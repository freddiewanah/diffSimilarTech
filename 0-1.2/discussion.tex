\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Benefits to technology developers}
Our work can locate potential defects or feature request of certain technology such as the performance overhead, lack of certain features compared with other similar technology, and so on.
Such feedback can be returned to the technology creators or maintainers, so that they can improve their softwares or product accordingly.

\subsection{Benefits to Migration}
Our work not only spots similar technologies in Software Engineering domain, but also render the comparison among them.
Such conclusion can be regarded as a backbone to support the potential migration among different technologies.

\subsection{Generability}
Actually, the method used in this work can be extent to other domains such as math, english, etc.

\subsection{Limitation of our tool}
Some comparative opinions may be out-of-date or biased, but our summarization does not consider the time factor.
In addition, the current extraction of comparative sentences is too naive to deal with complicated cases.
For example, some users mentioned good points of one technology in one paragraph, while bad points of the other technology in next paragraph.
Our method cannot extract some comparison between them, and there are many such cases in Stack Overflow.
It leads to a big loss of user opinions.
