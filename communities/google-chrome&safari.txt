Cluster 1
safari is more secure than ie or google-chrome
safari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not great
it takes longer than google-chrome or safari to load but it does load successfully
my ipad 1 safari js benchmarked 38 times slower than google-chrome on my pc
the one used by google-chrome and is slower than mobile safari s nitro javascript engine
safari will display fonts without a specified size significantly smaller than in google-chrome
the safari controller bar is the quicktime bar which is smaller and dark so the movement is less noticeable than google-chrome which has a big blue progress bar
it seems google-chrome calculates the row height according to the highest image;safari does not calculate the row height according to the images
safari 5.1.10 6534.59.10 middle handles a smaller viewport but in sort order with a smaller viewport computes new image sizes even smaller than google-chrome
from testing this in google-chrome and safari this seems google-chrome is more forgiving in that this parses the style string and puts the right style in place for you but safari does not
safari makes child block s height larger than google-chrome
google-chrome is very forgiving when it comes to css syntax error;safari not so much
from testing this in google-chrome and safari it seems google-chrome is more forgiving in that it parses the style string and puts the right style in place for you but safari does not
total width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspector
google-chrome ignoring flex-basis in column layout;google-chrome safari not filling 100 height of flex parent

if i try to do a google search for website loading slower in google-chrome than in safari i get a lot of results about how safari is slower than google-chrome

Cluster 2
google-chrome is worse than safari

Cluster 3
google-chrome does not offer nightly builds although they do have an open source project called chromium that does offer nightly builds google-chrome is based on chromium but they are not identical;similarly safari does not offer nightly builds either though again they have an open source project based on webkit
in google-chrome you can set the default fonts at google-chrome settings under advanced settings;in safari it is less easy but i could find this post
for example if you discover that google-chrome takes the 152x152 apple touch icon well now you know what you need;problem you probably want to support all scenarios android google-chrome ios safari etc. not only the new tab of ios google-chrome
a lot of people use iphones ipads and safari is literally the only option even google-chrome is more like safari in disguise... so it s quite a portion of users who are suffering from this issue
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers
i used the same approach as kiem nguyen above but google-chrome wouldn t work for me even after editing my .bash_profile as hanshenry90 suggested;to use safari to view the notebook open your terminal and enter
ios google-chrome is more ios safari than google-chrome itself
ios google-chrome is more ios safari than google-chrome itself;it seems i found an answer on my question ios safari does not support fullscreen api
it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari
safari is more funny than google-chrome i can easily make google-chrome cache my page but safari does not
google-chrome did not display the html-document generated with xml data;firefox and safari however did the job
i think it s a bug in google-chrome s svg rendering implementation;at least in firefox and safari it looks much better
that s very interesting as google-chrome isn t anything special on pc;in fact on my windows 7 pc safari is my tertiary browser behind maxthon-3 operates like ie but better and opera 1-key window cycling and page resize beats all
the do javascript syntax is for safari not google-chrome;for google-chrome it s execute javascript however changing that doesn t fix your code
google-chrome doesn t have duplicate popup if login credentials are incorrect though;the method of explicitly redirecting document.location with username password in url caused me some problems with safari giving a phishing warning
dus anyone knows if there is something wrong with my json or if google-chrome is harder to get than safari
google-chrome is not a supported browser for ssrs report builder;only ie firefox and safari are officially supported
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has
it also gets broken even more in ios google-chrome which is an older version of safari
okay safari ios is more strict than google-chrome android when it comes to this all fine but it still needs to enable me to allow the connection through
i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js
works with angular on google-chrome but not phantomjs;your safari error is very illuminating and i am kicking myself for not reading it more closely
from the blog post it seems it is buggy in safari so maybe google-chrome has not implemented it yet;i m unable to activate that experiment myself there s no developer tools experiments in my google-chrome flags but from safari i found this explanation
so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit
the point is that safari has a functionality google-chrome doesn t when safari auto-completes the request it sends the request;google-chrome doesn t send the request until the enter button is pressed
the open source browsers are webkit which is used for safari and the mozilla flavoured firefox;there is also chromium which is the open source version of the google flavoured google-chrome which uses a lesser javascript engine squirrel as opposed to v8 and does not have the multi-separate-thread modularisation of google-chrome
safari renders open sans bolder than in google-chrome so you would need to apply a lighter font weight for safari open sans google web fonts rendering in google-chrome
this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also safari gives me the error much faster than google-chrome wtf
i read somewhere that safari has more stringent requirements on cross domain scripting - it and google-chrome share the same code base
however zooming in on the map in safari hangs the web page;google-chrome is easier on that
i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome
safari does not store content in the dom google-chrome does;google-chrome keeps each browser window sandboxed in its own operating system process multi-process model
the tryanchordownload approach should work on modern versions of firefox and google-chrome and is a cleaned-up version of code provided in this forum post;the trysaveasdownload approach should theoretically work on any major modern browser though safari may not respect the specified file name
in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox
it s tough to gauge from the parameters you posted but just based on you saying that this works perfectly in safari but doesn t work in google-chrome or firefox it sounds like this could be a cors issue;firefox and google-chrome have different requirements for cross-origin requests than safari
i used the same code written in this question which worked in firefox and safari but not in google-chrome;in google-chrome it didn t play again
safari 5.1 still renders smoother than google-chrome but it is now clear that google has done much improvement
google-chrome javascript console f12 or ctrl + shift + j;mostly the same browser as safari but safari is better imho
i have had issues with dynamically created nodes that use filters and animatemotion has been a bugged in google-chrome for way too long.. we use ff5+ as our interactive interfaces for this reason safari is getting better too
important as of writing this safari on os x is the most accessible browser;google-chrome has less support for all the aria features
the browser does not matter though safari gets way more consistently working results than google-chrome
in my case google-chrome tools displayed the file name not just author stylesheet;i m not sure if this is 100 accurate but i believe that safari will not show the name of the css file if it is named default.css
google-chrome has many issues with screen readers that were not primarily written for it such as voiceover safari and nvda firefox;i tested this example myself and the labels were read aloud using voiceover and safari but not with google-chrome - because of these issues
conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome
here was my problem if i put the mp4 line first google-chrome would play the video part but there would be no sound;if i put the webm line first google-chrome would play the video and sound correctly but apple safari would not detect the video at all
so the short answer is no there s no way of stopping this via angular - and currently there doesn t appear to be a way to tell google-chrome not to do it either;it turns out it s not angular that s doing it it s google-chrome safari does not have the same behaviour haven t tested other browsers
if the chunked response does not end properly google-chrome cannot read it;but firefox and safari are taking care of this internally

Cluster 4
figure out how to install selenium with the google-chrome driver safari driver may be faster as the google-chrome driver safari driver js engine is faster

Cluster 5
google-chrome has more of the market than safari not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -

Cluster 6
safari still uses the older version while google-chrome uses a more current one
safari also uses this;google-chrome uses the more modern rfc 6455

Cluster 7
google-chrome moves the transformation-center over the z-axis safari leaves this center were it was but moves the object itself over the z-axis;the object therefore is zoomed in safari and seems bigger
