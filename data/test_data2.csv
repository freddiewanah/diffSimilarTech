22222222 operations are far slower than 11111111 operations causing the system to slow down significantly,1
as for me 22222222 implementation is smaller than the whole 11111111 so i m using,2
there might be some edge cases where 22222222 is slightly better because the 11111111 format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry,1

it s close - i m finding if 11111111 is greater than 22222222 the left position of the rotated image is incorrect,0
that is actually not the case with 11111111 which is --- more so than 22222222 --- just a math equation,1

these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a 11111111 means that the method can handle less acts as a 22222222 of since can handle everything that the 11111111 can handle and more,0
