### Problems that might need to consider:

1. How do we treat the assumptions inside question/comparative sentences in question itself (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10282566/avoiding-line-breaks-in-encrypted-and-encoded-url-string)

1. should consider scores into to the final decision on how good the answer is 

1. pairs like arrays and for-loop

1. Some sample posts that have comparative sentences:
* 29881041
* 27156
* 27440
* 30243

### Environment setup:

1. import xml from Posts.xml to postgresql with the following project in github https://github.com/Networks-Learning/stackexchange-dump-to-postgres
