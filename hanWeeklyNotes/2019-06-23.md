### Works done:

* Remove the question post

* extract sentences with certain pattern,
Id from 0 to 2558011

    * the presenter is responsible for binding the model to the view
    * nunit does have a litter bit better tool support though
    * if receipt must be verified tcp is your best option
    
    
* Words count based on different categories 

### Concern:

include other platforms for cates as most for data is not large enough
