### Works done:

1. Reformatted selected categories(57.8% of four datasets tag pairs) and selected none and adj, adv only.
 
    File: [top_categories.txt](https://github.com/freddiewanah/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/outnew/cate/top_categories.txt)
1. Patterns: id from 0 to 400000 
        
    File: [output.txt](https://github.com/freddiewanah/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/outnew/pattern_v3/output_55898.txt)
        
    185 matched sentences with 37 should be excluded sentences
    
    of the 37 should be excluded sentences, 25 are from single pattern 7,6 sentences 
    
    92.5% are right matches if we exclude pattern 7,6

    jython	pypy ???
    Pattern(s): 1	5	
    pypy is an experimental interpreter compiler that may one day supplant cpython but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas
    jython and ironpython are useful if you have an overriding need to interface with existing libraries written in a different platform like if you have 100 000 lines of java and you just want to write a 20-line python script

    postgresql	mysql
    Pattern(s): 7	3	1	7	7	
    in your example you would want something like this select o.id o.address o.otherdetails group_concat concat e.firstname e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql - edit postgresql 9.0 is equally simple now that string_agg expression delimiter is built-in
    here it is with comma-space between elements select o.id o.address o.otherdetails string_agg e.firstname || || e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql before 9.0 allows you to define your own aggregate functions with create aggregate
    slightly more work than mysql but much more flexible

    vmware	virtualbox
    Pattern(s): 7	
    3 it has nat support and bridged networking like the vmware and microsoft products
    4 there is no server version of virtualbox but i know it shares an engine with qemu so it may be possible to host your vbox images on qemu

    firefox	safari
    Pattern(s): 5	6	
    chrome safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to firebug s console so your code should be portable across those browsers

    postgresql	mysql
    Pattern(s): 7	
    you can certainly make a case against mysql since some of the most important features in regard to data safety have been added only recently
