swt	swing
combined with the free nsis installer you can build a nice package for your windows users
edit did not see that you use swt
don t know if it works with swt as well because i used only swing in my apps

boost	stl
if you look into stl boost mfc atl and many open source projects you can see there are so many assertion statements and that makes project going further more safely

cvs	svn
and cherry-picking merges while not trivial is not terribly difficult and far more advanced than anything svn or cvs can do

26973
client-side	server-side
because merges are performed client-side they are much faster and less error-prone than initiating a server-side merge

on the other hand nullpointerexception s and indexoutofboundsexception s might actually often be appropriate

rss	feed
i want to merge multiple rss feed into a single feed removing any duplicates

27156
feeds	rss

jquery	scriptaculous
to put some names out there prototype scriptaculous jquery dojo yui ...those all seem to have active users and contributers so they are probably worth reading up on to see if they meet your needs
jquery is good but with a little extra effort maybe you ll find that something else works better for you
good luck

post	get
it would look like this then to get the selected key you could do or if you are using xhtml then you can create a custom namespace
since you say the keys can repeat using the value attribute is probably not an option since then you wouldn t be able to tell which of the different options with the same value was selected on the form post

post	get
then in the httphandler perform the same hash and only run if they match
should i added variables to the query string or post the data i need to send
i d like to come up with a solution that would prevent a person with basic computer skills from accidentally or intentionally accessing the page directly considering the callback is buried in the client code it would take someone with equal determination to get either the querystring or the post request

mamp	wamp
i know that i can do it using macports but i d prefer not to make any changes to my default os x php installation
i m running mamp 1.7.2 on a mac and i d like to install the extension php_gd2
i know that on windows using wamp i d simply select the php_gd2 entry in the extensions menu to activate it
