code notice the extra comma in the array declaration. the code above gives different outputs for various browsers safari 5 firefox 5 ie 6 the extra comma in the array is being ignored by safari and firefox while ie treats it as another object in the array

cos	sin
my only warning against skipping the parsing tools or just using the shunting yard algorithm or a hand rolled recursive decent parser is that little toy languages 1 may someday turn into big actual languages with functions sin cos log and variables conditions and for loops

cvs	svn
edit to clarify i know both perforce svn allow locking merging but svn encourages a liberal edit merge method whereas as i understand it perforce encourages a checkout-checkin method
i ve always used subversion or cvs for version control which use a merge methodology
one of my friends raves about perforce and how great it is with its change lists and check-out methodology

stdout	stderr
here s an example save it as evil.py when you run this program you will see that nothing went to stdout where print usually prints to the first string that gets written to stderr is the one starting with it the next two lines are the ones that were collected in the stringio object replacing sys.stdout err like this is an application of what s called monkeypatching

perforce	svn	versioning	upgrade
perforce supports merging and in fact had better merge support than svn until svn 1.5 where named merges were added as well as change lists which perforce has always had and i mis very much moving to a shop that used svn but we won t upgrade until 1.5 has been a bit more time tested. it s worth noting that svn and perforce both allow you to do a locked checkout so you can do the unmerged model if you want but aside perhaps from managing binaries with versioning control i don t see much use for this
