apache	lighttpd
what you do is that you start your django fastcgi server in a separate process and then configures apache via rewrites to call this process when needed
or you can serve django without using apache but with another server that supports fastcgi natively the documentation mentions that you can do this if you don t have any apache specific needs
i guess the reason must be to save memory. lighttpd this is the server that runs youtube
