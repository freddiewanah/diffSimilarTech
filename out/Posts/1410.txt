getdate	dateadd
the most readable imo which gets now s datetime getdate #8 27 2008 10 23am# converts to a string with format 101 convert varchar #8 27 2008 10 23am# 101 8 27 2007 converts to a datetime convert datetime 8 27 2007 #8 27 2008 12 00am# subtracts 1 year dateadd yy -1 #8 27 2008 12 00am# #8 27 2007 12 00am# there s variants with datediff and dateadd to get you midnight of today but they tend to be rather obtuse though slightly better on performance - not that you d notice compared to the reads required to fetch the data

implements	extends
the controller does not care what type of object it is by contrast i can also create an object that does not extends from account say a user abstract class and still implements listable and editable but not versionable which doesn t make sense here

subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends
in this way i am saying that foouser subclass is not an account but does act like an editable object
likewise baraccount extends from account but is not a user subclass but implements editable listable and also versionable
adding all of these apis for editable listable and versionable into the abstract-class itself would not only be cluttered and ugly but would either duplicate the common interfaces in account and user or force my user object to implement versionable probably just to throw an exception
