profiling	debugging
if your debugging use is relatively repetitive you could always write some nice utility classes that provide a more convenient interface
you can still use all the legacy features with opengl 3.2 or later if you create a context with the compatibility profiling
only the core profiling has the legacy features removed

hide	show
in your code the animation removes your from view and show the to view.so in the collection if the content view is removed then how it come back. so don t remove the view just hide it

26880032
uiview	subviews
don t use uiviewcontrollertransitioncoordinator for this
there are a few options to consider for uiview transitions you can pass the uiviewanimationoptionlayoutsubviews option
this will animate the changes between subviews before and after calling layoutsubviews on the view whose frame you just changed

26880032
uiview	calayer	uiview	subviews	uiview	subviews
this will animate the changes between subviews before and after calling layoutsubviews on the view whose frame you just changed
instead of using layoutsubviews at all you could override setbounds or setframe on your uiview and calayer subclasses
this way if they re called within an animation block the subviews will animate together with the superview

26880032
put	get
my fear is that not every property needs to be animated in every case like in the auxiliary views - i already am flipping setdisableactions on off to force deny some property animations
generally if you want it animated put it in an animation block and if you don t don t
obviously it can get more complex than this which is why apple sometimes has a setter with an animated argument like setselected animated

26880066
int	double
make sure to keep the result as a double - the truncation that occurs when casting a double to an int would yield inaccurate results
instead replace your return statement with return int math.signum result1 - result2
in this case the result of 0.9 - 0.3 would be 0.6 the signum of which would be 1

26880066
int	double
however if we were to cast the double 0.6 to an int the result would be 0 not 1 indicating that they are equal

apache	nginx
distributing the html code to the clients does not take that much of a load but you will have an apache or nginx or wathever + a tomcat + your database running on the same server it will be ok for most cases it depends on the success of your website but usually when you have to ask yourself how you are going to manage such a load you have the means to rethink the architecture

26881383
width	height
in general if you want to install constraints manually that mimic the effect of an autoresizing mask with a flexible width and flexible height then you would do this by creating four constraints maintaining a fixed distance between the edges of the view and the corresponding edges of its superview -- that is the top of the view and the top of the superview the bottom with the bottom the left with left and right with right

26881383
width	height
this assumes there are no other conflicting constraints that try to set the height and width of the view

26881427
int	double	int	double
in order to get a non-integer result you have to cast one of the numbers to double
if kills deaths 1 you get 0 since the output of int division is int
this 0 is then cast to 0.0 to fit the double variable in which you store it

26881449
int	double	int	double
if you cast one oy them to a double youget the expected result
because your input values are int
if you cast one oy them to a double youget the expected result

like matches are put together and filtering out where there is no match returning the end result
i actually get two matches against your aaa element since it s canname array has two elements matching elements in the ds array you could alternately change the last to a using the name and uuid fields as the _id grouping key then use the operator on all other projected fields in order to retain only the first match

this all works great however one issue i have is if the text is longer than the textframe it runs off the page and i need the page to move on accordingly whilst retaining the other objects in place
i can use the below code to measure a string but it s only useful for comparing the width against the frame and not the height because it could be different once put into a smaller area

you will have to implement udp packet loss recovery yourself because udp is connection less unreliable protocol
i suggest udp because you will get flexibility on creating flow error control mechanisms yourself
while you can do same with tcp but it adds latency and user will see pauses in video play

pop-up	dialog
actually my idea is to use an to load the file and then add a change listener on that element now there are several problem that i m facing the first problem is that the pop-up is closed when the open dialog opens and it causes all related object and code to be destroyed with the pop-up page
and looking at other question this is the normal behaviour of a chrome extension when it lost focus the pop-up will be destroyed
i found another solution that suggests to add the file logic into the background page that will not be destroyed if the pop-up lost focus

26884140

range	minimum	multiplication	modulo
the change is that the order-dependent part has been simplified to its essential minimum here are the lessons learnt from practical work with that digest count sum and product partial primorial modulo word size turned out to be exceedingly useful because of the fact that they relate to things also found elsewhere in the world like certain lists at oeis count and sum were very useful because the first tends to be naturally available when manipulating generating using comparing batches of primes and the sum is easily computed on the fly with zero effort
this allows partial verification against existing results without going the whole hog of instantiating and updating a digest and without the overhead of two - comparatively slow - multiplication count is also exceedingly useful as it must by necessity be part of any indexing superstructure built on systems of digests and conversely it can guide the search straight to the block range containing the nth prime or to the blocks overlapped by the nth through n+k th primes the order dependency of the fourth component checksum turned out be less of a hindrance than anticipated since small primes tend to occur be generated or used in order in situations where verification might be desired the order dependency of the checksum - and lack of combinability - made it perfectly useless outside of the specific block for which it was generated fixed-size auxiliary program structures - like the ubiquitous small factor bitmaps - are best verified as raw memory for startup self-checks instead of running a primes digest on them
this drastically reduces complexity and speeds things up by several orders of magnitude for many practical purposes the order-dependent checksum could simply be dropped leaving you with a three-component digest that is trivially combinable for adjacent ranges

in the netfilter callback that runs in an interrupt context is possible to send packets but is not possible to receive them since every attempt to wait causes a kernel panic . for this reason the solution i proposed works with udp but cannot work with tcp the tcp handshake requires that the ack message must be received

portrait	landscape
it is best to just let the device choose the preferred orientation
i can see you have accepted an answer which doesn t solve your problem entirely this will force your app to be portrait on both phones and tablets
you can have the app forced in the device s preferred orientation by using this will lead to forcing your app to portrait on most phones phones and landscape on tablets. there are many phones with keypads which were designed for landscape mode

storing a reference string is implemented via fgetc here too

your operating system must also have a working thread-safe realpath call

you could turn the list of coordinates into a set to remove duplicates also note that you can eliminate the for-loop by calling instead of for each i the i values are in the first arrays but since you don t care about those you can just drop the first arrays

the actual article of course as well as a parent subdocument with a url which will match the _id of some other document as well as a title which is the text that we will print out on screen for inside of the tag
an identicle structure exists for the children except that it is an array so that all of the children are there
this type of design seems to have the advantage of speed in my opinion but i would like to hear what others thing of this design

thus parent now contains just a text string which will match the _id of some other document and children will similarly have an array of strings which link to _id s

soundjs	preloadjs
i believe there are open bugs in preloadjs and soundjs which prevent audio loading from reporting progress

soundjs	preloadjs
soundjs actually injects the functionality into preloadjs to handle loading and will not respect the usexhr parameter instead relying on the browser capabilities and soundjs plugins to load and play audio

in my case whenever i need to do this i use ng-class
if you copy the code from your ng-show and put it into html css cursor default simply makes the cursor not change for usability purposes. hope this helps
edit in this case adding the cursor and showedit to the ng-click probably wont make a difference as the icon will always be shown if the mouse is over the icon due to the hover event but nonetheless i think it s good practice to cover all bases

if you use udpclisock.connect addr first and then send instead of sendto you ll get a connection refused error

26892526

this error is suppressed if sendto is used connectionless udp...
i tested your code against my own udp classes from cpp-lib and it works perfectly well as long as the server actually replies

but when i m submission the form the default value is lost unless i m applying another value to somethingtype in some other function if i use ng-init inside the form angular keeps the default value and sends it with the form
edit another funny thing is that if i change the scope value from other scope it does not get lost on submit
this function activated in one of the forms ng-clicks and saves the value to somethingtype just fine

public	protected
you expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields or require access modifiers other than public such as protected and private

26895866
super	abstract	super	implements
if you stick to abstract classes you will never run into this problem
however if your object is required to implements two interfaces because it needs to be added to lists that are expecting those types and those interfaces have conflicting method signatures you will wind up having to redefine a whole bunch of methods even if that means you re just making super calls which sort of defeats the point of inheritance-based dynamic dispatch
it isn t a deal-breaker but something to consider when structuring a complex java project

you use your second if branch so your tuple becomes 5.5 7.75 10
at this point you have no hope of success since your min is already larger than your answer
change to by the way if you tried to debug this at all printing out what min mid and max become at each iteration the problem would ve been very clear

int	double
when the java compiler encounters an int float or double value in a place where an object is expected it automatically creates a wrapper object
the code generated by the compiler for your code is equivalent to the valueof method caches int instances for the values from -128 to 127 iirc with the result that both values will be replaced by the same object
try the same with a lager value like 1000

next	except
has the right idea except that you want lead instead of lag to get the next pickup
for example this query will produce the next pickup time lat and long after a pickup at jfk
any time you can avoid a self-join it s good to do so

getter	setter
instead of you need to use or you were trying to assign a value to the return value of a getter method which is not possible so the compiler was saying expression not assignable. you need to use the setter method or dot notation instead

haskell	ocaml
i don t know why the naming of them has anything to do with the semantic of the program
i recently wrote some haskell code and it never terminates
after i carefully examined my code the problem boiled down to the following code piece i guess this must have something to do with the laziness of haskell since the same code terminates in ocaml

width	height
if mkmapview disappear when you try to resize or move the button the map view has just set its width and height to zero

26897110
haskell	ocaml
the issue is that unlike ocaml let bindings in haskell are recursive by default

26897110
haskell	ocaml	haskell	ocaml	shadowing	named
so is equivalent to ocaml s and is a circular definition
this is why shadowing variable named in haskell ie defining a multiple times is considered bad style and even has a compiler warning which you can turn on with the -wall flag or more specifically -fwarn-name-shadowing
this default makes more sense in haskell than ocaml because thanks to laziness circular values rather than just recursive functions are actually useful

subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
for example here is an ast suitable for a simple expression language with variables numeric literals addition subtraction and multiplication then to complete the implementation you write a function with this signature and i d say that in fact explicit recursion on an ast type like expr is a fine solution for a simple interpreter like this

.htaccess	httpd.conf
i am running 2.4 so i checked httpd.conf and uncommented loadmodule filter_module modules mod_filter.so and that did the trick
this is kind of an old question so this probably won t be much help to the op but i came across this while dealing with the same issue 500 internal server error after modifying the .htaccess and thought it might be worth mentioning in case anyone else winds up here with the same problem
after checking the error log i found this error ...invalid command addoutputfilterbytype perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration so after googling that i found this in the apache docs on upgrading to 2.4 from 2.2 where it says invalid command addoutputfilterbytype perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration - addoutputfilterbytype has moved from the core to mod_filter which must be loaded

while this does not happen for armeabi
the linker ld gives me an error of this kind path to bin ld error path to myobjfile.obj multiple definition of foo int int path to bin ld path to myobjfile.obj previous definition here the path is exactly the same so this makes me assume that the linker uses every file twice

so far my solution for this is to parse the string looking for the first closing parenthesis and its matching open parenthesis building a filtering from the grouping replacing the grouping with the index of the filtering and working outwards

26897875
ready	each
first thing to try in the console router.current .ready if this doesn t return false then there is something very funny going on with tracker or iron-router as it reactively gives the master wait-list readiness so if it returns true then there is something else preventing the page from rendering
the best way to find out which item s in the wait-list isn t ready is to go through your router code pull out the subscription handles into a global object and pass references to the waiton callback
for example rather than do this instead that way you can run subs.somethings.ready from the console on each of the subscriptions to find out which it is that is preventing your page from rendering

but you will have to fiddle around to get the right value
the easiest solution for your example is to remove the line but since you ve put it there i assume that you really want need it there
so then you have to manually adapt the height of the colorbar using the shrink argument of colorbar as maxnoe suggests might also do the trick

the easiest way is to do the task set above is aggregate 16 6 b b a a x b b 0.5 the first and last parameters set the scene to do a percentile 50 which is a median the second says ignore all errors including div#0 and the third says select the b column data and divide it by a number which is one for all non empty values that have an x in the a column and a zero otherwise. the zeros create a divide by zero exception and will be ignored because a 1 a and a 0 div#0 the technique works for quartiles with an appropriate p value all other percentile of course and for max and min using the large or small function with appropriate arguments

i was reading that tkinter is not threadsafe so i was trying to ensure that the tkinter methods couldn t run at the same time so i made a boolean value initialized to true in settings.py called canusetk and i use it to block the measure method from being called while it is set to false

i found on django-admin.py and manage.py that python manage.py sqlall appname prints the create table and initial-data sql statements for the given app name s . i looked at installed_apps in settings.py and ended up running something like python manage.py sqlall admin auth contenttypes sessions sites messages staticfiles one for each django.contrib.appname in installed_apps

getter	setter
you can t get the seconds value from a setter method the purpose of a setter method is after all to set something
if you want to get something use a getter method
and it s pretty simple to create a getter method just change your seconds method to this def seconds seconds # we get the value of seconds now we don t set it to 0 end ruby can create this method automatically in the background for you with just one line added inside your class and that line is attr_reader seconds

26899727
getter	setter
these attr_reader and attr_writer methods exist because making setter and getter methods is so common that this shortens your program significantly especially if you have say 10 instance variables you have seconds and time_string now but you could also have instance variables for minutes hours days etc

google-chrome	firefox
the button will send you to the end of the page via after the page is filled and scroll appears you will see that for osme reason padding-bottom will stay out of the page - only on firefox
on google-chrome and ie it works as it should
or does int not calculate padding at all for the expanding dynamic content

26900329
unsigned	short
i would suggest changing your byte array to being an unsigned byte array then change sum to an unsigned int or unsigned short 16 bits will suffice where you calculate the sum sum sum + msgpack i 0xff

26900333
stdout	fflush
newline at end of string or manually cause stdout to be fflush printf input any number

26900333

inherited	properties
in various points you need inherited in common as some of the properties like digitalfuelmeter air conditioning seat adjustment etc are common for all the cars

26900719
super	extends
see code example below this is untested code but i can t see why it wouldn t work
you should read how the super keyword and inheritance works in java
getting the superclass or the class your class extends is not really necessary in the general case

26900719
super	extends
getting the superclass or the class your class extends is not really necessary in the general case
see the below illustration to refer to the superclass use the super keyword
see example below i hope this answers your question

which is the best and accurate method to do because int a
double b

hide	show
i assume that this is what you want to achieve demo just assume that the script in the demo is inside the success function first you have some error in here this will not add the p element to the element with id j1979 because you write it like that where you should be writing it like this note the quotes at start and end and the closing tag second there s no word or anything inside the p element that indicates that you could click it to show more information so put the pid inside the p like this here s the full code with some css style to hide it before the user click on the pid

26901045
client-side	server-side
if that is the case you can do the whole server-side thing as a pre-requisite aditionally set a custom response header i.e then readfile blah.jpg
on the client-side with the xmlhttprequest set in the onload event another request to the server with the image-id with e.g xhr.getresponseheader x-imageid and the current time in milliseconds new date .gettime
obviously you will need to set some info to distinguish the requests so that the server will only log for image requests and update the records with the update time requests

26901137
submit	submission
following is the working code to tag friends also you have to submit your review to fb for the taggable friends api feature of the project you created in the devlepoer facebook account.after you get the approval for your submission the following code will tag your friends

26901175
implements	extends
start by making your plugin extends the org.eclipse.ui.startup extension point and define a class to override istartup that earlystartup will look something like we ll listen for windows to open and when they do this part listener is where you should get the editorpart which means you can add the document listener listening to just the keypressess this ends up being simpler to implements but may be very noisy

26901236

stdout	stderr
so we duplicate the pipe stdout to stderr so that the final output will be captured and then set stdout back to the terminal --keep-tite is dialog-specific

26902263
put	get
i know it s not an elegant solution to do this but it shouldn t be so difficult either just remember to copy the exact html code delete all intro s and replace all 0 s with 4- the index n. div is just keeping track of the user s number you could put your own text there like user nº 0 and in the jquery code replace the 0 with the value of 5- you could put a limit to the number of users example 10 that can be added by creating an variable inside the .click function
i ve created this code here it is i ve tested it and it works some important notes 1- the div who s is just to tell jquery where to put the new duplicated fields
2- the jquery code works with an index variable that starts in 0 and gets incremented by 1 on each new click on the + button so the first time you click it should get to 1 3- the original form s code where value is 0 by default is printed everytime the + button is clicked but replacing each 0 in the html code by 3.2 - if you make some changes to the code of your form by this method you should change the javascript code as well

26902428
udp	tcp
let s compare some aspects of udp against tcp

26902428
udp	tcp
packets may arrive in a different order than they were sent
udp does not care and will deliver the packets in this order to the application
in tcp data have a sequence number so the receivers operating system will detect reordering and forward the data to the application in the correct order

26902428
udp	tcp
again tcp will detect this due to the sequence number but udp will not and thus transmit the duplicate packet to the application

26902428
udp	tcp
both tcp and udp have the same kind of checksum to detect small errors but will not detect larger errors

26902428
rtp	rtcp
also rtp is often accompanied by the rtcp protocol to send statistics about packet loss back to the peer and thus make adaption of connection speed possible

26902451
inherited	properties
inherited of scope properties has nothing to do with the nesting of your states and everything to do with the nesting of your views templates

26902451
children	parent
in this scenario you cannot expect to access the scope variables of parent state views within the views of children states

google-chrome	firefox
therefore i tried automating the clicking with js and jquery starting from firefox and moving on to google-chrome using greecemonkey and tempermonkey

26902859
google-chrome	firefox
the transition from these two browsers was not as easy as i first thought as what seems to be not working is the .click
method on google-chrome at least trying to click some buttons from browsers console
a simpliefied version when run from browsers console google-chrome and firebug firefox on google-chrome just prints out an array of matched elements

26902859
google-chrome	firefox
as i tried this code and it still is not working or why does it work with firefox both from firebug and greecemonkey and not in google-chrome

trick google-chrome and firefox and maybe other browsers into displaying the pdfs using the adobe reader plugin for full pdf open parameters support among other benefits by using one of the following adobe pdf in xml format types in your embed code application vnd.adobe.pdfxml application vnd.adobe.x-mars this works fine as of my answer today and i m hopeful it will continue to work fine

26903056
put	get
b.id in there too to avoid self-intersection difference but you get the idea i hope
you have a couple of issues you have 2 columns in first select and only one in the 2nd plus you have a comma in from of st_difference where presumably you wanted to put a 2 or somesome
you can simplify the query somewhat by selecting the geoms from table1 and table2 in a with query and then unioning them eg with geoms geom1 geom2 as select a.the_geom b.the_geom from table1 a table2 b select 1 st_intersection geom1 geom2 from geoms where st_intersects geom1 geom2 union select 2 st_difference geom1 geom2 from geoms where st_intersects geom1 geom2

26903204
listview	gridview
note you are not using the convertview passed to getview method of your adapter this is generally not good for listview gridview

26903204
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
you can search listview adapter convertview in google and you will find plenty of articles introducing it
nb you do not need to set the onclicklistener for each view of your list item really
instead you can directly set onitemclicklistener for the listview and switch the fragment there

26903492
post	get
we normally use jackson or jersey for json or xml based request parameters and have annotations like get post etc before a method which intercepts the request and we can get the parameters from the hosted service and use them for our benefits

26903496
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
access it in viewwillappear
don t access the property in viewdidload - it won t be set at that point
access it in viewwillappear

if you get this kind of error change the type from get post to jsonp and then in url append this parameter without quotes

26903623
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
you have to create two constraints from the child to it s parent view equal width equal height it s also possible to define a margin select the created constraint within the size inspector

so i have two div with ng-show and ng-hide whose value i am changing in the controller to true and false

26903767
aggregate-functions	sum
but when you use an aggregate-functions like count max sum etc you also need use a group by clause
and speaking a little loosely every column that s in the select clause must be either a the argument to an aggregate-functions or b named in the group by clause


26903782
pthreads	fcntl
the current version of pthreads mandates fcntl locking and lockf locking for file-level inter-process locking

26903782
fcntl	posix
posix also defines flockfile funlockfile and ftrylockfile which are used for controlling locking between threads in an application
afaik you can implement both lockf and flock locking using fcntl locking
note that the locking functions work on file descriptors or file streams

26903812

only if the server and client are on the same lan or vpn you can think of using this or file.copy source desctrination

26903817
minimum	max
you can specify min and max for the allocated memory when the jvm starts
initially the jvm will allocate the minimum value or more if your application needs it
if over time the used memory is far below the allocated memory the latter will go down as well

i mean i guess i could come up with a single arbitrary local branch name to always pull the commits down into and then delete that branch after every push but that s seems inelegant.

in c++ you may follow the same principle using an enum but you don t need that extra parameter nor do you need to use a function pointer of course you may use inheritance and overloading like in java to avoid using switches
if you re doing c just put a function pointer in that struct and at initialisation time set the right one if the name change over time define an enum to enumerate all the possible values name could take instead of using a char
then you will need to add a parameter to myfunction so as to get the value in name this is basically the poor man oop in c

int	double
the intel compiler has the following intrinsic defined to do horizontal sums _mm512_reduce_add_ps horizontal sum of 16 floats _mm512_reduce_add_pd horizontal sum of 8 double _mm512_reduce_add_epi32 horizontal sum of 16 32-bit int _mm512_reduce_add_epi64 horizontal sum of 8 64-bit int however as far as i can tell these are broken into multiple instructions anyway so i don t think you gain anything more than doing the horizontal sum of the upper and lower part of the avx512 register

subclass	abstract-class
what about thinking the following way a relationship between a class and an abstract-class is of type is-a a relationship between a class and an interface is of type has-a so when you have an abstract-class mammals a subclass human and an interface driving then you can say each human is-a mammal each human has-a driving behavior my suggestion is that the book knowledge phrase indicates that he wanted to hear the semantic difference between both like others here already suggested

jar	war
to give you a little bit of perspective we have an ear file that contains lib jarthatusesspi.jar myejb.jar mywebinterface.war lib someotherdependency.jar for myejb.jar it can see the classes inside jarthatusesspi.jar the spi works as in everything is detected as it should be for the mywebinterface.war it can see the classes inside jarthatusesspi.jar the spi does not work nothing is automatically detected
if myejb approaches the spi jar first and initializes the spi stuff -basically store the spi results in memory in a singleton- and the web interface then requests that instance it will see the same instance with the spi loaded instances
so we are sure that the war and the parent ear file are looking at the same class with the same classloader the same instances etc except the spi stuff does not work if you run it in the web interface first.

hopefully the comments in the js explain the rest but if you have a different html dom setup you might need to change the selectors in how it finds the parent s children and the children s parent
from what i understand you re going to be wanting some sort of layout like this html js you current setup works from a functionality perspective if you follow the advice of the other 2 answers however because all your children have the same name it means they cannot be posted in the form distinctly
i have changed the data- attributes to classes as it s simpler to check a class

perhaps using a suitably configured ext4 or btrfs file system should help
some filesystems are using hashing or b-tree techniques to make the complexity of file access in a directory of size n be o log n others are still linear o n and the kernel might do weird things above that

keywords and functions that said a keyword in java and most languages is a reserved word like for while or return but your examples are not keywords they are function names like sin and sqrt
sin is a function so it s represented as a memory address where its code block is. keywords like for aren t represented as binary for for example is converted to a list of byte code jump instructions which are compiled into assembly instructions which are represented as binary
my point is that you cannot convert most keywords directly into binary

advantages fast parent lookup lookup by _id your doc title return parent field fast children lookup lookup by parent your doc title which will return all child documents updating relationships is just a matter of changing the parent field changing the underlying data requires changes to only one document disadvantages searching by ancestors and descendants is slow requiring a traversal child references each node contains a reference array to its children advantages fast retrieval of children return the children array fast relationship update just update children s array where needed disadvantages finding a parent requires looking up your _id in all children arrays of all documents until you find it since the parent will contain the current node as a child ancestors descendants search require traversals of the tree array of ancestors each node contains a reference to an array of its ancestors its parent advantages fast retrieval of ancestors no traversal required to find a specific one easy to lookup parent and children following the parent references approach to find descendants just look up the ancestors because all descendants must contain the same ancestors disadvantages need to worry about keeping the array of ancestors as well as the parent field updated whenever there is a change in relationships often across multiple documents

move	drag
i have a main form it has a pagecontrol with 5 tabs on it. i m looking for a way to detach these tabsheets from the pagecontrol and move them individually to a new form that is created runtime
the move sheet needs to retain all it s components buttons labels etc and function almost the same as it was still in it s place in the pagecontrol
basically the idea is that if a user wants to view 2 or more pages simultaneously then he she can drag that sheet out of the form s area and it creates a new window for it

now i get an error or well not really an error but this is what it says when i try to run this code resource interpreted as document but transferred with mime type application vnd.ms-excel data application vnd.ms-excel

if you are ready for format your hdfs namenode stop all hdfs services clear out all files inside the following directories and format hdfs again hadoop namenode -format
clusterids of datanodes and namenode should match then only datanodes can effectively communicate with namenode
if you do namenode format new clusterid will be assigned for namenode then clusterids in datanodes won t match

decimal	ieee
see how to get biggest bigdecimal value for answers on how big bigdecimal can be.
xml schema itself does not impose minimum and maximum values on xsd decimal definition decimal represents arbitrary precision decimal numbers. the value space of decimal is the set of the values i 10 -n where i and n are integers such that n 0
contrast this with xsd float which corresponds to ieee single-precision 32-bit floats. implementations on the other hand may support limits to the range of xsd decimal note all minimally conforming processors must support decimal numbers with a minimum of 18 decimal digits with a totaldigits of 18

however minimally conforming processors may set an application-defined limit on the maximum number of decimal digits they are prepared to support in which case that application-defined maximum number must be clearly documented
for example xerces2-j uses java.math.bigdecimal

fortunately the font has a tounicode map trying to apply this map one gets based on the explicit beginbfrange...endbfrange entries this very well matches the appearance of the page
the pdf specification offers hints on how to extract text content in section 9.10.2 mapping character codes to unicode values if the font dictionary contains a tounicode cmap see 9.10.3 tounicode cmaps use that cmap to convert the character code to unicode
if the font is a simple font that uses one of the predefined encodings macromanencoding macexpertencoding or winansiencoding or that has an encoding whose differences array includes only character names taken from the adobe standard latin character set and the set of named characters in the symbol font see annex d a map the character code to a character name according to table d.1 and the font s differences array

if the font is a composite font that uses one of the predefined cmaps listed in table 118 except identity h and identity v or whose descendant cidfont uses the adobe-gb1 adobe-cns1 adobe-japan1 or adobe-korea1 character collection a map the character code to a character identifier cid according to the font s cmap
b obtain the registry and ordering of the character collection used by the font s cmap for example adobe and japan1 from its cidsysteminfo dictionary

my advise is use send recv if you re in a connection oriented mode tcp use sendto recvfrom mainly for connectionless communications e.g udp use write read if you will not specify any flag and for raw i o the aforementioned functions may be consider as higher level ones i would not advise a single class which handles both protocols but rather two specialized ones

post	get
currently in the above call the upload action method on the tools controller will be receiving an id argument
if you want to pass a display name back to your deleteuser action method you could use however the deleteuser method is decorated with the httppost attribute meaning that the action will only accept requests that use the post method
this means that you have three options 1 remove the httppost attribute from the action method - probably not a good idea since i imagine you don t want to be exposing this action to get requests for good reason

26911413
swift	objective-c	swift	objective-c
i don t know if the same works for system api but given it s an objective-c class in that case you can just call foo.respondstoselector dofoo
swift probably does not include enough runtime type information to check for protocol conformance
protocols are really only a compile-time thing and objective-c includes extra tables in the built product that aren t strictly necessary for running the program to allow determining conformance

26911413
swift	objective-c
the recommendation from apple in objective-c has always been to check for the presence of individual methods and not to look at the class or protocol to permit duck typing and enable use of proxy objects
my guess is that this is the reason why the designers of swift felt it was ok to leave out protocol runtime data in the default case to encourage proper detection of features of a class
operator which checks both whether the object exists and that it implements the given method

if the column class returned by tablemodel.getcolumnclass implements comparable use a comparator that sorts the strings based on the values returned by comparable.compareto

26911428
comparator	comparable
if a string convertor has been specified for the table by invoking setstringconverter use a comparator that sorts the resulting string representations based on the current locale
if none of the previous rules apply use a comparator that invokes tostring on the column data and sorts the resulting strings based on the current locale
since date class implements comparable interface then it s a case of point 3

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller should not perform a segue
it should only be connected to a rootviewcontroller which may be a uiviewcontroller or its subclass
a segue should be performed from the rootviewcontroller of the uinavigationcontroller

26911571
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a segue should be performed from the rootviewcontroller of the uinavigationcontroller
the segue should have the rootviewcontroller as its source and some other uiviewcontroller or its subclass as its destination
your screenshot shows that your uinavigationcontroller is connected to a rootviewcontroller

mvp	presenter
hope i understood you rightly
you should probably let the api manage its own domain objects and in your project map those objects to custom model or viewmodel objects as necessary whenever working with viewmodels try to remember that mvvm or mvp is a pattern for your ui not a pattern for business logic
presenter should call other classes which should be regarded as outside the mvvm mvp mvpvm pattern to do their business logic

maven	pom.xml	maven	m2e	m2e	pom.xml
if your changing two projects constantly this could be signal for bad design not always
regardless i doubt you will be able to get the same behavior as maven to maven with maven to gradle as that would be two different eclipse plugins m2e and eclipse-gradle
what i have seen many gradle users do is have a maven pom.xml file with all the dependencies in their gradle projects

26911966
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml	maven	m2e	m2e	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
what i have seen many gradle users do is have a maven pom.xml file with all the dependencies in their gradle projects
they then just use the m2e plugin as though the project was just an maven project but use gradle for building on the command line
you can create the pom.xml file with gradle itself

i m using json.net for serialization and deserialization. i have the following code while the class looks as follows when i serialize that to a string i get the expected result until now everything works fine it looks like json.net doesn t do anything special with the ref property when serializing to a string
upon parsing of the string however json.net recognized the property named ref as an reference to some id which it can t find and does not put it back on the deserialized object
this is to be expected but the web service is handing out pagination that way with next previous and last attributes

width	height	width	text-align
in my snippet i applied this text-align to the body but you can just use a wrapping div instead if this causes issues with the rest of your layout
you should set the min-width and min-height of the container instead of the width and height
if you explicitly set the these dimensions the container element is not allowed to grow to accommodate its children

26912932
width	text-align	children	parent
if you explicitly set the these dimensions the container element is not allowed to grow to accommodate its children
the display attribute also needs to change to inline-block so it will fit to the width of the children
the last thing that needs to be done to preserve the centering is to set the container s parent to text-align center this will necessitate setting text-align left in the container

26912932
margin	text-align	margin	text-align
the last thing that needs to be done to preserve the centering is to set the container s parent to text-align center this will necessitate setting text-align left in the container
this also removes the need to set the container s margin s to auto
in my snippet i applied this text-align to the body but you can just use a wrapping div instead if this causes issues with the rest of your layout

if i correct for that and make the constructors of b1 and b2 public instead of protected everything gets totally messed up see here as the output becomes 99 0 10 final 10 so in fact the parts of b1 s and b2 s constructors that initialize b are still executed and even change the value of x

the conditional check of the while-loop handles all cases of relationship between vector size and grid size
this particular grid-striding loops methodology has the additional benefit in terms of mapping elements to threads that it tends to naturally promote coalesced access
the reads and writes to data vector in the code above will coalesce perfectly due to the behavior of the grid-striding loops

the reasoning behind this is in following this process upgrade database ef migration test website update website code if something goes wrong revert to the previous website code the problem i will certainly face is that at step 2 and 4 i will surely get an error from ef about the model being changed although all the db changes are compatible with the existing code.
i know that a solution would be to migrate down the database to the previous versioning or even do a db backup but it may happen that some migrations are really complex and the down part may be broken or simply poorly coded

you can use case expressions to differentiate by the type of transaction select product sum case type when s then final_price end as s_value count case type when s then final_price end as s_count sum case type when r then final_price end as r_value count case type when r then final_price end as r_count group by product type edit by the forward-quotes around the column names i m assuming this is a mysql questions even though it s not explicitly tagged as such. if this is the case you can simplify the count statements by utilizing mysql s automatic conversion from boolean to int which takes true as a 1 and false as a 0

the standard way to call intlinprog is in the following way f is the vector that weights each parameter of the solution you want to solve intcon denotes which of your parameters need to be integer
in this case you want all of them to be integer so you would have to supply an increasing vector from 1 to n where n is the number of factors you want to decompose the number v into same as before
a and b are matrix and vectors that define your inequality constraints

the entire ui shows up in landscape as expected but when i create a new uiwindow it shows up in portrait
the new uiwindow s frame matches the screen s frame exactly so i can t imagine why how it is showing up in portrait mode

i understand the differences between settimeout and setinterval as this explained it quite nicely

26916368
setinterval	settimeout
if i need to call a countdown several times in a game fairly frequently for example a player moves to a new location which triggers a new countdown which will encourage them to move in 5 seconds but it s not necessarily uniform intervals meaning they should move to next location but can hang out at current location and be penalized is it better performance-wise and clean code-wise to a keep clearing and setting settimeout when the player decides to change location b keep setinterval running but change a variable that acts as that countdown each time the player moves to a new location

in order to serialize your dictionary you ll need to convert the enum to one of those nsjsonserialize data-types similar to your example as an alternative since this kind of manipulation is fairly common you might want to consider adding this category to dictionary which gives it a convenient map function once that s done the conversion is simply

26916986
versioning	upgrade
say if the old versioning is 2 and new versioning is 4 then the logic will upgrade the database from 2 to 3 and then to 4 if old versioning is 3 and new versioning is 4 it will just run the upgrade logic for 3 to 4
to further add missing points here as per the request by jaskey database versioning is stored within the sqlite database file
catch is the constructor sqliteopenhelper context context string name sqlitedatabase.cursorfactory factory int versioning so when the database helper constructor is called with a name 2nd param platform checks if the database exists or not and if the database exists it gets the versioning information from the database file header and triggers the right call back as already explained in the older answer if the database with the name doesn t exists it triggers oncreate

26916986
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
say your first versioning of application had the databasehelper extending sqliteopenhelper with constructor passing versioning as 1 and then you provided an upgrade application with the new source code having versioning passed as 2 then automatically when the databasehelper is constructed platform triggers onupgrade by seeing the file already exists but the versioning is lower than the current versioning which you have passed
now say you are planing to give a third versioning of application with db versioning as 3 db versioning is increased only when database schema is to be modified
in such incremental upgrade you have to write the upgrade logic from each versioning incrementally for a better maintainable code example pseudo code below notice the missing break statement in case 1 and 2

26917075
put	get
i have not tested the select but you should get the gist of it
i would say that you do not put these into the database
a better way would be to put them into a config file and then set them up from there

it s located on the following url services returnsites.ashx it s a quite simple json aray that looks like this i d like to loop through each of the sites in the json array
i have an html-file containing this i have a controller as well looks like this what i need is to put something instead of the trhee dots to grab the array from the json file
i can get it working if i my controller looks like this containing the array the controller file but i can t get it working if i m trying to grab the array from the file on the server

put	get
to use cifs from unix you typically need to know a user name and password for the cifs server and reference them in the mount command or fstab entry
you can put the password in a file that is protected and use the file for the mount
if you don t know the cifs server admin to get a user pass you have many problems

next	except
which is all well and good except that open already does that the most commonly-used values of mode are r for reading w for writing truncating the file if it already exists so we open the file creating it if it doesn t exist and truncating it to 0 bytes if it does
then on the next line we truncate it to 0 bytes
that truncating the file

popover	tooltip
it so happens that in my app all tooltip are created by my code so there is no risk of missing something
finding all elements with popover even unmarked if you are in a situation where a popover can be created without being marked i call this an escapee then you need to query the whole dom and find which elements have popover
there is no shortcut here

26917400
hex	binary
assuming you want to read the values from a file and write them back in the new format that is from a file of content ff00 928a get a new file with the content 0xff 0x00 0x92 0x8a this code should do the trick edit if the file is binary when you print f.read you don t see the values you give but what they represent in ascii you can do see if printing this gives you a string with the hex representation of the data. and of course you can convert it back with unhexlify from the same module if needed

26917410
put	get
the easier way to do this without relying on nested form is to put the id of the new record in the params of the detail get request

forexample for these local variables dim strname as string dim intage as int dim strgender as boolean in this case resharper rule should underline strgender since type is boolean and prefix is str instead of bln

equals	gethashcode
in addition to driis answer you can also create a new like and then you can pass that comparer to contains like where list1 is defined as or you can inherit from and then override equals and gethashcode because msdn states we recommend that you derive from the class instead of implementing the interface because the class tests for equality using the method instead of the equals method. this is consistent with the contains indexof lastindexof and remove methods of the class and other generic collections

you can use max on column c to get a count of the visible rows etc
say we want to filter data like put a header in cell c1 and in c2 enter and copy down
we now apply the filter to column b and we see as you see the helper column give a nice sequential list of the visible cells

gson	jackson
for parsing i can recommend my own jsonj library which was written specifically to support open ended scenarios like you describe and uses jackson to deserialize into heavily customised implementations of java.util.map and java.util.list
gson is also a very solid choice
if you want to do this application wide you can instead write your own provider and do the same there

haskell	ocaml
something that i know python and ocaml at the very least do. ghc does not need to do this so it exposes the full 32 or 64 bits as appropriate for its architecture
an int in haskell has to support at least a range of but it can also be larger
the exact size will depend on both the compiler you use and the architecture you re on

26919801
range	minimum
the exact size will depend on both the compiler you use and the architecture you re on
you can read more about this in the 2010 haskell report the latest standard for the haskell language. with ghc on a 64 bit machine you will have a range of
but even on a 32 bit machine i believe the range ghc gives you will be a bit larger than the strict minimum presumably

ngtable	ng-show
thanks
i have an ngtable with dynamic headers and dynamic rows of data that loads on a query
before the data loads the headers can be filtered by a checkbox that toggles the column.visible attribute dictated by ng-show

26919957
ocaml	racket	ocaml	racket
also in ocaml there re things like row polymorhism classes functors and modules that do not have direct correspondence in typed racket afaik
the main difference for me is that ocaml type system will always infer a most general type for you so that you do not need to add type annotations with some small exceptions in objective part of the language
also in ocaml there re things like row polymorhism classes functors and modules that do not have direct correspondence in typed racket afaik

here s one of the possible examples just googled v 4592599fecc08e5588c4244e2b0ceb7d32363a56 however depending on your actual needs the test may be quite complex
for example ubuntu as a debian-based os always has etc debian_version and many rpm-based oses traditionally have etc redhat-release
there s a file etc os-release in the linux standard base lsb specification but for example on the localhost this file is empty for an unknown reason

ng-style	ng-class
so instead of using style use ng-style
ng-style is used to interpolate javascript object into style attribute not css class
following directive will be translated to style color red and ng-class directive translates your object into class attribute

26920093
strdup	strtok
use strtok to split the string apart wherever a space occurs and store each return value a string pointer in an array of string pointers
if you re going to use the line buffer for something else you ll have to use strdup to create a copy of each token before storing it in the table otherwise you ll lose this data
the simplest way to read in a whole line is by using fgets but if you must use fscanf then you could use something like replacing 99 with one less than the size of the buffer you are reading the line into

put	get
so first correction is 2.you define your text action s http method as put however in your routes file you are handling get requests for your desired action

post	get
update after reading the comments i ve tested my assertion as shown above this application outputs just foo default if i uncomment #1 i then get foo default foo copy as the original poster suggested gcc 4.9 with -o3
i have to play more with non-printing constructors to see if this is always true or just when there are side effects but i wanted to update this post to clarify that it is not as cut and dry as i suggested

throttling	throttle
among the output will be to throttle your requests you could do the following some of the providers such as mapquest don t impose throttling at the moment

26920396
pull	push
i could pull in the changes as the hint says but given that the branches we push into staging are often short lived and may have little to do with each other this seems like it would be unnecessary and confusing

width	margin
instead of floating .column you should float each column however note that the margin isn t included in width 33.3 so they won t fit in a single line

width	height
essentially i solved the fixed width and height problem by changing the ribbon style open the ribbon assembly in jetbrains dotpeek open resources system.windows.controls.ribbon.g.resources themes generic.baml copy the entire resource dictionary into a .xaml file in your project

26920740
range	min	range	max	min	max
it is a conversion of full time in seconds or something that as an x-data passed to your chart and since you change the min and max value of time it has been out of range value so you have not any presentation of your data

int	double
link to wikipedia page on ieee floating point highlight float double are base radix 2 finite numbers which may be either base 2 binary or base 10 decimal
each finite number is described by three int s a sign zero or one c a significand or coefficient q an exponent
the numerical value of a finite number is 1 s c b q where b is the base 2 or 10 also called radix

the code is found here plugin_print_funcnames.cpp it seems like that the clang++ cannot find the library is not in the llvm library

26921319
margin	height
it is easy to see that for such data largest margin classifier will cut the plane horizontally somewhere around height 175 so once we get new sample 0 178 a woman of 178cm height we get the classification that she is a man

the + symbol is the magical inherited symbol
it works more examples of the inherited now add some concreteness by instantiating nat as type class cf i still try periodically to learn how to use the isabelle vocabulary correctly
well i wouldn t have already committed if i hadn t of replaced c and d in the definition for subclassing in isar-ref.pdf to find out

ng-app	ng-controller
first add ng-app directive not np-app in the html tag then add ng-controller directive in the table tag then make sure the js code looks something like

26921440
children	parent
when a row exceeds the viewport width it displays the scrollbar but when you scroll the styling of the row element remains the size of the viewport it does not seem to wrap all of its children
see fiddle try scrolling you will see the yellow row .sk_row class does not appear around all its children
a solution would be fine but i would like to know why the parent does not visually contain all children

26921495
hash	md5
however if you had the same scenario but derived the hash of the files first you would read 200mb of data from disk typically the slowest component in a computer distilling to 1.6k in memory using md5 hasing - 16 byte - security is not important and would read 2n 2mb for final direct binary comparison where n is the number of duplicates found

subclass	inherited
see this stack overflow response for details overriding methods using categories in objective-c here is the key phrase although the objective-c language currently allows you to use a category to override methods the class inherited or even methods declared in the class interface you are strongly discouraged from doing so
a category is not a substitute for a subclass
if the goal is simply to disable copy and paste in the web view it may be easier to just inject some css into the html such as

post	get
i have some regular wordpress post that i need to get from the database by parent category and order by the results of a custom table in the database that i have made

26921861
cos	sin
this is because you are rotating the vector with sin and cos which accept values in radians

26921877
google-chrome	safari
i suggest that you bind or unbind your click handler depending on the screen width like so working example you might also want to throttle or debounce your resize handler so it won t fire continuously in ie safari and google-chrome

26921888
multiplying	modulo
it may be better to have a password length of for example 8 through 12 inclusive and yes that is the modulo - you can use that instead of the multiplying divide actions

26921993
free	malloc
2 allocate the memory directly from a system service or library call malloc and use the corresponding function to free the memory
memory should always be free in the same way that it is allocated
you are asking for trouble doing what you are doing

26921993
free	malloc
you are asking for trouble doing what you are doing
off hand i can think of two ways to address this problem 1 have a delete function in c++ that you call to free the memory
2 allocate the memory directly from a system service or library call malloc and use the corresponding function to free the memory

26922037
integer	unsigned
i am seeing recurring squares in the output and some garbled fuzzy regions
suspect integer truncation is causing the artifacts
after i read the entire 8 bit rgb file into memory i allocate a parallel array of unsigned shorts to hold intermediate results during the analysis

26922037
int	double
i plan on upgrading the input to full 16 bit unsigned short tiff type quanta
upgrading the parallel working array to full 32 bit int would make any possibility of overflow vanishingly remote
double would also work fine but are soooo large and seem like overkill

26922064
multiplying	division
we need to represent sets of items that can assume 3 states as sums of powers of 3 to form indexes into lookup tables and this isn t as fast or convenient as working with 2-state items but it s not too hard the only expensive operation is division by 3 which can be done by multiplying by 0x55555556 and keeping the top 32 bits of the 64-bit result

26922139
mongodb	bson
you ll want to use moped bson objectid 54652f5b43687229b4060000 instead
this sets up single collection inheritance that means that both customer and simcustomer will be stored in the customers collection inside mongodb and they ll be differentiated using the _type field
specifying an index in simcustomer will create the index on the customers collection because that s where simcustomer s are stored

26922139
mongodb	bson	mongodb	bson
that really should be a moped bson objectid or you ll end up with a string inside the database and that will make a mess of your queries
mongoid may know what type a property should be but neither moped nor mongodb will
you ll want to use moped bson objectid 54652f5b43687229b4060000 instead

put	get
if i put in my vimrc file search results for them get directed to quick fix window correctly

26922345
goto	break
it will break if the condition is not met and program will continue at next line after curly brace
yes in assembly language loops are implemented with condition statement and a goto statement you can use this approach in c but not in java because goto is not permitted
when program gets to l1 it checks the condition

26922413
getter	setter
that in fact is all a property really is a way of calling a setter getter method

26922522
width	height
you can set the height and width to be zero so it doesn t block your screen

cos	sin
also the signal customarily uses cos instead of sin to ensure zero-phase shift when transmitting

26922582
children	parent
the children will die or their state will be completely wiped out. the question is what exactly will happen with children if not restart them during parent restart one can do that by overwrite prerestart and postrestart methods simply skip stop in first and skip start in second

post	get
to post s after_save method so essentially what i m trying to do is to get the trigger call be equivalent to which is basically how can i do this without modifying the post class
class method which takes a post object and checks to see if it meets some criteria
if yes it updates post.owner.awards

26922700
mongodb	bson
you re on the right track by trying to assign your own _id s but you don t have to use string s you can simply say moped bson objectid.new to generate a new _id
assuming that your order s have a customer_id which points at the customer you could don t be afraid to poke around inside mongodb using the mongo shell to see how things are structured internally
all the helpful relations and embedding conveniences that mongoid provides are nice but you still need to know what they re doing to your database

26922741
put	get
you need to put your xml processing instruction above your doctype declaration so to get rid of the xml parsing error the start of your file should look like this second problem you re referencing both a dtd file for hibernate version 3 and an xml schema for version 4

folder	directory
if it unix like system try change permission like following command chmod +w folder
you may have not write permission on the remote folder
please check if the ftp user you logged in have a write permission on the directory

26922878
put	get
after this you will get the location travelled by your mobile during sleep condition and you can place the routes into the activity using your code by extracting the values from the json array .
you can t directly mark an marker or put route into your activity from the service.
so it is better to implement both the service and activity with a location listener.

26922921
put	get
let me know if that doesn t make any sense
one way to do it would be in your visitscontroller then in your visits create.html.erb simply put it should work but it doesn t feel right from a restful perspective
a better way to do it would be to have in your config routes.rb resources visits do resources payments end that will generate the following route get visits visit_id payments new then in the visitscontroller and in your paymentscontroller in your payments new.html.erb don t forget to put and there you have it.

addition	multiplication	operands	scalar
the usual definition of matrix addition in which corresponding entries are added together is only defined for matrices of the same size
the wikipedia article on matrix addition mentions two additional types of addition the direct sum merely embeds the two operands on the diagonal of a new matrix in your case creating a 288 x 288 matrix
the kronecker sum is essentially a block matrix consisting of multiples of b formed from individual elements of a using scalar multiplication

int	chars
int is being called with different types because iterating over a string is giving chars objects not strings of length 1 and when given a chars julia s int is more like python s ord which gives rise to what you see there are lots of ways you could get this to behave as you expect use parseint or simply convert back to a string

1.first stop all the entities like namenode datanode etc
you will be having some script or command to do that format tmp directory go to var cache hadoop-hdfs hdfs dfs and delete all the contents in the directory manually now format your namenode again start all the entities then use jps command to confirm that the datanode has been started now run whichever application you may like or have

since you re using glassfish you can use jaspic which is the java ee standard for passing credential data across layers

26923465
typedef	struct
i think that that instead of typedef struct header it should be typedef struct header

26923592
typedef	struct
the trouble is that you ve declared that there is a struct tcb_t somewhere and you ve defined a typedef with the name tcb_t for a tagless anonymous struct type but you ve not defined the type struct tcb_t

i think b should be static const or constexpr but i m sure you can sort that... if there s lots of other stuff you want in myclass and don t want to duplicate or put in a base etc. you could move the b calculation into a supporting template using the specialisation approach above
what i m told worked this avoids a reliance on short circuit evaluation preventing the divide by 0
having the conditional selections happen before the division

int	boolean
you can use sharedpreferences to save any primitive data boolean floats int longs and strings

26923908
double-pointer	pointers
as your question title says c imo the best approach will be to decalre a pointers of that particular variable type in your main function pass the address of that pointers essencially a double-pointer to other functions and allocate memory dynamically

26923908
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
you can keep on passing the pointer to all other functions
inside every called functions measure the amount of memory required to put the data from that particular function and use realloc to increase the available memory
as mentioned by uncleo the required pointer should be the pointer to array i.e a double pointer edit for the very first time allocating memory to that pointer you can use malloc or calloc

26923908
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
as mentioned by uncleo the required pointer should be the pointer to array i.e a double pointer edit for the very first time allocating memory to that pointer you can use malloc or calloc
from next time onwards to extend resize the amount of memory you need to use realloc

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
see automatic initializer inherited rule 1 if your subclassing doesn t define any designated initializers it automatically inherited all of its superclass designated initializers

26924029
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in your example the subclassing b does not define any initializers on its own therefore it inherited all initializers from a including the required initializer. the same is true if b defines only convenience initializers now updated for swift 2 but if the subclassing defines any designated non-convenience initializer then it does not inherited the superclass initializers anymore

swift	objective-c
in objective-c i could write something like this and reuse most of the code i couldn t find the similar approach to do it in swift since there is no #define directive in swift and it is impossible to use constant in this case

26924388
coalesce	isnull
you can use both of these methods but there are differences select isnull col1 0 from table1 select coalesce col1 0 from table1 comparing coalesce and isnull the isnull function and the coalesce expression have a similar purpose but can behave differently

26924388
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	isnull
because isnull is a function it is evaluated only once
as described above the input values for the coalesce expression can be evaluated multiple times
data type determination of the resulting expression is different. isnull uses the data type of the first parameter coalesce follows the case expression rules and returns the data type of value with the highest precedence

26924388
coalesce	isnull
the nullability of the result expression is different for isnull and coalesce

26924388
coalesce	isnull
so the expressions isnull null 1 and coalesce null 1 although equivalent have different nullability values

26924388
coalesce	isnull
this makes a difference if you are using these expressions in computed columns creating key constraints or making the return value of a scalar udf deterministic so that it can be indexed as shown in the following example
-- this statement fails because the primary key cannot accept null values -- and the nullability of the coalesce expression for col2 -- evaluates to null
create table #demo col1 integer null col2 as coalesce col1 0 primary key col3 as isnull col1 0

26924388
coalesce	isnull
validations for isnull and coalesce are also different

26924388
coalesce	isnull
isnull takes only 2 parameters whereas coalesce takes a variable number of parameters

create convenience initializers whenever a shortcut to a common initialization pattern will save time or make initialization of the class clearer in intent required initialisers required initializers can be thought of as a binding contract between a parent interface and subsequent subclasses
its your means of enforcing that all your children are aware of and implements a certain set of initialisers
write the required modifiers before the definition of a class initializer to indicate that every subclass of the class must implements that initializer

super	self
for c the mro is c a b object so super a self .__init__ will find b.__init__

26927718
super	self
for these cases you don t want to use cooperative inheritance but directly reference a.__init__ and b.__init__ instead
super should only be used if the methods you are calling have the same signature or will swallow unsupported arguments with and
in that case just the one super c self .__init__ call would be needed and the next class in the mro order would take care of chaining on the call

26927718
super	self
in that case just the one super c self .__init__ call would be needed and the next class in the mro order would take care of chaining on the call
putting it differently when you use super you can not know what class will be next in the mro so that class better support the arguments you pass to it
if that isn t the case do not use super

in order to eliminate such scanning as much as possible we can define a pattern that tells jetty which sources to scan and which not to scan
this is done by either setting some configuration in maven or by setting an attribute in the jetty-context.xml
if you are using the maven plugin you need to set jetty s jetty-context.xml also in your pom.xml some other solutions that have not worked for me either no increase in startup time or no correct startup at all jetty 8.1.2 startup delay jetty8 with maven plugin takes to long to start etc

for practical reasons and flexibility i d stick with md5
note you can generate a secret unguessable sequence by adding a pseudo-random salt to your timestamp storing it in a database or log and publishing a one-way function of it its hash
any sequence can then later by verified by producing the salt and showing that its hash matches the published hash

26930222
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
since the word trust comes into play here i d consider sha-256 instead of md5 if large communities of gamers are involved and or run md5 iteratively in the way of key derivation functions when computing the hash of the salt that gets published

26930222
salt	md5
naked md5 and sha-1 are too small but there are easy ways around that just use more state
your time stamp is the biggest problem here has it has far fewer possible states than the 2 226 required for dealing a fair hand of poker and the salt that you add has to pick up the slack
e.g

26930265
int	double
if there is a value to print it will be double#tostring double d that does the job
the same applies to int
using string.valueof object is also what happens when you do println value is + value

26930327
folder	directory
for now i created a static subfolder inside the resources directory this might change but it definitely won t be inside the view folder

26930454
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
you need set box-sizing to border-box to use padding with width

26930511
lseek	fseek	lseek	fread	fseek	fread
i think you can use the lseek function for your purpose. you already used open and read instead of fopen and fread just use lseek instead of fseek

26930623
int	chars
your table now becomes create table customers id int not null name varchar 20 not null age int not null address chars 25 salary decimal 18 2 primary key id updatetime timestamp default current_timestamp on update current_timestamp

26930742
cbperipheralmanager	cbcentralmanager
so i use cbcentralmanager and cbperipheralmanager on each

26930754
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
im experiencing a weird behavior using tablepersubclass inherited option in gorm grails 2.4.3 having one superclass domain item and a subclassing let s say book i get two tables in mysql item and book when i save book items i can see entries in item table

26930782
qtreewidget	qabstractitemmodel
you can try to use your qtreewidget s model qabstractitemmodel to get the right index by the column and row numbers update for sub items the same approach can be used

26930924
vim	textmate
now when i try to execute git commit the terminal shows me this error usr bin mate -w usr bin mate no such file or directory error cannot run usr bin mate -w no such file or directory error there was a problem with the editor usr bin mate -w . please supply the message using either -m or -f option
before bash-it the commit command correctly opened vim. of course i ve tried to change the core.editor in git to vim but it does not work anyway
i really like vim it was super easy and fast...i don t want to use textmate to edit the commit message

26931007
chown	sudo
easiest solution sudo chown -r whoami targetfolder in your case you might as well give access to the whole www folder

26931031
put	get
here are the hex opacity values for the 2 additional digits 100 ff 95 f2 90 e6 85 d9 80 cc 75 bf 70 b3 65 a6 60 99 55 8c 50 80 45 73 40 66 35 59 30 4d 25 40 20 33 15 26 10 1a 5 0d 0 00 for exemple if you have de hex colour #111111 just put one of opacity values to get transparency

26931173
for-loop	loops
the error message is server.r update if i wrap the for-loop inside a reactive function and call it as part of renderui loops works but the plot is missing i guess this is because a renderui only create html tags it will not assign images to the generated tags

26931233
versioning	upgrade
a simple example of how to avoid having to upgrade the database each time
the onupgradeneeded callback is only called when you increment the versioning parameter to indexeddb.open
you will need to increment save and then reload each time you want your example code to run

26931345
google-chrome	safari
no matter what the fields are named jari and there s an assumption that safari seems to look for an input field with password and username and always tries to fill it user3172174 sometimes i notice this strange behavior on google-chrome and safari when there are password fields in the same form

26931355

quicksort	bucket-sort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	radix-sort	heapsort	bucket-sort	radix-sort	bucket-sort	radix-sort	heapsort
like heapsort insertion sort quicksort merge-sort bucket-sort or radix-sort

26931552
heapsort	bucket-sort
bucket-sort doesn t actually sort anything it just divides array in sub-arrays which then can be sorted using some sorting algorithm
heapsort is comparison-based algorithm and the given algorithms doesn t look like one
so the only possibility that s left is radix-sort which is not a comparison-based algorithm

26931661
google-chrome	safari
new fix works like before but handles virtual keyboard live demo updateend by the way more information on my observation sometimes i notice this strange behavior on google-chrome and safari when there are password fields in the same form

26931727
getter	setter
you can use getter and setter like and you can create a new case insensitive dict from a case sensitive one like so or with a comprehension

26931885
for-loop	loops
the for-loop loops for 31 times not 30 1..30 is 30 numbers + 1 for the zero

26932021
post	get
it will not provide 404 but of course it will not update json file if you need data to be saved you need real working application which will provide api and process request and store data
you said i want to edit the contents of the home page and post back to the json file. you cant save to the local files with angular
get request is working just because browser can load static file its same with css or html

26932080
width	height
while the problem is that an element other than the root element needs a parent with a specified width in order to calculate its own relative height you can avoid the problem using units relative to the viewport such as vh 1vh is equal to one-percent of the height of the view-port and so is pretty much a direct drop-in replacement for a -based height such as js fiddle demo

26932083
implements	extends
you can define a writes for bar by extends and implements a writes method for it for those that may be interested here is a somewhat crude implementation of edit since the op wants the bar s merged into an object rather than an array you ll also have to define a special as well

26932100
put	get
it could look like this although the naming would get tricky and usage of put add methods from map collection would be somehow confusing explicit disclaimer there s no such thing as multisetmultimap if you re interested in this solution you should go with the new issue on github

26932196
for-loop	loops
many algorithms have become much easier to use in c++11 thanks to lambdas and better bind expressions which allow you to specify the functor in a relatively concise fashion
however the range-based for-loop is a perfectly legitimate option too
if all you need is one or two statements in loops body then by all means use a range-based loops

26932293
x86	64bit
regards pascal excerpt from the blueboxlib.h file
i have a c# application that p invokes an ansi c library provided by the manufacturer to access an rfid-reader over the network. this works absolutely fine with .net framework versions 2.0 up to 4.5 if i manually set the platform to x86
with the platform set to 64bit on the other hand it only works with .net framework versions 3.5. the error code i get is defined as invalidhandle where the handle is an int i m given by the library identifying the reader. i don t get what an impact the framework version could have on a native library especially if only so on a 64bit platform

26932294
tweepy	twython
which means that what you should really be doing is use a twitter lib for python such as twython or tweepy

26932377
width	height
use this width and height in this way

26932385
vp8	opus
right now audio wise the only supported codecs are pcma pcmu isac and opus the default
for video you have vp8 also h264 on some systems with firefox
to use any of these codecs as default you must modify your sdp before setting it locally in your peerconnection and sending your offer answer

26932385
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
just make sure to add the payload and the appropriate mappings and options fmtp is needed for h264 as profiles are important and possibly sprop-parameter-sets
this will work with any appropriately coded webrtc system firefox opera etc
not just google-chrome

26932469
for-loop	loops
solution is much simpler try to use canonical for-loop instead of for-each loops

26932472
dplyr	tidyr
try or use dplyr tidyr or using base r data

26932497
getter	setter
i m developing one project using jsf and primefaces i was tired of getter and setter and decided to use lombok project to get rid of it. so i ve created simple page

26932498
equals	compareto
the code in line will return a date in 1970 while the code in line will return the current date in 2014 so the code will never executed because the campare is equals to -1 0 here is a test code i created on button as a debugging techniques instead use your code to log it out to logcat the logcat result is 11-14 16 18 02.618 e test_tag 2137 timecompare is thu jan 01 23 00 00 eet 1970 11-14 16 18 02.618 e test_tag 2137 currenttime is fri nov 14 16 18 02 eet 2014 11-14 16 18 02.618 e test_tag 2137 compareto result is -1 to correct this i suggest to save the time in data bandle as full length like yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss then use simpledateformat yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss as following so your code will run correctly

26932539
implicit	shapeless
depending on your use case you can emulate a type-level function by providing implicit for the cases this is how a lot of shapeless works

26932602
content-disposition	content-type
so i generated the template as rtf and tried to embed it into the email via content-type text rtf content-disposition inline content-type text richtext content-disposition inline but that lead to the rtf code being shown as normal text or attached to the mail

26932605
for-loop	arrays
the test then computes all combinations while comparing it with all combinations of another arrays with similar properties like truth tables i have not been able to either compute something that would generate every combination of the arrays of size n and alphabet l niether have i been able to make code that is able to combine the computation into iterative testcases test all the combinations of the two arrays compared though with code that would be able to generate the combinations making a nested for-loop should do the required testing

26932692
mouseup	mousedown
edit what happens is that the timeout variable is getting overwritten when a second mousedown happens without a mouseup

26932693
for-loop	arrays
now for the second for-loop we take all of the values we stored in our temp arrays list and we put them on the now-empty right side of the arrays

integer	unsigned
a properly correct solution might look like this in the end unless you really need the extra bit it usually best to avoid unsigned integers
c has this concept called integer promotion
basically it means that all maths is done in signed int unless you really insist otherwise or it doesn t fit

26932845
puts	gets

the code below creates a parent context and puts a class called environment into the context with a name environment which is generated through a annotationbeannamegenerator
this then gets autowired into testchild which is in a child context

the option to change your lockscreen notification visiblity is in the device settings under sound notifications when device is locked as show below
as selvin noted in his answer the option to hide sensitive content is only available if you have set some sort of device lock such as a pin or pattern lock
if you can unlock your device with a simple swipe of the lockscreen this option is not available

int	double
finally you should be able to divide by 1000 and get the correct result
the problem is that you are using int32 as type you only have int numbers and 0.23 is correctly rounded to 0
try to cast the variable consrollkp to double before dividing it by 1000 to clarify using typecast with single will not work

shadowing	named	shadowing	named
in case of active patterns you can put them in modules - for example pat1 and pat2 so in your code you can then use fully qualified named like pat1.a or pat2.a
i agree that shadowing of active patterns can be tricky - though it is the same problem that you get with discriminated union cases and record labels in f#
in case of types you can always include the type named to resolve the ambiguity

26933167
getter	setter
there basically are two ways to do this use a common interface that expose the getter and setter

26933167
getter	setter
if possible both objects don t already extend other superclasses you could use an abstract superclass and put the properties as well as the getter and setter there

26933167
implements	extends
note that both approaches can be combined use an interface for the handler and use an abstract superclass that implements that interface as an adapter class you could extends that adapter when possible or just implements the interface when extends the adapter is not possible

26933204
client-side	server-side
you re mixing client-side and server-side functionality

26933204
client-side	server-side
ultimately you need to separate your client-side functionality from your server-side functionality

26933204
client-side	server-side
if you re just redirecting after a form post which is what you re doing then redirect from server-side code
if you want the bells and whistles of client-side animations and ux don t use webforms post-backs


26933304
hide	show
but when i use its show function on a form that is itself popped up from the main form the messagebox hide under the second form and the program therefore becomes unavailable

int	chars
since there is no exact match for other_function chars or other_function int must implicitly convert its argument to match one of but has ctor which accepts an int and has ctor which accepts a chars

i thought isselected can not be found as there s no such property in viewmodel i tried to use the solution suggested to construct a list of tabitem but i get the error unable to cast object of type tabdata to type tabitem

26933941
children	parent

for example if i want to select all elements either of class zip or class email who are children of the element with id form this does not work

you as a developer can then use xcode s import localization feature to import the translation xliff file into your project

26934189
for-loop	loops
however that messes up the for-loop because if the first record could not be sanitized then it s removed the on the next iteration of loops it s skipped because record 2 is now record 1

primefaces	omnifaces
edit i m using omnifaces 1.6.3 and primefaces 5.1

26934290
width	height
to center a div whose parent is the body you need also to declare its width and height

26934296
hide	show
looks like first position is calculated including bottom bar which is hidden due to hide on push if there is uitableview as subview top pinned subviews again are show on wrong place for a moment and then jump to correct place

26934344
createjs	easeljs
its a little dirty but used extensively until easeljs 0.7.1 the latest release
the new way even better though the latest version of createjs only available in github as the next version which should be tagged and published to the cdn soon
has a brand new model for inheritance that is even easier and does things like automatically injecting super methods including the ability to call the super constructor

26934362

if you upgraded to universal analytics and are not using classic analytics then you would use a send event not a push event ga send event audio e.type this attr src

loops	if-statement
that is instead of placing two nested while loops in your code you can check for valid input with a single if-statement such as hope this helps
the reason why your code is not terminating is due to nesting your while loops
although you have included a break statement in the line you will not exit the outer loops

the issue with this is that it s a fifo queue and any items ahead of the stop item need to be popped before it can get to my stop item

for-loop	loops
one way you could accomplish all this in a single line might look like so sw.writeline string.join | fields.take fields.length - 1
one way you could do this - if what you want at that point in the code is to always write all but the final element in your - is construct a for-loop that terminates before the last item this is assuming that you want to write each field individually and that you want to iterate through fields in the first place
if all you want to do is just write a single string to a single line without using a loops you could do this and then just write the truncatedfields as you see fit

multiplying	transpose
i need to multiplying each column of x by b so i would have n squared matrices m x 3 . see example how it should look like below then i need to multiplying each of this n matrixes on transpose vector a which will turn my n matrixes into n vectors of length m

nswindow	nsvisualeffectview
doing this with vibrancy in yosemite should be simple being a matter of checking for yosemite and inserting an nsvisualeffectview with vibrancy turned on
getting it right under 10.8 10.9 on the other hand i could sidestep this problem entirely by using the built-in bottom bar drawing provided by nswindow but the color-merged approach is visually much cleaner much more strongly associates controls with their parent panes and seems to be the style of choice more and more often these days
if at all possible i d like to use it in my own application

implements	extends
the more specific approach the observer approach the observer design pattern might be a very good fit for something more generic and it actually extends the example i gave before
if you re not familiar with it it s a way to implements event and thus tie up between the state of 2 objects while when one is changed the other one observes this changes and reacts accordingly
in this case your light observes the switch

as it is now i have a playlist endpoint with get and put enabled

26938429
put	get	put	get
right now get returns a list of json representations of each song the filename of the saved song and it s length
put allows you to if you know the filenames of all the saved music put a list of these json representations and replace the current playlist
what i would like is to have each song resource be identified by it s position in the current playlist and be able to get put delete them individually

int	boolean
z might indeed be a string but it could in principle be any non-primitive type because all objects have an equals method
a cannot be an int because you cannot call methods like .length on an int
b cannot be an int because in the line the expression on the right side is of type boolean and you cannot assign a boolean to an int

26938530

put	get
something like this should work or be close to a functioning solution caveat code has not been compiled nor tested
you should never call thread.sleep ... on the swing event thread unless your goal is to put the entire application to sleep rendering it useless
instead get rid of the for loop and loop using a swing timer

26938677
puts	gets
on end-of-file fgets will return null when it gets to end-of-file and you need to check feof to verify that eof has been reached
feof never puts eof in its output
eof is an int value of -1 which cannot be represented in a char array

26938677
getc	gets
eof is an int value of -1 which cannot be represented in a char array
eof is only returned by getc and similar functions

converter	multibinding
it turns out i could use a multibinding for this
the converter looks like this i should be a little more thorough in that converter and ensure that all of the objects in the values array are of type frameworkelement but this gets the idea across
then in the xaml i can bind to the property on my behavior like this i m using the onetime mode on the binding simply because these are ui elements in the view that i m binding to the behavior

filtering	grouping
what can i do to make this work..
i have the following table with the shown data in it send_date | household_id ------------------------- 11-20-2014 | 123 11-20-2014 | 456 11-15-2014 | 789 i need to do 2 things 1 calculate the max value for send_date 2 filtering out any rows whose send_date does not match that value in other words i want the output to be send_date | household_id ------------------------- 11-20-2014 | 123 11-20-2014 | 456 row number 3 should be filtering out as its send_date is not the max
i tried creating an aggregate grouping by all columns and creating a new output port called max_date with an expression of max send_date then have a filtering transformation with the condition this lets all rows through though

nsdata	nsoutputstream
if you want lower level file i o you can use nsinputstream and nsoutputstream as martin r

of course you can also use all the usual c stdio functions if you really want to get down and dirty with your files

folder	directory	folder	dir	folder	dir
for ex if you have created your project in c workspace test where test is your project name in command prompt type c cd c workspace test now your command prompt would look like this c workspace test type dir after test it would show you the directory structure of your project
check if you have any lib folder in that structure
if you have a lib folder type dir lib in the command prompt which would show you the list of jars available in your project

26938914
super	self
similar criticism to the below but additionally that s not the way to initialize via super and you ll get a deprecationwarning if you access the message attribute edit to override something or pass extra args do this that way you could pass dict of error messages to the second param and get to it later with e.errors it also requires exactly two arguments to be passed in aside from the self . no more no less

26938922
int	double
you can use instead the standard if-then-else control construct a performance advantage of this alternative solution besides avoiding repeating computations when an int is not odd is that assuming your prolog system implements first-argument indexing as most do the correct clause for the double 2 predicate will always be picked at each call without creating a choice-point assuming that the predicate is called with the first argument instantiated but this or your definition definition would not work otherwise

put	get
given no code was provided i ll give you some rough directions to get you started but put it on you to determine any specifics

put	get
first lets create a month column for the data and then calculate the modes for each key for each month
additionally lets put this new data in its own dataset
however this procedure calculates the mode in a very specific way that you may not want defaults to the lowest in the case of a tie and produces no mode if nothing occurs at least twice documentation if that doesn t work for you i recommend using proc sql to get a count of each key month value combination and calculating your own mode from there

subsequently it is serialized to json and stored as bson in mongodb

it is a bit confusing but notice the following output so the tsc.exe in the 1.1 folder is actually 1.3 not really sure why the folder version numbering is off but this is the case for me. small sidenote i m a bit confused too because on another system it isn t working like this still showing 1.0.3 but you might want to check your tsc.exe -v from the 1.1 directory

range	minimum
depending on the data there will be values outside the user specified range
i adapted this code to illustrate my question python matplotlib - colorbar range and display values this code plots values from 0 to 2 but i have set the contour range v 0.1 to 1.5 so that there will be values outside the contour and i am using extensions extend both to extend contour so that values outside the range appear as a colour to ensure that there are no white areas
on less there is another way what i want is for the minimum value of the data and maximum value of the data to display on the extensions

folder	directory
the filesystemwatcher is set as follows the event handler when the myroot directory is empty and files are created by another process they are moved inside the folder as i described

26939734
cpu	processors
but my process containing the watcher hits a constant 13 to 14 cpu on an octa core processors and increases as the size of the sub directories increase
during processing even if i create copy-paste 2000 files at once goes 1 more than that. the funny part is that when i change the monitoring path to an empty one or the same but with less volume inside it the cpu utilization of my process is 0 and only when files are created goes to a max of 2 - 5
again as said the observation is clear when the monitoring path sub directories contain data that data affect the watcher internals even if you set not to monitor the sub directories

gif	png
this is the best source to answer my question although i didn t originally find my answer here i found my answer here you can simply add contenttype file.mimetype acl public-read to the params turning into edit rather than supplying the file s mimetype you could only allow particular mimetypes such as image jpg image jpeg image png image gif etc.

i need to implement an animation on an imageview similar to the slide to answer animation that exists in many android devices. the requiremnts support api level 8 if not possible then 9 so the convenient drag listener is out of the question move the imageview right or left when dragging it only horizontal dragging is required

26939946
pull	push
pull vs push when you send log messages directly to the log parser from log shipper you basically push the messages and hope that the parser can handle the rate at which these events are being pushed to it
when you choose to use a message queue you allow the log parser to pull the messages at the rate that it can handle
when the rate is too high and the parser can t pull all the messages they will accumulate in your message queue and once the rate will become lower the parser will pull these messages and clear the queue

the decryption itself works since i m able to see the decoded data or spdy packages if spdy is used by right clicking on a tlspacket and selecting follow ssl stream

hash	salt
using the salt hash technique for password transmission will resolve this issue

26940690
hash	salt
in the salt hash technique the passwords are stored as hash in the database

26940690
hash	salt
a javascript code on the page computes a hash of the entered password concatenates the salt and computes a hash of the entire string

26940690
hash	salt
the server then retrieves the user s hash password from the database concatenates the same salt and computes a hash

26940690
hash	salt
now the post request will contain the salt hash value of the password and the cleartext password will not be present in the memory sha 256 is a strong hashing algorithm available today readymade implementations in javascript are available and quoted in the good reads section

- flash debugger is found in flex sdk directory as fdb.exe - air debug launcher is found in the air sdk as adl.exe you cannot start an air application directly with fdb because fdb attempts to launch it with flash player
instead let the air application connect to a running fdb session
renaun erickson has a great article describing debugger connection during app launch but he has replied to this question saying connection after that point isn t possible the following posts seem to indicate this is possible with android apps i haven t tried them on my air app android reconnect debugger reconnect to debug process on android using eclipse with adt the answer i m interested in any form of solution to this problem involving any ide or command-line utility the flash debugger mentioned in adobe documentation as a command-line debugger flash builder intellij idea flashdevelop etc

26940891
hash	salt
there are multiple ways to do this but there is no way you can create anything that is impossible to hack read
however you can limit mitm attacks by hashing the password x number of times before sending it to the server. when the hash is recived by the server you do x number of new hash rounds
you should also figure out a how to manage your salt

jar	war	ant	maven
as per my experience in the java field automated deployment means your code is compiled from a repository and built into a jar war ear at a certain location and this is done automatically through tools like ant maven hudson etc so here ant and maven are helping you build the artifacts like the jar war etc and hudson helps in scheduling the time for the build and the location where the artifacts need to be stored etc

if the codec isn t defined you ll get a diverging implicit error
theoretically the woozle codec could be automatically derived if there s an implicit in scope but scalac isn t up to the task -- instead it bails out with a diverging implicit expansion error
we hope to improve this with shapeless 2.1

if all images are of constant width and height you simply add the image urls to your data array and dynamically set the xlink href attribute using the data function

one approach is to preload the images so that you know the width and height values once the images are loaded and use a callback function to place them within the pie chart

int	boolean
at the very least you should change it to return false as soon as it has found one divisor when
you are getting that error because genprim returns an int but main assigns that result to l so l no longer contains a list of numbers just that single int
similarly prim returns a boolean true or false but main assigns that to l too

26944025
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
it is handy that the input string consists of numbers because then we can use the digits in the string to index an arrays that holds the possible letters for each number
the idea is to modify an output string at a particular index using a for-loop to go over all the possible replacements at that index
then recursively move to the next index in the output arrays in the body of the for-loop

26944042
folder	directory
you just need to create a folder inside document directory
then fetch the folder everytime you want to store something and store into it


26944061
free	memcmp	free	malloc	free	memcpy
my goal was a method which is very easy to use inside various cyclically called functions
i cleaned all the init and free logic from the code
i especially don t like the oldshool malloc memcpy and memcmp stuff but i don t know any other way how to do it

26944088
min	max
this code will now result the variable to be an integer between min and max now you can easily replace those with constants or set values to them for nice and understandable code

26944200
width	height
an old question however no replies are suitable but you can find some hint here how to customize the width and height when show an activity as a dialog this helps customize the width and height but not set the max width and height

26944226
memcpy	memcmp
you do need to define and have a working copy constructor for your types but that is much better than blindly using memcmp and memcpy

26944226
memcpy	memcmp
this will let you use a single map for everything like you were doing before but this has no memcpy memcmp

26944283
for-loop	loops
if you want to create a different object each time you should use
somehow after the for-loop the values of the object.num 1 no matter what even though they are never set to 1
yes they are - they re set to 1 in the last iteration of this loops the last iteration of that loops is when temp is 1

26944294

i definitely do not want to sleep and keep reading the arp table to check if a new entry is added
i am coding in visual c++

26944314
folder	directory
you can prepend directory to the list of quote directory with the -iquote option
so when you want to include geometry.h using you just have to invoke gcc with additional -i argument you just have to decide how deep do you want to go and if you want to use #include you may do that too lets assume you re in abs path ws a inc your_header.h and want to include abs path ws b inc normal geometry.h #include path geometry.h abs path ws a inc geometry.h .. geometry.h abs path ws a geometry.h .. .. geometry.h abs path ws geometry.h .. .. b geometry.h abs path ws b geometry.h .. .. b inc geometry.h abs path ws b inc geometry.h .. .. b inc normal geometry.h abs path ws b inc normal geometry.h if this doesn t work you are probably in different folder or have a typo somewhere
i would personally go with the first solution you may want to have your libraries system wide later and this way you just have to change one -i header in makefile without editing sources

free	malloc
secondly you are freeing your person struct right after creation
free new_person
now aop- data i is a dangling pointer because the address it points to could be overwritten any time because it s not locked by malloc anymore

26944685
free	malloc
now aop- data i is a dangling pointer because the address it points to could be overwritten any time because it s not locked by malloc anymore
instead you have to free it in your destroy function
it might look something like this

comparator	comparable
if your class implements comparable you can add a public int comparator object o function

26944900
equals	compareto
then you can call it using but keep in mind that the function return an int
0 if yourobject is smaller 0 if it s equals and 0 if it s greater
you can compare your object to different objects using instanceof inside compareto object o but you need to specify how the comparison should be handled with a specific object java will not guess for you

26944904
folder	directory
the directory will also need execute permissions
for the situation you are describing i would run dropbox as a separate user as well and then make the dropbox folder either group or world readable
the dropbox user should also not be part of the sudo group

26944904
chown	chmod	chown	sudo	chown	mkdir	chmod	mkdir
i ll assume your dropbox folder is named dropbox
chown -r dropbox node dropbox find dropbox -type d | xargs chmod 750 find dropbox -type f | xargs chmod 640 mkdir node # copy files in here chown -r node node node find node -type d | xargs chmod 750 find node -type f | xargs chmod 640 note that this turns off the executable bit on all binaries so you may have to manually fix those
also note that chmod and chown both require root permissions to modify other user files so you ll probably need to add some sudo to those commands but it was already getting long

go and open terminal and type the command below ifconfig you ll see the private ip that the router gives you from here should be something like ex 192.168.1.10 after you acquire the ip open etc mysql mysql.cnf and change the bind adress to the ip you ve acquired in this case restart the server via sudo service mysql restart after this case i ll give you some tips for security
never allow your root user remotely accessible that is just unsecure

int	chars
to avoid the conversion you provide a type chars d that makes the literal decimal in the first place
compare this to the left part is decimal the right part is int but no compile error occurs even with option strict on because now there is an implicit widening conversion from int to decimal because decimal can represent all values an int can possibly have

next	document.write
we may want to consider what we want to happen when i is bigger than or equal to arr.length as well

width	margin
obviously this is a simple width 75 in css but when i do this the main content div refuses to align to the right of the navigation div
however if the div at 75 was taking up 400px and i changed the width 75 to width 450px then the divs align exactly how i want them to despite being the same size
when i look at the box model for the main content div i can see the content is 75 as it is supposed to be but there is a margin on the right of it which takes up the rest of the container

graphics2d	bufferedimage
what i ve done is to 1 create a bufferedimage to display my static images and then draw directly my dynamic images and 2 if need be limit the area being drawn by using the repaint ... method overload that accepts a rectangle
you state to me this screams performance issue because every time the paint method is called i.e every frame you are needlessly casting to a graphics2d type every single time
there is minimal cost to this and so i wouldn t worry about it

filesystems	xfs
make sure that you only use about 80 of the available disk space in the volume group for creating the logical volume
create a filesystems on the logical volume
i prefer xfs so we create an xfs filesystems on dev volgroup logvol1 mkfs.xfs dev volgroup logvol1 mount the newly created filesystems on mnt mount dev volgroup logvol1 mnt shut down mongod killall mongod note that the upstart scripts sometimes have problems shutting down mongod and this command gracefully stops mongod anyway

you need to call fflush 3 before each call to write 1 .
since it is a syscall or else end each printf format string with a n since stdout is generally line-buffered

width	height
on one hand by using display inline-block for the outer div and not specifying an explicit height you ve implicitly told the browser to make it as wide as the inner div inside it
on the other hand by specifying width 50 for the inner div you told the browser to make it only half as wide as the outer div
obviously these requirement conflict at least unless both divs have zero width so one of them has to fail

vmware	virtualbox
if you decide to give vmware player a try make sure you have vt-x amd-v available and enabled on your physical host computer
then add the following setting to your vmware machine and you should be able to start hyper-v inside your vm
for more information see these links unable to use hyper-v platform inside a windows 8 virtual machine how to enable windows server 2012 hyper-v role in vmware and some useful topics on virtualbox forums which explain why the feature is not available on virtualbox t 20589 t 52625 p 304452 i really miss this feature on virtualbox because i find vmware player to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than virtualbox does

however when i set the static window s text with setwindowtext to timealarm via strftime it always outputs 01 00 00

26949038
icmp	tcp
icmp runs directly over ip as specified in rfc 792 icmp messages are sent using the basic ip header
this can be a bit confusing as icmp is classified as a network layer protocol rather than a transport layer protocol but it makes sense when taking into account that it s merely an addition to ip to carry error routing and control messages and data
thus it can t rely on the tcp layer to transfer itself since the tcp layer depends on the ip layer which icmp helps to manage and troubleshoot

26949038
icmp	tcp	mtu	icmp
the tcp layer may come to know of the path s mtu value even though the icmp message is not layered upon tcp

26949038
icmp	tcp
it s up to the implementation of os the network stack to notify the tcp layer of the mtu so it can then use this value to update its mss value
rfc 1122 requires that the icmp message includes the ip header as well as the first 8 bytes of the problematic datagram that triggered that icmp message every icmp error message includes the internet header and at least the first 8 data octets of the datagram that triggered the error
more than 8 octets may be sent

26949038
icmp	tcp	mtu	icmp
therefore i assume that once an icmp fragmentation needed and df set error message is received the mtu value is somehow made available to the tcp layer that can use it to update its mss value

26949038
icmp	tcp	icmp	tcp
furthermore i think that the application layer that instantiated the tcp connection and taking use of it may handle such messages as well and fragment the packets at a higher level
the application may open a socket that expects icmp messages and act accordingly when such are received
however fragmenting packets at the application layer is totally transparent to the tcp ip layers

26949038
icmp	tcp
rfc 5927 section 2.2 refers to rfc 1122 section 4.2.3.9 which states that tcp should abort the connection when an icmp fragmentation needed and df set error message is passed up from the ip layer since it signifies a hard error condition

26949038
icmp	tcp
the better strategy would be to lower the message size because fragmentation will cause more traffic and consume more internet resources
for conclusion i think that the specification is not definitive in regard to the required behavior from a host upon receipt of an icmp fragmentation needed and df set error message
my guess is that both layers ip tcp are notified of the message in order to update their mtu mss values respectively and that one of them takes upon the responsibility of retransmitting the problematic packet in smaller chunks

26949038
icmp	tcp
my guess is that both layers ip tcp are notified of the message in order to update their mtu mss values respectively and that one of them takes upon the responsibility of retransmitting the problematic packet in smaller chunks
lastly regarding your implementation i think that for full compliance with rfc 1122 you should update the icmp message to include the ip header of the problematic packet as well as its next 8 bytes though you may include more than just the first 8 bytes
moreover you should verify that the icmp message is received before the corresponding ack for the packet to which that icmp message refers

26949038
icmp	tcp
if sending the icmp message as a response to one of the tcp packets fails i suggest you try sending the icmp message before even receiving the tcp packet to which it relates at first in order to assure it is received before the ack

if the account has been created from the web platform django-userena then i can t use apikeyauthentication because the key should be created when a new user is saved

if a gesture recognizer doesn t recognize its gesture or if the value of this property is no the view receives all touches in the multi-touch sequence
should be this mean touches are cancelled in case gesture was recognized otherwise touchesbegan moved ended called
from documentation when this property is yes the default and the receiver recognizes its gesture the touches of that gesture that are pending are not delivered to the view and previously delivered touches are cancelled through a touchescancelled withevent message sent to the view

vbscript	vb6	vbscript	vb6
the problem is that every time i do this i have to write that same include sub in the main vbscript so i wondered if i can make an activex dll in vb6 so that i just can do this createobject blah.include .include filepath .
i assume that your real world problem is code re-use via modules libraries in vbscript
that can be achieved without the overhead of ms scriptcontrol vb6 and dlls

implicit	shapeless

so far i can do this which then allows me to extract values procedurally however when i try to write a function to do this i m getting tied up with implicit not found presumably i m getting this because the compiler can t verify that my parameter is not a case class
i m quite new to shapeless so i m not entirely sure if i m trying to do something crazy or if missing something simple

onresume	onpause
recently a client reported a freeze in our app that happens only on nexus 10 device
we bought the device ourselves and tested device came with android 4.2 preinstalled - there were no hangs nor freezes in our app after upgrading android to 4.3 our app freezed on closing camera see below for explanation by upgrading to 4.4 our app kept freezing by flashing the latest android 5.0 nexus 10 factory image our app still kept freezing edit - the problem has been solved by upgrading nexus 10 to android 5.1 more information about the freeze our app opens the camera in onresume method of activity installs the preview callback sets the preview size to best possible for our processing needs on nexus 10 this is 1920x1080 and either starts the preview if resuming from sleep or delegates the same to surfacecreated method of surfaceview callback
in onpause method our app removes the preview callback stops the camera preview and releases the camera

check your computer s system information to see whether you need an x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of the program and then contact the software publisher
the result is the same regardless of what version of go i use x86 x64
also note that i m not using any ide

26951767
shadowing	named
the global keyword when used in a non-global scope allows you to rebind the named to a different object and have that rebinding take effect in the global scope too otherwise you would simply be defining a new variable in the local scope which would indeed be shadowing the original variable
shadowing isn t a technique or a tool it s something that is simply a consequence of python s scoping rules
i m confused by your question about whether any of the variables are global

26951937

int	double
you can implement a dynamic programm that solves the knapsack problem with int satisfaction and arbitrary real number prizes like double
first the standard solution of the problem with int prizes this creates a table where the solution can be found by following the recursion for entry k m n
now the solution for the problem with real number weight the solution can now be found similiar to the other version

free	malloc	free	malloc
in c use malloc and its friends to allocate data chunks of memory dynamically
the common idiom is like don forget to deallocate it when not needed by free standard function
moreover you should also always check returned value from malloc determining if it succeded

base	fractions	base	fractions	abc	isinstance	abc	isinstance
if you want that take note of their is_integer property and the code is then just from numbers import integral def is_sort_of_integer value if isinstance value integral return true try return value.is_integer except attributeerror return false if you also want to deal with decimal s fractions and so on which don t have an is_integer method the best option would probably be just from numbers import number integral def is_sort_of_integer value if isinstance value integral return true if isinstance value number try return not value 1 except typeerror return false return false the integral check shouldn t be needed in this case but it s probably best to keep it
normally one would check against the integral abc abstract base class but floating point values are not normally meant to be treated as integers no matter their value
if you want that take note of their is_integer property and the code is then just from numbers import integral def is_sort_of_integer value if isinstance value integral return true try return value.is_integer except attributeerror return false if you also want to deal with decimal s fractions and so on which don t have an is_integer method the best option would probably be just from numbers import number integral def is_sort_of_integer value if isinstance value integral return true if isinstance value number try return not value 1 except typeerror return false return false the integral check shouldn t be needed in this case but it s probably best to keep it

inherited	subclassing
you might want to take a look at this
unfortunately typescript does not support multiple inherited
therefore there is no completely trivial answer you will probably have to restructure your program here are a few suggestions if this additional class contains behaviour that many of your subclassing share it makes sense to insert it into the class hierarchy somewhere at the top

26952456
superclass	subclassing
therefore there is no completely trivial answer you will probably have to restructure your program here are a few suggestions if this additional class contains behaviour that many of your subclassing share it makes sense to insert it into the class hierarchy somewhere at the top
maybe you could derive the common superclass of sprite texture layer .
this would be a good choice if you can find a good spot in the type hirarchy

26952456
superclass	subclassing
a logical inheritance tree is very valuable if the additional class does not fit logically into the type hierarchy you could use aggregation
that means that you add an instance variable of the type of this class to a common superclass of sprite texture layer .
then you can access the variable with its getter setter in all subclassing

26952456
implements	extends
then you could extends the interface with all your classes but would have to implements the methods correctly in each class

however if i delete all cookies for lema.drae.es the get request returns the aforementioned hidden form
in short i need a way to receive the response of that post request from within greasemonkey and i believe that if it were possible to receive the cookie from the server and store it then i could include it as a request header in a further request and it should work as i expect
or it should simply be stored in the browser and therefore would get sent as a header when i trigger gm_xmlhttprequest

26952953
for-loop	arrays
using local variables to cache values pulled out of global structures and arrays can actually speed up execution of your code
if for instance you are fetching something from a complex structure inside a for-loop where the compiler can t optimize and you know the value isn t changing the local variables can save quite a bit of time
you can use gcc other compilers too to generate the intermediate assembly code and see what the compiler is actually doing

26952993
post	get
using methods each handler class has methods with names like get and post after the http methods get and post etc

children	parent
here s what i came up with an item model that can be constructed with a friendly syntax no need to set its parent a pruning tool that will remove an item and cleanup the hierarchy as much as it can example pruning item 1.4.1.1 before after objects item your item it watches for children you add to it and un sets its parent property provides prune method which removes it from its parent climbs up and repeat until not possible code itemcollection a collection of items using observablecollection very useful in alleviating the need to specify parent as you will see on the example below

dplyr	tidyr
or by library dplyr and library tidyr if you use library tidyr alone could do spread df x2 x3

26953676
spaces	delimiter
use fo the entire line - omitting the delims option will set delimiter to the default set spaces comma semicolon etc. don t use -comments within a block parenthesised statement-sequence as it s actually a broken label and cmd doesn t appeciate labels within a block

vlookup	sumifs
i hope all of this is clear
i am trying to do a vlookup that pulls the accurate cell phone checks per status all star noob etc. into my coffee beans table
i figured the vlookup would get me there in combination with sumifs perhaps ...went down the index match route but don t think thats what i need

26953798
sorting	filtering
just don t pass in the sorting parameters and it will sort by score using indexsearcher.search query filtering int you could also pass in a sort instance that sorts on relevance using the sort.relevance constant if you prefer

26953832
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
your current code takes the second through fifth elements of the arrays quiz for midterm which happen to be the second through fifth arrays of integers not the second through fifth integers in each arrays in quiz
how this works is a condensed version of a for-loop
for example the above code is the same as the following which pretty much iterates through all of the elements in quiz and takes the two and the one and the five for the separate arrays

26953869
decltype	auto
a generic lambda looks like return type deduction for normal functions looks like the semantics for decltype auto are described in the following example from n3638 if the placeholder is the decltype auto type-specifier the declared type of the variable or return type of the function shall be the placeholder alone

26953887

26953911
implements	extends
the interface of isuperadmin applies to whatever extends a class that implements it

26953923
put	get
the compiler complains because file is a string not a character
in other words getfolderpath is returning something like c files morefiles while you put in files
if you iterate through that you will get c then then then f an so on

26953966
move	drag
tap drag the screen the label move up and down to match the position of the finger

26953980
int	double
or better yet use double and double.parse
i ll assume you re getting a compile time error because of the following line the return type of int.parse is int but your trying to assign it to a variable of type string
change the type of baseoftriangle and heightoftriangle to int and that will solve your problem

26954050
int	double
based on the accepted answer i had hoped to create a ratio template class that would simply produce the ratio of two int s as a constexpr double and specialize it for parameters of 0 0

controller and model partial view after reading this post i replaced with i was able to access the values through the formcollection with but i cant get them into my model

26954284
memcached	apc
that means it has to be parsed by php on read which is probably slower unless you use a php bytecode cache like apc
neither solution will be as fast as something like memcached since they both read from the filesystem instead of memory but they should provide an optimization for slow database queries that are run often
edit as kiran madipally pointed out it should be easy create your own phpfastcache driver by extending cacheprovider

26954293
getter	setter
you need getter and setter on your properties as your method signature is public partialviewresult index testmodel model the defaultmodelbinder initializes a new instance of testmodel then attempts to set the value of its properties based on the posted values but cant do so because your properties do not have setter

26954378
primes	palindrome
another important thing is to look for the distribution of primes and palindrome numbers

26954486
fadein	hide
it s because #popup is already visible and you are trying to fadein hide it first and then try fadein after 5s delay

if you use binaryencode on your query column and convert the binary to hex you can see it is the same value

26954647
udp	tcp
a particular socket is uniquely identified by a 5-tuple a list of 5 particular properties. those properties are source ip address destination ip address source port number destination port number transport protocol usually tcp or udp these parameters must be unique for sockets that are open at the same time

26954647

inherited	subclassing
in the case subclassing is lexically inclosing class for test by inherited

26954913
subclass	superclass	subclass	superclass
on the other hand a superclass constructor is always executed before a sub-class constructor
therefore creating an instance of subclass requires calling first the constructor of test which requires calling first the constructor of subclass.inner but subclass.inner cannot be initialized before its containing instance
i believe that in order to satisfy the condition you quoted the superclass inner must be enclosed by a superclass of test

26954935
ssl	https
one of them used and when i tried that the exception was the underlying connection was closed could not establish trust relationship for the ssl tls secure channel. i deployed to my server which is https and still the same response

26954940
int	double
multiplication by double factor can be replaced by multiplication by int and shifting right

26954948
stdout	stderr
your grep invocation will then be able to see it
you need to redirect to stdout before you can pipe like that
those messages go to stderr by default rather than stdout

26954948
stdout	stderr

it must be possible to make the default var mog app_engine local folder available to the virtualbox vm by changing the permissions and thus there would be no need to hack into google-cloud-sdk python files
however i haven t had the time to test that yet

your definition of exp and interpret are not fully visible and not sure i understand what you are trying to represent but here s 2 ideas try to use operator overloading defining a + and a - methods for more dsl-esque operations even better so you can think of the addition subtraction or any other operation as bahaviours and define them as functions

the fact that the unresolved symbol has 12 in its name means that the compiler is expecting that mpi_file_seek is an stdcall function
stdcall is mainly used for dll functions and only on x86 x64 uses a different calling convention similar to fastcall
if you are linking against the 64bit import library of ms-mpi the decorated symbol won t be found in the library and such an error will occur

it helps to understand if we split the code into smaller functions def chr2int i return ord i - 65 this is for mapping uppercase letters to int starting from 0
example 65 is the decimal code of the uppercase letter a rot adds k to a number n modulo 26 def rot n k return n + k 26 26 is the number of all letters from a to z example int2chr performs the inverse function of chr2int - converts the integer back to a letter

cells	tablecell
to understand how this column is being configured you need to understand that there is a separation between the data displayed in the table and the view of the data the presentation of the data to the user
in javafx for complex ui controls such as tables trees and lists the view of the data is represented by a cells
the cells factory that you set on a column tells javafx how to create a tablecell from the data displayed in the cells - it s essentially a function that creates tablecell s when needed

the cells factory that you set on a column tells javafx how to create a tablecell from the data displayed in the cells - it s essentially a function that creates tablecell s when needed

what this all comes down to css html javascript a working example in js fiddle this jsfiddle will just work fine in ie and firefox showing two columns as it should
but in google-chrome it just shows 1 big column with a lot of whitespace below it
what i think is the problem google-chrome seems not to respect the new container height when calculating how li elements should be distributed over the columns

26958705
google-chrome	firefox
interestingly if i remove the multicolumn class from the div with id divmulticolumn and then manually reapply the class using the inspect element function then google-chrome does work as i would expect and it will distribute the content over the two columns just like ie and firefox do. if i use js to mimic the removal and reapply of the multicolumn class then this doesn t work see commented out javascript bits in the fiddle

i have the following class hierarchy the rule of deserialization is if eventtype 0 then deserialize to a initevent if eventtype 0 then deserialize to a recoevent out of the box the jackson deserialization will not work because it does not know which class to deserialize with
one way to handle that is by doing as follows on the base class the problem of this solution is assumes the client will serializable with the same mapper since the class element needs to be present now in the json
my client will not send the extra class element in the incoming json

dictionary	map
supported containers std map std multimap std unordered_map std unordered_multimap wxhashmap qmap qmultimap qhash qmultihash etc
usage here is a similar implementation by using a wrapper class which is more similar to the method get of dictionary type in python usage

allocator	stl
from user s point of view it means that there s no dependency on c++ runtime libstdc++ or similar which may be handy in constrained and embedded environments. from nanomsg developer s point of view it makes life easier. number of memory allocator is drastically reduced as intrusive containers are used instead of c++ stl containers. the above also means less memory fragmentation less cache misses etc. more discussion on the c vs

folder	directory
i have even more nested folder structure but it works well for me and hope it helps you
the gist is to build all css js to another folder and copy assets files relatively to this new folder
let give build name for it root build application.css - minified application.js - minified fonts ... img ... ... index.html ... using grunt-contrib-copy plugin copy all your assets to build assets directory without breaking their original structure

folder	directory
let give build name for it root build application.css - minified application.js - minified fonts ... img ... ... index.html ... using grunt-contrib-copy plugin copy all your assets to build assets directory without breaking their original structure
so relative passes for your css saves fonts are still in . fonts folder
the problem you ll faced to with such approach is saving folder structure for assets

maven	pom.xml
this also allows you to use a continuous integration server like jenkins or hudson
imho the only really repeatable way to do this is to make the official maintained build a stand-alone one maven gradle and to have no dependency in your project or your version control system on any ide whatsoever
so for instance if you set up and maintain your build in maven and use only external dependencies no jars in your lib directory then both eclipse and intellij and netbeans etc. can load the pom.xml and build the code

filtering	grouping
you have an index on the grouping and the logdt columns and this is good so i believe that this query will be quite fast select grouping min logdt from table as t grouping by t.group but since you are filtering by item 59 and you don t have an index on the item column your query will be slow i suspect that your first query is fast because grouping gr1 contains fewer items than other grouping but if you try to filtering by other grouping eg

try-catch	exception-handling
you can use a finally block to ensure that the file is closed no matter what or better a closing context
the fact is that you are constructing the file object and using it in two different try-catch blocks
so if this fails no value will be assigned to fout the first catch will handle the exception-handling and the excution will continue with fout.write bytewave

26959870
try-catch	exception-handling
first of all wrap the two operations in the same try-catch block this piece of code has still a problem if write fails and an exception-handling is thrown close will never be called

int	chars
the format breaks down as follows marks the start of the format specifier 0 indicates zero-padding for numerical values 12 indicates the minimum field-width x specifies that the conversion type should be hexadecimal so the result will be a string at least twelve chars long zero-padded if necessary and converted to hexadecimal format
the getnode function returns a 48-bit positive int
it is then converted to hexadecimal format using string formating

for-loop	arrays
the most efficient method may depend on the number of rows in the array. methods that use map or a for-loop to handle each row separately are good if the number of rows is not too large but if there are lots of rows you can do better by using a numpy trick to handle the entire arrays with one call to np.unique

26960239
disk	ram
this is not a good idea because the layered filesystem is slower than a regular filesystem and you won t be wanting any of the features of layering or snapshotting on your transactional data
the documentation on managing data explains how to mount regular disk so it is accessible from your containers

26960239
disk	ram
edit after more information was supplied d using up ram implies the containers are still running

width	margin
the window decoration is only relevant when postioning windows
the resize and setgeometry functions always exclude the window frame so it doesn t need to be factored in when calculating the total width
the difference between resizing a widget within a layout versus resizing a top-level window is that the latter needs to take account of the layout margin

sudo	passwd
if you have a bunch of users who should all have super user privileges rather than giving everyone the root passwd you add them to the sudoers file then when somebody changes something that required super user rights you will know who it was
firstly sudo does not come by default with all distributions
debian which ubuntu and mint and a ton of other popular distros are based on does not install sudo out the box

according to apple s docs on swift and objective-c type compatibility the answer is no when you create a swift class that descends from an objective-c class the class and its members properties methods subscripts and initializers that are compatible with objective-c are automatically available from objective-c

26960747
nsviewcontroller	nscolor
it s of course also possible to do this in the nsview -subclass itself in awakefromnib for example you could change the color and the size of the cursor by adapting the nscolor and the nssize cursorsize
remember to call removetrackingrect on the nsview when you re done with the cursor at latest when the nsviewcontroller is deallocating
see apple doc for nscursor for how to work with cursors in cocoa

you cannot do if you haven t initialised the board variable properly. you are trying to execute next line and what javascript would do is first it will try to get which will be undefined then it will try to do which will fire the error undefined is not an object you should first put some data into your board array before running that loop

ng-show	ng-hide
of course i added an ng-hide to the loading indicator triggered by this function

this function will be run when to check if the span element should be displayed

uinavigationcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
i did all of this in code in the viewdidload of mainvc in your segmenttapped method you can trigger the pageviewcontroller to swap from firstvc to secondvc or vice versa if you implement the uipageviewcontroller s delegate and datasource methods you can even have swipe gestures to switch pages
assume you have a viewcontroller mainvc embedded in a uinavigationcontroller and mainvc has the segmented control
when the first segment is selected you want firstvc viewcontroller presented and secondvc for the second segment

int	double	int	chars	unsigned	short
the standard specifies the different int types with strictly decreasing ranks as long long int long int int short int chars furthermore all the other types are by default signed whereas chars is either signed or unsigned depending on the implementation
all the types have both signed and unsigned versions. the standard furthermore defines the real types as long double double float the way i m reading the standard is that if we have are adding a + b and a is a real type and b is any int type then b is converted to the type of a
in other words it doesn t matter what the rank of the int type is it s the real type that specifies what real type the int type is converted to

26961636
inherited	properties
it s a completely empty object nothing inherited from any .prototype inclusing object.prototype so you can be guaranteed that any properties lookup will only succeed if the properties was explicitly added to the object

stdio	fflush
since each line is only about 50-100 bytes long this creates a lot of system call overhead
we can instead open a stdio handle around our descriptor and use fprintf to write to it

hash	salt	hash	md5
by providing their password in password-recovery email your password is p 55word or over the phone you may expose much of their online existence
i do not use mysql often but you can md5 hash on the database side as shown here mysql md5 select
further if you salt the hash add your own string like sodium to the hash that is not exposed anywhere so long as it s the same salt for the user each time you greatly increase the security as databases of straight hashes of entire dictionaries exist

trie	tree	trie	tree
if you have a very large number of refs this is quite inefficient as you end up doing a large number of comparisons with uninteresting bits of the ref tree we know that all of refs tags is uninteresting in the example above yet we check each entry in it
instead let s take advantage of the fact that we have the packed refs stored as a trie of ref_entry structs
we can find each component of the proposed refname as we walk through the tree checking for d f conflicts as we go

width	margin
with your layout the easiest way is for all s leave horizontalalignment center set width to some identical value like 160 smarter for all s change horizontalalignment to stretch set their margin s left and right to some identical value like 10 0 10 0 or if you don t like setting that margins per-button or any other per-button settings you may put into grid.resources a style with some setter s that will set all the buttons

post	get
you d still get the padding from both sides of the image view unless you added custom code to zero out the left edge padding on the image view when the image is empty
to follow up on almo s post create a second variant of your custom table view you could make it a subclass of your custom table view class
that way you don t have to duplicate code

int	double	multiplying	division
another way to fix this problem is to force c++ to use floating point division by making one or both numbers a floating point constant specifically a constant of type double by appending .0 to them for example
this is because you multiplying by 5 9 which is zero due to int division
if you change parentheses like this you would get the correct result

boost	stl
if so can someone post an example of how to replace a stl function
i would like to replace std sort with boost sort to compare the performance between them
a colleague recommended that i create a shared library with a re-definition of std sort that calls boost sort and then simply use ld_preload to bring in the new shared library and therefore override std sort

26964027
width	height
however the width and the height will increase

26964027
width	height
so in short you can just replace the width crop.w and height crop.h used while scaling by those obtained when calculating the bounding box bbox.w and bbox.h keep in mind that the coordinates obtained on the last two lines only work in the rotated coordinate system

26964183
width	height
the resulting width and height of the window are automatically enlarged if either of dimensions is less than the minimum size as specified by the previous call to the setminimumsize method

here is a way to do it given the standard slider markup with min max and initial value set as you specified on pagecreate insert a relatively positioned div into the slider track and then set its dimensions on the change event of the slider the css for the highlight makes sure the div uses relative positioning sets the height to 100 of the track sets the background color and initializes the width to 0

26964414
let	curry
that s why swift is complaining
let s write some incomplete definitions for the terms in your question non-curried two-argument function a function that takes two arguments and returns some value
example curry two-argument function a function that takes one argument and returns another function that takes one argument and returns some value

26964441
google-chrome	firefox
only google-chrome exhibits this kind of behaviour you will not see this in firefox or ie
and this case is only for an empty input field in google-chrome
if you are using a placeholder text for the input box then there will not be any issue with the alignment

26964493
bash	subshell
you can remove only the 10 digit prefix from filenames fairly easily using character classes and string indexes input output when working in bash it is generally more efficient and better suited to use the tools that bash provides rather than spawning subshell calling 3rd party tools like grep and cut

26964721

it doesn t trigger the mousemove event continuely.but when i use onxx it works
i know addeventlistener can add a lot of handlers onxx just have one handler.and addeventlistener can remove the handler.but one thing i can t understand is why when i use onxx my console get log correctly.but when i use addeventlistener i can t get mousemove event proper
when i use addeventlistener i press my mousedown then i move the mouse

26964873

26965077
getter	setter
the property syntax lets you declare a combination of a getter and a setter in a short syntax

26965077
getter	setter
properties support an alternative way of invoking getter and setter methods in objective-c in addition to the standard you can write it is not necessary to declare properties to use the dot syntax you can call any value-returning method with no arguments or a setter method with a single argument using dot syntax

26965080
getter	setter
according to the conventions the underlying instance variables should be prefixed with _ if you do not declare them the compiler does that for you but be careful in case you override both the getter and the setter you need to add this kind of statements in the .m file because in that case the compiler will not generate the _width ivar on your behalf

26965105
bash	subshell
when working in bash try to utilize the tools bash provides and get away from using external applications and pipes which each spawn a separate process and subshell of their own such as grep awk cut and |
there is virtually nothing bash can t do as far as string line parsing goes utilizing its own parameter expansion substring extraction substring substitution and string indexes
there is nothing wrong with calling external apps from within a script just don t use them to replace what bash already does for you

26965138
udp	tcp
unlike tcp a udp read is an all-or-nothing operation either a whole udp message is read or an error occurs there is no in-between

26965138
packets	pcap
you cannot access the packets headers
that being said you can get the packets s source ip port at least via the abinding.peerip and abinding.peerport properties of the onudpread event
however there is no way to retrieve the other packets header values nor should you ever need them in most situations unless you sniff the network yourself such as with a pcap library

you could then replace stdin in the function with fp and read from any open file stream
i apologize i meant to post an example to replace your getstring function last night
below is a simple example of a function fgetsinput you can use to get input from stdin using fgets that will greatly improve security vulnerability of your code

26965543

cpython	pypy
try using pypy if possible
for some compute intensive tasks it is dozens of times faster than cpython if there are a lot of duplicate ints in the file it can surprisingly be faster to use a dict mapping than int as it saves the time to create new int objects
first step is to profile as nathancahill suggests in the comments

folder	directory
you can use this simple function to delete folder recursively notes unlink is for a file .git is a directory so it won t remove use rmdir

26967264
set	bag
don t know to much about this but i know that it has something to do with bag of features.
just use matchfeatures function iterative and set up a ratio of number of features matched over the number of features in a training set
final question i need some direction toward my objective

int	double
for more complicated functions you may want to create separate overloads for double and and or float and long double etc
c++ is a strongly typed language and the literal 1 is always an int
the determination you ask about might be relevant when converting text.

jruby	mri
the c drivers use the mri api which is not supported in jruby you need to setup the jdbc adapter which does the same using native java apis for mysql gem mysql2 platform mri gem jdbc-mysql platform jruby gem activerecord-jdbc-adapter platform jruby note as of the time of this answer rails 4.2 is not supported with ar-jdbc they did a lot of internal ar refactorings that might take a while to finish up

this is my first post. i am trying to create a mailto link using templated javascript that takes the following excerpt from a json object where +menu.menu i .link+ is replaced by mailto mrlevitas yahoo.com when i click on the page nothing happens in either google-chrome or firefox

26968058
for-loop	loops
further a dict ionary of set s could be definitely is a better data structure for your use case a for-loop can be more efficient if you skip further comparisons after a match edit and provides also an easy way to compute the total number of matches that the op s program accumulates during its loops this detail just slipped my mind... another thing that you may want to do is sanitize known_adj

26968075
super	abstract	super	abstract
there is still no abstract keyword so you would have to supply either default behaviour or throw an exception in your base class - but the protected keyword allows you to override the base class implementation the private keyword does not allow this in the current version of typescript
as of typescript 1.3 you can use the protected keyword and late binding so you don t have to pass the method to the super class
there is still no abstract keyword so you would have to supply either default behaviour or throw an exception in your base class - but the protected keyword allows you to override the base class implementation the private keyword does not allow this in the current version of typescript

26968078
copying	overwrite
as per the design rule of string concatination you need to remove or replace or overwrite the terminating nul and add the second string
to avoid the terminating nul apperaing in the output string do not increment the pointer when it reaches nul instead start copying the next string from that particular location itself
check the below code

26968162
folder	directory
this content type has a setting called override the default page size where you can define your own page size
the termpartsettings are in the modules orchard.taxonomies settings folder
the termpart itself is in the modules orchard.taxonomies models directory

this code might help you on right clicking on specific 1 no default browser menu opens 2 show hide edit link on clicking on document both left and right 1 hide edit link can be changed accordingly try it here

26968262
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that the last option of just copying elements over is 7x faster in google-chrome 10x faster in ie11 and even more of a difference in firefox

26968357
put	get
for example this cancel winrt combobox infinte scroll effect or the problem with this solution is that you get a weird behaviour on the first item in the combobox. how to reproduce create a new blank windows 8.1 app in mainpage.xaml put create a style.xaml resource dictionary like this now start the app select an item down the list for example 05 minutes then select the first item in the same dropdown for example 00 minutes

hide	show
design the child views with in the container view controller . apply business logic in your main view controlle r to show and hide the child views accordingly

26968484
jruby	mri	jruby	mri
update twist ending this was a known bug in mri 1.9.2 and jruby s implementation mirrors that behavior
it may be a defect in jruby s implementation of __method__ or it may be a bug in the implementation of define_method or it may be strictly limited to the use of the two together
look what happens if you cast the proc object into a block by using the operator now in mri as before however in jruby it s fixed given the internal implementation of mri s define_method which includes the handling of proc arguments vs block arguments if jruby s is at all similar it s also possible that that is where the problem could lie

26968601
inherited	subclassing
if you don t that could be why you re getting that classcastexception because you re trying to cast your an activity instance getactivity to a subclassing of which it does not share any inherited relationship with onfragmentinteractionlistener

26968636
domxpath	domdocument
don t try to parse html with regex use domdocument and domxpath instead

26968665
yacc	bison
yacc --version bison bison 3.0.2 you can use this cmd to reproduce the problem cat tiger.y
i have written a yacc file according to tiger book appendix a tiger manual
but there are still some shift reduce conflicts

26968805
versioning	upgrade
buildroot-2011.02 libpng-1.4.5 autoconf-2.65 python-2.7.1 i am trying to upgrade libpng from version-1.4.5 to version-1.6.8
but the newer versioning of libpng requires autoconf 2.68 or higher
if i update autoconf to 2.68 python 2.7.1 fails which requires older versioning of autoconf

26968809
getter	setter
the entity i m using at the moment looks like this i am using magic setter getter to expose protected properties __set __get to receive the data i am using the following query the result with the given dataset will be id name leftid rightid parentid depth 3 cat#1.1 2 3 1 1 this is exactly the result that i want to have in the doctrine entity but cannot find a solution to get the entity as an doctrine object

26968959
gruntjs	yeoman
i m also using bower gruntjs and yeoman that s due to work i m not quite used to these maybe there s also a problem. the strange behavior is i wanted to retrieve the json data with a http.get and resolve it - all within a service so that i can hand out the data object from there to the main controller and won t have to resolve it there. strangely i didn t get any data it was empty or not readable

26968959
gruntjs	yeoman
strangely doing a little test-app without gruntjs yeoman and bower it worked

26969081
put	get
is there a way to get all dates between two dates without using any mysql table something like select date between 2012-02-10 and 2012-02-15 that would result in this out put date list 2012-02-10 ... 2012-02-15

portrait	landscape
create folder in res layout-land or layout-port layout-port layout for widget that must change for portrait orientation layout-land layout for widget that must change for landscape orientation

26969193
int	chars
probably the best way to do it will be equals but it s best to ignore whitespaces i m not quite sure how you split your string but for example if you have a chars op and two int a and b

26969285
ubuntu	debian
so using debian s or ubuntu s pip is guaranteed to have bugs

26969459
mapr	cloudera
essentially it is the same hadoop and same map-reduce jobs running on top of with covered with tons of marketing that causes the confusion and questions like yours
here s the diagram of the components they have in their distribution for stream processing on top of mapr you can use apache spark streaming apache flume apache storm - it depends on the task you need to solve yes it is commercial licensed per-node basis as far as i know
you can easily contact their sales guys they would be glad to explain the prices and terms just like the other hadoop distributions but personally i would prefer fully open-source platform rather than proprietary mapr-fs but its up to you to choose no because apache hadoop is part of many commercial distributions cloudera mapr hortonworks pivotal etc

26969525
inherited	properties
i m just telling you to define every feature that should be considered before deciding what tools you re going to use ie how are you going to write code which components to use etc
there are other approaches you can experiment create a customsplitcontainer that inherited from splitcontainer
then handle the ui inside by adding public methods and function and properties and events

26969525
mouse	keyboard
upon instanciation addhandler is very usefull to capture mouse and keyboard inputs handle custom drag drops etc

26969608

try to register the same renderer also for int and double

26969712
bower	npm
i would like to install version 1.3.9 of bower with npm. i have tried the following sudo npm uninstall -g bower successful sudo npm install -g bower#1.3.9 even though bower re-installs correctly the version remains at the latest version 1.3.12 not at the desired 1.3.9

26969742
post	put
yes change all the code that does it the wrong way
here s a post on using the delegated form of .on instead of .live
third a work-around would be to put all your initialization code that hooks up these event handlers into a single function or called by a single function

26969742
put	get
if you put some event handlers in there that should not be in there then you may get duplicate event handlers installed

26969749
width	height
reason2 since you dont have height and width absolute positioning inside relative div causes overlapping

26969804
getter	setter
something like this is just getter and setter for a string tabfragmantb. this will return you the tag of the fragment to which you are sending data lets call it fragment b .so the code in fragment b will look something like this write it in the oncreateview section itself

26970038
folder	directory	folder	dir
change the build options to .. build meant the build directory was created in the parent dir
is the parent dir means recursively copy all files and files of descendent folder


26970043
gridview	rowdatabound
you can use rowdatabound event of gridview

26970446
onresume	onpause
we can t perform such kind of operation in android because while your dialog is open at that time your activity is in onpause mode and the most forground view is your dialod you must have to go back in your activity view means start onresume oncreate then after you perform your task for open the second dialog

26970589
hide	show
inside filechooser dialog there should be an context menu item to show hide them but you can t control this option from application for example here is how it looks on linux

26970640
post	get
connect the front-end and the web-service by means of get and post http requests

26970719
margin	height	margin	height
i want to remove the height of the border which exceeds the top and bottom of the text
see the screenshot i have tried several mothds for example wrapping the paragraph in a div and setting the negative margin but doesnt seem to work
here s simple css demo edit the line height should not be changed

26970744
osx	yosemite
i m using delphi xe7
i m trying to compare two strings on osx in a case insensitive way using ansisametext
this used to work fine but on osx yosemite this behaves strange if the preferred language of osx is set to dutch system preferences - language region - preferred languages - nederlands dutch

26970789
content-length	content-type
i wrote a php script to migrate from oauth1 to oauth2 using curl the headers are right and the form-data is also right but the response is always and here s the verbos of curl post o oauth2 token http 1.1 host accounts.google.com accept authorization oauth oauth_consumer_key mykey.com oauth_nonce 1416228848 oauth_signature_method hmac-sha1 oauth_token 1 252fnzl27urrdqlwle oauth_timestamp 1416228848 oauth_version 1.0 oauth_signature qcx5mw 2buxuxsuyz7j7x8 content-length 230 content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded and the postfields contains the oauth2 data i tried it on more than one token and it s returning the same message

26970854
width	height
the font objects have a method getsize text that returns a tuple width height

26970970
setinterval	settimeout
you can store your timeout in a variable in an accessible scope and then clear it on the click of a button
if your ajax request fails or is prolonged for any reason setinterval will keep making a new request
since you are making an ajax request every so often what you should be doing is using settimeout within the callback function which will make a new request only when the last is complete

26970987
public	protected
digging through the javafx source i found that the actual method called when you click tableview columns divider is it s declared in com.sun.javafx.scene.control.skin.tableviewskinbase method signature protected abstract void resizecolumntofitcontent tc tc int maxrows since it s protected you cannot call it from tableview.getskin but you can always extend the tableviewskin overriding only resizecolumntofitcontent method and make it public

26971002
cdr	cons	cdr	cons
to add an element to the end of the list replacd modifies the cdr of list-tail to add a new cons and list-tail is updated to point to the new cons
when the loop terminates the result is the cdr of list-head
because the list appending algorithm becomes easier when list-tail is always a pointer to the last cons of the list

26971026
post	get
i ve read in another post that it would eventually get called when tcp detects loss of connectivity but it s not in the timely manner that i need as the default for firefox i believe is 10 minutes and i don t really want to go around hundreds of computers about config changing this value

26971079
elasticsearch	kibana
i ve setup the elasticsearch logstash kibana log viewing tools on my systems

26971325
qlocalsocket	qtcpserver	qlocalsocket	qtcpsocket
functionally it may appear to require a network as the concepts are similar to qtcpsocket but in reality no network is required
as the docs state for qlocalsocket on windows this is a named pipe and on unix this is a local domain socket
if applications are running on different machines then i suggest using qtcpserver which has a similar functional interface as qlocalserver and qlocalsocket

26971350
ng-view	ng-hide
to fix it just change ng-if to ng-show ng-hide and all will work well
just want to add one more case when controller can init twice this is actual for angular.js 1.3.1 in this case route.current will be already set when ng-view will init
that cause double initialization

26971350
ng-show	ng-hide
to fix it just change ng-if to ng-show ng-hide and all will work well

26971373
margin	border-box	box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	border-box
i thought bootstrap 3 used box-sizing border-box so when i tried to add a margin class to the 2 box-sizing border-box they stack on top of each other instead of sitting next to each other from sm upwards in size

26971430
box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	border-box
border-box the width and height properties include the padding and border but not the margin. ... source mdn to simulate margin you can use border with the same colour as the background
the box-sizing border-box
property doesn t include margin in the size of the elements

26971430
width	margin
property doesn t include margin in the size of the elements
it includes border width and paddding
that is why they don t stay inline

26971430
width	height	width	border-box	width	margin	margin	height	margin	border-box	height	border-box
border-box the width and height properties include the padding and border but not the margin. ... source mdn to simulate margin you can use border with the same colour as the background

26971438
post	put
then just name the update route
your form states to use post but you don t have a post route configured
the rails way to do this is to submit the form to the update path via put since you are updating a record also you probably want to use path instead of url

26971491
folder	directory
i currently save the user uploaded photos on a directory that is outside the flask folder on openshift image currently saving in the data folder under app-root data and the flask files are in app-root repo

26971501
gruntjs	grunt-contrib-watch
obviously i can configure all rest and socket calls from client to server so that they use some sort of prefix during development and deploy client and server on different ports on 127.0.0.1 or some other stuff like that while changing it in production to be the same server
after looking around and not finding a proper answer the closest and kind of incomplete is this gruntjs livereload with node.js application i decided to ask
given node app client + server with express desired ability to start the above app using node-dev or supervisor so that changes to server files reload the server ability to configure grunt-contrib-watch so that changes to client files reload the browser unless it was clear from the above - both server and client are deployed with the same express server issues attempts despite trying various permutations of watch connect parallel concurrent and more the main issue remains - inability to inject livereload script into the same domain port express started on

26971510
width	height
your problem is css-related you aren t setting height and width of elements correctly

26971565
bluetooth	usb
i though about instead of streaming the audio over wifi to use bluetooth or usb

26971645
switching	screens
however i would like the task to start when the app is suspended either via a home screens button press or an app switching and i would like it to stop when the app is resumed

26971702
pdfbox	itext
you have tagged this as an itext itextpdf question yet you are using pdfbox

26971715
for-loop	arrays
for that you can use an nsmutablearray and add the matching arrays inside the for-loop

26971740
postgresql	mysql
where to store those results because the storage engine should support filtering by position
postgresql using the postgis plugin and mongodb are good candidates for geosearches
mysql does implement basic geo functions too albeit it doesn t scale too well when dealing with several thousand points which filters to offer using which controls what backend to receive and process those filters and deliver the matching results what mapping library to use to visualize those matching results as you see the only part when you use google maps api v3 is the last one and the limited set of functionalities you need for this project makes me think that if there s any chance you ll surpass the free tier in terms of request per hour or per day you ll be better off with a simpler free alternative like leaflet

26971776
put	get
can you supply some examples to help me figure how put this together to get the following output thank you in advance

26971816
width	height
here is a swift class that will help return the correct sizing for an image based on a width or height limit that you choose

26971835
stdout	stderr
file redirection is something happens to the files your program receives already open normally stdin stdout and stderr

26971852
google-chrome	firefox
remember that you must perform the controls server side because every user is able to alter the html dom with firebug or firefox devtools google-chrome devtools etc... or simply forging a request ad-hoc without even visiting your page and enabling the fields you have disabled

26971908
icmp	tcp
a typical implementation will use icmp echo requests if the privilege can be obtained otherwise it will try to establish a tcp connection on port 7 echo of the destination host

26971936
squash	branch
you can skip tracking a remote branch by specifying the last n commits you want to squash

26971936
squash	branch
if you have 4 commits in your branch and you want to squash the last 3 commits effectively making a single commit you can do git rebase -i head 4

26971974
int	chars
you probably wanted to use something of the form a not equal to b
second getchar returns an int value
if you try to store the return value in a chars container you may find that it will never be equal to eof

26971977
pidcrypt	phpseclib
i m willing to change libraries if needbe but currently im trying this keys php code using phpseclib just echoing empty text the plaintext variable is data encrypted via the pidcrypt website using those keys

26971992
folder	directory
i want to upload files to home root directory of the server not into a folder

26971993
folder	dir
for each file in the indicated folder if a file with the same name does not exist in the parent folder remove from child dir command is used instead of if exists to avoid false positive match with folder names delete operations are only echoed to console

26972094
inherited	properties
i ve created a custom iconbutton class that inherited from button and adds a few dependency properties to place an image in front of the button s text

26972159

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have a html site.the issue is favicon not working in google-chrome but it worked well in firefox safari

26972411
sorting	filtering
see fusiontablequery google places see placesearchrequest google maps engine i m not sure you can filtering by radius on the client side tho see mapsenginelayer now since you re already planning to save your data to a database you don t really need to rely on google maps api embedded functions
you can query the database yourself and deal with the results later in the form of markers for example any geo enabled database will allow you to search for radius specifying the center radius and optionally sorting by distance
if you wanted to search say all the records within a 1000m distance from lng 30 lat 70 iin mongodb it would be something like whereas in postgresql with postgis it would be something like edit oh and i don t understand why would you save radiuses in the db

26972428
public	protected
to allow derived class access parent member you need to specify protected or public

26972527
getter	setter
for instance if i only wanted the symbol could i only have that data member as long as it s setter and getter

26972641
client-side	server-side
that being said there are many reasons why you should rather split your project into several modules with one module containing only client-side code and producing javascript and associated resources through the gwt compiler and one with only server-side dependencies

26972706
bottle	cherrypy
the cherrypy microframework has a webserver with builtin ssl-support as you see here bottle on cherrypy server + ssl

26972712
cout	cin
on top of this i have to work with constraints such as not changing anything in the header file and not being able to use any std library function besides std string and std cout cin

26972752
subclass	inherited	subclass	superclass
back them out if you don t like them
your question sounds like a case of class subclass
in object modeling the design uses the fundamental mechanism of inherited and the design pattern of subclasses that extend and revise superclass

26972760
daemons	systemd
files and directories will be created for the user and group root except the process in questions drops root privileges
usually it is best to have a dedicated user for any daemons so you should use mongodb as this is the user created by the ubuntu and 10gen packages
now we need to make sure that there is no mongod running we want to kill all mongod processes and since the only user capable of killing processes which might belong to a different user than himself is root we tell the systemd to execute this command with root privileges we make sure that all the files and directories belong to the proper user we want to change the owner and the group of all directories below var lib mongodb recursively to user mongodb and group mongodb and we need the according privileges to do so we remove the lockfile as user mongodb next we will run the repair command as user mongodb note that the -u mongodb is crucial for your systemd to work properly after the repair

26972898
gif	png
so in addition to the image and image jpeg packages i also had to import image png and image gif only to register their respective decoders

26972898
gif	png
package main import image image jpeg i wanted to export the images as jpeg _ image png _ image gif ... the relevant documentation from the image package decoding any particular image format requires the prior registration of a decoder function

26973001
folder	directory
go to folder bld debug platforms android res and create a new folder named drawable-nodpi 4
add my splash.9.png file in this folder 5
build deploy application subsequent clean or rebuilds will delete this directory

26973048
xslt	xquery
by default i would start by writing it in the most programmer-efficient language available typically xquery or xslt and only resort to a lower-level language if you can t achieve the performance requirements that way

26973053
mousemove	mousedown
closest you can get is and call it from mousedown and mousemove event handlers private sub progressbar1_mousemove sender as object e as mouseeventargs handles progressbar1.mousemove changeprogress progressbar1 e end sub private sub progressbar1_mousedown sender as object e as mouseeventargs handles progressbar1.mousedown changeprogress progressbar1 e end sub it is workable you ll notice that getting to 100 is a bit awkward

26973084
decimal	ieee
results may also be surprising due to the inexact representation of decimal fractions in the ieee floating point standard r9 and errors introduced when scaling by powers of ten

26973085
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
you can probably set up a pointer arrays to make accesses easier to loops but then you re going to have initialize the arrays which will be similiar-looking but enable better run-time performance if that s your goal
no you can t use a for-loop index variable which only gets its value at run-time to build a compile-time symbol name like that
the symbol names are not available when the program runs when the for-loop executes so it doesn t make any sense

26973164
post	get
http post requests pass the data in the body of the request as serialised string of parameters in the same form as a get querystring

26973164
post	get	post	get
classic asp makes it easy to access these values with two collections request collections request.querystring - contains all parameters requested via the get request method
request.form - contains all parameters requested via the post request method
request - contains all parameters requested via either the get or post request methods

26973164
post	get
note - this method is less efficient because the parameter has be checked in both the querystring and form collections if you know where your data is coming from whether it s a get or post request it is best to use the corresponding collection

26973164
post	get
example usage if the following request is made get http 1.1 in the page default.asp the parameters can be accessed using either the request.querystring or request collections
if the following request is made post http 1.1 phone 12345 message test in the page default.asp the parameters can be accessed using either the request.form or request collections
jquery makes a really easy to pass this information the three properties you want to make sure are set correctly are

26973168
equals	gethashcode
try this to add to the answer from mapper this is the line that is probably breaking it you are creating a new object another solution is to override gethashcode and equals in ellipsexy

children	parent
step 2 sorting now that we have a bunch of documents which hold the parent_id and the number of children this parent has we sort it by the children field in descending -1 order
step3 limiting since we are only interested in the parent_id which has the most children we only let mongod return the first document after sorting

to have it called upon exit even if the program is terminated early such as with a call to exit
also the people in the comments of your post are right - the indices don t make much sense
they are technically valid but depending on your usage you may get a memory access violation due to buffer overflow trying to access memory beyond what is allocated for the array will give you junk data or more likely will crash your application entirely immediately if the os or hardware detects that the program is trying to use memory it doesn t own or later on if you broke the stack by writing something to it

range	minimum
you can follow this tutorial or find another one by yourself there are lots of it
if an object reaches the screen boundary from its inside when its x is in range 0 screenwidth and its y is in range 0 screenheight you can negate its speed in x or y direction depending on which boundary has been reached so it would go in the other direction like in an elastic collision with a wall
you can adjust speedx and speedy minimum and maximum values to see which give the most satisfying results

int	chars
so let s start with those that are generally available strings as list of chars codes mdash
int representing code points this representation is often the default prior to swi 7 it was the default in swi too
the biggest downside is that a list of arbitrary int can now be confused with text

any hints to point me in the right direction would be much appreciated

26974895
int	chars
use to tell the compiler that the narrowing conversion is safe
as id is an unsigned int the type of id 3 will also be an unsigned int
your compiler is helpfully warning you that unsigned chars which is 8 bits by the standard might be too small to receive the unsigned int which is at least 16 bits by the standard

26975121
affinity	processors
i am sorry to be the myth buster here but setting thread affinity has great importance and it grows in importance over time as the systems we all use become more and more numa non-uniform memory architecture by nature. even a trivial dual socket server these days has ram connected separately to each socket and the difference in access to memory from a socket to its own ram to that of the neighboring processors socket remote ram is substantial

26975121
affinity	processors
in the near future processors are hitting the market in which the internal set of cores is numa in itself separate memory controllers for separate groups of cores etc . there is no need for me to repeat the work of others here just look for numa and thread affinity online - and you can learn from years of experience of other engineers
not setting thread affinity is effectively equal to hoping that the os scheduler will handle thread affinity correctly
let me explain you have a system with some numa nodes processing and memory domains

26975121
cpu	affinity
when the thread is put back into running state it may be made runnable on any of the cores in the system as you did not set an affinity mask to it and the larger your system is the higher the chance it will be woken up on a cpu which is remote from the memory it previously allocated or used

centos	linux
my question is why is this code not working between across different versions of linux
the following code produces different results when run on different os in particular under fedora 14 centos 6.6 the final displayed value is miin under fedora 9 17 and centos 6.2 it is main
while i am sure there are numerous ways for achieving the final goal of main this code is deep inside a program that is failing and this is the test case that uses the internal function logic

26976031
int	boolean
try adding the values this works because boolean values inherit from int but it could be subject to abuse if someone passed int

26976106
strcpy	memmove
you could also use strrchr to find the rightmost slash followed by strchr to find the first dot after the slash but i think this approach would give me more headaches
the strcpy function causes undefined behaviour when the string you are copying overlaps the destination
in such cases you need to use memmove

26976106
strcpy	memmove
in such cases you need to use memmove
if you are unable to rewrite the function there s a quick fix that might be usable duplicating the string would make the strcpy non-overlapping otherwise i would strongly suggest that you rewrite the broken function
this is my suggestion briefly tested note that this code finds the first dot after the last slash which is what i would want while your code finds the last dot

26976109

xargs this gets the input in blocks of x items defined by -n x
then you can replace spaces with commas with tr or sed
paste this joins every 3 input and uses delimiter as separator

26976747
stdout	fflush
the only requirement is that std cerr have std basic_ios unitbuf set so that it will fflush at the end of each output function or a non-formatted output function
on the other hand unless you ve called std basic_ios sync_with_stdio false outputting to the c++ streams and outputting to the corresponding c streams std cout and stdout must have the same effects. in theory this can be done in several ways stdout functions can forward to those of std cout std cout output can forward to stdout or they can share some common buffer implementation under the hood
in practice practically all implementations have std cout forwarding to stdout

26976747
stdout	stderr
c specifies that stderr not be fully buffered and that stdout may be fully buffered only if it can be determined not to refer to an interactive device for some implementation defined meaning of interactive device

filtering	grouping
i have two corresponding arrays and the arrays correspond to filtering settings for a grouping of questions
the first array relates to the filtering title and the second array relates to the selection for each filtering - filtering value
there can be multiple selections for each filtering which is why there are duplicate instances of the filtering titles difficulty and specialty for example

26976954
filtering	grouping
i started off with the following ...which works fine if there is only one instance of each filtering title
however if there are multiple selections within a filtering the filtering title is output the same number of times as the filtering value
instead i d like to grouping the filtering values under one filtering title so instead of difficulty easy difficulty average difficulty hard ...i d get difficulty easy average hard

vsto	add-in
vsto + is suitable for large-scale team development + if you already have visual studio pro its free + good for com add-in ui development + microsoft product - performance of .net-interop is poor - still difficult to handle multiple excel versions - significant learning curve for vba user - no udf support excel dna + excellent udf performance xll-.net + suports both the com - interop and the xll interfaces + easy to use and deploy + use with or without visual studio + free and open source - not well documented but excellent support group you should also consider add-in express which like excel dna supports both the com interface and the xll interface and has many wizards for building things

temp	corrupt
some operating systems can help you avoid this by implementing a file-lock mutex system but on most operating systems you just get a corrupt file a crashed program or both
here s an interesting article talking about how to avoid race conditions in python one suggestion that the author makes is to copy the file to a temp file make your writes appends there and then move the file back
race conditions happen when files are kept open for a long time this way you are never actually opening the main file in python so the only point at which a collision could occur is during the os copy move operations which are much faster

pom.xml assembly.xml thanks in advance for any suggestions
using maven i want to create 1 a jar file for my current project with the current version included in the file name myproject-version.jar and 2 an overall artifact in tar.gzip format containing the project s jar file and all dependency jars in a lib directory and various driver scripts in a bin directory but without the version number or an arbitrary id in the name
i have this working somewhat using the assembly plugin in that if i use the below pom.xml and assembly.xml then when i run mvn package i can get a tar.gzip file with the jars and scripts included as desired however i don t seem to be able to get the naming versioning correct -- either i get both the project s jar file and the tar.gzip file with the version number or not depending on the build finalname used

uninstall	downgrade
as you confirmed code was running properly in version 2.43.0 to fix the issue downgrade the selenium package on your virtual machine using below pip commands first un-install selenium sudo pip uninstall selenium then install the working version - 2.43.0 after this your code should work on virtual machine also without any issue

multiplying	subtract
so lets say we have a list of 100 25 sum 2 multiplying 800 50 subtract sum should result in by the following steps i am trying to understand the structure of how to make this happen in particular how to iterate through the list and make appropriate actions not so much on the helper predicates that do the actual work sum multiple etc

26979104
post	get
here the model property makes a call to the store to get all posts
this.store.find post
replacing this call with a static array seems to work fine. this makes a call to the rails postscontroller s index function

26979104
post	put
the index function returns a variable with the activerecord post models
from here the post need to be json-ified for ember to be able to use it
so they are put through a serializer which here is post_serializer.rb

qstring	qdatetime
i d suggest using string formatting to create the filename qstring logpacketfile 1userid 2 - 3.log .arg logpacketspath .arg userid .arg qdatetime currentdatetime .tostring dd.mm.yy

26979222
int	chars	qstring	qdatetime	qstring	qfile
see next output ... userid f - 17.11.14.log note f not a 70 because operator+ thought that you use simple chars and 70 in chars is f so i strongly suggest you to use qstring number to prevent errors
convert int to qstring use qstring number
output with your current code output with qfile logpacketfile logpacketspath + userid + qstring number userid + - + qdatetime currentdatetime .tostring dd.mm.yy + .log

a common thing to do is to put such shared partials into a separate directory with a descriptive name i use shared
you can actually render partials from any folder
for example in users show.html.erb you can render a partial _info from say transactions

range	min	range	max
this is clearly the more concise idiom to adopt for this purpose
i ve tested your code with the same results but as i think about this i realize that there is an issue with the means by which you are using range
traits of the range type must be defined with min and max values found within trait_handlers.rangetype which equates to int long float

26979828
range	min	range	max
traits of the range type must be defined with min and max values found within trait_handlers.rangetype which equates to int long float
so you ll have to define an initial range using those types unless you want to replace traits.api.baserange which i don t think is a smart move
so you ll have to stick with these data types and do a little more manual work if you d like to tie changes to simple.minimum and simple.maximum to the bounds of your simple.ranged trait

your layout seem to be correct you just need to use android scaletype fitstart or centercrop instead of android adjustviewbounds true and set imageview width and height to match_parent or 320dp

getter	setter
since i m assuming that obj is a variable and not a property this is the equivalent but personally i find the if much easier to read note that if obj is just a variable then there are no side-effects when setting it to itself however if you try this with a property then you are invoking a getter and setter if myvar is null

accessing httpsession from httpservletrequest in a web socket serverendpoint
i am seeing very odd behavior with google-chrome and websockets with respect to httpsessions
it seems that in google-chrome each tabs has its own httpsession unlike firefox where they all share the same httpsession

26980233
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that in google-chrome each tabs has its own httpsession unlike firefox where they all share the same httpsession
but when to connect to a websocket from javascript in google-chrome inside a webpage the httpsession that is uses seems to be random or at least not always the one from the current page
the behavior i m seeing on the server tomcat is that sometimes the httpsession is null or an old session the server doesn t know anything about or the httpsession from another tab

this seems to be some kind of bug in google-chrome firefox never has any issues and always gives the httpsession from the page

free	malloc
if the architecture would have all instances of a plug-in share the same static data then at least from the standpoint of the plug-in architecture data which shouldn t be shared shouldn t be static
while it might arguably be better to have each instance store its static data in a block of space requested from the heap that would necessitate having each instance free up that block of space when it was done
having each plug-in instance allocate all its data on its stack including a suitable-sized that which would be subdivided to satisfy malloc or new requests prior to running user code would ensure that killing the thread associated with an instance would free up the storage associated with it

26980313

min	max
if you want to manually scale up and down you could set your max and min to a wide value and move desired capacity within it

26981343
accessor	properties
solution 1 - use element collections given that you are only using the indexed properties to specify the index locator you could define element collections instead
assuming that your page is something like you could define the page object as the two element collections are arrays meaning you can specify the index by using the method the problem with this solution is that you do not get the benefit of the different accessor methods
solution 2 - use xpath another option would be to use the xpath locator with the indexed_property the benefit of this is that you get the usual accessor methods created the disadvantage here is that you have to write xpaths which is not a big deal when it is simple

folder	directory
usually you want to have just one top-level directory that holds all of your code javascript stuff and your web page stuff
here s an example project structure project assets css style.css images javascript server.js views index.html in the example above project would be your main folder and inside of that you d have your server.js and then folder for your assets css javascript images and your views html pages
this is a fairly standard convention

build.gradle	gradlew
short answer yes you can using the sonarqube community intellij plugin long answer assuming you have a build.gradle like then you can run local sonar analysis with gradlew this will produce a sonar-report.json file now you have everything is needed by the plugin sonarqube server name your_server host url local analysis script name gradlew script script path to android-studio-example-project gradlew sonarrunner path to sonar-report.json path to android-studio-example-project build sonar sonar-report.json after the configuration is done you can see new issues by running the sonarqube new issues inspection inside intellij android studio i have used this project for an example and sonarqube server 4.0 with a squid only based rule set 4.4 failed to analyse a gradlew project

here is an example of the flow get products create user types in some information post products create validation fails re-display the form with warnings - user corrects the input post products create validation passes item is saved redirect using a get to products view 5 user refreshes the page this results in a harmless get products view 5 to issue a redirect you can use

hide	show
you can t append a div to a ul but you could easily move the account and nav li s using jquery s append as dfsq suggests however to my mind it would be better to have these items duplicated in the main menu but with a mobile-only classname that you then show hide in your media-queries css demo

26982340
free	malloc
you should define a pointer to char instead of the array and then call malloc in order to obtain the required memory
after you are done using that memory you must release it with free
here s a second version that uses memory on the heap things to note is sizeof char in this case which is always 1 and therefore often is omitted

26982340
realloc	malloc
the already allocated data stays in place even if the memory is not the same notes realloc null size behaves like malloc size

fullcalendar 2.2.0 adds momentjs as a dependent js link which is not a part of fullcalendar 1.x.x so copy and pasting what is available on the link above into your fullcalendar 1.x.x files will not work

downcasting	upcasting	upcasting	downcast

i am pretty sure i understand the general difference between upcasting and downcasting particularly in c++
i understand that we can t always downcast because casting a base class pointer to a derived class pointer would assume that the base class object being pointed to has all the members of the derived class

you can t get both the minimum and maximum in one line but you can get them with a simple loop this produces the values with the same complexity as min and max o n so linear complexity

jtable	jlabel
a cell renderer is responsible for creating a component which the cells actually display
the cell renderer component is not actually added to the jtable
the jtable just uses it to do painting. defaulttablecellrenderer creates jlabel so you can set their background and foreground colors freely

the reason is there are some files with same names in the meta-inf directory the content of the files is not the same - so there need to be different versions

2 i d like to avoid a for-loop in the code that loops through each files this cannot take advantage of concurrency and it complicates the makefile as the tar file is somewhat dynamic -- third parties can easily add files to it and i don t want to process the old files 3 i d like to avoid untarring while the makefile is doing parsing as that s just plain ugly i m wondering if it there s a simple way to create the dependency list dynamically and modify it after a rule is run

serializable	deserialization
slightly more c++ style serializable and deserialization is desribed in this article -

26983595
unsigned	short
it s an unsigned short actually the int keyword is optional for short or long declarations
the unsigned keyword may applied to all of these type declarations and makes them just unsigned

int	chars
the code can be saved to a file and run using awk -f script.awk f1 f2 explanation set the field separator to a comma surrounded by any number of white space chars when in the first file set the array key k to the string made up of the first four fields separated by the special variable subsep
use int to cast the numbers to their int value the array seen keeps a track of the keys that have been so far
save each field in the file into the array b once all records have been processed loop through the keys in seen split the keys on the delimiter subsep which we used earlier split returns the number of elements in the array c loop through each element and print the value loop from 5 to the maximum number of fields printing the alternate values from a and b things that need doing check whether and are different so the can be added replace

26984259
strsplit	substr
if you can change how you read the data then the loop could just be for each line in file.readlines your file name.txt ... next
if you have to use a string as input you can use strsplit to break it up into lines and process each line
substr can be used to extract the rest of the line - i ve just hardcoded the starting positions below

it s usually considered bad manners to modify the index of a for-loop from inside loops

26984356
serializable	deserialization
the setstring string string setter of the configuration classed is harnessed to achieve this task
the object that has to be shared across is serializable into a java string at the driver end and is de-serialized back to the object at the mapper or reducer
in the example code below i have used com.google.gson.gson class for the easy serialization and deserialization

26984356
serializable	deserialization
in the example code below i have used com.google.gson.gson class for the easy serializable and deserialization
you can use java serializable as well
class that represents the object you need to share the main class from where you can set the configurations the mapper class from where you can retrieve the object the bean is converted to a serialized json string using the tojson object src method of the class com.google.gson.gson

a dictionary is a map from keys to values

26984764
dictionary	map
a numpy array can also act as a map from keys to values
for example the dictionary is more flexible -- it s keys can be any hashable object
the array must be indexed by integers

26984764
for-loop	arrays	int	double
color was picked so the answer is easy to check. here is a benchmark showing rgb2vals which uses numpy indexing is much faster than using a double for-loop the first step is to reduce color to a 2-dimensional arrays by converting every r g b triplet to a single int now we do the same for the r g b triplet keys in the color2ind dict concatenate these two arrays and then use np.unique to find the inverse index uniq holds the unique values in int_colors and int_keys . index holds the index values such that once we have index we are golden

26984785
for-loop	loops
to change a for-loop into a while loops you ll have to set up the while loops to constantly check to see if the number and increment have passed the upper bound while increasing the increment each run through

innodb	myisam
all details are explained in the above links
no mysql doesn t lock innodb tables for queries that only read data from tables
this is only the case for old myisam tables where all readers must wait until the writer is done and vice versa

26985194
innodb	myisam
this is only the case for old myisam tables where all readers must wait until the writer is done and vice versa
for innodb tables they implemented multiversion concurrency control in mysql terminology it is called consistent nonlocking reads in short - when the reader starts the query the database makes a snapshot of the database at a point in time when the query was started and the reader the query sees only changes made visible commited up to this point in time but doesn t see changes made by later transactions
this allows readers to read data without locking and waiting for writers but still keeping acid there are subtle differences depending on the transaction isolation level you can find detailed description here in short - in read uncommited read commited and repeatable read modes all select statements that only read data selects without for update or lock in share mode clasues are performed in a nonlocking fashion

folder	directory
while i know the android os may decide to clear files from the cache directory of my application to free up internal storage space i m not quite sure if this cleanup process can happen even during its execution. if i could assume the os won t mess with the cached files during execution i would be able to use in memory data structures to optimize my cache implementation
for example i could use a map in memory of cached entries files stored on the cache folder containing time stamps of cache hits and other information that might be useful to prioritize the way cached entries are recycled
otherwise if i have to deal with the fact that the cache cleanup process may happen anytime anywhere even during app execution use of in memory data structures would be useless because they would eventually become out of sync with the real contents of the folder in the event of the os deciding to clean up files by itself

26986637
folder	directory
in which case my cache system would have to be less efficient because it would be forced to keep checking the contents of the cache folder directly in the file system everytime a new file is requested by the app. in other words i just want to know if i can assume the contents of the cache directory wont be changed by the os concurrently with my app because that might considerably change my cache implementation

26986781
waitpid	fork
note that after that loop you do you call fork again which will create a child which is not going to be handled by the loop
this code will make sure that all terminated children are removed as the flag suggests wnohang the waitpid function shall not suspend execution of the calling thread if status is not immediately available for one of the child processes specified by pid
ref so while you meet these kind of children you will execute the fprintf

26986821
mediarecorder	fileobserver
-- regarding 1. recording is actually stopped the recorded file is one second long but fileobserver is obviously only called much later namely after i explicitly call cameraview.stop
i tried to call stop directly on the mediarecorder passed in the event which works in android but not in cwac
-- regarding 1. i digged into this further and it looks like the video file is kept written until i explicitly call cameraview.stop - only then is it truncated to one second and closed

26986906

this works in ksh zsh too
you can get the basename of a file using the basename command looks like you re doing this step from find anyways... then to remove the extension use the parameter expansion to strip out the last dot and everything that follows man bash search for parameter expansion for more info
this works in ksh zsh too

int	double	int	chars
given your code above and assuming letters1 is 30 chars long and there are 20 mistakes then 20 30 or any amount of mistakes from the total chars available except when every chars is wrong will result in converting one of those values to a double should retain the fractions portion of the division
you re performing int arithmetic and losing the fractions portion of the result of your division
when you divide two integers the result is another int and you lose the fractions part

26987465
switching	screens
what we want is to be able to switch back and forth between the list and map view without adding anything new into the nav controller stack...meaning if they switch to the map view and then hit the back arrow they want the user to go back to the search screens
the other thing is when switching between the list and map view they want a horizontal flip effect so it s somewhat clear to the user that they aren t pushing onto the nav stack
so my problem is i can t figure out how to get this all working together

hive	hdfs
all hive managed tables are stored in the below hdfs location

26988075
spaces	delimiter	spaces	delimiter
but in my current case there is no any delimiter just two spaces and the fix length of field
for example- table field |------|-----------|-----------|-------------| | id 8 | name 50 | state 15 | category 10 | |------|-----------|-----------|-------------| | | | | | sample data of upload.txt file- format id name address category 10719922 union bank of india delhi normal 10719956 state bank of india mumbai normal 10719522 hdfc bank gujrat high 10759924 icici bank goa normal now you can understand the data format of text file field length + two spaces field length + two spaces and so on
the problem is if the data is not matches with the field size then again spaces are hare to complete the length of field that s why two space are not available as delimiter

26988075
spaces	delimiter	spaces	delimiter
the problem is if the data is not matches with the field size then again spaces are hare to complete the length of field that s why two spaces are not available as delimiter
like take the first of data- id have 8 digit data than two spaces and name length 50 but data have only 19 character so there is 31 spaces to complete the length 50 after that two spaces then next field
so i have no delimiter or syntax rather than length + 2 spaces to identify the single field data

26988081
width	height
but this will not custom_divider.xml note that the divider height is specified by android width layout xml my guess is that google messed up with the optimization for drawing listview dividers and will simply not draw them if there is not enough room

i use jcrop and try to set the width and height by a input field

26988214
packets	multicast
the ip_multicast_if or ipv6_multicast_if settings tell your socket which interface to send its multicast packets on

26988214
packets	multicast	packets	multicast
it s a separate independent setting from the interface that you bound your socket to with bind since bind controls which interface s the socket receives multicast packets from
granted the bsd sockets api implementors could have made the assumption that a socket would always want to send packets out over the same interface it receive packets on but that would make a number of use cases more difficult
for example if you are using a single socket to receive multicast packets from all interfaces via inaddr_any then when sending a packet using that socket you d still need a way to specify which multicast interface you want that packet to be sent over

for-loop	loops
please close the for-loop while storing data and add another loops before print

26988312
udp	tcp
in that case the packet s that wouldn t fit into the buffer will simply be dropped and never seen again
note udp doesn t really have a concept of connect just sending and receiving packets
if making a tcp connection is analogous to making telephone call then sending a udp packet is more like mailing a letter

26988312
udp	tcp
regarding two sockets arriving at the same udp port on a server at the same time the tcp ip stack keeps a fixed-size receive-buffer for each socket that the server creates and whenever a packet arrives at the port that socket is bound to the packet is placed into that buffer

build.gradle	gradlew
so i think this will solve your case
remove this chunk of code from your build.gradle in the root directory apply plugin com.android.application and as it says that note do not place your application dependencies here
they belong in the individual module build.gradle files meaning this line of code goes to in the gradlew file inside your app folder

it seems that centos 7 has still quite old qemu but i did not give it a try
instead i tried ubuntu 14.04 and it seems it is working
so anyone trying to do something like me i recommend checking version of qemu

26989006
width	height
it appears you only want to change the image values based on the y coordinate so create a new matrix y like this where height and width are the size of your image then create your image v this will work if a b and c are single values or matrices with the same size as y

udp	tcp
i have written a similar program with tcp sockets and what it did was iterate through the set of file descriptor with select and if the file descriptor equals stdin then serve the user command and if it equals the listener handle a new connection and else receive tcp messages
udp is connectionless so i guess there is no need to handle a new connection
it seems like i don t even need to maintain a number of sockets to communicate with multiple sockets

however i do not understand the col-lg-1 if you want the block to be centered do a .col-xs-12 or if smaller for example 6 columns .col-xs-6.col-xs-offset-3 offset must be 12 - width 2
just remove width 1920px

it would be great if the solution inside gradle because we currently use gradle | grep -iv ivy which is very unhandy
we re using gradle and sometimes we need to use the --debug option .
mostly to debug sadly it always starts with 1000th of line similar to the following it seems that all of them are caused by some third party libs

if you need all the userspace files of ubuntu then this is how docker operates - in order to promise that you can lift your container off an ubuntu machine and run it on a different linux docker has its own copy of everything above the kernel

26991451
public	protected
if c can see a.m1 but not a.m2 then we know that a.m2 cannot be public and a.m1 cannot be private
and because d sees a.m2 but not a.m1 we know that they can neither be public nor private
so they will have to be protected or package-private default access

i managed to resolve this by finding this blog post
if anyone else finds that they are struggling to implement this this is how i did it might not be the best solution but it works for me i copied the following text into my theme functions.php and then i modified theme woocommerce single-product add-to-cart simple.php make sure you don t midify the plugin files so make a copy and paste into your theme files into a woocommerce folder to the following notice that i had removed my quantity input from my code so if you need it ensure you rework the code to get it working i added another button next to the existing add to cart button but separating the form

filesystems	ntfs
a related question was raised on the mathworks website and the accepted answer was to pre-allocate when possible
if you don t pre-allocate then the extent of your performance problems will depend on your filesystems how data are stored on disk the cluster-size your hardware hdd seek time or ssd access times the size of your mat file whether it moves into non-contiguous space and the current state of your storage existing fragmentation free space
let s pretend that you re running a recent windows os and so are using the ntfs file-system

swift	objective-c
there are multiple reasons why the swift code is slower than the objective-c code. i made a very simple test case by comparing two fixed strings 100 times

26991969
swift	objective-c
on the other hand objective-c nsstring stores the strings as a sequence of utf-16 code points
if you replace by so that the swift code works on utf-16 sequences as well then the time goes down to 1.88 seconds
the allocation of the 2-dimensional array is also slow

26991969
swift	objective-c
i found a simple array2d class here using that class in your code the time in the test case goes down to 0.84 seconds
the last bottleneck that i found in the swift code is the min function. the swift library has a built-in min function which is faster
so just removing the custom function from the swift code reduces the time for the test case to 0.04 seconds which is almost as good as the objective-c version

that said id is probably not the column you want but something like synonyme_id
you can also post your table structure so anyone interested can have the full picture
once the mapping looks ok it will be easier to look for the solution to the problem if it doesn t get resolved when mappings are fixed

if you want to rely on the values of those variables even after an exception-handling is thrown and caught you must give them some default values either in the catch blocks or in a finally block assuming you can t just give them a default value before the try-catch block
the values of p1 p2 s1 s2 and a will not be destroyed after the try-catch block
however is an exception-handling is thrown in the try block some of them may remain uninitialized

an interceptor is really simple this is how the annotation would look and this is how you would use it the code inside mywrappedmethod would be wrapped by the code in the foointerceptor. note that the interceptor is only invoked if the method call to mywrappedmethod is managed by the container you invoke it on a managed instance of myservice via inject

floating-point	fractions
you ll never get a fractions number with trailing zeros though

the function below does this provided you supply a sufficiently long char buffer by repeatedly writing and scanning with increasing precision your length is the strlen of the string held by the buffer

accessibility is orthogonal to deletedness if a class is declared to be a base class clause 10 for another class using the public access specifier the public members of the base class are accessible as public members of the derived class and protected members of the base class are accessible as protected members of the derived class

even on my imac i was expecting to see this run at the full frame rate - 60fps that requestanimationframe this is what view.onframe uses internally allows but sometimes the frame rate variates there as well
i have tested this on galaxy s3 stock and google-chrome browsers laggy at some points when animating the framerate freezes for 5 6 frames every 35 frames
google nexus 5 stock and google-chrome browsers works somehow better freezes for 5 7 frames and continues iphone 4 safari browser very sluggish imac 2011 8gb ram core2 duo processor fairly good framerate sometimes variates

your best bet is to use bitwise shift operators and and logical | and to absorb chars values into an int
also consider using int32_t in case you build to targets with 16 or 64 bit int s

even though a cast like you ve shown is allowed for correctly aligned pointers dereferencing such a pointer is a violation of strict aliasing
an object with an effective type of must not be accessed through an lvalue of type int
in general type-punning is endianness-dependent and converting a chars array representing rgb colours is probably easier to do in an endianness-agnostic way something like

children	parent	qthread	qobject
also there is usually little benefit in creating more threads than available processor cores
whether it is not a bad practice to put qthread workerthread_ as the member of threadedworker class when an object is moved to its thread the object and its children are moved
the children are the objects linked in the qt parent child hierarchy when you pass a parent to a constructor of a qobject derived class or call setparent

26996621
qthread	qobject
the children are the objects linked in the qt parent child hierarchy when you pass a parent to a constructor of a qobject derived class or call setparent
in the case of a member pointer such as a qthread pointer it is not a child of the class
therefore when the threadedworker object is moved to the new thread this will work

26996621
pull	push
in other words this function can only push an object from the current thread to another thread it cannot pull an object from any arbitrary thread to the current thread

26996621
qthread	qobject	qthread	qobject
for this reason i would say it is not a good idea to have a qthread instance as a member of a qobject and move the object to that thread
if you re going to use qthread then i suggest reading and following the method as outlined in how to really truly use qthread
in addition it is often overlooked that the functionality of movetothread allows a 1 to many relationship of qthread to qobject so it is perfectly acceptable to create a qthread object and move multiple qobject instances to the new thread

this pointer can be of type base-class
i don t follow this

26996864

just like menu #2 it takes the screen width and height from the appdelegate to draw the menu

26997830
operands	scalar	operands	scalar
for scalar built-in types only or || will only evaluate the right hand operand if the left hand operand compares equal to 0
for built-in vector types both operands are evaluated and the operators are applied component-wise
if one operand is a scalar and the other is a vector the scalar may be subject to the usual arithmetic conversion to the element type used by the vector operand

26997830

the scalar type is then widened to a vector that has the same number of components as the vector operands

so i decided to move my code to a new page so at the very least i could see on a page the output razor generated from the cshtml page and determine if it was in fact intact which it is all the border styles and font changes and widths heights seem to be intact

creating a framework project in xcode and building it fails with multiple errors basically the include paths used in the headers seem to be incorrectly looked up

26999786
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie i have to click a tab twice to get the tab to change or respond to the click

26999825
for-loop	loops
you have an infinite loops because i is never updated in the for-loop

26999874
try-catch	exception-handling	try-catch	exception-handling
if there s no subclass of exception-handling or runtimeexception or any create a custom exception-handling class or reuse one previously created but with a distinct message
usually i tend to create these classes extending from runtimeexception to avoid clients of the method using try-catch blocks
if there s the need to handle the exception-handling in the client of this method then it should extend from exception-handling

26999968
draggable	droppable
what you need is to configure your draggable object to revert in invalid and your droppable only accept a draggable object then on drop you can execute a function and do whatever you want

26999969
hash	salt
that being said make sure you salt your hash otherwise they can be reconstructed easily

26999987
google-chrome	firefox	put	get
i am having the following problem shown in pictures in google-chrome note that this cutting submenu since firefox is as follows do not understand what may be happening a snippet of code an image of the css that is affecting this element if you need put the file ------------------------------------- edit ---------------------------------- scouring the internet by any chance can get where the error if i take this part .show slow

26999993
rubygems	bundler
it can t easily load gems that bundler installs outside of rubygems load path

27000000
super	implements
i also found this question but i m still not certain on how it should be implements
i have two classes with a super class
in essence the two classes are concrete classes on a tree

27000149
sorting	filtering
with no arguments returns the list of parameters provided so it becomes a question of filtering and sorting

27000253
squash	branch
keep in mind that version control via commit messages is a form of code documentation
squash willy-nilly is certainly not good practice
it may be fine for a hotfix branch but rarely is for a substantial feature branch

27000317
minimum	max
finally i took the integer array and put it into a short int array by taking each element dividing by that max value and then multiplying by the max short int value
this way you get the minimum amount of headroom needed to fit the data
you might be able to do some statistics on the integer array and integrate some clipping but for what i needed the minimum amount of headroom was good enough for me

27000399
cube	skybox
i have created a cube skybox that uses different materials for each side

27000437
subtraction	addition
the step by step execution explicitly allows overflows and underflows through addition subtraction and shift operations and thus the result is the same

27000492
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am using the following css to centre a div in the middle of my page i have tested this in google-chrome firefox and safari and it works as intended

27000526
folder	dir
the previous clickonce info was as follows publishing folder location ftp example.oldname.com installation folder url deployment web page appname.html version 1.0.0.0 then it got changed to the following publishing folder location ftp name.ca installation folder url also tried dir deployment web page appname.html version 1.0.1.0 note the application is set to check for updates before the application starts and was successfully updated on all versions 1.0.0.0 prior to the server change

27000609
for-loop	arrays
to fix it just iterate your arrays in other ways that don t require a wrapping function
for example for-loop for...of ecmascript 6 note this won t work in strict mode 10.4.2.1 strict mode restrictions the eval code cannot instantiate variable or function bindings in the variable environment of the calling context that invoked the eval if either the code of the calling context or the eval code is strict code
instead such bindings are instantiated in a new variableenvironment that is only accessible to the eval code

27000681
google-chrome	firefox
so .example- x is allowed
this input basically allows any input that starts with http google-chrome and is followed by anything other than a few special characters such as those that have a function in urls # etc
in firefox all that s checked is if it starts with http followed by anything other than even just http is allowed in firefox

27000740
union	distinct
below are details but the essence of what i m asking is whether there is a better way to make my set distinct after i union the four flat files

27000815
versioning	upgrade
it is not possible to upgrade jdk now
my java versioning is 1.6 and connect to a server over ssl using axis 2 stub
all used to work fine

27000884
inherited	properties
this should be the way in order to create the picture i used sparx systems enterprise architect and the features properties override attribute initializers context menu operation applied to the inherited field1 attribute

27000900
hide	show
update based on comments posted answer trying result help started but the window doesn t show at all i think it gives an error and closes if i copy the path from cmd to terminal runs perfectly so the arguments seem to be correct... update after trying to play with osascript after the code above to start assistant i added one of the many versions of activatescript none of the above versions of script had any effect
a possibility for the scripts that use pid to ignore me is that osascript may be using the window id which may be different from process id - i have searched for ways to acquire the windows id but found nothing i can use from inside qt. additional update i created a signal and sent an emit to the caller after the start so that perhaps i can do something to hide the caller window
an attempt to minimize then restore the caller looked horrible especially due to animation

27000915
gulp-compass	gulp-ruby-sass
replacing the gulp-compass plugin to gulp-ruby-sass is not an option due to a bug they have which block me from using certain sass features i need to use
i m using gulp-compass to compile my scss to css using gulp task
i m running on windows 7

27000974
filtering	grouping
a terrible terrible but effective hack is to draw a transparent shape with the filtering dimension that you want along with your horizontal or vertical lines and set the filtering on a grouping element grouping that shape along with your desired shape

27000991
g++	gcc
if you re on linux you should be able to update gcc and g++ via the repositories

27001001
qapplication	qmessagebox
if you don t want call beep where you show message box and if you you think that you really need this you can subclass qmessagebox and add some method which will call qapplication beep

27001059
children	parent
basically i had to figure out what the maximum number of children the parent model has

27001059
children	parent
then in the download.csv.csvbuilder i build the csv file with a header of the column names and headers for the maximum number of children a parent might have from the query

27001064
children	parent
i ve tried looping over the children i ve tried just destroying the parent but none works as expected

27001118
maven	pom.xml	jar	war
you shouldn t create multiple different artifacts in 1 pom.xml even if you can. as you can see it causes logical issues
thats actually not the maven way of doing thing right. you should have a pom.xml for the jar project that has those pojos
than you should have another pom.xml for the war project that has the first project as a dependency

27001237
maven	pom.xml
maven replaces property values two times at the beginning probably during assembling of effective pom.xml it replaces static properties declared in properties sections before each run of a plugin it replaces properties again so dynamic values used now what the above means is that if you have static declaration and later you use this property like the value is injected before you have a chance to dynamicaly change it

27001267
int	chars
here in is a chars you need to subtract zero from it inorder to obtain the actual int value corresponding to that chars

27001279
children	parent
focus is an issue here but its not actually children stealing the focus it s parent above the drawer layout actionbar toolbar

27001319
width	height
so imo the options are to 1 have various arguments for every single cell coloring option cell height and width row height and width column height and width etc

27001392
free	malloc
when you ask for a chunk of memory by calling malloc or similar the allocator finds an appropriate block in the list of free blocks removes it so it s no longer available and gives you a pointer to the block
when you call free the process is reversed -- the block is put back on the free list and thereby becomes available to be allocated again
importantly once you call free on a pointer you must not dereference that pointer again

27001392
free	calloc	free	malloc
your code shouldn t have any particular expectations about how memory allocation works beyond what s documented in the standard library call malloc calloc etc
to get a block of memory and call free to give it back when you re done so that it can be reused


27001423
free	malloc
malloc and free do whatever they want

27001423
free	malloc
their expected behaviour is that malloc allocates a block of desired size in dynamic memory and returns a pointer to it
free must be able to receive one such pointer and correctly deallocate the block
how they keep track of the block size is irrelevant

27001468
mp4	webm
if any of these answers above don t work and you re on an apache server adding the following to your .htaccess file most of the common formats add any that apply addtype video mp4 .mp4 addtype audio mp4 .m4a addtype video mp4 .m4v addtype video ogg .ogv addtype video ogg .ogg addtype video webm .webm i had a similar problem and adding this solved all my playback issues

27001484
ssl	https
we do have an ssl certificate on the server have setup the azure configuration to use it and are able to browse the site under https
i m not really sure how to move forward with this info as it s the first time i ve setup a site with ssl


27001493
width	height
problem 1 when you created rectangle you provided two entry objects as its width and height values

27001547
pow	math.h
for example 1.00000 and .99999 don t agree on any decimal places but abs 1.00000-.99999 .00001 .001
to convert 3 to .001 use the pow function
.001 pow 10 -3 it returns base to the power of exponent in this case 10 -3. you would need to include the math.h library to use pow

27001556
children	parent
just iterate over the children array - you ll need to cast from anyobject back to sknode to add the node to the new parent

27001592
put	get
this is a sample log out put i get 2014-11-18t18 30 33.570z - debug authenticated

27001604
multiplication	modulo
the compiler would simply use s1 and s2 as uint32_t typed values not being able to promote them further and the multiplication would simply give the result as the comment says modulo uint_max + 1 which is 0x100000000 this case

27001604
multiplying	multiplication
integer promotion would see uint32_t can be promoted to int 64 bit signed the multiplication would then attempt to multiplying two int s which if they happen to have the values shown in the example would cause an integer overflow which is undefined behavior

27001616
folder	directory
i m trying to run through folder and subfolders only no files can be altered in a given directory which have leading underscores and remove those leading underscores

27001619
children	parent
find all parent where the children array contains the specific child object

27001654
uiview	subviews
i have a uitableview and added it as a subviews of a uiview . whenever i select a cell that had everything disappears in uitableview

27001654
swift	objective-c
currently i use swift however already happened in objective-c

27001666
range	minimum
this saves the x- and y-ranges in the gnuplot variables gpval_x_min gpval_x_max gpval_y_min and gpval_y_max
then you set the range and replot the push pop stuff is required only if you want to keep the initial terminal settings
to make this reusable for use with multiplot you can wrap all those commands inside a string and call eval on it another option would be to use stats to compute the maximum and minimum x- and y-values and set the range accordingly

27001741
x86	64bit
i m assuming your setup is 32bit windows 7 with visual studio 2010 setup using the x86 native compiler and x64 cross compiler. if you re running 64bit windows you may need to change x86_amd64 to amd64 in the batch script depending on your setup. this is assuming visual studio is installed in program files and your solution is located in d mysoln create a file called buildall.bat and add this to it now create 2 more batch scripts crosscompilex86.bat to build the release version of a x86 build and include this devenv mysoln.sln clean release|x86 if errorlevel neq 0 exit b errorlevel devenv mysoln.sln rebuild release|x86 if errorlevel neq 0 exit b errorlevel crosscompilex64.bat to build the release version of the x64 build and include this devenv mysoln.sln clean release|x64 if errorlevel neq 0 exit b errorlevel devenv mysoln.sln rebuild release|x64 if errorlevel neq 0 exit b errorlevel now place all 3 batch files along in your solution folder along with mysoln.sln. you can build both x86 and x64 release versions by creating a shortcut on your desktop which run the following commands build all - d mysoln buildall.bat build x86 release only - d mysoln buildall.bat x86 build x64 release only - d mysoln buildall.bat x64 if you re using another configuration like anycpu etc you would need to customize the above scripts accordingly
here is the script i m using to completely automate the command line build of x86 and x64 configurations for the same solution through batch scripts
this is based on devenv.exe as it works if you have a setup project in your build msbuild doesn t support building setup projects

27001741
x86	64bit

27001745
google-chrome	firefox
then it produce an error
you can use web developer tools to analyze your code. modern web browser have tools like that. take a look at google-chrome developer tools for example
you can find equivalent tools for firefox and internet explorer

27001763
post	get
these calls can be made using get or post et al depending on how your api functions using angular http or resource and the like
what you are asking implies you want to use an angular frontend to provide post method endpoints to your api
this does not make sense

27001763
post	get
in the traditional php example you mention the entire request goes to the server and a page result is returned to the browser so you have the chance to detect that a post or get was made and direct the request appropriately

27001794
multiplying	add
edit if rounding is required then simply add 5 10 decimal_place+1 before multiplying
if you need to check if two numbers are the same upon 3rd decimal place you can simply multiplying both values with 1000 and compare them as integers
you get the picture you have to mutiply with 10 decimal_place

27001794
multiplying	add
edit if rounding is required then simply add 5 10 decimal_place+1 before multiplying

27001838
versioning	upgrade
i have an angular 1.0 app and i have been asked to upgrade it to 1.3.2 what are the main changes new features between these two versioning

27001861
folder	directory
ok i have a psh script that does the following things creates a text file under a user appdata local directory creates a scheduled task with the schtasks command runs an iex new-object net.webclient .downloadstring https blahblah.com command creates a vbs file under the system32 folder on windows 7 and 8 it works fine

27001869
std	ostream
if your replacement has the same quantity of characters as the text in the file then go ahead and seek to the position and overwrite the text see std ostream seekp

27001894
google-chrome	firefox
my app makes an ajax request using cors which works in google-chrome but not in firefox

27001953
post	get
in order to get another successful post i must physically refresh the page then reenter that data

27001991
maven	pom.xml
there is a certain order which repository maven looks first what next and so on
if maven fails to download artifact from the first repo it will try download it from the next repo
maven looks repositories first from settings.xml then project s pom.xml and lastly parent pom.xml s repositories

27002009
iprincipal	iidentity
this means that it really doesn t matter if you are using windows authentication based on windows users forms authentication based on cookies or some other brew of authentication
if you take a look at the source code for authorizeattribute you can see that all it does is check whether the iidentity.isauthenticated property is true to determine whether the user is logged in and also checks the iprincipal interface to check the user and or roles
so in short the only requirement for the security mechanism is for it to implement iprincipal and iidentity and to set those interfaces in the the application_beginrequest event for stateless security or application_acquirerequeststate event if using session state for security in global.asax

27002084
maven	pom.xml
i have a very simple maven project pom.xml i have two classes in src main java myclass.groovy and parentclass.java and here are my maven details maven 3.2.3 33f8c3e1027c3ddde99d3cdebad2656a31e8fdf4

27002159
hide	show
once you have a separate layer answer you can associate a link to show hide it - the link in this case will be what someone clicks to show the answer

27002182
nas	qnap
i ve got problem with my gitlab instalation on nas qnap ts-112

27002202
postgresql	mysql
just find with offset i hope it helps edited since answer.order rand .first works fine with mysql also you can use answer.order random .first with postgresql or with offset you can do it with confidence it works

27002390
post	get
this is the much more simplified version of it and then within my loops using which will then get me the default or higher res variation every time
the only issue with this approach is that if a user post a gallery it will crash out
i am looking for a fix in another thread

27002435
post	get
answer is here facebook php api post an event on a page copied below for convenience i think you need the page access_token and here how you get it make sure you grant the manage_pages permission and add the access_token to the event_info array

27002450
calloc	malloc
if so what does calloc do then
isak savo explains that calloc does indeed touch the memory it writes zeroes on it and thus you ll be sure the os is backing the allocation with actual ram or swap
this is also why it is slower than malloc not only does it have to zero it the os must also find a suitable memory area by possibly swapping out other processes so i decided to try it myself after executing this application windows s task manager would tell me that only 352 kb were being used out of ram

27002450
calloc	malloc
on the other hand however if i would call malloc and initialize the array manually task manager would show me that there is actually 4.452kb of ram being used by the application
if so what does calloc do then


27002529
versioning	upgrade
the app was running fine for the past several months until just recently i upgrade my phone from 4.4.4 to 5.0 via the official ota update
now the app crashes and i get the following stack trace here is my layout here s my gradle file and here is the relevant bits of the activity the same app still works fine on another phone with an older versioning of android
and if i remove the fragment from the layout it runs without crashing on my phone with 5.0 of course without the map so i m fairly certain it s the map fragment that s causing the issue

27002554
d3.js	highcharts
if its not possible with d3.js has anyone done something similar with highcharts

27002557
multiplying	add
i ve found the solution if anyone is having same problem basically what i did was read every byte and if the number is 9 then add cx to ax and multiplying it by 10

27002562
namedtuple	dictionary
without knowing how you re planning to use them it s hard to say for sure see keep data out of your variable names for some relevant background on making the decision yourself but it might be better to have say a single dictionary using the month names as keys or to just leave the values in a list and use the month names as just symbolic names for indices into that list that might be even nicer with an intenum or maybe a namedtuple

27002595
union	distinct
all because microsoft didn t put a distinct union option in the data flow taskbar

27002626
innodb	myisam
so we don t quite have an answer here because it seems innodb storage engines give us one problem and myisam enginges give us another

27002650
children	parent
there are 2 scenarios that i want to capture messages from sibling processes and the parent process or from other children of the same parent process that have run before or after me

27002657
implements	extends
extends does the same but unwraps lists both methods return none but you ll need a method that returns the combined list therefore just use the plus sign
spark combinebykey it s also possible to solve this with combinebykey which is used internally to implements reducebykey but it s more complex and using one of the specialized per-key combiners in spark can be much faster
your use case is simple enough for the upper solution

27002663
dumpsys	adb
we used to get device id imei using the following command adb shell dumpsys iphonesubinfo but since last android update 5.0 - lollilop this command doesn t return anything i performed this test on both nexus 4 and nexus 5

27002672
int	double
after you can do arithmetic if you need with bash and arithmetic operator
one way to interact between shell and bc will print a random number in the range 0 to 4 is a pseudo random int usable directly in your shell
note that double quotes are mandatory to use shell variables

27002739
portrait	landscape
i am creating a two-column layout - left fixed right fluid - and i m using a media query to put the left column below the right which is the main content if the screen resolution is between 320 and 649 px portrait or landscape

27002739
width	height
for example if i resize the browser i m using chrome canary developer console to a width of 480px everything works fine as per the media query as long as the height of the window is greater than 480px

27002749
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and have just set up a server over at linode using ubuntu 12.04

27002843
versioning	upgrade
just because the json versioning appears to maintain order doesn t mean that it will next time or will after an upgrade so don t depend on this non-specified behavior

27002845
put	get
this works however the only problem i have is that i cannot get the following script to work with an -eq and have instead used a -gt and put the file date in the script one day less than the actual file date

27002881
swift	objective-c
yes you are free to use either objective-c or swift when writing a watchkit extension

27002885
qtextstream	qmutex
the whole point of a mutex is that you are operating on the same mutex in every thread
this wrapper should take any constructor arguments and forward them to qtextstream and should lock any call to operator
the reason qmutex can t be a local variable inside a function is that then the mutex is allocated in the context of that function

27002912
hex	binary
in the event that you have mbstring overload set or your are developing for the platforms where you are unsure about this setting you can do the following the reason why this works is that in hex you are guaranteed to get 2 characters for all bytes that come from bin2hex it returns two chars even for the initial binary 0

27002937
debian	linux
i hope you can explain me how to deploy an asp.net mvc5 application on mono to a linux server
we want to deploy a mvc5 application which is build on mono to a debian server
this server comes from a third party who has a larger web server that can redirect requests via proxies

27002950
build.gradle	gradlew
right click the project and select export choose android and generate gradlew build files if you look in your folder you will see a new build.gradle file quit eclipse to avoid adb weirdness on some platforms and open android studio file import project select the build.gradle file from above next it might prompt you to update your gradlew version do this and let it sync then your conifguration might need some help if you press play and it pops open a edit configuration dialog tell it what activity to launch as default in this case it is startgameactivity
finally change the sdk version in build.gradle compilesdkversion google inc. glass development kit preview 19 after you do this the project will build and run on glass
here is a repo of that result please fork as you wish

27002953
google-chrome	firefox
this has been reported before as a bug in firefox gecko but it s actually a bug in google-chrome blink

27002955
put	get
these kinds of sites make their money by showing you ads every time you download a file and by prompting you to pay a monthly fee to get direct accelerated whatever downloads and so on so they will put all kinds of hurdles in the way of you downloading files directly without seeing those ads or paying that fee

27002989
stdout	stderr
the lines not all processes could be identified non-owned process info will not be shown you would have to be root to see it all. are sent to stderr instead of stdout so you can get rid of them by sending stderr to dev null instead of letting it be printed in the console

27002995
int	chars
so a suitable macro for displaying this information might be for example the following test code outputs for example - your addresses will probably be different as may the data type sizes and structure alignment and packing a_global_int 0x8049948 - 0x804994b 4 bytes. a_static_int 0x8049944 - 0x8049947 4 bytes. char_array_10 0xbf856502 - 0xbf85650b 10 bytes. int_array_16 0xbf856520 - 0xbf85655f 64 bytes. int 0xbf8564f4 - 0xbf8564f7 4 bytes. chars 0xbf8564f3 - 0xbf8564f3 1 bytes. long_long 0xbf8564f8 - 0xbf8564ff 8 bytes. a_structure 0xbf85650c - 0xbf85651f 20 bytes. in the light of comments it seems you may be asking something different than that addressed by my answer above static data allocation is known at build time and can be reported by your linker in the map file

imageview	universal-image-loader
universal-image-loader cancels previous displayimage ... task for the same imageview

27003307
spaces	delimiter
use that awk command explanation sets the delimiter to spaces and printf s s s s. s s s n format the output cuts the second firls in the desired pieces or use that sed command explanation first match a 8-digit pattern and save it as 1 after a spaces match 3 times a 2-digit pattern and save them to 2 3 and 4 and at last match 3-digit pattern and save it as 5 1 2 3 4. 5 format the output

27003343
children	parent
so there you d define the supervision strategy in the parent and all works as you d want it to then
it seems that you re using a pool router it starts its own children
instead what you want to use is a group router group router docs in which case you create the child actors and supply them to the router

27003365
exponent	modulo
rsa encryption is described as where c is a cipher text m is an original message e is public exponent typically 65537 and n is public modulo

27003379
apache	nginx
so depending on what http server you are using nginx apache etc if properly configured these service accounts should not be able to execute that command because they do not have root level privileges in order to execute the changes you are wanting to make even if shell_exec is enabled

put	get
here s the basic set up i m using pyprimes to get factors for the data variable but this hard-coded list works for this all that is good now i want to link some unique colors to the unique primes in the dataframe
one way is to do but of course whatever i put in the last slot ends up replacing all the previous color values at the end of the for-loop
or is there a better way to solve this problem

27003744
factors	matrix
xtabs will return a value-matrix that can be indexed by a two-column character-valued matrix formed from the first two columns and are probably factors hence the need for the as.character -conversion --- see what is being indexed

27003745
strtok	strcmp	fgetc	strtok	fgetc	strcmp
if they are just words its gets a lot easier
anyway first i would read the entire file into a buffer with fgetc after that just keep on using strtok with whitespace as the delimiter
then for each token use strcmp on the token and the double array of chars you have

beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i want to use amazon-web-services elasticache service as we are already using amazon-web-services and have amazon-web-services beanstalk django app up and running

27003895
shadowing	named
just about all the node.js code i ve seen on the internet uses this convention for requiring modules where the return value of require is assigned to a variable with the same named as the module the trouble is that that many module named are quite common words that we would like to use for variable named elsewhere in our code which will probably cause problems due to named shadowing

27003930
post	put
prop sheets set in the ide are put at the bottom so that won t work
i ve found and reported in other post tagged msbuild that the platformtoolset behaves funny and different in vs or command-line
in addition to making sure it s set early enough it seems to unnaturally be required in the main not included file and possibly in a particular spot

27004040
public	protected
they are defined by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed by a normal variable declaration

27004040
int	boolean
in other words the value of this property can only be an int float string boolean or empty array

27004258
inline	inlining
since we re talking virtual functions having it out of line isn t a problem for inlining most likely and if it is you can still have it outside the class but marked as inline
but having it in a .cpp and not inline has the additional benefit of providing a key function for the class which gives the compiler a definite place to put the vtable thus reducing compile and linking time a bit


27004279
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop condition is bad should be as you have an arrays of dimension n and the cointng starts from 0

27004289
httpresponse	request	httprequest	httpresponse
how it works is this the spray-can layer http connection actor sends an httprequest object to the service and expects an httpresponse for it httpservice receives this messages and saves the original sender the spray-can layer connection actor as the root responder it creates the requestcontext which holds both the request and the responder as the actorref to which responses need to be sent to

27004289
httpresponse	request
basic operations on the requestcontext like complete just send a message to the responder to complete the request also for reject a message is sent to the responder
however as the original responder is just an actorref of the spray-can level actor and the rejection message isn t handled by spray-can the routing layer has to hook into the message processing to use the rejectionhandler to convert a rejection to an ordinary httpresponse
this can be done by using requestcontext.withrouteresponsemapped which returns a new requestcontext which contains a new responder that wraps the old one appling some function onto all messages received by this responder before forwarding the result to the original responder

27004298
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
another thing is that if you want the slideup hide effect to be noticeable you should run the slidedown show effect in its callback

27004320
iboutlet	ibaction
that looks like you either have a method named advancebutton that is colliding with a variable named advancebutton or instead of defining an iboutlet for your button you defined an ibaction

27004356
for-loop	loops
your for-loop doesn t check break condition and loops forever starting to write out of bounds

int	chars
by my reading of the standard an implementation which used a 15-bit chars could legally store int as a 15-bit magnitude and use a second 15-bit word to store the sign along with 14 bits of padding

27004880
int	chars
a similar situation could arise with any larger chars size if 32 767 was replaced with uchar_max
such a situation is unlikely however compared with the real-world problems associated with unsigned int multiplication alluded to in the other post

filtering	grouping
you can use a select instruction to get what you need sqldf select date sku sum a.quantity as quantity min a.price as price from df as a grouping by date sku you can use standard sql instructions to manipulate filtering or aggregate data stored in data frames which sqldf reads as if they were tables

27005166
aggregate-functions	sum
those first two are no problem but i m having difficulty getting the grand total for the report which would be the sum of each region total
i can t reference the region group as the total is outside that group - scope parameter that is not valid for an aggregate-functions

int	double
bear in mind that math.pow returns a double so you will need to cast it to an int if you only want a whole number

27005657
dictionary	map
printing out the dictionary
you could achieve this with two maps dictionary one being the inverse of the other
for the first map the key would be the name and the value would be a list of characters

27005829
width	height
no problem at all you can use the usual size tags or you can use width height more information about the tags

27005845
floating-point	integer
this is the line that is causing you to add 0 many times which isn t what you need here
use a double literal 1.0 to force floating-point calculation
also mathematically e is not an integer it s irrational and transcendental so long is an inappropriate data type to use

hide	show
i have the following code which calls the bootstrap 3.1 js method collapse on a div with either show or hide as a parameter based on the value of the selected item in a select input element

27006325
hide	show
one thing you can try is to find an element modified by the action that s taking place let s say maybe clicking causes something to hide or show on the page by right clicking on an element in chrome s elements panel you have the option to break on subtree modification what this means is that if a dom node inside this element changes the javascript execution will pause

27006351
put	get
add column to state if page is last hit get pageviews exits and exit rate this will then give you your actual calculations

button	checkbox
i ve used an array of color s to make life simpler but the general concept should work for if-else statements you just need to reset the counter when it reaches its limit take a look at how to use buttons checkbox and radio buttons and how to write an action listeners for more details
if i understand correctly basically you want to change the color each time the button is pressed based on the number of times the button has previously been pressed
mouselistener is not a good choice for jbutton as buttons can be activated by the keyboard via short cuts or focus activity and programically none of which the mouselistener will detect

27006694
button	checkbox
mouselistener is not a good choice for jbutton as buttons can be activated by the keyboard via short cuts or focus activity and programically none of which the mouselistener will detect
instead you should use a actionlistener this example will change the color each time the button is clicked

implicit	shapeless
correct me if i m wrong - so a dependent function à la shapeless should be able to provide that the above defines a pseudo dependent function that accepts a hlist as argument we will later make it accept only hlists made of and returns a dimensions with its type parameters set see below for the definition of dimensions.aux - we will make all be a hlist made of matching the input hlist types
we then have to provide a definition of this dependent function at some values here hlists made of - this is typically made in the dependent function trait s singleton object here we defined dimensionsof at hnil and hlists of the form where ct is an hlist at which dimensionsof is it-self defined as we require - and then use - an implicit that attests so
dimensions.aux used in the above definitions is defined like the dimensions function defined above can then be used this way dimensions1 and dimensions2 are not needed any more

27006944

draggable	droppable
here s the doc for the drop event triggered when an accepted draggable is dropped on the droppable based on the tolerance option
the default value for the accept option is which means it will fire the drop event by default when any draggable is dropped into it
the second is where you were just off based on the tolerance option

27007444
draggable	droppable
the default value for tolerance is intersect draggable overlaps the droppable at least 50 in both directions

27007444
draggable	droppable	draggable	droppable
in your fiddle your droppable has a small defined width
however your draggable does not
this means that your draggable is the full width of the container which is much wider than the droppable and thus can t possibly intersect by 50

27007444
draggable	droppable
if you switch intersect to touch instead you ll see the event fire properly as in that case the draggable only needs to intersect the droppable by any amount

rtsp	sdp
your config file could look like this some important stuff might be missing with such setup you can watch the stream with vlc by typing rtsp 192.168.0.xxx 1235 test1.sdp here is the ffserver documentation
you can use ffserver to stream a video using rtsp
just change console syntax to something like this ffmpeg -i space.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -tune zerolatency -crf 18 create a ffserver.config file sample where you declare httpport rtspport and sdp stream

width	height
if you look farther in the apple handbook you will see this section structures and enumerations are value types in this section you will see this let hd resolution width 1920 height 1080 var cinema hd this example declares a constant called hd and sets it to a resolution instance initialized with the width and height of full hd video 1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels high

27007748
width	height
even though hd and cinema now have the same width and height they are two completely different instances behind the scenes
next the width property of cinema is amended to be the width of the slightly-wider 2k standard used for digital cinema projection 2048 pixels wide and 1080 pixels high cinema . width 2048 checking the width property of cinema shows that it has indeed changed to be 2048 println cinema is now cinema . width pixels wide prints cinema is now 2048 pixels wide however the width property of the original hd instance still has the old value of 1920 println hd is still hd . width pixels wide prints hd is still 1920 pixels wide when cinema was given the current value of hd the values stored in hd were copied into the new cinema instance
the end result is two completely separate instances which just happened to contain the same numeric values

put	get
you can get the preprocessor to do arithmetic evaluate but only in the context of #if which allows you to evaluate a boolean expression
you can use that feature to rather laboriously output a number but only by using preprocessor input in #include d files since you cannot put #if inside a macro
you don t mention why you want to stringify int_min so i m not in a position to offer an alternative if indeed one exists

27008390
post	get
in this case since you are doing a post it will call the post method in the view
the formview s implementation of post is this since we aren t using formview but are using formmixin we need to include it
so all it does is get the form class you set in self.form_class instantiates it then checks if it is valid

post	get
you should initialize properties loginviewmodel and registerviewmodel in the view models constructor and in the get method pass a new instance of the view model and to ensure you model properties post back pass the model to the partials html.partial _loginpartial model and change the partial to use loginandregisterviewmodel this ensures the that the controls are bound to the view model and generate the correct name attributes whereas passing on a property of the model would have generated which would not bind to loginandregisterviewmodel on post back and all properties would have been null

to call the superclass method you should write that said you don t really need to implements setname in the subclassing if it only calls the superclass implementation

ubuntu	linux
most linux distributions restrict access to dev vcsn so if you want to play around with them you ll either need special privileges or you ll need to use root privileges to change the access permissions on the device files
ubuntu appears to provide rw access to users in group tty
check ls -l dev vcs0 to see how your system does it. and of course you ll need to find the console - try ctl alt 1

subclass	superclass

i have a swift protocol that defines a method like the following i have several different classes that will conform to this protocol the implementation for the retrieve method in each subclass will be nearly identical
i d like pull the common implementation of those functions into a shared superclass that conforms to the protocol the problem with this approach is that my protocol defines the return type of the retrieve method as type self which is what i really want in the end

27008934
superclass	subclassing
i could of course implement a differently-named method in the base class and then have each subclassing implement the protocol by calling into its superclass s method to do the work but that doesn t seem particularly elegant to me

memcpy	memmove
objects with trivial copy constructors trivial copy assignment operators and trivial destructors can be copied with memcpy or memmove the requirements for a special member function of a class t to be trivial are copy constructors cc and copy assignment operators ca not being user-provided meaning it is implicitly-defined or defaulted and if it is defaulted its signature is the same as implicitly-defined t has no virtual member functions t has no virtual base classes the cc ca selected for every direct base of t is trivial the cc ca selected for every non-static class type or array of class type memeber of t is trivial t has no non-static data members of volatile-qualified type since c++14 destructors not being user-provided meaning it is implicitly-defined or defaulted not being virtual that is the base class destructor is not virtual all direct base classes have trivial destructors all non-static data members of class type or array of class type have trivial destructors just declaring the function as doesn t make it trivial it will only be trivial if the class also supports all the other criteria for the corresponding function to be trivial but explicitly writing the function in user code does prevent it from being trivial

when abcviewcontroller screen is pushed orientation changes from portrait mode to landscape mode

27010299
for-loop	loops
basically it s important to avoid using the iterator
i found a really clumsy solution in the aforementioned code it is important to use a for-loop with an index to go through the dbset instance
furthermore in loops you add each element to a list

int	double	int	double
you could use 3 double 2 or 1.5
the issue is here more specifically here 3 2 because that is int math
you could use 3 double 2 or 1.5

post	get
but as per standards of get and post methods described here i think am doing wrong
please suggest is there any other way to pass the data in to the post method
please suggest me

27010795
post	get
see spring mvc post request
yes you are correct you should use post request to do any kind of dml operation on server
get should be used for data fetch operations only

27010795
submit	submission
reason is to avoid the doubly form submission which you can do with f5 or double click of submit button

27010795
post	get
you should use method requestmethod.post instead of get
see spring mvc post request


27010798
int	double
if i recall correctly integer64 are just double s masked as int

27010884
calloc	malloc
but at all there is no regulation about whether malloc calloc have to allocate the memory on the call or just as you are using the memory

27010942
int	chars
because you are comparing int to string and the string is type-casted to int - and since first or any first seq of chars element of that string is a number and next is not part of any int representation - it change to that element 1

27011004
qtabwidget	qtabbar	public	protected
but qtabwidget tabbar is protected and you can not access it
the solution is to derive a class from qtabwidget and implement a public function which returns a pointer to qtabbar now you can install event filter on the tab bar mtabwidget is an instance of customtab your event filter should be like

versioning	upgrade
for me solution was to update to tomcat 8. although says that any servlet container of versioning 3.0 will do and says that tomcat versioning 7 supports it i was unable to launch my war app on it. but upgrade to tomcat 8 solved the issue

27011172
post	get
also you might find that running commands in the vm using winrm or ssh may be the easiest way to launch tests
if you haven t already seen it the blog post about windows support in vagrant 1.6 is informative creating a virtualbox vagrant base vm from an .iso should work and you can then do all of your work using the vm from that point onward
to get started you might try these steps create a virtualbox vm from your windows .iso using the virtualbox gui or cmdline tools

accessor	properties
perhaps there is a better way.
you can use the accessor that d3.csv accepts to specify how you want the row data transformed
the function below takes an object and converts all of its properties to lowercase

27011469
serializable	deserialization
in your case the cost of serialization deserialization would most certainly outweight the cost of accessing an arraylist
also implementing parcelable should be prefered over serializable on android for performance reason

min	max
for the query above and for the exact data you provided the output is this the order of values in the array value is max min avg as per the script in reduce_script

cpython	ironpython
you have to run the program using ironpython .net as wpf will not be available in standard cpython environments

tcheckbox	tpanel
for more information see and related topics
you either have to manually set taborder to some reasonable value because tshape doesn t have it published and is thus set to -1 which does the same thing as or doesn t place the tcheckbox in the trectangle just place it in front of the trectangle so it draws over the trectangle
another option is not to use the trectangle at all and change the style of the tpanel right click on the panel in the designer and select edit custom style.

apache	nginx
the omnibus rpm version of gitlab will install gitlab to the opt gitlab directory. if you want to check the files that will be installed by an rpm package you can do so with rpm -qlp gitlab-7.4.3_omnibus.5.1.0.ci-1.el6.x86_64.rpm after you install the rpm with rpm -ivh gitlab .rpm you configure the url subdomain using the etc gitlab gitlab.rb file. after amending the gitlab.rb file you can start gitlab with gitlab-ctl start or restart it with gitlab-ctl restart you can configure the web address port that gitlab nginx listens on using the external_url parameter in the gitlab.rb file external_url if you already have a webserver such as apache using port 80 or port 443 then you might want to ask gitlab nginx to listen on a port other than 80 or 443 with external_url you can check if anything is listening on particular ports using netstat -luntap | grep listen

define og image width and og image height parameters like maria has suggested

27012819
pem	pkcs#12
if you use openssl you don t have to copy the full source code into your project it is enough to add the libs and headers so the openssl library can be used without any size problem. you can generate a key and a cert like that with openssl and you can write this into pem format with these functions after that it is possible to write these files into a pkcs#12 file source from here

27012825
setinterval	settimeout
you could also use inside the settimeout but it s not the best option because you could trigger some javascript error if angularjs is already digesting i put your code on jsfiddle reading your code i think you are working on a carousel
if this is correct the right function ub your code would be which is the equivalent of setinterval in plain javascript

gruntjs	yeoman
if you want to deploy your app on a distant server with gruntjs you can use a similar approch as i did by adding a new deploy parameter on your yeoman build gruntjs task or create a new deploy dedicated task using grunt-ssh for executing linux commands over ssh and sending files over sftp grunt-zipup for ziping your local ressources before sending it through sftp for example i have a build task that compiles optimize minify revision resources where i added a deploy parameter see modules docs for details ps there are tons of other gruntjs plugins that you could use for that

post request for creating the pdf which returns an id or filename get request in an iframe
update if you want to display small files this method is not recommended for big files which come from a previous post request without saving them anywhere then use a data url just replace with the actual base64 string representation of the file
in order to get the base64 string of a stream make use of the convert.tobase64string method

vb6	vba
then you could add that dll using the vba editor s tools...references dialog from any office or other product that supported vba the same way you might use say the microsoft scripting runtime which is super-handy for things like dictionary filesystemobject and textstream
problem is vb6 was released sometime in 1998 and has not been available from or supported by microsoft for years now
there seem to be quite a few download sites offering the package - i can t offer any advice about the legality or security issues that might be experienced by using them.

27013436
width	height
i don t understand your code snippets but then again probably you don t understand them either so let s not look at what you ve written so far and let s take a closer look at the tileintwo example in this example we ask the pdfreader instance for the page size of the first page and we create a new rectangle with the same width and only half the height

27013627
post	get
when putting the form data in the query string this is usually done with data that is not sensitive and used mainly for get request where the parameter values are used to help filter in getting the resource
if this is sensitive data that should be stored on the server you generally want to post the data as form data in the body of the request as seen in the answer from your previous post update if you don t know the key names which is required to use queryparam you can obtain the entire query string from an injected uriinfo
something like getqueryparameters will return all the keys and values in multivaluemap alternatively if you know the keys which are shown in the url you posted in the comment then you cause just use all those key for the queryparam all this crazy stuff sort 5b0 5d 5bfield 5d is just how url are encoded with special character but jax-rs will convert back to their rightful form ie

int	double
this is the same behaviour as in c c++ objective-c et al so you shouldn t be too surprised to see it in your debugger too
it s just int math and the usual rules for promotion of types
whereas since and the parentheses force this to be evaluated first before promoting it to double

for-loop	arrays
so i leave it up to you to clean it up they may appear everywhere not only at the beginning or the end if there are two consecutive split-numbers in the input arrays
this is because result is defined in the for-loop scope
please format your code and you will see that result isn t visible from return statement

button	checkbox	getter	setter	onclientclick	datalist
now in your adapter class write something like this and in your oncheckedchangelistener orest savchak s answer is also right but keeping track of checkbox in your pojo classes will help you to retrieve the checked items later and also do other things easier like you want to uncheck all the checkbox on click of reset button
for that in onclientclick on reset button you ll just need to do edit 1 create getter setter for draweritemlist in your adapter and then in onclientclick of reset button in place of datalist do as following

pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
to compute the hash salt the creators used pbkdf2
i am not interested in hearing about arguments for or against pbkdf2 as that is not what this question is about
they seem to have used buffers for everything here which i understand is a common practice in node

put	get
if you combine this with a group by on your points table you will get an array of all the polygons containing those points eg select pl.id array_agg ar.id order by ar.id as area_list from areas ar places pl where st_contains ar.geom pl.geom group by pl.id order by pl.id
note you can put an order by inside array_agg so that the area ids always appear in the same order
i have called both table s primary keys id and both table s geometries geom so you might have to adjust for your set up

swift	objective-c	getter	setter
objective-c generates getter and setter if not read only methods so you can override their behaviour
swift has method observers for custom behaviour so you don t need custom getter setter
assign to property directly

27015304
put	get
it is about testing for the existence of elements in it
if your application calls for retrieval then what it actually needs is an identity mapping a map where you put key key
then you will be able to get the object just as you want

to achieve this i created a class called coreactivity which is extended by all my activities and does the following my problem occurs when i wish to show a screens on a phone setup on landscape mode to do this i use the following the problem is that on a phone if the user is holding the phone on portrait mode as one would since most of the application is in portrait mode then the activity gets created and destroyed and then recreated
but if they are holding it on landscape mode then it is only created once

select distinct fromdate todate ischargeable username datediff day fromdate todate + 1 as count1 from dbo.vdiary group by fromdate todate ischargeable username this results in.

maven	pom.xml
if you have a version declared in the very pom.xml maven uses it

27016959
maven	pom.xml	jar	war
2 the only way i would see this happening is if you micromanage the dependencies in the pom.xml of the ear entirely
1 ejb jar in the pom.xml of the jar make the dependency not provided so maven knows the dependency is needed on the runtime classpath and thus to be deployed with the application - that will trigger it to add it to the ear lib
1 war basically what you describe here is that instead of packaging the dependency with the war package it in the parent ear

27016959
maven	pom.xml
in maven terms you then add the dependency to the pom.xml of the ear so it is on the runtime classpath there and you mark the dependency as provided in the pom.xml of the war so it is on the compile time classpath but not on the runtime classpath there

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
this should be you want to loops as long as i is smaller than a.length the size of the arrays . the for-loop will be exited or skipped if the termination condition returns false

27017591
for-loop	loops
since i equals 0 the length of a would have to be 0 for this loops to run and we already know that you declared a with a length of 7
take a close look at your for-loop
notice that you are using a greater than sign

getter	setter	implements	extends
try making the variable protected which allows extends classes to have visibility on the variable if you want to continue accessing the sport variable in this manner otherwise have getter and setter in the abstract class and the extends implements classes to call them instead

27018018
integer	fractions
since the length is an integer and integers can t contain fractions you can t have half an item in the array it is safe to check if the count is more than three a side note your variable assignment makes no sense

int	chars
conclusion i don t know of any significant reasons not to use chars if possible instead of int for arithmetic where everything lies in registers though you will pay a conversion cost when reading writing to memory

required	placeholder	required	placeholder
to fix this you can assign a placeholder value to your variable like this that being said i think vptheron and kululimpa s suggestions are the way to go
you are getting that error because your private variable is not initially assigned a value so is treated as abstract and abstract variables can t be private because they can not be accessed by the sub classes that are required to implement them
to fix this you can assign a placeholder value to your variable like this that being said i think vptheron and kululimpa s suggestions are the way to go

the former is the same as linkedhashset the latter will bump the key up if you re-insert it and also if you look it up
1 adding a duplicate into a set does not do anything it returns false immediately and contents of the set are not affected regardless of particular implementation be it a hashset a treeset or a linkedhashset
2 check out linkedhashmap it is probably the closest to what you want

ubuntu	debian	ffmpeg	libav
possible solution is building ffmpeg it s rather simple - i really don t understand why debian ubuntu prefers libav without alternative

27020828
folder	directory
for installing ffmpeg you should download its sources from official site or clone git repository git source.ffmpeg.org ffmpeg.git then enter source directory and run . configure --enable-shared --disable-static make sudo make install you can also add other parameters to configure . you can build static libraries too but opencv can t be built with static ffmpeg libraries now i don t know why
after this you can download opencv sources from opencv site or clone github repository opencv repository create build folder and run from it the following cmake path_to_sources -dcmake_build_type release make sudo make install of course path_to_sources must be actual path to your opencv sources
after these steps you have working latest opencv build in your system

i am finding a lot on so that talks about put vs post and best practices for doing crud operations on a root object but i ve spent the night trying to find information around how child objects should be handled

keydown	keyup
from what i can tell this is happening because the os is simply adding the character and not triggering any normal javascript events you would expect to fire when keying in text keydown keypress keyup

getattr	setattr
to do this purely with attributes use getattr and setattr and store the attribute names in choices in use

27021033
int	boolean
i need to convert several string values to int boolean etc. however since the input values may be null i can t use the integer.valueof method for example

27021072
width	height
suppose html response look like this #1 - filter by html attributes #2 filter by width inline styles #3 - example - if width and height attributes have not been setted for images in my opinion better send json which will contain all images urls because creating unnecessary http queries it s not good solution

27021106
draggable	droppable
firstly jqueryui is required by gridmanager so you ve already got the drag drop functionality on the page
however gm is already using the draggable sortable jqueryui features so be warned you might get some clashes
gm actually creates a lot of temp markup and then strips it out on preview save - have a look at the generated source code - you ll see divs of class gm-editable-region - might be worth trying to make that class a droppable region i.e so other things can be dropped on it

laika	tinytest
i strongly believe that its use of phantomjs is a much better than sanjo jasmine chrome or clinical nightwatch firefox attempting to use real browsers
i still recommend laika for now but i suspect it will break at some point and won t be fixed rapidly
tinytest is being added to velocity

27021461
laika	tinytest
failing that if your interest is mostly server-side unit testing then fall back to tinytest
only if that gets real frustrating would i suggest you pick up laika and then expect it to break some day
hopefully that s far enough down the road for the velocity situation to have greatly improved

27021538
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
if we look at the method in question we can see it does not exist in v3.1.1 of spring security but was present in v3.1.5 i note the mismatch in your pom.xml between spring-security-core 3.1.1 and the web and config modules 3.1.5
so we can guess that you code is compiled against 3.1.1 look at the maven dependency hierarchy to confirm but that 3.1.5 is being used at runtime look in web-inf lib folder of your deployed web app to confirm 3.1.5 is present - this is being pull in as a transitive dependency of web and config modules
suggested fix is then to update your pom.xml to point core module to 3.1.5

scrolltop	removeclass
when you scroll the page passed the height of your header you set it to position fixed
by doing this you remove some of the height of the page which means jquery window .scrolltop changes scrolltop is now lower than your header height - 42
this is what causes it to constantly flicker between addclass stick and removeclass stick causing that jumpy feeling

27021877
implements	extends
authorizeattribute on the other hand works out of the box
it implements iauthorizationfilter and already takes care of the common needs of developers
it still allows you to override the onauthorization method in case you want to extends its functionality but you don t have to as it works just fine without you doing that

i am trying to put together a table that uses the twitter bootstrap striping but i need it to not apply to nested rows
by that i mean i have table like this striped cells marked with s ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | s | s | s | s | s | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | | | | | | | ------------------------------ | | | | s | s | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ because the second row here has cells with rowspan 2 the single row cells get the striping effect

then in a for-loop parfor loops specifically i compute the actual result of each tensor and send it to the preallocated space
why i couldn t use which throws ---------- update i pre-allocate the memory for the 200 tensors just because i heard memory preallocation can make the data continuous in the memory and thus can alleviate the outofmemory problem

nsoperation	nsurlsession
but afnetworking s nsurlsession implementation never did this nor does alamofire
you can easily wrap the request in an nsoperation subclass
for example then when i want to initiate my 50 requests i d do something like this that way those requests will be constrained by the maxconcurrentoperationcount and we don t have to worry about any of the requests timing out

pull	push
your app would push pull data to parse to sync the data

27023021
int	chars
so you can type a - or 1 and the ascii value will be scanned
you would need to scan d instead to get an actual int
you would scan into an int variable instead of a chars then do a 0-255 range check to determine if it s viable to store in a single byte

27023848
width	height
using the scroll properties of the element and the deltax y properties on the event you can prevent and stop the default action when it goes below zero or above the width height

27023959
for-loop	arrays
6 where possible reuse local variables and parameters
7 use types which are no bigger than what they need to be for instance the counter variable in for-loop over 100 objects need only be as large as a char
8 place some of your initialized data arrays into code space

ssl	https
here s what you could do to watch calendar events on your dev machine point ngrok.mydomain.com to another server let s say a new ec2 micro instance point wildcard cname to ngrok.mydomain.com compile ngrok server and client to use your certificate rather than ngrok.com run the ngroku-server on ec2 instance on your dev machine config the client to use ngrok.mydomain.com instead of ngroku.com run ngrok -subdomain dev 80 your local dev machine s 80 port should be accessible via this is really cool and is very helpful when debugging google s webhooks which require valid https and a verified root domain name
another interesting trick is to use cloudflare s universal ssl to have a valid pointing to your dev machine without purchasing a certificate
the steps are exactly the same except that you need to issue your own certificate for ngrok client-server communications and use cloudflare s flex ssl for dev-machine.yourdomain.com

well basically it is a tool to allow easily include other packages using a description file which might be used by angular but not packaged for meteor yet you will likely be using it for installing ngcordova

those are now included by default into your meteor project

public	protected
it is a compile-time error if a default constructor is implicitly declared but the superclass does not have an accessible constructor 6.6 that takes no arguments and has no throws clause

noexcept	throw
since you are moving f into g there is no reason to perform a deep copy and the implementation can just move the ownership of the function stored in f to g like an unique_ptr
as for the reason why the small buffer is not used here this might be related to the fact that your implementation defines the function move constructor to be noexcept
if the move constructor of function is noexcept it can not call any function that might throw hence the implementation simply refuse to move your object from the f s small buffer to the g s one and allocates it on the heap so that it can just move a pointer in the move constructor assignment

noexcept	throw

both libstd++ and libc++ generate a copy constructor call at the line if you simply add noexcept to a s copy constructor
surprisingly they both seem to ignore the presence of a noexcept move constructor

27025028
button	checkbox
secondly use prop when setting a checkbox status rather than attr
there are also a few other things like the tag should be closed and have the attribute type set to button
alternatively you can use i ve included both in the fiddle to show they work the same

27025038
dictionary	map
in your case it will be second you need to use the cmap argument for example so in the end you ll have now the only thing left to you is to pass you proper color map to cmap
your color_map is a dictionary with only two keys 0 and 1
any value in between is not a correct key for the dictionary thus you get a keyerror

27025130
typedef	struct
you need to define the types struct node and struct studentroster instead of using the name the pointer typedef struct nodep and struct studentrosterp so the following piece of code is probably what you actually mean

mouseover	mouseout
i ve seen examples online of using the hover pseudo-class to simulate a mouseover mouseout effect in css3.

27025493
next	except
is jsut the same as the version above it except that it takes advantage of the fact that after each run last x entries are guaranteed to be sorted
it s probably easier to envisage like this procedure bubblesort somelist while somelist is not sorted loop over all elements in the list if the current item is larger than the next item swap items bubble sort basically repeatedly scans through the list swaping any two elements if they are relatively out of order
you just need to do this

27025507
hide	show
and if you wanted to hide the other p elements then do this it looks a little strange but here s how it works hide all p elements .next a select the next sibling of each p but only if it s an a element .prev now go back to the p and it will be only the ones that had an a sibling .show .css color red then show and color those remaining p elements

27025530
spaces	delimiter
the biggest thing is that you needed to specify the delimiter to use to parse the string
since that wmic command will returns strings like netconnectionid local area connection you need to indicate that you want to split the string at the instead of the spaces like it ordinarily would be
the second thing is that when you call a function you can access the parameters that are passed into it with 1 for the first parameter 2 for the second parameter etc

27025593
for-loop	loops
in case you want an explanation you are calling the .next method on your downwarditerator object and your while loops isn t checking the right iterator object to see if there are any elements left also when your first if condition is met you can use an enhanced for-loop to iterate over your enemylist if enemylist isn t being modified

27025683
bellman-ford	dijkstra
in the worst case you have to perform as many relaxations as for example the bellman-ford algorithm but you have the additional overhead of the priority queue
that makes your worst-case performance worse than bellman-ford which is therefore preferred for graphs with negative edges
this doesn t mean that your modified dijkstra isn t useful

27025683
bellman-ford	dijkstra
this doesn t mean that your modified dijkstra isn t useful
it can perform much better than bellman-ford if you have very few negative edges and or if those negative edges are separated from the rest of the graph by expensive paths
but be prepared for a quite bad worst-case performance

queue	fifo
i am looking for some class or library for java 8 which can buffer the objects in a fifo manner and automatically writes them to the database if a certain minimum size is reached. the library should be able to handle concurrency as good and fast as possible as it might occur that two items are stored into the cache at the same time
my best guess is that i could use a flavour of java.util.concurrent.blockingqueue linkedblockingqueue.drainto collection maxelements in combination with a timer which periodically polls the length of the queue

happens with both cmd and powershell i ve tried removing and reinstalling node both using the installer on nodejs.org and via chocolatey with the same result

serializable	deserialization
thank you
i need to pass a c# memory object from one process to another ipc i ve just tried to serializable this object in a file and then deserialize it in my 2nd process with binary serializable binaryformatter in order to have good performance
unfortunately the performance is not up to what i expected. as my object has a lot of information serializable and deserialization takes too much times the serializable of my object takes more than 1mb on my hard drive

27026095

the other thing you could do is make the fields private in the base class and provide getter and setter to allow the child classes to update the fields but that creates the potential for outsiders to call the setter

the term definition is defined in the introductory part of 6.7
as for the name typedef it s caused a fair amount of confusion over the years since it doesn t really define a type

post	get
another option is to do a redirect after successful form submission -- this will automatically reload the page in the browser via a get request so a subsequent refresh will not trigger a re-submission
you shouldn t refresh a page that was requested via post as the browser will re-submit the data that s why the browser shows a warning
if you change your form code to web2py will automatically create a _formkey token for the form to prevent double submission as well as to protect against csrf attacks

if you are using cross validation or grid search in scikit-learn then you can use multiple cpus with the n_jobs parameter note that cross_val_score only needs a job per forld so if your number of folds is less than your cpus you still won t be using all of your processing power
libsvm can use openmp if you can compile it and use it directly as per these instructions in the libsvm faq

this is default layout of jpanel so the gui builder will not generate any layout code and your custom panel will be left intact. so it isn t very clear why grouplayout causes this behavior but empirically to solve it you would have to set a different layout manager to the custom panels flowlayout or gridbaglayout

hash	salt
a well-designed password hashing scheme using a salt and key stretching however should remain secure assuming of course that the passwords themselves are not easily guessable even if the attacker knows the entire password hash

27029501
hash	salt
thus even if the timing attack succeeds the passwords themselves will be safe
to carry out the attack the attacker must submit passwords whose hash value they know
the hash value depends on the salt

27029501
hash	salt
however this is only because such analyses assume the worst-case scenario mentioned above where the attacker has already obtained a copy of the entire user database salt and hash and all

27029501
hash	salt
if the attacker doesn t yet know the hash there s no reason to assume they would know the salt. even if the attacker knows the salt in order to carry out the iterative attack described above they ll need to generate passwords that hash to a value with a desired prefix
for any secure hash function the only practical way to do this is by trial an error which means that the time needed to do so scales exponentially with the length of the prefix
what this means in practice is that in order to extract sufficiently many bits of the hash to be able to carry out an offline brute force attack against it which need not be all of them

in addition if you want to simulate a transaction you will need to have a pos that sends apdu commands to your hce service
nfc is hardware specific so i believe that using just an emulator is not possible

drop the leading and you ll see it. given that information if we look at the non-working example and take the loop body and replace with the string seq 1 3 to get touch seq 1 3.out
which gets us a call which runs touch seq 1 3.out and creates the files you list in your post and an empty touch variable
which explains why though you didn t ask you get make nothing to be done for test as output from running make

however now i m running into a weird issue i created my projectname-bridging-header.h and have been importing my objective-c header files as i need them in my new .swift files
i have a nested .xcodeproj inside my project and upon attempting to expose a class from that nested project to swift via my bridging header xcode stops auto-completion
funny thing is i can still run the app without problems when typing myobj xcode auto-complete shows me

qsort	strcmp
your output actually seems correct but for the fact that it still has duplicated values so i d start with what you have so far
given that it s classwork i won t give you the full solution but i will say that one option is to sort the words such as with qsort then output them in such a way that duplicates are removed
the following pseudo-code is one way to do that with a sorted array if you have troubles getting qsort to behave as you expect and many do another option is to simply remove the duplicates with something like and then output the ones that haven t been set to an empty string note that i m leaving it up to you to translate that pseudo-code into c but you should remember a couple of things string comparisons should be done with strcmp rather than and

then to get the format like you ve asked for with printf and a for loop might look something like finally your long if else chain could be significantly shortened using character.digit chars int like
the easiest way to print an int array in general is probably system.out.println arrays.tostring telnumber
your declaration of telnumber should look more like your declaration gives every element an initial count equal to it s index i m fairly certain you wanted them to be zero

spaces	delimiter	fgets	strtok
add a newline n to the delimiter argument in both calls to strtok remember fgets includes the newline in the line it reads and strtok was told to split on spaces so the newline was included with the words

27031496
spaces	delimiter
isblank recognizes spaces and tab t
isspace recognizes form feed f carriage return r newline n and vertical tab v as well as spaces and tab mark the end of the tokens that strtok is to recognize
strtok is defined to treat multiple characters from the delimiter as equivalent to one

int	chars
this step takes individual chars and combines them into tokens which are things the next step understands
this step differentiates between language keywords like for and if in c operators like + constants like int and string literals and other stuff

alertdialog	progressdialog
however in my activity when the activity is created first an alertdialog appears which leads to a rest api call and a progressdialog follows while the data is fetched from the server
the problem lies in here when i would change the configuration the activity will be recreated and i will get the alertdialog again. if i set in the manifest the color of the menu item won t change because the activity is never created again but it will avoid the alertdialog and would maintain the activity state
i am looking for a way to change the menuitem text color in the onconfigurationchanged event

radiobuttons are used for a single choice if you want to select more than one choice try to use checkboxes. if you want to use radiobuttons instead of checkboxes you should group them by using a panel or groupbox controls

put	get
client code could do things like define variables or function arguments of or hiddenstuff_b type but unless g_visible provides a factory or hiddenstuff_x s definition s included in the translation unit it can t actually get variables to point at or call with in short not having the impl declarations private is a poor choice
the difference is that they have forward declarations of the two hidden classes in global scope or if your code put g_visible in a namespace then whatever namespace that happened to be
unnecessary namespace pollution

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
so when you go up an arrays 0-9 you want the top of a for-loop to be less than the arrays length when you are going down the arrays 9-0 you want the lower bound to be less than or equal to the bottom of the arrays otherwise you will start out trying to access at 10 the arrays length and get an outofrangeexception
for example and and when you are displaying the index in a for-loop you will want to display the index and not the arrays length
also something of note - you were deducting the value of the userarray variable in two separate for loops which does not reset it when it leaves loops so at the end of the method the userarray variable would have been at - 2 userarray instead of what i think you were going for which was the index arrays length

super	self
if you are using python 2 remember when using super that you need to use the fully qualified name super socialdog.personality_2 self .super_class_method super socialdog.personality_2 self .super_class_field
to inherit from the class you specified according to the code you provided all that is required is to define the class personality_2 like this class socialdog dog #... class personality_2 dog.personality_1 #... now as for your problem when trying to use super this might be because your base classes of dog and dog.personality_1 do not inherit from the python default class object which is required in order to use the super method

data hiding it just provides a way to protect your data from the outside world

you can make things a little neater by realising that a data frame is really a list so to rank by columns in order of occurrence dense_rank ave order do.call order df df you are ranking by columns in reverse order of occurrence so dense_rank ave order do.call order rev df df or explicitly specifying columns and their order
solutions involving will only work if values within each vector are int with a fixed number of digits
this is because paste converts to chars and chars lexicographic ordering differs from numeric rank c 1 2 11

base	fractions
in 2011 peter dalgaard suggested which gives what wikipedia calls fractions ranking and in base rank is the default
your example is what wikipedia calls dense ranking which isn t available in base rank but - as commented by david arenburg - is provided by dplyr dense_rank so you can library dyplr and use looking at the code for dense_rank it is just suggesting that if you don t want to load dplyr and are happy with a 2-statement solution creating another variable - r - you could use edited to add .

in this class it would also contain all the transactions as a list the sort order should be managed by the model to this end i d add all the name objects to a list and use the collections.sort and comparator apis to simplify the process add all these objects to a comboboxmodel and use a custom listcellrenderer to customise the look for the combobox see how to use combo boxes and writing a custom cell renderer for more details use an actionlistener on the jcombobox to detect when a change occurs using the selected item get all the transactions from the name object and add them to a listmodel if you re clever you d just pass the name object to custom listmodel and it would extract the details for you
again use a listcellrenderer to customise the look of the jlist to your needs
you should also consider using a jtable which is better at displaying structured data see how to use tables for more details

printf	strlen
to that address we will add the difference p-str say 25
so the printf command will combine the two strings rep and p+strlen orig in memory beginning at the address we also know from the format string s s that both rep and p+strlen orig will likewise be type pointers
the address of rep is whatever it is but the next pointer p+strlen orig will be p say 1500 + strlen orig the length of orig assume is 20 chars

27037311
printf	strlen
the address of rep is whatever it is but the next pointer p+strlen orig will be p say 1500 + strlen orig the length of orig assume is 20 chars
so printf will read the string value beginning at address 1520 along with the string rep into buffer at address buffer+ p-str or 1025 for this example
lets say the pointers point to the following strings lets also say that so the resulting string in buffer at my fake address 1025 is

solution you either need to put the background-position property after the background shorthand so it isn t overridden or specify background-color instead of the background shorthand so the background-position isn t overridden
it is happening because you are overriding the background-position property with the background shorthand
explanation the background specifies the concatenation of the initial values of its longhand properties background-image none background-position 0 0 background-size auto auto background-repeat repeat background-origin padding-box background-style is itself a shorthand its initial value is the concatenation of its own longhand properties background-clip border-box background-color transparent source mdn background so when you set background orange after background-position in your css it implicitly gives background-position 0 0

with jasmine 2 you can use done for asynchonous test but with the way you ve created your function you can t use done. you will have to have a callback block in your method or a promise callback note the tohavebeencall syntax i would prefer a promise syntax the last problem you will have is to mock the network call if you want your test to be truly unitary else you r also testing the backend answer that could be what you want if you want to mock the call you should look at httpbackend this blog post seems to have more informations not mine edit add dependancy to test before your it use a beforeeach edit 2 ok i havn t explain it correctly try

if you want to have two distinct comparable interfaces implemented just use comparator s for them - it s generally easier to maintain composition than inherited in classes
for some applications distinguishing generics at run-time you may also try subclassing them but that would in this particular case cause more trouble than it would solve imo since you d still get comparable cannot be inherited with different arguments error - but at least you could differentiate those interfaces by instanceof

so if your sliders were within a data-role page div with an id page1 you could handle the pagecreate event and within it run the addall to get the initial total and then add a change handler to each of the sliders that also runs the addall function demo
for jquery mobile you need to make sure that you put your code within an appropriate page event so that the widgets have been created

swift	objective-c
this seems reasonable in objective-c but swift isn t very pointer-friendly and i haven t managed to create a cfdictionary taking pointers on uitouch as value

27042935
inline	inlining
i dispute this for below reasons larger and recursive functions are not inline and the compiler ignores the inline keyword
smaller functions are automatically inline by the optimizer irrespective of the inline keyword being mentioned or not
it s quite clear that the user doesn t have any control over function inlining with the use of keyword inline

27042935
inline	inlining
perception b inline has nothing to do with the concept of inlining

thats all
this is what worked for me on centos first install sudo yum install postgresql postgresql-devel python-devel on ubuntu just use the equivilent apt-get packages
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-dev python-dev and now include the path to your postgresql binary dir with you pip install this should work for either debain or rhel based linux make sure to include the correct path

folder	directory
in visual studio 2013 i struggled with this for a while and it is pretty much easy to solve just follow what the exceptions says virtual directory not being configured as an application in iis in my case i had webservice planted inside iis website so i opened the website in iis manager right clicked the wcf folder clicked convert to application and then submitted with ok wcf is back and running

27043237
width	height
thumb can set a max width and the height becomes proportional so it doesn t become distorted 2 different directories to separate thumb and original can grab image data so it can be inserted into a database very easily

27043247
children	parent
somewhere in that code try putting this line although it s hard to know if this would work without seeing more of your code than what you ve shared here
unfortunately this isn t possible using css alone because css can only select children and subsequent siblings
using jquery this can be done very simply with the parent selector

serializable	deserialization
i am doing pojo serializable deserialization using jackson. here is a pojo exemple i have to read the field productid in this json but also in to make it short i would like to use the same object to read the field in a json file found somewhere and to save the object as this in mongodb using productid as the primary key which has to be named _id . since i am using jackson fasterxml both to read from the file and to write to the database i can not find a way to do so except by creating a new class with the same fields or inheritance and fill them one by one

inherited	subclassing
but the big advantage is that it enforces the one-to-one nature of the is-a relationship between each subclassing and the superclass

sprockets	js-routes	sprockets	browserify-rails
what is the correct way to have sprockets preprocess a file before bundling it with browserify-rails
i m using browserify-rails and i m trying to get sprockets to preprocess a file that contains a sprockets directive so that when i require it using browserify it will contain the generated javascript
the sprockets directive tries to include the output of the gem js-routes in order to allow me to access the rails routes from the clientside

27044183
sprockets	js-routes
within system react_routes.js i have the following as an aside i configured js-routes to place the output in an object called module.exports so to comply with the commonjs model as described in railsware js-routes#121 the only issue is that when i look at the generated bundle the sprockets directive is still there and has not been expanded

int	chars
in haskell a proxy is a type witness value that makes it easy to pass some types around an example use is here in json-schema so you could do schema proxy proxy int chars to obtain what the json representation for an int-char-tuple would be probably an array

mouse	keyboard
in case if you are simulating mouse keyboard actions like hitting enter clicking on particular coordinate etc in your script it will work fine even if mouse and keyboards are not connected to a computer

width	height
i have a uiview with a height of 100 and a width of 50

27044242
getter	setter
i do not really understand how getter and setter work althougth it is a basic concept

27044272
put	get
i m wondering if i can get any tips to speed up the calculations
the iterative functions has to put the value as close to zero as possible and it decreases or increases until the conditions are met
i sped it up by increasing by 1 then when it gets closer to the range it increments by 0.1 for precision

27044300
implements	extends
basically i have 1 main class which extends jframe and implements actionlistener and i have created a window which is my main window

27044369
post	get
it gets redirected to init because im not logged in
i make a post with username and password to the node server
after that i can get the projects json through localhost 3001 projects

27044369
post	get
now on the client
i make a http post with username and password onto the node server i can log in no errors
after that i make a http get to projects nut now i cant reach it because the req.isauthenticated in the isloggedin function returns false

27044537
getter	setter
the call of getter and setter methods by expressions is not part of jsf but expression language most known as el

27044537
getter	setter	getter	setter
jsf takes advantage of el to bind the data of the html components to the fields of a bean through proper getters and setter
this is if the bean exists expression language will execute the proper getter of the registered bean in the proper scope
if client performs a form submission or an ajax request then the components that are sent to the server usually all the components in the in case of ajax requests you can state which components to send to the server will contain a new value and this value will be set to the field with the proper setter method

27044537
getter	setter
the steps explained here are a very small explanation and with lot of elements not explained of the jsf lifecycle and how jsf uses getter and setter

27044787
pull	push
once all tcp connections to the git-daemon disappear completely from ss -atp the next git pull or push request is slow then followed by fast once etc

27044792
folder	directory
your directory structure is different from the default one shown here you have to put the packages folder and these files into the public directory .htaccess favicon.ico index.php robots.txt then to make your site work again change the document root of your apache server to path to application public there s a reason for the public directory

27044792
folder	directory
when you put it on a server on the internet you gain additional security because the user can only access what is in the public directory
because the domain is pointing to this folder if you use your current setup everybody could see your whole application
for example one could enter example.com app config database.php and would see your database password

27044814
dns	spf
it has to go in your dns server
to check what s in your dns install the dnsutils package which should include the dig utility
you can then look up dns records like this there you can see looking up txt records for google.com and that gives your their spf which is actually slightly sub-optimal as the ip4 clauses should come before the include

27044821
floating-point	integer
from the swift programming language unlike with integer literals negative floating-point numbers are expressed by applying the unary minus operator - to a floating-point literal as in -42.0

27044841
int	chars
you are running into jls-5.1.4 widening and narrowing primitive conversion the following conversion combines both widening and narrowing primitive conversions byte to chars first the byte is converted to an int via widening primitive conversion 5.1.2 and then the resulting int is converted to a chars by narrowing primitive conversion 5.1.3

27044859
jar	war
i have a simple j2ee application made up of a web-tier war an ejb tier interfaces implementations and a business tier jar

27044890
children	parent
if your parent class declares a constructor children cannot use an implicit constructor because the parent class basically indicates i cannot be instantiated implicitly so to provide the necessary information the child classes must also declare at least one explicit constructor

27044904
superclass	subclassing
the information required for a subclassing often isn t the same as the information required for a superclass

27044913
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
the right way to go about providing items for the navigation bar is to override uiviewcontroller s navigationitem property and return a customized uinavigationitem instance
this way when you push and pop view controllers off of the uinavigationcontroller s stack the navigation bar will be updated automatically
this is an example from a uiviewcontroller subclass in one of my projects

27044943
inline	inlining
i wasn t sure about your claim smaller functions are automatically inline by optimizer irrespective of inline is mentioned or not... it s quite clear that the user doesn t have any control over function inlining with the use of keyword inline

27044943
clang	llvm
i looked through the github repository for clang and llvm to find out

27044943
clang	llvm
i found out that the inline keyword does make clang llvm more likely to inline a function

27044943
clang	llvm
inside that function we set a bit and emit a warning if it s a duplicate inline searching for fs_inline_specified elsewhere we see it s a single bit in a bitfield and it s used in a getter function isinlinespecified searching for call sites of isinlinespecified we find the codegen where we convert the c++ parse tree into llvm intermediate representation clang to llvm we are done with the c++ parsing stage

27044943
clang	llvm
we switch from clang to the llvm repository

27044943
inline	inlining
in inliner runonscc inlinecallifpossible does the inlining based on shouldinline s decision
so the threshold was affected by the inline keyword and is used in the end to decide whether to inline
therefore your perception b is partly wrong because at least one major compiler changes its optimization behavior based on the inline keyword

27044957
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
instead try using a parser such as beautifulsoup
make sure you also install lxml and html5lib as well for best performance and access to all the features
pip install lxml html5lib beautifulsoup4 should do the trick

jtabbedpane	jscrollpane
i have a jtabbedpane which two tabs including two jscrollpane

27044994
width	height
each item whould stretch to occupy the whole width of the control and have its height set so that the items are uniformly distributed

27044994
width	height
note that each item occupies one fourth of the available height and all of them have the same width currently i have this code xaml and trackview contains problem is each listviewitem from listview is rendered with irregular proportions

27045006
width	height
what you could do is save height and width of screen once the page is shown pagecontainershow

27045006
width	height
if the current height width is greater than inital height width ignore the swipe

27045064
hash	salt
password recovery reset goes only to the e-mail account on file make sure your send a reset link expires after a certain time or after it has been used whichever comes first hash stored passwords in the database use salt instead of plain hash

27045064
ssl	https
get a certificate for the server and use https at the minimum the login credentials absolutely need to be passed over ssl

27045064
ssl	https
it will also help to have the entire website on https instead of just the login page
ssl is no longer computationally expensive anymore
having the entire site over ssl prevents any sslstrip attacks

27045225
post	get
therefore pointing out that my lcycle is fine misses what i m trying to get at
i m sorry i did not make this point sufficiently clear in my original post
this implementation of ltake as well as the definition of the lazylist type above comes from here

27045249
min	max
also don t use min and max as variable names

27045249
min	max
therefore in general the formula that you wrote above exactly transforms your data so that it fits between min and max

27045295
put	get
i m trying to make client side validation using javascript on the page if the value is something submit form otherwise display message value must be something maybe i can do something like but how do i get the new value i just put in

windows	wow64
in windows 7 server 2008 r2 and later it s actually possible to remove the wow64 layer that allows 32-bit programs to run

27045324
windows	wow64
if you marked the executable as x86 it wouldn t run at all without wow64 but if you used any cpu + prefer 32-bit it would run as a 64-bit process instead
the defaults for visual studio 2013 are any cpu and prefer 32-bit for new windows forms and windows service projects
tested on update 3. projects upgraded from older versions of visual studio may have different settings

27045324
versioning	upgrade
tested on update 3. projects upgrade from older versions of visual studio may have different settings
this might explain why projectb works while projecta doesn t if projectb was created on an older versioning or if someone has changed that setting

stdout	stderr
watch the stringio instance for new lines and when a new line is arrived you can yield it to the streaminghttpresponse see this answer for an example
you can wrap the fabric functions run sudo with your own version and override their stdout there
docs says to override which local streams are used to display remote stdout and or stderr specify stdout or stderr

27045463
stdout	stderr
docs says to override which local streams are used to display remote stdout and or stderr specify stdout or stderr
by default the regular sys.stdout and sys.stderr python stream objects are used. then you can pass a stringio an in-memory file-like object instance to the stdout parameter
watch the stringio instance for new lines and when a new line is arrived you can yield it to the streaminghttpresponse see this answer for an example

pull	push
if you pushed just a html file with no buildpack then you would likely get an error indicating the buildpack could not be determined
bluemix tries to guess the type of buildpack you want based on the type of files uploaded and then pull the buildpack from an internal cache
the cf push command allows you to explicitly state the buildpack to use -b so there is no guess work and no need to rely on only the buildpack that bluemix currently knows about

27046020
folder	directory	folder	directory
to use it simply supply that url with the -b option on the cf push command from the root directory of your application cf push yourappname -b be sure you are issuing this command from your app directory
the yourappname will be part of the url for your website app for an actual example we will upload your index.html which exist in folder c users xyz documents projects projecthelloworld and we will call this app helloworld
here is what we would do bluemix will then upload everything in that local directory to the server and also grab the buildpack from the url location and stage your application code with the buildpack bluemix will then attempt to start the application

27046020
folder	directory
here is what we would do bluemix will then upload everything in that local directory to the server and also grab the buildpack from the url location and stage your application code with the buildpack bluemix will then attempt to start the application

it has a lot of demos and examples

27046202
for-loop	loops
you are using the short form of the for-loop so that only the command forms the body of loops

27046202
for-loop	loops
instead ensure that the sleep command is in the body of the for-loop with you could also put sleep 1 inside the construct that forms the body of the short-form for-loop but i recommend avoiding that form except for quick one-off loops in interactive shells.

however it seems that the build step involving gulp-inject won t work once gulp-watch gets involved
seemingly the reason is that the watch stream never ends and gulp-inject doesn t know when to start

super	implements
i noticed when debugging that the visible cells property gets set to an empty array therefore when you start to dispose visible cells they no longer exist hence it becomes an array of zero elements
another thing i noticed is that you will run into inconsistency exceptions if you don t remove the parameter view from its super view i ve noticed especially with setting the layout of the collection view
other than that i ve had to implements something similar on our side

rss	feed	rss	feed
so even when you specifically open the rss feed as a page it will try to render the html
but since rss elements tags don t have a meaning as html they are rendered as a generic block element
some browsers in fact show rss feed in a specific way when they encounter them but not so phantomjs

27048625

you can still do things on the rss feed elements casper.getelementattribute and others still work but be aware that when you specifically have to select elements based on namespaces then a slight workaround has to be done

i am using the google maps api to show traffic conditions in my area and i was wondering if it was possible to hide the actual map portion of it so that only the traffic layer is visible the green red yellow traffic lanes and road names would be visible but the background would be transparent or a solid color instead of showing the map

polymorphism	specialization
using debugger and disassembly mode - the issue source would be system.runtimetypehandle.instantiate system.type
the issue is located at structuremap s class inheritance. usage of c# dynamic involves creation of polymorphism callsites which ones does use runtime binders
consider simplified inheritance tree for lambdainstance class as shown above inherites but with specialization of . so specialization of generic parameter t is child type definition - . this creates circular reference in a case of getting constructed type at runtime as required by runtime binders for invariant polymorphism behaviour

the double brackets feel unnecessary and it would be nice if list behaved more like python dictionaries but once you get used to the it is very much similar. you can chose your own stance on the variety of ways to do the same thing in r as someone who has only come to it recently i find it often difficult to read but it is quite the language and the hassle might just be worth it. enjoy
there is some goofy syntax in r for sure to reiterate what others have said this pattern extends into higher dimensional lists the as well as can be used to access lists at particular indices but int indices must be designated with is probably the safe bet

disclaimer i ve never done a google-chrome extension but based on the rest of your question it sounds like it s just working with javascript like any other web page so i ll go ahead and answer it
in any case working with cookies in javascript can be somewhat of a pain i m assuming that your server side already works with and expects cookies so i won t try to suggest any alternatives

the result will be similar to this note how the series formula show the range names instead of the cell ranges

google-chrome	firefox
at this point i should say that i personally love firefox as a browser and my strong preference is to keep using it however for our business clean editing markup is critical and in google-chrome using the above method excluding insertbronreturn produces the desired markup the above keypress event function switches google-chrome cleanly to use p rather than its standard div so i am in a difficult position and i would welcome any input from other firefox enthusiasts as to how the above can be achieved elegantly if indeed it is possible please don t invest time providing complex hacks though as we are unlikely to use them - in my limited experience complexity is diametrically opposed to reliability thanks in advance for any help
ps - after working with this i m really not sure that the google-chrome div implementation is any better - see comments below

entities	entitymanager
transactionmanager is totally different to entitymanager one is in charge of the entities listener entities relationships persistence lifecycle of them and this interface defines the methods that are used to interact with the persistence context associated with an specific persistence context where the entities are alive meanwhile transactionmanager is responsible for transactional data access giving support to all the transaction that need to occurs within your application

27050235
entities	entitymanager
which it means the connection to the database and entities are managed by the entitymanager but the object that open an close transaction in the service layer using the transaction annotation is the transactionmanager

27050235
entities	entitymanager
so basically inject one of these objects depends on what you are looking for manage entities and operate with them use entitymanager control the transactional state of your application by yourself use the transactionmanager

you can put the main body of code into a function and call it again from the timer
note this is not technically rerunning a promise it s rerunning a block of code that will then resolve the promise when done fyi i also added a retry count so the code can never get stuck in an error loop

i forgot to say that this code does not use a specified comparator but according to the documentation it is supposed to use the compareto if your class implements comparable which is what i am using. i tried also specifying a comparator but it did not work either
here is my problem the collections.sort line works just fine in java 8u5 and before but in java 8u20 they seem to have changed the code for collections.sort and it no longer uses anything but the natural order even if you specify a comparator

equals	compareto
now as you have correctly pointed out if you do not specify a comparator the natural ordering of the class that is the compareto method you have defined is used
however the comparable class documentation also states the following it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals
this is so because sorted sets and sorted maps without explicit comparators behave strangely when they are used with elements or keys whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals

27050503
equals	compareto
this is so because sorted sets and sorted maps without explicit comparators behave strangely when they are used with elements or keys whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals
in particular such a sorted set or sorted map violates the general contract for set or map which is defined in terms of the equals method
since the class instructortreenode does not override object#equals your compareto method may return 0 even if returns false

uicollectionviewcell	uitableview
assuming that your uitableview cells are the width and height of the screen you could configure the embedded collection view to basically paginate horizontally since uicollectionview is a subclass of uiscrollview
when setting up the collection view use uicollectionviewflowlayout as the layout object and configure it up like so you then place each page of content in a custom uicollectionviewcell and the collection view will paginate them for you
this has the added bonus of providing you with a paginated scrolling api for free

readonly	temporary
one way to achieve what you want would include the following steps temporary rooting the device converting the app in question into a system app using titanium backup root but there are also other apps helping you with this step unroot the device again as the app now resides in readonly space system the user cannot delete it without either rooting the device or flashing a rom -- which of course could be done but it s a higher inhibition threshold at least

27052566
range	infinity
for example i m guessing that you don t actually want to troll your players with a score command when you don t keep score but that should show you the ideal. if you want to get clever there s an even simpler way to do this just loop over all the numbers from 1 to infinity
the count function which works kind of like range except there s no stop value because it never stops from itertools import count for counter in count 1 # the rest of your code

i think this guide from apple may be the most relevant
if you are intending to work with uidocument and icloud this guide from apple is pretty good edited don t know of any better guide of hand so this may help you will need to fetch the ubiquityurl using the urlforubuiquitycontaineridentifier function on nsfilemanager which should be done asynchronously . once that is done you can use code like the following to create your document
you ll also want to look into using nsmetadataquery to detect documents uploaded from other devices and potentially queue them for download and observing the nspersistentstoredidimportubiquitouscontentchangesnotification to find about changes made via icloud among other things

min	max
i ve learned that constantly adding to and resetting vectors takes up a lot of time so i m not sure how to go about storing bodies in cells of the grid
from my understanding everything in the grid is always subject to change since if the min x or y changes the position of 0 0 will change as well and since obviously there are moving bodies the third index would have to be reset and re-added to every single frame
i m not sure what i m supposed to do differently but i m sure there s something wrong with the way i have this set up or the way i m thinking about it edit the size of the grid in the x and y position are also subject to change since the difference between max and mins can differ 1000 is just a value i plugged in there that will work for me for right now

27054390
int	chars
my goal is to using a array for the grammar check each chars in the input string against the grammar and return true if the string is contained within the grammar
in my algorithm pn is an int to keep track of which production in the grammar i am currently looking at and to make sure that i don t scan the same grammar twice e.g a pn of 1 in above grammar would correspond to aasa
also i have 0 represent the empty string

if you want a different timespan use a different interval if both columns are defined as date which also includes a time in oracle the result of subtracting one from the other is an integer representing the difference in fractions days

27056123
highcharts	highstock
i have a master page which calls in other web pages using jquery.load for example project.prx is in an in-house cgi language like coldfusion and it s pumping out html and javascript. in the browser debugger i get error messages like the following every time i click on a link viz uncaught highcharts error #16 www.highcharts.com errors 16 highcharts website says of this error highcharts error #16 highcharts already defined in the page this error happens the second time highcharts or highstock is loaded in the same page so the highcharts namespace is already defined

27056123
highcharts	highstock
keep in mind that the highcharts.chart constructor and all features of highcharts are included in highstock so if you are running chart and stockchart in combination you only need to load the highstock.js file
as i m using jquery s load and targeting a div in the current document it is a fair call for highcharts to claim that i m loading a second instance of the namespace
nevertheless this is what i want to do

27056204
folder	directory
for example application name | | - web_inf | - jsp - if this folder having jsp files | - common css | - js then the path of css in jsp file is like here single . dot represent current directory that is jsp direcrory folder and double .. dot previous upper directory that is application main project directory from this directory its points to common css style.css

27056206
int	double	int	chars
i ve tried casting it into an int a byte a chars a float and a double

27056253
inherited	properties
a lot of css properties inherited a similar pattern such as the shorcut for padding margin etc

27056270
ng-submit	ng-show	ng-submit	ng-switch
first you should wrap related form fields in a single modal object instead of multiple modal objects
like and secondly you should use ng-submit or ng-click for the form submitting action like or thirdly you should use ng-model to get the data out of the form instead of serialize
and finally if you want to show some feedback other than text to the user you should use ng-show ng-switch ng-class or ng-style when possible

27056272
post	get
state kalle redirect_uri mycallbakurls response_type code client_id myclientid when i then try to do a post to with i get error invalid_grant back

27056300
single-quotes	double-quotes
a third idea is to go back to sqlclr but to create a scalar function that takes in the table name and id as parameters
you can then make use of the context connection which is the in-process connection hence fast and build a dynamic sql statement of select from table where id value obviously check inputs for single-quotes and dashes to avoid sql injection
when you call sqldatareader you can not only step through each field easily but you then also have insight into the datatype of each field and can determine if it is numeric and if so then don t put the double-quotes around the value in the output

27056322
mp4	h.264
the only codec supported for ie is h.264 with mp4 you can bypass the container mov if the video is encoded in h.264

27056346
width	height
try this for your 1st problem you need to give some width to .wrapper_menu for the 2nd problem remove extra padding from remove padding from both also give proper height to .wrapper_menu .menu

27056556
folder	directory
the problem is that the contents inside the folder keep on changing dynamically and the idea of adding kcfurlisexcludedfrombackupkey for every files sounds a bit difficult as there are multiple classes in my code which can write to the documents directory

27056586
put	get
another way is via the rest api jira-base-url rest api 2 field it s a get request so just put that url in your browser

27056628
post	get
the ajax code and the web service this is the error i get when i send a request 500 internal server error the path of the web service is right and i enabled post and get requests in the service s web.config

27056688
inherited	properties
for example note that in the above example getcommonproperty and setcommonproperty int are inherited from the commonbase class and can be used in instances of objects of type subtype1 and subtype2
so we have inherited here but we don t really have polymorphism yet as will be explained below
you may or may not want to instantiate objects of the base class but you can still use it to collect specify behaviour methods and properties fields that all derived classes will inherit

27056735
google-chrome	firefox
the map is displayed ok in firefox and google-chrome or in android 4.x s webkit

27056980
width	height
using auto layout here s what you need to do make sure you aren t adding fixed width and or height constraints to any of your subviews depending on which dimension s you want to dynamically size

27057165
hide	show
instead of this i need to use display none and show because visibility hidden method just hide the div it s not remove the div space .if i show the second div it s comes under the first div

27057205
punctuation	words
if you want to keep the trailing leading punctuation with the words that are not present in exclude first one is equivalent to

27057289
hide	show
you can use display none to hide the particular div you can similarly show this div by you can also hide a particular div by adding the display attribute to it

27057398
elasticsearch	kibana
modify elasticsearch configuration file elasticsearch.yml append or modify following configurations it is caused by kibana page trying to load jason data from elasticsearch which will be blocked for security reason

27057537
min	max
first you need to take out the size of the partition as you will handle that with scales remove it not comment it next you have to use and arc that does depend on the scales like in the example as you can see the max and min are kind of squeezing the hidden segments.

logarithm	modulo
it s not necessarily efficient but it works
notice that you can use the length of the input in digits to compute its logarithm
you can use this to perform division and therefore modulo

27058231
integer	unsigned	integer	unsigned
in this case you can use printf time u unsigned int time 0
on most system time_t is define on the same number of bit than integer and is always positive
in this case you can use printf time u unsigned int time 0

i put also a sleep to slow down the write process but it didn t help
the problem is that in my cluster i get a lot of hints and i m forced to repair nodes continuously. keep in mind that i need to generate 600 days of data

g++	gcc
i ve been trying to get the threadsanitizer to work with the gcc release i have 4.8.2 so i took their simple example and compiled it without as follows g++ -o testtsan testtsan.cpp -lpthread this is good then i added the thread sanitizer g++ -o testtsan testtsan.cpp -lpthread -fsanitize thread but of course this fails without -pie -fpic g++ -o testtsan testtsan.cpp -lpthread -fsanitize thread -pie -fpic which then compiles however when running i get when checking through strace this appears to be because it tries to mmap a 1tb of memory so fails with enomem

hide	show
you can hide this included layout with calling setvisibility v.setvisibility view.gone and show it later with calling v.setvisibility view.visible to reference button and textview from support layout you can use findviewbyid method on your included view i m not sure but i think it s even not mandatory you can call it directly on your activity s view if it s not working try with button btn button supportlayout.findviewbyid r.id.btn

typedef	typename
if i want to see the return type of getbar with intellisense i see it resolved the template typename to barwrite which is great. if i want to see the return type of getbundy with intellisense it does not get resolved to bundywrite as expected but i als noticed that if i use a typedef for t in foobaset and use that as the return type of getbar instead of t it also does not get resolved to barwrite
so i guess it has to do with the typedef
is there any chance to get the resolved concrete class types for intellisense

stdout	stderr
to suppress stdout and stderr you simply redirect the output like this

27060416
stdout	stderr
the first redirection will redirect the standard output to dev null which will suppress it
this standard output are things that are written to the screen by commands not errors when executing echo hello the hello will be a line of stdout
the second redirection will couple stderr or standard error to the same location as standard output so also to dev null

so your parameter named should reflect that and possibly change the method named to addflavour too
look at the code the parameter flavours is shadowing your field flavours so the compiler is trying to find an add method in string not arraylist
you could just explicitly qualify it this.flavours.add flavours but it would be much better to change the parameter named

phpstorm	webstorm
so i guess when you reference a library that is physically located outside of the project it should be listed there
in phpstorm the stuff listed under external libraries branch will include phar files folders from settings | php | include paths folders that are not part of the actual project but still referenced for code completion libraries installed globally
quite likely it s the same here in webstorm for javascript libraries global npm modules or whatever

for-loop	arrays
i am getting values from some source using which i need to create a dictionary of dictionary. to solve such a task in php i would just write a for-loop and i do not need to bother if a value really exists in my associative arrays - it will be created if it isn t. in python though you get a key error so i have to check that and add a dictionary if it isn t there to me that looks very ugly and i think there is way of doing that as simple as in a php example

27061306
width	height
find the code below- also android layout_gravity center_vertical is used to align the buttons in a row in case they contain variable length text. use of 0dp and weight it a pretty neat yet not so well known trick
the best solution i could find is to use a linear layout horizontal for each row you want and within it assign the button cell width to 0dp and the weight to 1
for each of the linear layouts rows assign the height to 0dp and the weight to 1

27061453
aggregate-functions	sum
this can be sorted with an if statement but it s even more bulky than the original
the second solution can t be used for time averaging because it s not an aggregate-functions
the best solution i ve managed actually uses a stored function which you can create if you have the privileges on the database as follows you can then calculate the average by calling on the function within a query select vavgtest sum sin radians winddirection sum cos radians winddirection as vectoraverage from table group by hour mytimestamp dayofyear mytimestamp year mytimestamp order by mytimestamp

27061586

that s why you probably shouldn t add another directory level there
however if you want other folder in the repository beside proj at the same level then it might make sense to make the parent folder a repository and add the folder there
note though that usually you would want to make one repository for each separate project

inherited	properties
you can also create usercontrol with assumption it will always work with only specific type of datacontext and then you just use path from that view model type but then datacontext of that usercontrol must always be of the view model it s designed for mostly inherited through visual tree i would also change type of icon properties from image to imagesource for example

since the chars 4 comes before the chars 9 444 comes before 9
if you make those fields int fields then they will be sorted numerically
it s helpful here to use properly typed tableview s and tablecolumn s instead of raw types

i have a cocoapods workspace project written in objective-c with ios7 target and ios8.1 sdk. when i add a new widget today extension target and set the app id to .today add a provisioning profiling it runs fine on the simulator. on the device however i can t start it using debugging xcode is stuck in waiting to attach mode and if i manually open today view i can t see my app name in the edit button. the host app works just fine after adding the new target. i have arm64 architecture enabled in the widget. i tried the widget in both swift and objective-c

emacs	lighttable
i suggest you to give lighttable a try and also this tutorial to see the great integration lighttable has with clojure and clojurescript as inline evaluation ctrl+enter and documentation with ctrl+d with almost no setup you can easily add emacs keybindings through a plugin

entities	entitymanager
i have seen problems when the entity equality is based on a proxy gets in the session and when it gets unwrapped as the real object you get equals that returns false
and when you override equals and hashcode to use the generated id because that one is generated only on persist all non-persisted entities have id null and therefore are all equal to one another
from what i read when you use a traditional id generation technique autoincrement let s say the id is generated when the entitymanager is flushed

nsurl	nsstring
minor improvement to ujell s solution if you use nsurl instead of a nsstring you can use any url custom urls have fun

27063056
for-loop	loops
the equivalent to your while loops using a for-loop is if you just wanted the end result you could use

27063253
fontfamily	font-size
i just want to do this the correct way so it will adapt well also to different media sizes later on
in my application i set the text size like this this results in this size of font when i inspect some text fontfamily arial helvetica sans-serif
font-size 14px

27063298
xargs	zcat
in your case test we have some gz files in the current directory let s find them and print just the first field on the first line and the output is i think you are looking for something like this find finds files and -print0 prints its name
xargs -0 allows you to handle what is coming from the previous pipe
with -i file we name it file so that we can then do zcat file | awk

27063298
xargs	zcat
with -i file we name it file so that we can then do zcat file | awk
interesting reading xargs how to control and use command line arguments .

capistrano	rvm
i am having trouble launching my application in the server because of the following error the error is self descritive but i don t know how to fix it since i have in my gemfile script ruby 2.0.0 and in my capistrano deployment script set rvm_ruby_string ruby-2.0.0-p353 set bundle_dir home blabla .rvm gems ruby-2.0.0-p353 bin in my server i set my environment variables as following rvm use ruby-2.0.0-p353 and the output of env rails_env testenvir bundle exec ruby -v is i could verify by connecting through a new terminal that rvm list produces finally my crashing command is defined in the eye script that tries launching the following command i verified that # working_directory and # rails_env are correct so i thought about hardcoding as a first step the paths of bundle and unicorn since they are the one taken from the 2.1.0 instead of the 2.0.0-p353 the error that i get in unicorn.log.

for-loop	arrays
you should use a nested for-loop if you want to check if any single number in arrays a is also in arrays b

27064047

switching	screens
i am putting the screens shot of the window how it looks like. you can see the sub window is new but it is opened inside the main window and the control is totally on it
i tried using window-handles alerts and also i tried without switching the window. but none of the idea worked for me. once i select the element a new browser sub-window opens up
now the control is on the new sub-window which i cannot detect at all

27064153
folder	directory
if you add a top-level folder called cordova-build-override to your meteor project the directory tree that it contains will be added to the .meteor local cordova-build folder just before the build and compilation step
so put your custom appdelegate.m in a new folder called
mkdir -p cordova-build-override platforms ios foo classes cp .meteor local cordova-build platforms ios foo classes appdelegate.m cordova-build-override platforms ios foo classes the meteor-cordova integration page on the github meteor wiki is the best place so far to find the details of cordova development with meteor

google-chrome	firefox
roughly this event is removed when the dropdown closes
this worked fine in google-chrome and it works in ie as long as you fall back to the deprecated mousewheel event instead of using the more modern wheel event
firefox however is a different story

27064283
for-loop	arrays
this algorithm is o n log k where n is the number of nodes in the tree and k is the number of items you want
the basic algorithm is assuming that k is the number of items you want to select when the for-loop is done your heap contains the k largest values
you can obtain them in ascending order with if you want them in ascending order remove them from the heap as above into an arrays and then reverse the arrays

27064303
ienumerable	iqueryable
in this case you may have to call asenumerable or any other method that forces the iqueryable to execute eg select with no arguments is not an ienumerable or iqueryable method so i suppose it s a method provided by some other orm

27064496
folder	dir
this might be a solution but before i try that out i d like to now or there isn t a good clojure library around
i would like to zip a folder recursevely with clojure
an example of such a folder would be a b c ccc.txt bb.txt c a.txt b.txt option 1 using the os from within clojure what works with zip in ubuntu is to execute following in the root of this structure but you have to be in the working dir in order to do this

27064697
width	margin
so what you need to go is get all the imgs widths together imgwidth then find the window width windowwidth then determine the margin dmargin which is windowwidth - imgwidth divided by the number of imgs + 1 for 2 elements there is 3 white spaces 1 to the left of the first img 1 inbetween them and 1 to the right as so then you need to apply that full margin to only the left of the first img and the right of the second image and then only half of dmargin to the rest because the right of img1 and left of img2 need to be half of the dmargin so that together it is the full dmargin

27064885
hide	show
show hide functionality 2 the 4th row will have set of child elements if i start putting text in each cell it will look really nasty

implements	extends
so question is is tabhost available if we implements tabbar appearance by extends tablistener interface

27065127
implements	extends
public class tabbaractivity extends actionbaractivity implements actionbar.tablistener

27065135
pull	push
the correct way to handle symlinks in git between multiple systems is to use it the way it was designed to be used which is to have multiple clones and push and pull between them

27065140
textblock	repeatbutton
if you define the appearance of the repeatbutton once all repeatbuttons will use have that appearance even if the repeatbutton is inside a controltemplate
just to shed some light on why the textblock doesn t find its implicit style there is a curious rule in wpf implicit styles are only inherited across template boundaries by elements which inherit from the control class
elements which do not inherit from control will not probe for implicit styles outside of the parent template

27065156
addition	multiplication
multiplication and addition processes are very hard in nsnumber objects convert it to int value to perform processes than back to nsnumber object

27065570
min	max
the gpu has hardware instructions for integer min and max

27065570
division	modulo	division	multiplication
for other compile-time constant values of n a small instruction sequence is emitted that typically involves integer multiplication and shifting
for variable n determined at runtime the modulo will basically require a full integer division which is at least 15 or so instructions
so other than for the case of compile-time constant n being a power of two clamping using min and max seems preferable over a modulo based solution from a performance perspective

27065577
width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
i have done some investigation which you can see here to include a sample html css the scenario the 2nd section should collapse with the 3rd section moving left alongside the 1st section
the problem if i have padding and or border on the div that is being collapsed when the width reaches a certain amount on collapse the divs wrap around causing the height to increase pushing subsequent elements downwards
i tried with box-sizing border-box but this has a clear wrapping effect as well

27065577
width	border-box
i tried with box-sizing border-box but this has a clear wrapping effect as well
i tried to transition the padding and border-width as well as the width but again it still wraps
i could experiment with different durations but it still has a strange effect

27066101
for-loop	loops
i is then incremented to 5 and is executed
just use a for-loop instead or use either way
personally i find the for-loop more readable to answer your question using gdb you ve compiled using the -g flag so run gdb compiled_file_name in gdb set a break-point in the while loops start the program run use step or next to step through the code use p i to check the value of i every time you hit the while condition and every time you use i as offset for more details docs for gdb are available

27066134
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
however the view and any related constraints are not added to the view hierarchy and the view has a superview property of nil
so a test for a valid superview works as a solution but i ve found that it has to come quite late - in viewdidappear
the superviews are still nil in viewwillappear for example

put	get
example bob jones e100 e95 e87 q10 q10 q8 h10 h10 h10 joe smith q10 q10 h7 h10 h9 h10 e80 it seems easy enough to get the program to store each name in an array but i am struggling with the code for getting it to pull e100 e95 etc
and put them in the exams array for example
the code i have so far will obviously not do that and is instead set up to just add one integer to each array in the order they are entered edit1 weights this is how the user enters grade item details at the start of the program exams number points weight 3 100 60 user presses enter quizzes number points weight 3 10 20 user presses enter homework number points weight 3 10 20 user presses enter the first number is the amount of exams quizzes homework in the course second number is the max points for each exam quiz homework the third number is the weight of exams quizzes homework in the final grade

floating-point	integer
it could be an integer type or a floating-point type it can t be complex -- fortunately

27066562
int	double
mingw probably won t handle printing a long double value correctly but mingw uses a signed int type for time_t so that s not an issue. this will print a raw value that isn t meaningful unless you happen to know how time_t is represented both what type it is and how it represents the current time

swift	objective-c
if you want that to be handle correctly you can use something like example in objective-c and i only needed the rightview
this is what i am using right now swift 4.2 swift 4 swift 3 i never set a other padding but you can tweak
this class doesn t take care of the rightview and leftview on the textfield

27066802
libstdc++	libc++
the short answer is you cannot use gcc to build c++ code on os x 10.9 and newer because apple switched to using libc++ instead of libstdc++ and gcc is incompatible with that runtime

27066804
awt	swing
if you want to enable the user to choose which path to save his text file i think you should use jfilechooser swing or jfiledialog awt

i have a rss feed and i need to extract the latest pubdate element from it for my test

27067493
for-loop	loops
because return immediately exits the function returning control to the caller the i++ statement of the for-loop will never get executed hence your bug
you likely intended for that to be outside the for-loop
another problem with that being in loops is that loops is not guaranteed to execute

the messages you see in your log is because java.security.accesscontrolexception is an unchecked-exception it is a runtimeexception . when a java.lang.runtimeexception is thrown from the ejb method the container will roll back the transaction discard the ejb bean instance throw the runtimeexception wrapped by javax.ejb.ejbexception to the client

27067790
rss	feed
a simple mapping afterwards generates an array that you can work on afterwards but since you only want the latest one and rss feed are sorted newest to oldest you can simply use the first one note the lack of an s in getelementinfo you previous approach would have worked if you would have done this in the page context

27067846
put	get
if you make sure that your calculations are in c for instance declare i to be long and put the data element into a cdefed variable or cast it before calculation you won t get this error

27068036
superclass	subclassing
it s about protecting the internal implementations of the objects involved and providing the author of the subclassing with a contract that limits what the subclassing needs to know about the superclass

27068036
superclass	subclassing
if the language allowed the subclassing to change any variables of any superclass then there would be too much potential for the subclassing to break the superclass and no way to change the superclass implementation details without risking breakage to the subclassing

this xml first calls nuget.exe restore path .sln file if the .sln file is not mentioned it picks up any other solution file in the same directory check in the build.proj nuget.exe all in the root folder along with the solution file now things are going smooth for me with the tfs online ci

floating-point	integer
that has the obvious meaning for integer types including _bool
for floating-point types it s effectively compared against 0.0 or 0.0f or 0.0l
for pointer types it s compared to a null pointer

folder	directory
for my specific case the resource directory is located in var lib ambari-server resources i found that because in the error log listed above it shows that it s trying to look under the resources directory so i used the find cmd
i then simply just downloaded a copy of the exact jdk version that it was looking for this is in the error log and mine was jdk-7u45-linux-x64.tar.gz from the internet and placed it in the resource folder and everything worked

in excel 2010 and later versions aggregate-functions works a little bit like subtotal - it can perform various functions while ignoring hidden rows.......but it also has options to ignore error values so without any helper columns you can use this single formula 9 denotes sum as per subtotal while 7 as the 2nd argument indicates that error values and hidden values should be ignored

if you are using this pattern to serve html partials for an ajax-style dynamic-replacement div in a web app this is fine although if these partials are not needing processing or can be defined at deployment time rather than being put and get d from datastore for example then it s best to simply link them in as static resources using the appengine-web.xml app.yaml depending on java or python go php i hope this has helped you think more about your use-case

filtering	grouping
it looks to me that gjreda s answer was only missing your cutoff filtering so assuming event_date and id are not in the index this gives the same output as before but the cutoff is arbitrary and if you still want to use those columns in the index you could do by the way it seems .asof when applied to the groupby dataframe evaluates the whole index and not the index of the grouping so your version with asof does not work as expected returns which looks like it used the last true value for all grouping

this is one difference objects aren t really locked up though you can do the locking up of objects by using object.preventextensions object.seal object.freeze but by themselves the objects can be modified at any point of time and this link to the prototype object is maintained in the child object
i can think of this in class inherited the parent objects are locked up
for instance here a s definition is locked up you can t add new properties once it is inherited

hide	show
css animations aren t blocked and therefore could be leveraged to make adjustments to the layout or the display of elements in spite of script-blocking windows
in your case you could utilize a special class that fades an element out after a short delay or simply set a transition-delay on the opacity of any element you expect to hide
i created another demo to show the use of utilizing css animations instead

in your situation to pin an object to the right hand side of a view the only constraints you need are top space to container trailing space to container fixed width fixed height if the width of your label is variable you probably want to right align the label remove the fixed width constraint and add either a lead space to container constraint or pin it to a sibling view that can change width

the directive doesn t care about how the properties are used it just needs to put them on the scope for the controller
here is an example using isolate scope here is an example using a child scope but mapping the same external value to scope.internalprop . this doesn t create an isolate scope so you still get scope inherited which can be useful sometimes
in both examples it s the directive that controls how external attributes are mapped to internal scope properties and then the controller can work with those internal properties as-needed

i have some hierarchical data in a table structure as so example 1 a a.1 a.1.1 a.1.2 a.2 a.2.1 a.2.2 b b.1 b.1.1 b.1.2 b.2 b.2.1 b.2.2 i would like to be able to expand and collapse within each level so example if i click on a.2 it s children should collapse example 2 a a.1 a.1.1 a.1.2 a.2 b b.1 b.1.1 b.1.2 b.2 b.2.1 b.2.2 and if i click a all of its children should collapse example 3 a b b.1 b.1.1 b.1.2 b.2 b.2.1 b.2.2 and if i expand a again a.2 should still remain collapsed children hidden example 4 a a.1 a.1.1 a.1.2 a.2 b b.1 b.1.1 b.1.2 b.2 b.2.1 b.2.2 i have tried code samples from -- but not handling three level hierarchies
this .nextuntil seems to work nicely but when the next tr is a parent row it gets collapsed until the next child row

min	max	min	max
in this modified bst you keep track of the the min node and max node everytime you do an operation that can potentially modify the data structure
for example in insert operation you can check if the min value is larger than the newly inserted value then assign the min value to the newly added node
the same technique can be applied on the max value

then open the file in visual studio but instead of just opening it select the open with... option click the black triangle on the open button and choose binary editor

you will find some combination of r n or r n there r is the hex value 0d and n is 0a

folder	directory	sudo	chgrp
in your case you should definately change it to 775 afterwards.
you can either set permissions to the folder by chmod 777 -r path to folder what you absolutely shouldn t do as everybody can write and execute everything in this directory afterwards or what i would prefer you create a new group let s call it usergroup sudo groupadd usergroup now that the group exists add the two users to it now all that s left is to set the permissions on the directory now only members of the usergroup group can read write or execute files and folder within the directory
note the -r argument to the chmod and chgrp commands this tells them to recurse into every sub directory of the target directory and modify every file and directory available

as you can see that you are dealing with prod assets or installing assets to prod environment in web directory so clear cach for prod is reasonable

however nsnumberformatter is fully unicode and localisation aware
to format an int value between 0 and 100 as an nsstring of 3 equal width chars you first define your formatter and then use it to format you numbers note the ... which converts the int to an nsnumber
you can do better than this and have nsnumberformatter format a floating point number between 0 and 1 as a percentage complete with the appropriate symbol for percent in the current locale

int	double
answer no
the only reason the float int union even makes sense is by virtue of the fact that both float and int share a storage size of 32-bits
what you are missing is an understanding that floats in fact all floating point numbers are stored in ieee-754 floating point format floats are single-precision double are double-precision etc.. when you use the float int union trick you see the integer value that is the integer equivalent to the ieee-754 single-precision floating point format for the float

getter	setter
in other words when you write if prop is defined and is visible in the current context it will be returned as is without calling __get
example this explains why doesn t invoke the getter
now since you also have the setter defined actually changes the protected member of the class therefore when you echo later on this still invokes the getter due to c s invisibility and the getter returns not the actual value of

27077697
getter	setter
that s why you see your line starting with b - it s printed before the whole expression is evaluated
the same happens with as c is also a protected property the getter itsels prints c but returns c value of which will be printed as part of the whole expression
after that line is processed calling another - setter - magic method as c is protected remember

27077697
getter	setter
but even though magic setter eventually changes the value of c property the next line in the code will output the same string as before
it s because the magic getter never access - it returns the value of instead when queried for c
the bottom line is also the certification guides and various similar-flavoured tests love magic methods in the real code it s better avoid them unless you really know what you re going to get

integer	unsigned
it makes handling the wrap-around of time problematic if you force it to wrap every 1000 ticks
ideally it should wrap a some power of 2 and since all integer types have a power of two range in any case you can simply increment it as i have done
if you do that the expressions such as now - last_event_timestamp give the correct time difference even when the counter has wrapped around so long as it has not wrapped around twice in that time for example 1 - 999 will give the answer -998 or 4294966298 if unsigned whereas 1 - 0xffffffff 2

i can live with a public get and protected set on the property i have tried the keyword and it works.

i think this because fromintegral is a type conversion function that does what you need the output of length list is an int that is integral and both float and double that are fractional and thus support are num so by using it you can convert an int to a fractional type and make your function compile for a reference on how numeric types conversions work in haskell have a look at converting numbers of haskell.org

disk	ram
preallocating a variable in ram and preallocating on the disk don t solve the same problem

27079645
int	chars
if you check specific key is pressed use chars keysym or keycode attribute of the event passed
the event handler or callback function will be called with an event object not with an int
the event object will never be equal to int object

27079651
equals	compareto
btw this makes your hashcode equals and compareto much simpler

put	get
it has a working r interface i can call from other packages but i d also like to call the c++ functions directly from c++ code in other rcpp-based packages i m developing
i ve figured out how to put the header for the first package in the inst include directory so that it is available in the second package
however when usedynlib is called in the second package s namespace file to load it s c++ code that calls a function in the first package i get an undefined symbol error for the function i am trying to use

swift	objective-c
in c# if i want to expose an iterable collection as a property of a class i d declare as in objective-c on the other hand the usual way is just to use the swiss army knives nsarray or nsmutablearray for everything in swift we have the opportunity to do something more along the lines of c# which i prefer because it allows us to encapsulate how the frogs are actually stored
this turns out to be a bit harder to achieve in swift
some protocols can only be used as generic type constraints because they have associated type constraints using typealias or use self in their definition

inherited	properties	inherited	properties
to avoid that you can make x non-enumerable filter non own properties in for...in
the problem is that areapropdesc is an object which inherited from object.prototype
since you created the object.prototype.x enumerable properties when you iterate objects using for...in you will see that properties

google-chrome	firefox
i am under the impression that as long as we return from the callback jquery in the browser will register the new value in the input element so the timeout argument is not of material even the value of 1 millisecond has worked on google-chrome and firefox

svm	cross-validation
i m using k-fold cross-validation to get the error rate of a svm classifier

27080089
tabs	tabpanel
example code for organizing ui.r code i found quite nice solution from github radiant code solution is to use renderui to render every tabpanel and in server.r tabs are sourced to different files

i already integrated zf 1 with doctrine 2 i created entities by this php doctrine.php orm convert-mapping --force --from-database annotation c wamp www ip application models now i m going to create getter and setter for them and generating entities i get the errors no metadata classes to process php doctrine.php orm generate-entities --generate-annotations true c wamp www ip application models

27080313
capitalize	uppercase
it might be easiest to split the string into a list of separate words capitalize each word and then join them back together the capitalize method sets the first character of a string to uppercase and the proceeding characters to lowercase

27080346
submit	submission
you have two ways to choose 1- make sure that user fills all the input you need unless he she cannot submit the form or he submit but you can prevent the submission by javascript and make sure all fields are filled out you can achieve this by adding required attribute to your inputs though this will not work in some browsers maybe ie or you can check all of them using javascript

27080388
x86	64bit	x86	64bit
code example this would still work if i use uintptr_t instead of uint32_t i assume but loading an immediate into a 64bit register rax is different from loading it into the lower 32bit alias are there any other differences
so i ve got a program which generates jit x86 machine code and executes it directly and i want it to support x86-64 amd64 x64 as well
the obvious differences are new registers rax r8 ... and pointer width pointers need to use 64bit regs default c calling convention arguments on stack vs

27080434
int	double
javascript does not have int arithmetic and all numbers are stored as 64-bit floats double in java

27080434
floating-point	integer
when javascript sees a bit-handling operator like or it temporarily converts the operands to 32-bit integers to perform the arithmetic but then converts them back to 64-bit float
thus the last multiplication is performed as a floating-point operation in javascript
in java it is still an integer operation

27080434
addition	multiplication
this code performs the same operation in java i have now tested it and the result is the same if you want javascript code that works the same as java you will need a way to perform multiplication and addition that works the same way as java does when you overflow

27080451
button	checkbox
i was looking at the pattern matching syntax for types in f# described here example from that page slightly modified what i don t understand is why we need to introduce a new name button checkbox along with the typecheck

27080475
multiplying	division
when this average gets multiplied again as the recursive call returns the significant digits that you lost in the division do not get restored
you are destroying information by dividing and then multiplying the sum
for greater precision you would want to keep track of the sum as you go through the elements then divide at the end

27080506
alarmmanager	powermanager
it is used to save battery
timers on handler.postdelayed for example won t work properly not called on time . there s special concept for this matter - for activities that needs to be performed in sleep mode you need to use alarmmanager see scheduling repeating alarms the matter is that your app needs to register with alarmmanager and then it will receive scheduled events when phone wakes up from sleep mode
your app needs to get lock with powermanager to perform activities in your case it s downloading json from network which you do not want to be interrupted with sleep mode while you re executing them

inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
you could make them all inherited from the same base class and use the above technique in each subclassing to set the correct properties in the base class

27080637

post	get
in order to get httppostedfilebase types to post correctly you need to add to your form header

27080789
put	get
i expect you can solve that- if not leave a comment and i ll get it fully working
i got interested in answering this because you put in a nearly fully working example
i copied it locally made small changes to work in my aws account and iterated to figure out the solution

27080860
daemon	cron
whenever probably isn t working because the cron daemon isn t running in your docker dokku container

27080871
128bit	64bit
loading from a double3 isn t as efficient as loading from other types
the best way to load data is usually using 128bit loads per thread
loading three consective 64bit values will be slower perhaps not by a lot but slower all the same

27080872
getter	setter
as far as your question deals with the registry pattern you can do this use the standard registry pattern call or use an abstract registry class with non-magic getter and setter call reg set foo bar

27080872
getter	setter
in a little test with 1.000.000 loops i got the following method 1 2 319s method 2 1 416s method 3 3 708s so an abstract registry with non-magic but at least static getter and setter seems to be the best solution

27080958
for-loop	loops
in your for-loop conditional you have a 1 the number one instead of i change it to and actually a nicer syntax for that loops in swift is

27080966
post	get
hey you cannot have multiple values like that because post or get will return just first value which in this case is 5 but you can make your value looks like this and then in php script you can separate values by using explode function which will return array that you can use

27081039
swift	objective-c
unlike objective-c though swift enforces the private interface at run time

27081044
google-chrome	firefox
my exact output is this yes here done edit i switched my default browser from google-chrome to firefox and now it works

27081102
box-sizing	border-box
if you plan on using borders you will also need to set box-sizing border-box as well - with the various vendor prefixes

27081132
folder	directory	folder	directory
the renamed uploads still works with a new name and the photos directory that is now called uploads does not
of note _test.log does not exist in the folder before testing so it s not like that file has bad permissions or anything
interestingly if i create a new directory chown it to apache apache chmod it to 777 i can t write to it so something larger may be wrong here

27081193
shadowing	named
you only introduce the named when you want to do a typecheck c#-style is and a cast c#-style as in your match pattern
what you suggest could easily be imagined as having an implicit shadowing of control control you use in the match with another control button after the cast
one problem i see with it is that it has a collateral effect of making the control control inaccessible in the match case bodies

27081200
16-bit	64bit
result 2 the number of bits to look at depends on your data type long - 64bit int - 32 bits short - 16-bit byte - 8 bits

27081226
punctuation	words
or a series of one or more words characters
i kept the pattern simple just to demonstrate but any other punctuation characters that you want to capture would be placed inside the character set
also you may want to use string.punctuation instead of typing out all of those punctuation characters

27081400
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if the method exist in the superclass and is overridden in the subclassing then even when called on an object of declared type superclass if it is actually of type subclassing than the method of subclassing will be called
however if the method is not defined in the superclass than it can not be called from an object declared to be of that type
it wouldn t make sense otherwise - what if the object was not of type subclassing but only of type superclass - it would be a type error

27081400
superclass	subclassing
it wouldn t make sense otherwise - what if the object was not of type subclassing but only of type superclass - it would be a type error
if you can t implement the method in the superclass than you are either not doing an example for which dynamic binding is appropriate or your superclass should actually be an interface or abstract
for example now if you write the output will be arf

27081455
rss	feed
each wp site comes with rss feed by default so its a case of picking your primary site to serve the posts from and installing a feed on the other three sites. as i ve read the about rss answers for content capture and i wanted to know the pros and cons about such approach in configuration for example rss by coding from strach to display same data or any wordpress rss feed plugins recommendation to the above approach especially on multisite purpose such related experience and if there is any better solutions for synchronizing post content for display same data sources throughout wordpress multisite network

int	chars
take the first two chars of date the value of month is the string 01
you can convert this into an int now the value of month is 1

to get the working tree to the state it was 5 commits ago on the current branch git checkout head 5 to move to branch foo 5 commits ago git checkout foo 5 either will put you in detached head state

27081946
maven	pom.xml
this translates to picking org.apache.kafka kafka_2.11 jar 0.8.2-v3-patch compile in your example
also see transitive dependencies the nearest-win approach just picks the version of the dependency closest to the left in the maven dependency tree output
this approach chooses a dependency based on how close they are to your pom.xml dependency declaration

27081946
maven	pom.xml
if you declare dependency conflicting-2.0 explicitly in your pom.xml that dependency will be the one picked by maven

27081946
maven	pom.xml
to exemplify in this case maven would pick conflicting-2.0 as the right version for the dependency since it is declared explicitly in the project pom.xml

27082040
post	put
i have the following 2 entities enterprise have many user relationship
i was able to send post request to create enterprise and the next thing i want to do is create a user that has a fk to the enterprise
here is my usercontroller when i try to send post to create new user i put breakpoints in my controller and saw that the user object s ownerenterprise field was null but other fields contain correct data

27082083
zfcuser	bjyauthorize
to do this properly i would not just try to inject myself before the bjyauthorize it would be better to add to zfcuser functionality and use a storagechain to get the identity of the user

27082206
post	get
you can achive this effect by following these steps download the html page with jquery into a temporay variable from the variable get the link address send magnific popup the link you want to display in the first place for the first part you can you this great post on stackoverflow how do i load html into a variable with jquery for the second task all you need is to query the first and only link in your html page and get it s href attribute now that target variable stores the requested url - send it over to magnific popup

27082408
stdout	fflush
it apparently happens because the subprocess produces output which is not piped throug the caller s stdout as it should but is fflush directly to the output

27082486
bash	zsh
note that i m using zsh so the which commands below actually show the function code from rvm but i didn t think that would be useful so i ran those in bash

versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to the 0.9 versioning to use the module

27082560
put	get
that should give you an array that looks like then explode arr 1 with as a parameter which you can get as new variables then you can put them in a finished array finarr array 0 arr 0 1 narr 0 2 narr 1

google-chrome	safari
i had the same problem worked on google-chrome and safari on my mac but did not work on google-chrome or safari on the iphone 5s running ios7

27082631
submit	submission
when run from inside controller and when in-memory spooling is configured via swiftmailer seems to work like this whenever from within controller is called - save message in memory when controller has finished work and symfony kernel is about to shutdown somwehere in event kernel.terminate or smth - check messages saved in memory and _actually submit them to smtp-server however this last step seems to silently ignore any errors which may be thrown when peforming submission of the message to the smtp server

27082642
bash	zsh
you can either set them as per your shell environment bash zsh etc.
for example if you re working within a bash environment you would need to add the following into your .bashrc file
or you can forego the environment variables and set the values directly within your database.yml

27082664
addition	modulo
write this what this does is convert both characters into their respective place in the alphabet perform addition modulo the number of characters in the alphabet for the wraparound effect and convert back to the correct ascii value

27082747
folder	directory
if you have app.js and home.js in the same directory the correct code is or if you have app.js in the main folder and home.js in a folder called mysubfolder you should pay attention to the .js extension that is not required and the trailing that is not needed

27082781
children	parent
i have a function that sorts a list of children that is passed to it based on the parameters in the parent function

27082789
metaclass	subclassing
the error says dict does not follow the metaclass api
the reason you get that particular error has to do with metaclass
the metaclass of any class has to match or subclassing the metaclass of each if it s base classes for the is-a rules of inheritance to work

27082789
metaclass	subclassing
the metaclass of any class has to match or subclassing the metaclass of each if it s base classes for the is-a rules of inheritance to work
you haven t supplied a metaclass so python uses the type of the single base class by default
when the base class is dict the metaclass is type the default and everything works well

27082839
xml-rpc	json-rpc
trac then provides anonymous and authenticated access to an api via two protocols xml-rpc and json-rpc

27082843
children	parent
for some reason even though the parent container has font-size 0 and the children are both 50 they drop to the other line

27082866
width	border-box
to those divs to make them sit side by side
the width also is affected by the border on the elements
you can add box-sizing border-box

put	get
just to check before the actual change occurs i put console.log to see if the values get passed in and after that the code magically started to work

27083158
google-chrome	safari
copy paste functionality works correctly in google-chrome and works poorly in safari

27083158
google-chrome	safari
that is in safari unlike in google-chrome you cannot paste selection copied from the grid back into some grid area using a cmd-p key shortcut

27083158
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in google-chrome using either cmd-p or paste menu option and does not work in safari at all

27083158
google-chrome	safari
you cannot copy from an outside program into handsontable when running in safari
debugging this issue proves tricky since when i set breakpoints in some code sections the act of breaking prevents the paste functionality from working even in google-chrome
there is something about the timing of the operations which makes the code hard to debug

27083158
google-chrome	safari
one observation i made is that in the function line 6938 the value of that.eltextarea.value is correct in google-chrome when i use cmd-p to paste and empty in safari

27083164
children	parent
children can be added deleted updated without touching the parent document however this have its cost of course - maintaining child-parent relationship forest in memory etc.

filtering	grouping
there are many ways to achieve it and one way is to use left join then with the join condition grouping the data and finally the additional condition for further filtering other way is to use exists as an alternative for grouping by demo

27083346
put	get
the expression wow wow is just a single column an anonymous record with two variables see the manual for details in general it s a good idea to add parentheses only if they are really required
don t put the columns in parentheses
if you look at the full error message you get then postgres actually tells you what was wrong

27083386
google-chrome	firefox
after beating my head in for awhile to try to diagnose i determined that it works fine in ie firefox and google-chrome version 38

27083451
elasticsearch	kibana
i would suggest you to check the elk product logstash elasticsearch kibana as it is the leading open source solution and it will provide you centralized access to your log files

imageview	listadapter
i can t get the width of an imageview in my listadapter s getview method.

27083521
getter	setter
the problem is you haven t actually created your getter and setter methods specifically the getter methods

27083556
int	chars
so first initialisze it then note that means adding the value of the chars str i converted to int to the pointer p_newstr

27083603
temp	tmp
and the temp data in tmp suds is created

27083672
int	double
i don t understand why the operator will not work for comparing string but will for comparing int double float etc

versioning	upgrade
when i execute the command rails s in my project the console display the message your ruby versioning is 2.0.0 but your gemfile specified 2.1.2 i executed the command brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build rbenv install --list and the versioning 2.1.2 appears in the list

27083703
swift	objective-c
note that only objective-c object pointer types are managed in arc
as for the documentation i believe it is due to the addition of swift
before swift the old documentation said null

27083723
width	height
let s say your object s center is x y with width w height h

27083759
int	chars
you can convert the first chars of your string to an int and then collapse all your variants for 1 - 9 into one using that int value

27083766
width	height
it s because you are spanning the entire view in your rect make you need to subtract the height and width of the tab and nav bar take a look at this example

27084158
clang	icc
so in short gcc clang icc are emitting instructions to counter the real possibilities of 32bits architectures.

27084158
clang	icc
for clang and icc the killer is not the increment but the initialization where you access each byte individually

27084158
clang	icc
gcc and icc probably do this by default because the order of bytes could be different that 0 1 2 3
surprisingly clang recognize that the order of bytes and optimizes this correctly - no perf difference
then something interesting happens the geninc32 function is slower on gcc but faster on msvc i don t see a permalink button on rise4fun so go there and paste the code tested on ideone

27084162
addition	multiplication
because of precedence rules isinstance g str and g.lower or g is actually evaluated as isinstance g str and g.lower or g multiplication is of higher precedence than addition

27084176
portrait	landscape
it is my target resolution where i only want the 720x720 inside 960x720 towards the top edge portrait or left edge landscape

27084182
g++	gcc
i did some search all answers seem to suggest that using clang++ instead of clang or rather g++ in place of gcc which is what i did in the first place

27084233
robocopy	xcopy
in this case you can set up a xcopy robocopy command which would copy the stuff to a network location

27084295
google-chrome	firefox
the link works in firefox but results in blank page in google-chrome

27084295
google-chrome	firefox
i checked with webdev tools and noticed that google-chrome loads the xsl files from a different url as firefox .._layout arena language.xsl 404 instead of .. _layout language.xsl ok
in addition in google-chrome i get the error message resource interpreted as stylesheet but transferred with mime type application xslt+xml
for this issue check google-chrome says resource interpreted as stylesheet but transferred with mime type application xml the main problem seems to be the misinterpred xsl import and xsl include statements which seems to be a google-chrome webkit bug - see or google for xsl import relative path google-chrome

width	height
hey guys i have a small issue i have an file upload that resizes the image into thumbnail by max width of 120px and ratios the height based on that

27084363
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
you would be happy to loops over the numpy arrays and call your function in a boring plain old for-loop style except that doing so is too slow

27084453
dictionary	map
the remaining arguments create an array of sorted key-value pairs prolog thus catches up to the many languages with a map datatype that have sprung up during the last 10 years maps in clojure
i just found out that swi-prolog version 7 introduces dictionary as an abstract object with a concrete modern syntax and functional notation for accessing members and as well as access functions defined by the user
the syntax is as follows see dictionary structures with named arguments for the details

27084537
button	checkbox
i am trying to re-sort the checkbox that are presented to the user by a button click to go up or down

27084568
qquickview	qurl
the good practice is making your qml file part of the app executable by putting into .qrc resource file with qt creator or by hand and the you can make use of it with something like qquickview view qurl qrc res qml main.qml

27084585
implements	extends
you could use an interface and overload the subroutine mysub then you can call it by using mysub and it will differentiate the functions based on the type of param edit ok how about this it uses an abstract type that contains the procedure obj and then your derived types can extends that and implements the actual procedure

27084683
put	get
i also had to fiddle around a bit to get this working i ve put it on a site i did for a friend you can have a look if it helps - warning it plays music when you load it

ubuntu	linux
i am trying to install 32 bit enthought canopy on 64 bit linux ubuntu 14.10 specifically

27084733
lxml	libxml2
andre augusto pointed out if you want to use lxml together with the official libxml2 python bindings maybe because one of your dependencies uses it you must build lxml statically

27084733
lxml	libxml2
otherwise the two packages will interfere in places where the libxml2 library requires global configuration which can have any kind of effect from disappearing functionality to crashes in either of the two
to get a static build either pass the --static-deps option to the setup.py script or run pip with the static_deps or staticbuild environment variable set to true static_deps true pip install lxml the staticbuild environment variable is handled equivalently to the static_deps variable but is used by some other extension packages too
from the lxml docs here.. his original post is here cannot install lxml on mac os x 10.9 there s some other ios related fixes there as well

width	height
i have a set of rooms and passages that i can convert into rectangles x y width height or a list of points x y

27085327
implements	extends
room and passage both extends the pointable interface
the getpoints method is implements for the room class as the problem i must identify the pointable that a given point belongs to
no rooms intersect

27085339
post	get
i wanted to read a post like you instead of using a get. i did it like this there are ways to do it which are simpler and smaller but i found them quite laggy so have been trying to get it as fast as possible

multiplying	add
it appears you re trying to multiplying two 8-bit values to get a 16-bit result and add that result to the value at

27085704
folder	directory
yes it is possible what i was doing wrong is not making the templates files accessible
if you want to have extra security on what can be accessible you could create a folder called for example public
then make that directory static app.use express.static __dirname + public

ubuntu studio linux 14.04.1 lts from a linux shell script i d like to launch a browser window of an exact size as a step for automatically recording a screencast

27085805
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the linked page from mdn notes that with a few exceptions this will not work post firefox 7
hellov pointed me to launch google-chrome from the command line with specific window coordinates which is about position not size
nevertheless digging through it yielded these ideas that also don t work no we could always read the firefox command line options page hint window size isn t there or the google-chrome switches source code where we will find and that was tried above

27085835
innodb	myisam
first you want to make sure your tables engine is innodb not myisam since latter doesn t support foreign key

27085860
hide	show
it should have two buttons show hide selecting show will display delete markers and all prior versions of objects a simpler way to delete objects from amazon s3 after a certain period of time is select your bucket open properties click lifecycle create a rule set to permanently delete n days after the object s creation date

27085890

put	get
once you do this all of the windows will close
if you want to show the subtraction stuff this is the code in python i didn t name the figures in matlab because what we re showing is obvious but for opencv you need to name the windows and so i put names that describe what we re showing for each
i also didn t need to take the absolute value because in numpy doing arithmetic operations that result in an overflow or underflow will simply wrap around itself while for matlab the values get clipped

27085980
implements	extends
if you want to just use an admin template you can start with this one that is decent enough
you can also look on how they implements it
while i would do things a little different i would extends the bootstrap widgets and change what i need instead of building them from scratch

27086032
put	get
i m trying to get a transition that is similar to the lightbox demo that famous has put out

27086142
int	double
the runtimeclass of int with string with double is int and the newarray method uses the runtimeclass to construct the new array
so the array is filled with default int values
likewise for the other order combinations

27086142
int	double
well int with string with double isn t an actual class but int is

27086142
int	double
each of the array elements has access to the methods of the three types int string and double they do and yet they don t

750 is the height and width of the applet i am drawing to

27086282
int	boolean
i have a scenario where an object receiving from ui passes a boolean value and this is stored in database as an int like true 1 and false 0

27086290
folder	directory
assuming you have __init__.py in your projects folder in the console you can do this import sys sys.path.append c users username dropbox projects import projects.myutilities.utility1 or if you want to add your desired directory permanently to the python path you can append your directory to the value of the environment variable called pythonpath

27086305
put	get
i have put the starting arrow in at the uiviewcontroller but i cannot get anything to come up apart from the launch screen

directory naming you do not need to provide a different suffix to your image file name for different screens sizes in android like you do in ios
the file name should be exactly the same for all the images of different sizes

27086367
google-chrome	firefox
i verified these results in firefox and google-chrome on ubuntu 14.04

27086421
for-loop	loops
any loops whether it be for-loop or while loops or do-while loops or any block like if-else if-else if- else switch must have opening and closing curly braces

27086609
try-catch	exception-handling
ok then try this although using the above code will handle both errors and exception-handling for you both extend from throwable but it s not the right way to do it only in very special cases do we handle errors using try-catch errors are something we need to check in our code and resolve them

27086630
swift	objective-c
i am using xcode 6 with mac os x yosemite but can t find any foundation option while creating project. there are four language options which i can see c c++ objective-c and swift

27086644
int	chars
it s ascii code for n
indeed ascii code again and you instructed printf to print it as an int using d
again using s printf expects a string in c but is actually a chars an 8-byte int

27086666
csv	tsv
univocity-parsers parses writes fixed-width inputs as well as csv and tsv

27086744
for-loop	arrays
try this code for further information about readalllines method file.readalllines if you ve many lines in text file and don t know the exact number then use can use for-loop to iterate through but in this case you also have to use list or arrays of integers to store int values

27086753
multiplying	multiplication
i m currently using nltk to process the contents of the document and get ngrams but from there i m not sure what approach i should take to calculate the similarity between documents
i read about using tf-idf and cosine similarity however because of the vast number of topics i m expecting a very high number of unique tokens so multiplying two very long vectors might be a bad way to go about it
also 80 000 documents might call for a lot of multiplication between vectors

27086795
public	protected
no the class can ba public but the constructor can be protected for only package acces or it also can be private - mostly used with factory static method

27086823
put	get
webfaction has pil installed by default and i can t seem to uninstall it
the docs say write a temporary file tmp photologue_no_pillow but i m not sure if that s a file or a directory or where to put it
photologue installs fine but then i get the following error when i try to add an image i haven t been able to turn up anything that appears similar and the docs refer to strange bugs and this seems like that

27086886
centroid	threshold
next the distance between each data point and the set of centroid is determined and each data point assigned to the centroid it is closes to
then new centroid are determined from the mean value of the data points assigned to the same cluster
these two steps are repeated until some convergence criterion is reached between two consecutive iterations the centroid combined movement falls below some threshold

27086886
scikit-learn	lda
pca principal component analysis lda linear discriminant analysis and kpca are all members of this class the defining characteristic of which is that that calculation of the eigenvalue eigenvector pairs for each feature in the original data or in the covariance matrix
scikit-learn has a module for pca computation
data model as you have observed the common dilemma in constructing a data model from unstructured text data is including a feature for every word in the entire corpus minus stop words often results in very high sparsity over the dataset each sentence includes only a small fraction of the total words across all sentences so each data vector is consequently sparse

27086977
min	max
i m coding a windows form application using a gmap control. i have many roads and i would like to adapt the gmap zoom value in order to fit all my roads on the map. i have the latitude and longitude min and max of all my roads. i m working with c#

27087032
min	max
the only way i could figure out how to do this was to create a table of unioned geometries in a cte use st_dump to produce individual polygons ie 1-2 and 3-4-5-6 in your question and then select the max and min values of the data attributes from the original table which i have called polygons as you didn t specify a name that intersect with the new unioned geometries and grouping by the same new unioned geometries

27087060
csv	tsv
do not use a csv parser to parse tsv inputs

27087184
floating-point	integer
the problem as stated by ajb is that javascript is loosely-typed and is performing double-precision floating-point arithmetic whereas we need strict 32-bit integer arithmetic

27087184
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition
for multiplication the function math.imul exists for this purpose
it is not yet supported in internet explorer but the linked page contains a replacement function that simulates imul for older browsers which works by multiplying the top and bottom halves of the numbers separately
for addition we can or the numbers with 0

27087213
udp	tcp
first thing of course is to receive data through tcp listener line receiver instead of udp to avoid loosing incoming points

27087272
portrait	landscape
orientation is system-wide property so it can only be landscape or portrait at the one time

27087344
scheme	racket
foldr or foldl for that matter successively calls a procedure you provide with 2 arguments the elements of the list one by one the previous result your procedure returned or the initial value if it s the first call note in racket the order of the arguments is the opposite of standard scheme so foldr already does the looping for you

27087733
viewdidload	viewwillappear
swift 4.2 swift 3 and 4 older swift
you may just need addobserver in viewdidload
but having addobserver in viewwillappear and removeobserver in viewwilldisappear prevents rare crashes which happens when you are changing your view

27087758
laravel	codeigniter
previously i combined php frameworks codeigniter laravel with angular and the file structure was like following

27087758

the scrollview can only have one child in order to operate properly make a layout that gathers all the children of it and make the scrollview it s parent

27087794
scons	ldd
try to check the dynamic dependencies for the clam_core lib with ldd
if this works at the command line but not in scons you possibly have set ld_library_path in your shell environment to make things work
then you d have to propagate this path to scons as well or even better install the needed clam libs properly such that their dependencies get resolved without the need for ld_library_path

27087921
cpu	hyperthreading
my example code is too long to post here but can be found by running the example here a chart of the performance is here

27088727
for-loop	arrays
you have to create a new arrays by converting each element to an optional. but instead of a for-loop you can use map and your method for converting the other way around aborts with fatal error can t unsafebitcast between types of different sizes in my current xcode 6.1

27088750
strace	lttng	strace	perf
strace shall intercept record system calls that are called by a process and also the signals that are received by a process
strace will be able to show the order of events and all the return resumption paths of calls
lttng is a combination of kprobes tracepoint and perf functionalities that can help in tracing of interrupts and race conditions

27088819
printf	strcpy
you simply can t use strcat or other similar functions like strcpy
you could use printf but then you don t allocate enough memory to store all data in the structure for example the size of an integer is four bytes but it can contain ten digits plus possible - for negative numbers
my proposed solution

27088831
inherited	properties
to rectify this you have two options create an object that will hold your states to active scope inherited lookup or use the properties to access the parent scope this also applies to the ng-class directive demo html

27088894

27088957
children	parent
from jquery last-child selector selects all elements that are the last child of their parent
ok running this code will yield ok let s remove so that divs will be direct children of the body result nothing is painted
question those divs are children of body

27089515
onreadystatechange	onload
i have a script which load a javascript file run-time or async the problem is that when s.onload is triggered and onload is printed in the console the script isn t loaded completely and when calling a function from the file undefined is returned if a settimeout is setup after the script is onload it works but that isn t good practice have made some research on the topic and found the onreadystatechange event

open up terminal.app go into your project s root directory and run this command for swift only for objective-c only for objective-c + swift for objective-c + swift + c + c++ terminal quick tips ls list directory contents cd change directory press tab to autocomplete remember to put backslash before spaces i suggest going one folder down from the main project so you get rid of code count from the frameworks

27089851
children	parent
how overflow works the element that has the overflow property will self-clear from overflowing into other elements
this is why #message-container flowed into the space occupied by #user-container but its children #message-box and #text-box with the overflow property had cleared themselves from flowing into the space #user-container
their margins were still relative to their parent #message-container not where they re clipped which is why it appeared there was no left margin where they ran into #user-container

oncreate	onstart
theres is second approach you can and also can register your button for context menu in oncreate or onstart or onresume context.registerforcontextmenu button

27090023
daemons	launchd
i recommend using a background worker pool properly running as a daemons service or at least properly detached from a launchd console using screen for example and your synchronous php apache script would push job requests to this pool using a socket

27090039
awt	swing
awt can do this with graphics.drawimage
see double buffering with awt for one discussion of how to do this
in swing this can be handled with jcomponent.setdoublebuffered if you are using something else you may wish to look it up using the exact phrase double buffering

27090166
width	height
create a new file named bools.xml in values folder as below create another file in values-land folder named bools.xml as below now in your activity before calling to setcontentview get this resource and based on its value set activity as full screen or not set your videoview s width and height match_parent

27090176
src	attr
jquery #show1 img attr src imgsrc

27090176
src	attr
so you should do jquery #show1 attr src imgsrc
edit2 ...and you re getting the src of the first image for imgsrc not the one that was clicked
use this or even

27090242
distance	polygons
one option would be to find the center of the polygons then place points 100m or whatever the distance is further from the center from each existing point

27090255
erlang	lisp
one popular pattern matching library for common lisp is optima available from quicklisp
what you actually seem to be looking for is pattern matching like in ml or erlang
that is a rather different concept from dispatch although they have similar purposes

27090257
google-chrome	firefox
in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox this example keeps the footer at the bottom when the content is removed but in ie this just doesn t work at all

27090305
put	get
plus it illustrates that by using pack and or grid instead of place you get proper resize behavior without any extra effort
if you really think you know better than your users you can put it back in
the code now has good resize behavior the grid of entry widgets expands to fill its container and the functions are less tightly coupled since a function that creates a frame doesn t have to know how that frame will be displayed

27090428
put	get
i was able to get this to work by installing and modifying my shortcut s target property to this e program files datastax community python python.exe e program files datastax community apache-cassandra bin cqlsh -u cassandra -p cassandra basically put the -u and -p flags outside of the double quotes and it should work

27090445
hide	show
a user click the logon button my popup page is opened ----------- first loop starts -------------- the user clicks the username field to type username the cursor focuses the field android opens the virtual keyboard then jquery try to reposition because the keyboard has show and the window size has changed
so popup hide and loses the focus
then android virtual keyboard is hidden because there is no any active input

27090526
put	get
i most frequently get it when i ve put arguments in the wrong order

27090529
for-loop	loops
because a while loops is a java equivalent while loops and the for-loop is translated to function call of if you use yield or if you don t care the result

27090542
children	parent	persistent	transient
the transitive persistent mechanism is going to save all new children entities if a transient or detached child becomes referenced by a persistent parent it is passed to saveorupdate that s why the animals get saved without any explicit flush

width	height
i want to place two images each of unspecified height and width 50 of the page next to each other

27090585
google-chrome	firefox

27090656
hide	show
replacing dom elements is a bad approach though -- you d be better off leaving the elements on the page and using show and hide

27090656
hide	show
i ve also hooked up a blur event handler so if the user clicks tabs out then it ll hide the textbox and show the button

27090691
for-loop	loops
at most only one of these two loops will ever execute because completion of the first loops guarantees the conditional for one of these two will already return false
the primary problem is in your for-loop for int i 0 j 0
i+j a+b

27090735
for-loop	loops

i have some code in which i want to use a for-loop to handle a set of files
as part of handling a file there s a for f loops that reads it and appends data to an other file based on the file name

27090798
children	parent
to create two equal columns using flexbox the parent container gets display flex each column is created by a div and they get flex 1 to grow shrink to stretch the child of the first column the first column is also given display flex so that its children can have flex properties and grow the aside child is given flex 1 and will grow shrink this is the easiest guide to flexbox you could ask for

27090847
inline	inlining
functions is purely syntactic and is unrelated to the difference between inlining and partial evaluation both function calls and expressions with operators can be inline and compile-time evaluated in c

i then moved it to the apache root directory c apache24 htdocs and now the php.ini file is in three identical copies everytime carefully copied and refreshed in the c windows folder the c php folder and the c apache24 htdocs folder

27090989
folder	directory
the php_mbstring.dll file 1.4 mb in size is in the php ext folder and the php.ini file has an absolute path to that directory
both apache and php are under their own folder on c level so short paths and no spaces in paths like with the program folder apache monitor has been stopped and started restarted and the whole pc switched off and restarted
i even downloaded a one-month newer version of php and still no dice

google-chrome	firefox
if i put a transparent static png image in the first layer the second layer is drawn but not with the animated gif
we have been running this game for a long time with no problem and the interesting part now is that it worked in google-chrome until we cleared our cache after getting complaints from our players
this would make it seem like we have changed something the broke it but it still works in firefox after clearing cache and all our older versions of the game that we haven t touched are also broken now in chrome. it seems to me that this is a bug introduced in google-chrome but i m probably wrong

versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade the ndk and now my app crashes with missing symbol mkfifo e dalvikvm 2031 dlopen data app-lib ...mylib.so failed cannot load library soinfo_relocate linker.cpp 975 cannot locate symbol mkfifo referenced by mylib.so ... the older platforms mkfifo was defined inline in sys stat.h but in platform versioning 21 it was changed to just an extern decleration so that explains the missing symbol exception.

slideup	slidedown
the first time this happens the element will have display block which means the element will appear immediately and the slidedown animation will not be apparent
when the panel is closed the slideup animation will add to the element which means the next time it s opened it will work as expected
if you add it manually like this it will work as long as the panel always begins as closed

postgresql	mysql
there s not an exact equivalent to convert a postgresql query that makes use of select distinct on to mysql

27091297
postgresql	mysql
a lot of people would be very tempted to convert this postgresql query with an order by select distinct on col1 col2 col3 col4 col5 from tablename order by col1 col2 col3 col4 with this one select col4 col5 from select col1 col2 col3 col4 col5 from tablename order by col1 col2 col3 col4 s group by col1 col2 col3 the idea here is to apply an order by to a subquery so that when mysql groups by col1 col2 col3 it will keep the first encountered value for col4 and col5

27091297
postgresql	mysql
conclusion as a general rule there s not an exact way to convert a postgresql query to a mysql query but there are a lot of workarounds the resulting query might be as simple as the original one or it might become very complicated but it depends on the query itself

swift	objective-c
but at the moment i really don t get it
i am trying to move an objective c coredata app to swift and ios and hit a brick wall with iterating through nsset objects xcode has generated these classes then in the 3rd class i am adding a method that needs to iterate though an nsset
the line after the comment above gives and error anyobject does not have a member named score the objective-c method looks like this and works fine this is about day three on swift so i may well be missing something really obvious.

i m guessing that the arrays equations intend for you to either permute across all combinations of phi and theta so that you can then sum over one or more dimensions of phi and theta
therefore you re likely going to have to introduce a for-loop and or a sum operation
since i don t know your antenna arrays equations i can t help

if you want to use a gtkstylecontext and the gtk api to draw something inside a clutteractor you can use a cluttercanvas content and then use the api with the cairo context that the cluttercanvas draw signal gives you
clutter does not know anything about gtk or css so you cannot use the gtk css machinery with clutter

if not create them before installing the plugin

27092456
versioning	upgrade
this will tell that you need at least versioning 2.1.0 but anything better is fine as long as it does not introduce incompatible changes that would be a new major number 3.0.0
if the project does not announce anything like this a versioning requirement of may be correct if you have proof that the project broke compatible versioning in the past and didn t correct this
this is less likely to be the case and it is the more nasty variant because you are forcing your own users to use a particular versioning of your dependency without being able to freely upgrade that

you have to change two things to get this working 1st change your post method signature to 2nd remove the from your json

27092752
put	get	hide	show
the easiest way to achieve this is with data binding - rather than modifying the dom manually as with put the extra detail inside a block that is only rendered when some value is truthy and let ractive determine when to show and hide it that way you never run into a situation where the dom and your viewmodel get out of sync - for a given viewmodel state there is guaranteed to only be one dom state

when the size of the image is known this is relatively simple just give the text a background color otherwise it is transparent by default and a negative left margin of half the image s width

min	max
an alternative would be to do this that defines properties on date that cannot be changed that have the min max numeric value for dates

x86	64bit
the batch file packed into a 32-bit executable runs now all console applications indeed from system32 directory on 32-bit windows but from systemroot syswow64 directory on 64bit windows
therefore the batch file checks next if environment variable programfiles x86 exists which is the case only on windows x64
therefore the condition on third line is false on windows x86 and systempath is not changed

27093204
x86	64bit
but better would be to do that all inside the 32-bit executable which extracts the batch file to temp and run it either with systemroot system32 cmd.exe c temp extractedbatch.bat for 32-bit windows where environment variable programfiles x86 does not exist or with systemroot sysnative cmd.exe c temp extractedbatch.bat on 64bit windows

i had a similiar problem some time ago demultiplexing using imultivalueconverter what worked for me was to delay the assignment of dependencyproperty.unsetvalue since a multibinding is somewhat a collection of bindings you can assign an ivalueconverter to each involved 1-1 bindings as follows 1 xaml-markup introduce converter for the involved 1 1-bindings note the introduced in the second binding 2 implement mymultivalueconverter create copies of the supplied element 3 implement the in 1 introduced unsetvalueconverter this way the disposal is delayed until right before the updated value is delivered and yes this isn t an answer to your question but mike s

for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
you need to change loops to return only when a solution is found now all candidates in all invocation levels will be tried so eventually you would end up with a solution assuming of course that your helper methods that find and set candidates work fine
your recursion with backtracking implementation is incorrect because your for-loop never goes past the first candidate

screens	tablet
therefore the table and the pie-charts should be in different s to allow the content to fall down when there is no room for it
responsiveness is always a plus when you are working on a small screens
so if you have clients with small screens phones tablet old scool monitors then yes it is a good idea to be responsive

27094757
width	height
you need to set css rules for width and height of your div that contains background image

27094771
width	height	width	height
i would like the images to sit in a div that maintains its height the images should be no larger than 500px in height
the width should be automatic to maintain aspect ratio
html i ve tried this css the above works well the gallery is always 500px high and images never exceed 500px in height

the width will automatically be scaled


27095014
firepath	firebug
with firebug you can see the dom tree which is really useful to know what you can reach .
and then try xpath with firepath to start i selected all h1 nodes h1 in the document and then you need to get all h4 for each h1 to get state but unfortunately h4 node is not a child of h1 node so you need to find another way to reach it if you want to start from h1 node
if you look at dom tree you will see that a div which contains h4 node is one of the next sibling of h1 node so let s select it this is the div for the current h1 node only

27095022
int	chars
you also cannot convert factors directly to numeric and get the correct value
factors are stored as int values that will probably be different from the values you have
we have to first convert to chars then to numeric

it can use its own private fields directly which means you don t actually need to call a getter and a setter

as noted you can t statically link the directx libraries direct3d directinput directsound etc

27095807
direct3d	directx	direct3d	directdraw
see not so directsetup for the a longer discussion of this
if you use direct3d 9 or later directdraw directsound 8 directinput 8 directshow directmusic directplay etc
what historically has been called directx 9.0c aka the summer 2004 release those bits are always present on windows starting with windows xp service pack 2 windows server 2003 service pack 1 and windows xp x64 edition

27095807
direct3d	directx
if you depend on these you still need the legacy directsetup
the good news is that with direct3d 11 you don t need to use it at all
instead see living without d3dx for a bunch of new support libraries that are statically linked to your application as well as available shared-source--which includes directx tool kit mentioned in the other answer

27095807
direct3d	directx
in short don t use direct3d retained mode directplay voice or directx 7 8 visual basic 6.0 as they aren t in the os starting with windows vista

27095817
dbcontext	objectcontext
4.2 or higher you can create a dbcontext from an existing objectcontext instance
once you ve got this dbcontext you can use its find method to get an object by key
all wrapped up in one method and omitting null checks i suppose this could work for you usage you have to use a new context in getoriginalentity because the find method first tries to get the entity from the context s cache

put	get
by keeping a record of the visited index in your array each time you get the max let me define the solution structure first then i will walk through it make a new array of the same size of the score_list let s call that array marker in the for loop you will make another loop to check for max score and in the same time check to see if the location of the max score in the marker array is 0
sample run on loop on the score_list and find the max score with marker 0 print it and then put marker for that score 1
on you will do the same but now there is one location excluded from the list here you are a sample code how to do it note that this code is not a runnable one and it is not optimized too o n 2 i wrote it for explanation purposes only

27096306
for-loop	loops
if you can explain what you re trying to accomplish we can help with a better algorithm
in your for-loop you are adding 1 to the result of a call to minnumber
when bignumber is less than zero the method returns int.maxvalue i ll leave it to you to step through the code but in the first loops when bignumber is 5 you continue to do a recursive call subtracting which is 1 from it

output error norf undeclared first use in this function i can duplicate the file in the same directory name it foobar2.h and then include that file instead and it outputs 1 2 3 so the path is not incorrect
i can make a link to the folder name it foobar2 and include foobar2 foobar.h and it outputs 1 2 3 so the file is not incorrect
to confirm that it is not registering changes i can destroy the foobar folder entirely and try to print just the 2 variables that were originally inside the header

also consider changing your table engine from myisam to innodb

27096764
put	get
if you don t care about the range being not uniform as in 1-10 11-20 instead of 1-15 15-20 etc then iterate through your old hashtable and add into a new hashtable w the new lambda value filling sequentially - that s the closest you ll get sometimes you ll get -1 from lambda value
if you don t care much about the original uneven distribution but equal range simply just take the number of numbers you have sort using some easy sort like quicksort and then put lambda value # of numbers in each bucket
not sure if that s what you mean but hope this helps

27096816
freebsd	linux
on linux at least the remaining bytes of the unused page are zero-filled so effectively you get a nul terminator in all cases where the file size isn t a multiple of the page size
but relying on that feels dirty and other mmap implementations in freebsd i think don t zero-fill partial pages
mapping files that are multiples of the page size will also lack the nul terminator

27096831
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
in addition you almost never want to use for in loops for going over an arrays s indexes
you should use a regular for-loop or array.prototype.foreach if the arrays had values of course
keep in mind that array.prototype.foreach may not be supported in all your target platforms

27096909
width	height
solution 1 lets say your body contains this div then you could try something like this solution 2 in this solution we have an external wrapper which will cover all the width and height of the window therefore when we want to fadeout the popup we just have to test whether or not the user has clicked on the popup or on the wrapper

27096938
multiplying	add
so my question what should be the next step how do i know which loop to add or multiplying

27097001
for-loop	loops
to bind the current value of s to each closure as it is launched one must modify the inner loops to create a new variable each iteration

27097113
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

27097150
superclass	subclassing
if you want the superclass s constructor to run as part of the subclassing s initialization you have to do that explicitly of course you d still get the same result because you d have the mammal function set the name property and then cat would write over it again

27097184
width	height
let s say i have a theater like when you open a facebook image and i need the image s width to keep the relation when i modify the window s height and therefore the image s height as i have the image s height set based on the window s height

27097186
scheme	racket
for example in racket either way it works as expected
as you mention we can use a vector data structure to represent a bit vector in scheme refer to your interpreter s documentation
as a first step create a new vector with the maximum number of elements that you expect and initialize it with zeroes

27097186
scheme	racket
there are several ways all involving traversing the vector testing the value at each position and accumulating the result in a list
for example using explicit recursion if you re lucky and use a sophisticated scheme interpreter we can write an idiomatic solution in terms of iterations and comprehensions
for example in racket either way it works as expected

27097214
stdout	stderr
in brief default buffering modes stdin is always buffered stderr is always unbuffered if stdout is a terminal then buffering is automatically set to line buffered else it is set to buffered for me the example you gave prints in cmd all the numbers upon exit in cygwin s python one by one in win32 python in mintty both all upon exit both one by one with -u option sys.stdout.isatty returns false
so it looks like msvcrt s stdout is unbuffered when it points to a terminal
a test with a simple c program shows the same behaviour

27097242

setting the height of the img will not trigger a resize of the width in some browsers

put	get	put	get
edit after answer siu chung chan s answer was exactly correct but since i didn t quite get it at first i thought i would share the code that made me realize that he was exactly right
if you were to put it all in one block this is what his very correct answer would look like to me the beauty of this is that it gives a peek into how some of the views are actually set up by apple to be biased for how they wanted to use them only
so if you want to do highly customized uis you have to do a lot of uiview manipulation to get around their perhaps unintended barriers

27098972

if yes stop the audioplayer if not then play the other sound the audioplayer stops and plays the other sound be aware that if you also record sounds on your app you have to set the session category as avaudiosessioncategoryplayback or the sound will be heard through the small speaker of the device

strncpy	malloc
aslo do not cast the return value of malloc
thanks to unwind in your case with strncpy you have supplied n as 2 which is not having any scope to store the terminating null byte
without the trminating null printf won t be knowing where to stop

27102896
strcpy	strncpy
now with 3 bytes of memory you can use strcpy to copy the string properly strncpy will not add the terminating null itself in case the n is equal to the size of supplied buffer thus becoming very very unreliable unlike strcpy

27102896
strcpy	strncpy
check the man page for strncpy and strcpy here

spaces	delimiter
meaning is taken as the block closing delimiter and both are removed from the final output
i expect this is to remove unnecessary blank lines in code like this however it does make it hard to control output of newlines and there s no elegant way to solve it add an extra spaces after the closing tag which causes the newline to be output but also the spaces explicitly echo a newline character add an additional newline after the php block


27103106
spaces	delimiter
it can if a.a does not point to properly allocated memory with enough spaces for the next spaces delimiter char data in the stream

27103258
geocoding	geocode
i ve never run up against this limitation in standard user interaction with a map
the only limitation i m familiar with is the reverse geocoding of coordinates via clgeocoder which says geocoding requests are rate-limited for each app so making too many requests in a short period of time may cause some of the requests to fail
when the maximum rate is exceeded the geocode passes an error object with the value kclerrornetwork to your completion handler

width	height
every time i click on an element in the interface builder everything in that view gets a height and width of zero and gets repositioned outside of the view

swift	objective-c
in objective-c it is done this way how to do it in swift

27103509
g++	gcc
when compiling c++ programs you need to use g++ instead of gcc so that the program gets linked with the proper libraries

27103582
sorting	filtering
you shouldn t rely on the index since the index in the table can differ from the index in your model due to filtering and sorting

27103593
comparator	comparable
i believe the original reason was that the methods were meant to be compatible with the comparator method on the comparable interface which specifies an object argument although this was obviously improved with the introduction of the generics syntax

27103625
post	get
you need an array to store parameters start building the query.note i have changed from post to get as it is easier to test also see pdo wiki for use in placeholders.ie placeholders cannot represent an arbitrary part of the query but a complete data literal only

if you are working on linux debian apt-get install php5-mysql because your php is not able to talk with mysql

27103698
int	double
so here we use two s to say we are passing in two strings
if we wanted to pass in two strings and an int we would use not how the order of the types in the first parameter match the order of the parameters i m passing in
according to the manual valid types are i for int d for double s for string b for blob

27103702
rss	feed
your rss feed contains entities so you need to convert them to their string representations

27103752
hide	show
that s relatively easy just use toggle with a boolean switch to show true hide false the unfortunately i m unable to give implementation examples due to the absence of any relevant code context or information in your question

27103766
hex	binary
if you want to print the contents of the binary file you need to write the values as hex values

27103767
inherited	properties
so now your button code looks like this i hope this help you
every tab in tableview is represented by a tab component that inherited from loader component
if you want force the tab to load its contents just set active properties to true

27103786
libstdc++	libc++
if you want you can convert it yourself or use one of the standard conversion functions mbstowcs not really portable or c++11 wstring_convert not really working with gcc libstdc++ working with clang libc++

27103982
min	max
all you need to do is take the min max x y of the existing points note this assumes x increases as you go right and y increases as you go down

27104041
google-chrome	safari
there are 381 multimonolines . however zooming in on the map in safari hangs the web page
google-chrome is easier on that
i realize that drawing 380 lines is quite an expensive thing to do so i think i will have to revert to the polyline hoping that someone has figured out how to do a gradient polyline

i have searched in the internet and found docx4j will convert docx xlsx files to html or pdf

27104360
internationalization	localization
am using only leading or trailing constraints. base internationalization is enabled in project settings also have added the languages in localization

27104379
configobj	configparser
omap which makes it less easy to update than a normal mapping if you want to have complex structures with lists of unnamed elements containing mappings dictionaires then configparser and configobj won t help you as the ini files key-value pairs have to go into sections and lists can only be values

27104496
post	get
while going through symfony s code i found it uses in that for post if you see above code if there is form name in our form type class it tries to get values from request as request- request- get name name is form name

27104515
range	min
if both conditions are fulfilled then it gets the row number - 1 if not then it gets false. the min function then gets the smallest row number - 1 from this array. the index then indicates this smallest row number - 1 which fulfills the conditions
it subtracts 1 from the row number because your index range starts at row 2
if the row number 2 fulfills the conditions then it is the index 1 within this range if row number 3 fulfills the conditions it is the index 2 and so on

27104618
folder	directory
i have created the folders on the remote side remote location already created usr local www foosite i am running scp from the local machine in directory usr local web www foosite but it s copying the foosite directory as a subdirectory.
i just want the contents of the folder not the folder itself.
here is the command i m using scp -r usr local web www foosite scpuser 216.99.999.99 usr local www foosite

i could resolve this issue by changing jdk1.8 64bit version to jdk 1.8 32bit x86 version

27104833
post	get	post	put	put	get
if no template is available the behavior depends on the selected format for an html response - if the request method is get an exception is raised but for other requests such as post the response depends on whether the resource has any validation errors assuming that an attempt has been made to save the resource by a create action if there are no errors the resource was saved successfully the response redirect s to the resource its show action
if there are validation errors the response renders a default action which is new for a post request or edit for patch or put


27104853
google-chrome	firefox
currentsrc is the behaviour i also would have expected but currently it is simply not implemented in google-chrome or firefox

27104950
width	height
the name of the outer div is scroll_main and the inner div is scroll_holder
the width of the outer div is 750px and overflow is set to auto
in the inner div i have added some div with a fixed width and height and float left

27104950
width	height
in the inner div i have added some div with a fixed width and height and float left
so i want to make the width of the inner div auto so that all the contain div of the inner section show in one row
i want to scroll from left to right

27104970
temporary	tablespace
since temporary tables require a special type of tablespace user temporary i think you should be able to accomplish this indirectly issue grant use of tablespace on the user temporary tablespace s while revoking that privilege on all regular tablespace

27105125
width	height
this is explained in my answer to the question add image to itext dynamically on pdf file in this answer i do this where field holds the name of the field and rect describes a rectangle from which you can get the width and the height

27105125
put	get
you can use basefont.getwidthpoint string text float fontsize to get the width of the string in pt
or put the string in a chunk and do chunk.getwidthpoint
the combination of the three should solve your problem

27105220

draggable	droppable	draggable	droppable
you can copy it s source to droppable as shown below
inside the drop event callback you can access the dropped draggable element via the draggable property of second argument commonly named as ui
you can copy it s source to droppable as shown below

27105578
setinterval	settimeout
i think you have to use setinterval instead of settimeout as your function is getting call repeatidly

27105590
int	double
changes use an int intead of a double that gets you away from a whole bunch of potential precision problems

27105650
put	get
you can start an indeterminate progress dialog uncancelable at onpreexecute and then dismiss it in onpostexecute and if you don t want the code to get started executing before the asynctask gets completed just put that code in onpostexecute method of asynctask

27105655
bower	npm
on bower homepage bower is optimized for the front-end
bower uses a flat dependency tree requiring only one version for each package reducing page load to a minimum
in short npm aims for stability

27105655
bower	npm	bower	npm
in short npm aims for stability
bower aims for minimal resource load
if you draw out the dependency structure you will see this npm as you can see it installs some dependencies recursively

27105655
bower	npm
so the common usage is bower for the packages that you want to publish on your webpages runtime where you avoid duplication and use npm for other stuff like testing building optimizing checking etc

27105655
bower	npm
update for npm 3 npm 3 still does things differently compared to bower

27105743
int	chars
if an error has occured the result array is uninitialized and must not be released
unsigned int ts3client_getcapturedevicelist modeid result
const chars modeid

27105743
int	chars	int	chars
chars result
unsigned int ts3client_getcapturedevicelist modeid result
const chars modeid

27105780
setinterval	settimeout
you can use setinterval but if you prefer to control it with a settimeout the better is to set just one timeout in the same time and chain your calls using callbacks

27105844
oncreate	recreate	oncreate	ondestroy
the activity will obviously not receive any events between unregister in ondestroy and register in oncreate - remember that by default the activity will be fully recreate when configuration changes

27105923
range	infinity
timestamp types accept special values for infinity and -infinity
range types have a general concept for range without lower upper bound
the functions to test for it are called lower_inf and upper_inf but they are really testing for no bound in the range

27105923
range	infinity
range with no upper lower bound include the value infinity -infinity for timestamp respectively

27105923
range	infinity	range	infinity
the manual also some element types have a notion of infinity but that is just another value so far as the range type mechanisms are concerned
for example in timestamp range means the same thing as
but means something different from the latter excludes the special timestamp value infinity

27105934
int	double
the first initialization works because the language upcasts the int literal 1234 to double before calling sqrt and then converting the result to float

27105934
int	double
the second initialization works for the same reason except this time the compiler does not have to upcast 1234.22 literal before the call because it is already of type double
this is discussed in c99 standard 6.3.1.4.1 when a finite value of real floating type is converted to an int type other than _bool the fractions part is discarded
6.7.8.11 the initializer for a scalar shall be a single expression optionally enclosed in braces

27105937
int	boolean
e suggests mask1 might be a better variable name than index1 since index usually suggests int values while mask suggest boolean which is what we have here

27105974
division	modulo
you can use modulo division in case the value is larger than the length of the string

27106033
actionscript	mxml
in flash builder s new project wizard you can create a new flex project and then select desktop as the application type. in next screen it asks for default main class just specify your main .as actionscript class file here. this way you won t have to write any mxml code and all the libraries of standard flex library will be implicitly available for the project files

27106085
post	get
i have managed to find a work-around for my particular use-case by storing and retrieving the session id in a different manner than with post get

27106106
int	double
widening primitive conversion 19 specific conversions on primitive types are called the widening primitive conversions .. int to long float or double .. 5.1.8
unboxing conversion .. from type int to type int what should happen is an unboxing from int to int and then a widening conversion to long
this is actually happening as expected in oracle jdk 1.8.0.25

27106426

i am using mongodb to store some cyrillic text from some feed rss news. the text is correctly stored but when i try to search a document with a simple find function it returns me a buffer too small error

27106561
interpolation	splines

i am using the interpolation package from scipy
in the documentation of the splprep function it says that amongst the return values there is also the variable fp that contains the residuals of the splines fit

27106575
folder	directory
just as simple change this to your favorite directory and remember that in the first create that directory with this code above code work if you added related manifest in your androidmanifest.xml file and for more information see below links how to create directory automatically on sd card create folder in android can #39

27106590
folder	directory
the reason for specifying the path like that is that when deployed to server the project structure will be like this one root - pics - css - index.css so the path will correct when deployed
however webstorm says it can t find resource which is also correct given current folder structure
i googled and found that i can mark directory as resources

27106607
accelerometer	gyroscope
i tried assembling an app from different examples using gyroscope or accelerometer or rotation vector sensors but could not come with something working properly

27106680
post	get
i m following the following steps create a cart with the security key of the client i have previously created the id of the product i want to buy and the quantity
then create a new order sending a post to api order passing the client id the security key the product id the prices with and without taxes etc... this is the entire xml that i send as you can see i m using the cashondelivery module
my problem is that when i post that xml to the api the order get s created but somehow the order doesn t show up in the orders list but i can get to that order if i go to clients - shopping carts - id of cart i created before post-ing the order xml - order created from this cart

27106718
triples	freebase
the steps are roughly as follows split the 28gb gzip 250gb uncompressed into smaller gzip files a 5m lines this results in about 550 files go trough each of the files look for the triples that declare a certain type and store the subjects freebase namespace + mid in one file per type i m interested in a go trough each of the files again since i now know the mids i can assemble the full objects

27106733
try-catch	exception-handling
no exception-handling would be handled in this case since the returned task is not awaited
there is however a distinction between a simple task -returning method and an async method you can avoid code duplication by simply having an async wrapper method that both invokes the method and await s the returned task inside a single try-catch block


27106766
pop-up	dialog
the best way is to have your window closing listener and action listener call the same method that will pop-up the dialog and call system.exit 0 if the user wants to exit

27106770
width	height
you should use inline styling in html emails as your style tags will be removed by google mail - this is also very useful to see what styles work in which email clients if you want to give your button a static size then use width height rather than max-width max-height as they are not supported in outlook 07+ to sort out the content table being centered you need to put it within a table that is 100 width and then set that to be align centre what #39

27106782

27106890
dplyr	tidyr
here is one idea using dplyr and tidyr

27106926
entities	entitymanager
you can however skip 1st level cache by using createquery createnamedquery createnativequery for querying and bulk updates deletes the persistence context is not updated to reflect their results
such queries should be executed in their own transaction thus invalidating any cached entities if any
transaction-scoped entitymanager means stateless should be used as well

the visible part of the background image depends on the screen size.the width of the slider is always 100
the slider height is fixed to n pixels

27106980
ready	each
you could revert the two arrays by creating a structure where you map routeid to array index for both of them you loop over each array and build something like and then you iterate over s keys and for each key you check if there is a corresponding key in . if yes you are ready to fetch which is the sub-array corresponding to the route you want to enrich in

i then went to this page there i again unchecked hard crop next to all items
i pressed save

27107053
config	ini
so my opinion is only use xml when you have options you can not represent in an ini file the ini sections work great for seperating live staging and dev configs also keeping them seperate but together in a simple and easy to edit way
config files are by far the easiest to work with they can be put in your version control system to see changes over time etc
i usually try and use the function parse_ini_file to lead it in to keep it in a well known format and make it clear that its not code its a config

27107230
width	height
however for an approximation i use the font size as the height and a fudge factor for the width where we are working in floats with a scale factor of 100
you can t compute the width of a string without the graphics context you are going to use to draw it
see this question

27107230
width	height
see this question
so you need will need to calculate the string width within your paintcomponent method every time it is called
however for an approximation i use the font size as the height and a fudge factor for the width where we are working in floats with a scale factor of 100

27107444

internationalization	localization	internationalization	localization
also localization which is potentially performed multiple times for different locales uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization which is ideally performed only once or as an integral part of ongoing development
according to wikipedia internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can potentially be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes
localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text

multiplying	division
for example 0.5 can be represented exactly dividing by 10 actually produces the same result as multiplying by 0.1 in other languages division between integers results in an integer however in javascript all numbers are modelled as floating points

27108186
int	double
to start d stands for int
the vector argument is recycled if possible but if it is c 1.5 1 it will fail when sprintf tries to replace d with 1.5 which is not int
i thought it might be related to the fact that in r both int and double are numeric mode for example thus both vectors should be stored as double
