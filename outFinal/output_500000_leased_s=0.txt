postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and mysql 5 are slightly worse than postgresql


71743
tapestry	sitemesh
Pattern(s): 10	
i have used sitemesh and sitemesh is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page


119991
freebsd	linux
Pattern(s): 8	
the freebsd kernel has a much more relaxed license than linux i think you might find the freebsd kernel worthwhile


133271
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 0	
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline a pointer automatically as a pointer will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining a pointer only once


140502
pop-up	dialog
Pattern(s): 7	
i think the pop-up centered on the parent window however s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and this is pop-up blocked s imo less annoying


217514
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 10	
for example the popular recursive quicksort algorithm provides quite reasonable performance with adequate ram but due to the recursive way that adequate ram copies portions of the array adequate ram becomes much less practical when the array does not fit in ram because adequate ram may cause a number of slow copy or move operations to and from disk


223029
interpreted-language	compiled-language
Pattern(s): 0	
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use a compiled-language and how you structure the code


330657
post	get
Pattern(s): 3	
security wise i prefer using post than get as the page gives at least some opaqueness as to what is being passed as a parameter and not anyone can just edit the url and play around


439818
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 2	
i have never used postgresql myself but i think postgresql s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer postgresql over mysql


488946
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 10	
if the subclassing is more specific then the subclassing might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to the subclassing superclass __init__ method


592640
kerberos	ntlm
Pattern(s): 7	0	
kerberos is complex to set up and even though kerberos generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site


844519
tapestry	wicket
Pattern(s): 2	
beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like tapestry


879201
colt	jama
Pattern(s): 8	0	
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt


890438
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
Pattern(s): 0	
if sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist s faster than sorteddictionary


1075055
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
Pattern(s): 3	
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local variables


1302592
phpmyadmin	heidisql
Pattern(s): 2	
since you re on windows i can highly recommend heidisql over phpmyadmin for working with mysql


1365849
textmate	gedit
Pattern(s): 0	
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using right - gedit more than textmate on os x


1566777
kerberos	ntlm
Pattern(s): 2	
yes negotiate will pick between kerberos and ntlm but this is a one time choice


1753801
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
when working with a portrait photo the photo height is greater than the width


1772948
joptionpane	jdialog
Pattern(s): 0	
usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs people write people own dialogs using jdialog


1798628
strsplit	substr
Pattern(s): 7	
usually you use strsplit to break a string in parts but with substr there s an easier solution for your problem


1962727
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 7	
using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitors to switch to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else all visitors prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting off devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs


2013862
cobertura	emma
Pattern(s): 0	
at one point i inquired about emma on a scala mailing list and i was told that by some that some had more success with cobertura


2076025
calloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 7	0	
calloc does take longer than malloc because calloc has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving calloc to you


2128783
lxml	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 10	
since beautifulsoup is no longer being actively developed i would recommend lxml since it does all the things beautifulsoup can do and a lot more


2166220
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 0	
if microsoft provided a rss feed people would install way more hotfixes than a rss feed people should and we don t want people to unintentionally break people own apps and not be able to find out which of the 30 hotfixes people installed is to blame


2625948
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	7	
because a double is higher a double is higher will merge the int into the 0.0


2626302
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 10	
my suspicion is that ie is swapping out the image for the last ie finds firefox is using the first and safari is saying screw this


2656592
x86	mips
Pattern(s): 8	
a better bet might be to install spim and to learn mips assembly which is more straightforward than x86 anyways


2717463
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 7	
note that while some people even trying to answer you re question think that md5 is insecure the reality is that md5 is still more than adequate for most purposes although i d recommend one of the more recent hash if you run paypal or control the launchpads for a fleet of nuclear weapons


2850154
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
documents are most likely to be in portrait format taller than documents are wide so if the height is greater than the width then do don t have to do anything


2874749
vbscript	jscript
Pattern(s): 8	
i am much more experienced with vbscript than jscript but i will give vbscript than jscript a shot since not many takers on this question


2886494
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
Pattern(s): 0	
sqlbuddy might look cute be fast and better than phpmyadmin but sqlbuddy has sqlbuddy limitations


2943437
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if the first thing not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as the first thing caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index


3313279
public	protected
Pattern(s): 7	
the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using the theory with public access


3421762
visualvm	yourkit
Pattern(s): 3	
but by all means if you have the budget i d recommend getting yourkit as the budget provides more sophisticated features and better metrics that visualvm don t have


3518755
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
an int is a bigger memory area than a chars and when you read you ll pick up other values beside a chars and end up with an effectively random value


3573705
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 3	
beside the advantages of encapsulation we prefer using properties with get and set accessor among many other ways because many other ways provide a clear and practical syntax


3690958
vim	textmate
Pattern(s): 0	
it s horses for courses personally i m much happier with textmate or vim and a nice cup of coffee but it s what feels more comfortable to you


3701546
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	0	
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of both of them fail if tokens are checked


3827002
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 10	
a debian or ubuntu system contains more python packages but the apt-get packages are specifically tuned for your system


3946868
apache	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 0	
since you ve switched to lighttpd the webserver itself is going to use fewer resources than apache would but apache is rarely the bottleneck unless you ve run out of ram or seriously misconfigured the webserver itself


3990544
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
for example if the element element can exist in more than one parent but you want the first ten of example that would select the first ten element elements which are children of the root


3991401
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if the function width or height is larger than your max values then it will be resized by keeping the aspect ratio


4225772
folder	dir
Pattern(s): 0	
calculates the size of the first 5 folder in your home dir should work on all platforms fails with an arrayindexoutofboundexception if there are less than five folder in your home dir


4396834
fink	macports
Pattern(s): 0	
on top of fink gives you access to more packages than macports


4710605
trac	bugzilla
Pattern(s): 10	
if you really want something with php then i guess bugzilla but imho trac is better


4747607
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 0	
the problem was that i was trying to add the bigger layer as a sublayer of the uiscrollview directly instead wrapping the bigger layer in a uiview and adding the bigger layer as a subviews worked


4798429
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
the button content is higher than the width height s width when the binding is set to height- width


4798429
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if the button contents width is higher than it s height then the binding will force the binding s width lower


4853900
mp3	ogg
Pattern(s): 2	
if you ask people to compare between mp3 aac m4a mp4 and ogg - people will give you different answers


4907141
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
the standard doesn t specify anything deeper than malloc and free which leaves c libraries free to implement t to work in t target environments


5005191
bitarray	bitset
Pattern(s): 0	
1 might not yet be sparse enough to make this better compared to just a plain bitarray assuming longs storing 64 bits each it doesn t take more than 2 longs to have more than one bitset on average but if the sparsity increases beyond that the space and time savings will show


5032917
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 10	
the inline keyword is more or less useless in this era regarding early inlining original intent


5248641
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you can also use compression on the tables to keep the tables smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity


5401619
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 0	
this way is better than having getter and setter in base of performance not to have reduntant code of two methods getter and setter


5588019
cairngorm	mate
Pattern(s): 8	
i m more familiar with mate than cairngorm but what i do in this situation is to back up my pop up with a model and dispatch the events off of a model


6087022
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 10	10	
i feel like using scripts ant maven is more natural for this task whereas java needs to work hard to read all the files folders to heap and write folders to heap to another folder


6275623
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 0	
of course uiscrollview can have more than one content view just as any uiview can have more than one subviews and this case it will be more difficult to render it layer


6524508
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
as for swfloader the height width property acts more like a canvas


6731523
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this is a radical concept i know but a mouse is slower than keyboard shortcuts


6824099
microchip	avr
Pattern(s): 10	8	
as far as easy goes better tools than avr are both equivalent in terms of difficulty better tools than avr provide assembly and c except that the gnu toolchain for avr is more complex than microchip because the gnu toolchain for avr requires use of unix command line etc


7022434
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 10	
edit since you say you can t add a none option and want to use a checkbox even though i strongly disagree on checkbox where a radio button is more appropriate - a common ui error .


7123723
qhash	qmap
Pattern(s): 10	
qhash is faster but qmap values are sorted by key if you iterate through qmap values


7230825
dbcontext	objectcontext
Pattern(s): 0	
you want to replace data in perfil is a feature it is about objectcontext api but the same is true or worse with dbcontext api


7335227
outputstream	inputstream
Pattern(s): 2	
map your image servlet on an url pattern of and get the image id or filename by request.getpathinfo and finally select it as inputstream from the db and write it to outputstream of the response


7419841
filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 7	0	
since the filesystems is more than likely fat or fat32 protecting the filesystems permission based way would be more convoluted


7460115
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	0	
in case of min heap when you insert the element which is less than some nodes in the tree the data structure now doesn t follow heap condition in case of min heap value of parent should be less than parent children so you have to shift up and up


7545483
uiview	uiwindow
Pattern(s): 7	
a uiwindow has everything a uiview has and more


7672369
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 2	
i choose button over checkbox in this case because i think the grouping are handier and faster to work with


7694050
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	7	
not that i think this is a good idea but in c at least you can check if your unsigned integer is greater than int_max for two s complement anyway not so sure about the sign magnitude and one s complement variants but they re probably rare enough that you could safely ignore they until a problem pops up


7725180
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 10	
this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use this


7754188
x86	mips
Pattern(s): 7	7	
if you pick up something like mips and get the hang of something like mips x86 is less of a monster to learn


8000104
moq	moles
Pattern(s): 10	
personally i think moles is much better suited for mocking the unmockable and i prefer a combination of moq for my own interfaces and classes and moq for framework and externalities like file i o gui db connections etc


8021213
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	
generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that


8165120
atof	strtod
Pattern(s): 7	0	
edit basile starynkevitch mentions that strtod is better than atof for this job as this job gives the ending character


8212449
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
if not try to use the post method as the post method can hold more data than get method


8388767
unix	aix
Pattern(s): 10	
nawk alas aix don t have sort and unix sort is far more superior then any hand-made sort in awk


8596064
gif	png
Pattern(s): 7	
-type palette might help to reduce your gif file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for png images


8698365
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
you can tell the difference by seeing if the screen height is greater than the screen width


8881046
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
Pattern(s): 0	
by default when you scale a qgraphicsscene larger than the qgraphicsview in which it is displayed it will show the necessary scroll bars


8931800
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 10	10	
using a ram disk is even better though often more of a challenge to get a ram disk to implement for you


8981895
cpython	ironpython
Pattern(s): 10	
ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython


9015987
xslt	xquery
Pattern(s): 7	
setting a namespace as the default namespace might be useful though sadly in xquery this also makes a namespace the default namespace for the output - xslt does this better


9055653
keystore	jks
Pattern(s): 0	
instead you can support more than the jks and try the default keystore type and if the default keystore type fails try the #pkcs12


9057271
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	
that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches


9108031
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
while setting it to the imageview check if the width of the image is greater than height or not and rotate the image to 90 if needed


9236157
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fixed-point
Pattern(s): 7	0	
but another added benefit of this approach is that this approach could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic


9381223
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	0	
since parent have a higher z-index than parent children you need to change the default browser stacking behavior


9381223
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
the z-index for its children should be higher than the parent


9427335
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
the for-loop is using i as a global variable so if your instance.set_marker function is also using i as a global variable and sets your instance.set_marker function value to something greater than 6 loops will exit


9463889
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
Pattern(s): 7	
you can also use the thread.join which andrewb suggests but i prefer a manualresetevent or autoresetevent since a manualresetevent or autoresetevent gives you more control over how and when a manualresetevent or autoresetevent s called


9609619
ordereddictionary	sorteddictionary
Pattern(s): 10	
it might not be the most efficient way to do it but i ve used ordereddictionary though sorteddictionary is probably more appropriate for handling the out of order issue in the past


9627280
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
because of tcp requires connection and provides security it is slower than udp and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming


9666529
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this function should check of a series of integers that there are four this function are all different and that the min is 3 less than the max - thus that there are four in a row


9760053
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
now you could iterate through the objects to find current limits 9min and max or you could even do the measure while you calculate the measures each time sth smaller than min happens store new min etc


9788111
mpfr	mpir
Pattern(s): 7	
the mpfr library can use mpir and provides much more complete floating-point support


9818771
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	
the operator precedence rules state that the binary multiplication operator has higher priority than the binary addition operator +


9870286
rank	max
Pattern(s): 7	
if your rank is less than 4 it takes 0 instead it s the max part


10116389
retaincount	dealloc
Pattern(s): 7	7	
if your array s retaincount is greater than 1 at the start of dealloc some other object is retaining your array s retaincount is greater than 1 at the start of dealloc at least temporarily


10240005
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if width is less than height just discarding it and if above allowing it


10363584
onchange	onblur
Pattern(s): 8	
edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure


10594881
onresume	onpause
Pattern(s): 10	
in your activity onresume will be called when your activity onresume becomes visible and onpause will be called when your activity onresume is no longer visible


10643923
popover	tooltip
Pattern(s): 7	
a tooltip has more in common with a popover but common are generally regarded as a popup historically


10765232
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	0	0	
2 if width is greater then image s height is greater than width width will be 300


10803166
comm	grep
Pattern(s): 0	
the comm command should be faster than grep because the comm command will work with sorted data while grep will always do a linear search


10807427
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 3	
i would definitely recommend using instrumentation to profiling what message is taking the most time so you can really break what message down


10848194
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 7	
an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of the application s though the application s may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screens


11264861
xmltype	clob
Pattern(s): 7	
a clob is a safer way to handle the soap request than an xmltype because the data returned may be longer than 32767 bytes


11371300
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 10	
a parameterized ant script has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but the actual pom.xml does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven


11477001
highcharts	flotr
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you should be able to do this in flotr which has a better license than highcharts by just throwing what they showed in this blog post on this side


11570526
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 10	
you can create custom controller to serve that files and use send_file mentod in send_file mentod with disposition inline also you may be interested to x_sendfile_header setting to serwe that files with apache nginx which is faster


11730008
xna	slimdx
Pattern(s): 0	
considering the lack of windows 8 love that xna is getting support being dropped apps won t be sellable on the app store -- i d go with slimdx -- i d s better than xna anyway -- the only down side is that you can i d make xbox apps with i d


11805018
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 7	
this library also lets swing applications run unmodified using an swt backend since your program is already written using swt that doesn t help you but it will others


11960001
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchdb	membase	couchbase
Pattern(s): 7	8	
i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level the 2.0 version s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together


12045089
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	7	
don t think of t as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong


12083121
webclient	httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 0	
webclient has a much simpler interface than httpwebrequest and takes care of reading and writing from the streams for you


12198850
subclass	abstract-class	super	abstract
Pattern(s): 7	
you can make it not abstract or create a subclass that invokes super on your abstract-class


12300894
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
Pattern(s): 2	
if you want to manipulate what it outputs via dom then you have to have a known quantity to match with getelementbyid getelementsbytagname or some other method for getting html element nodes from a dom


12322927
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
if anything still isn t resizing properly adjust anything still isn t resizing constraints so that anything still isn t resizing width and or height is no longer constant


12332127
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 0	0	
the resulting page identifiers will also be shorter than md5 hash and will only contain digits so the resulting page identifiers will be easy to include in url query strings etc


12638140
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
Pattern(s): 0	
well glassfish is more right than jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes should all have jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes own ejb-local-interface


12739978
draggable	droppable
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the problem you outlined is that the droppable is allowing more than 1 draggable item to be placed inside of the problem you outlined


12794377
goto	break
Pattern(s): 7	0	
but break is no better or worse than goto


13244402
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
if the children can exist without a parent calling persist merge on the children directly is the better option


13383931
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
in the browser default font the zero width space is taller than verdana characters are causing added height requirements


13442619
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
this also affects how the data is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion


13606542
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 0	
if you have two servers you would be better with nginx on site a proxying all requests to the internal server b with apache db and gearman on the internal server


13891140
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 8	
it sounds to me like you are asking for the union of the filtering session values from the two tables and as you want the distinct set you do want union rather than union all union all is actually a much more common requirement than union


13962386
pull	push
Pattern(s): 10	
if that happens the push will fail and the user telling him what s going on will have to pull before him can push as the push is no longer a fast-forward


13993979
lxml	elementtree
Pattern(s): 7	
the lxml library uses the same elementtree but offers more control over the output


14174099
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 10	8	
setinterval is more useful than settimeout here as setinterval recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it


14349123
width	margin
Pattern(s): 7	
the width of the span content plus the left margin is greater than 1000px and so 1000px wraps spans to the next line


14405219
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	
if you change libraries instead and hit an error post it i ll help you get it working


14964979
range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
the benefit of backbone models is that those are are dynamic so you can create a parser to read the validations form the server and add those validations to the backbone model in the way your pluggin need it it kind of easy if you only use required minlength max length and a regex but gets harder with range or some other kind of validations


15058125
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
i m on a mac os x 10.8.2 running firefox 18.0.2 - 18.0.2 actually runs the game faster and smoother than my google-chrome 25.0.1364.99

what you need to do is dynamically decide which side height or width has lesser value and then resize to that side maintaining aspect ratio and then crop that side


16370442
mdpi	hdpi
Pattern(s): 0	
you can also put hdpi 2x larger in xhdpi and 3x larger in xxhdpi in res drawable-nodpi in which case no image rescaling would be applied but no image rescaling is hardly ideal as the same image would be physically 3x smaller in xxhdpi than in mdpi

Pattern(s): 7	
give it a try works perfect for me what it is doing query get the all the post with a left jon with comments table so when a post has comment them n it also has the comment_date if no comments posted on a post then in result set it will be null so i have merged the comment_date with post_date so which post has the greater date for comment_date or post_date it will first and so on


17559504
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
in a lot of code the size of a variable isn t critical because the number is within such a range that a few thousand is way more than you ever need - number of chars in a filename is defined by the os and i m not aware of any os where a filename path is more than 4k chars - so a 16 32 or 64 bit value that can go to at least 32k would be perfectly fine for counting that - it doesn t really matter what size t is - so here we should use int not try to use a specific size


17595155

19528745
lua	moonscript
Pattern(s): 7	
note that there several advantages to leaving the lua code duplication generated by moonscript in your lua files at least for oft-used operations class definition is probably not one of your lua files but moonscript does way more than that


19621961
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	0	
however if you want to get more than one post rather use functions mentioned above i think the most important thing is to grab you want to get more than one post in one db query and not in ineffective way one-by-one


19696947
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
i have a comment on your for-loop q is never considered in the stopping condition therefore putting the stopping condition within loops is more logical in my opinion

our want to wait for an element to be visible visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0


20328742
codeigniter	yii
Pattern(s): 2	
so i always prefer yii over codeigniter


20407697
width	font-size
Pattern(s): 0	
you can use javascript to measure the div and set the font-size of a child div but a better idea might be to use an image of text that can resize a better idea by having width 100 so that a better idea always fills the parent div exactly


20463851
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
take each value and compare it to your current min and max values- if it is higher than the max or lower than the min replace that and then add the value to a running total for average purposes


20746334
public	protected
Pattern(s): 10	
second though the public quickly becomes more complicated you could use the above but with a protected set and force users to go through a method-based system to modify values allowing you to restrict log and otherwise do some logic during these actions


20755676
jobs	cron
Pattern(s): 3	
secondly if you want to schedule a re-boot of the machine i would recommend using cron jobs for a re-boot of the machine


21026331

Pattern(s): 7	
and then switching them display-properties when the screens is smaller than x px


21068023
public	protected
Pattern(s): 7	
if you overload the create_transparent_image method you must also define the create_transparent_image method as protected or define the create_transparent_image method as public which is weaker


21122732
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
while using chars there is probability of getting garbage value as using chars directly stores the chars but using int there is less probability of using chars as using chars stores the ascii value of the chars


21206375
cinnamon	gnome
Pattern(s): 10

it does produce hexadecimal rather than binary but it s very likely that hex is what you really want


22178187
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the line works because of operator precedence multiplication has a higher precedence than addition + so it will be done first


22212079
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 10	
use viewdidupdatelayout or viewdidlayoutsubviews if you need to perform layout adjustments in your controller but viewwillappear doesn t work for a weird situation such as a timing issue use viewdidappear is better done in a uiview subclass in my opinion


22248369
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
debug with firefox using firebug debug will give you more info than google-chrome on this type of error


22298391
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
i think it mostly depends on the interprter engine in browser which responsible for interpreting th scripts which server sends to your browser and another thing about firefox as you have mentioned the extension in firefox is also responsible for the extension in firefox and another thing which i think matters a lot the developement of the browser as you can see google-chrome has same ui on all windows linux mac since the extension in firefox is mostly written in java so the extension in firefox requires jvm to run hence it is slow as compared to firefox which is written separately for each os using the respective oss apis hence it is fast since it directly interacts with os than interacting with jvm which in turn interacts with os like in case of chrome.still google-chrome is faster in incognito mode because of the extension in firefox intelligence to keep frequently data cached if you ll see the temporary files created by google-chrome you ll see the temporary files created by google-chrome are huge in size as compared to that of firefox

debian	linux
Pattern(s): 0	
personally i develop on the windows but deploy on debian where couldn t find the scrapyd package at all at the time i was working on the scrapyd package and noticed that performance of scrapy is considerably worse than on linux box so you might reconsider your target

that s why even picky compilers do not issue a warning if you shift a chars wider than 7 bits try it - you ll get the warning only if you shift wider than an int allows


22478337
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 0	
1 first you need to create one class to fill listview and the element of one class should be whatever you want to display in list item and declare one integer than generate getter and setter method for it like


22499256
viewdidload	viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 7	
i agree with the other answer that this animation shouldn t be in viewdidload - you ve got no guarantee the view has been added to your window at that point viewdidappear is a better place


22568041
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if your compiler can do this then writing functions in a way that your compiler is able to inline is better than manually inlining the calls yourself

width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
gl_invalid_value is generated if width or height is less than 0


23373326
jsr168	jsr286
Pattern(s): 0	
as the previous poster points out this would be easier with jsr286 portlets wef and non-wef as the eventing is standard but jsr286 portlets wef and non-wef as the eventing is standard s not impossible with jsr168 if you re limited to that version in the short term


23532067
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 0	
but when anyone human looks at machine code anyone human look at machine code in hex using a hex editor which is much easier than reading binary


23770379
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	
though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie


23812903
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 10	
to me this makes your choice pretty clear cut depending on whether or not you can require those within your organization to upgrade those within your organization browsers to a versioning that is html5 compatible if those within your organization haven t already


23881563
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
and if image height is smaller than screen height the image width the image height will fit screen


24075797
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 10	
have you considered creating an object structure for these files and serializing these files java object serializable and deserialization is much faster than parsing an xml this is again considering that these 500 or so xml files don t get modified between reads


24077647
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 7	
better use of salt is that better use of salt is randomly generated before use in hash function and better use of salt does not need to be 1024 bytes - 8 bytes is more than enough for salt and then prepended to resulting hash


24183805
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 7	
you need to copy folder which has jasper jrxml files and put jasper jrxml files same directory of your jar file


24376457
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
list.remove max is first run your program goes through the while loop again but min and max will keep the same values min and max had on the first pass through the loop and as nothing remaining in list is greater than max or less than min the variables won t be changed and so python will end up trying to run list.remove min


24446302
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 10	
you can either prepend a dot to your image address which means go to parent directory meaning get out of css and then look for images or you can move your images folder to your css folder whichever is more comfortable for you


24548057
public	protected
Pattern(s): 8	
change it to public to make it more accessible or perhaps better protected to make it less accessible than public but more than private read more about that here


24656056
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 10	10	
if we put we filter in between these calls either in getter or setter setter is more efficient as it is called only when filters change we modify original filtered list with we filter and return our filter back through the getter

if you need to run all 3 in 1 click then you are better off with maven ant or something similar that has a good integration with eclipse


25450930
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 0	
it s interesting and probably relevant that the value is larger than an unsigned 64 bit integer but since the value is a string this is theoretically legal


25542334
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 0	
normally we used to put this type of extra functions files under lib directory so you should create one folder and named one folder lib under app directory and put logger.js file under that folder and try again


25568874
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you should treat submit as what happens after you ve done any pre-processing so binding to click events then conditionally raising the submit is better than always submission but conditionally stopping the submit


25576741
cypher	gremlin
Pattern(s): 10	
neo4j and cypher is still faster and obviously this has no effect on the gremlin queries on neo4j but that might be just a issue with the gremlin implementation for neo4j


25614535
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 10	
using a submit button makes codeigniter actually perform the problem standard form submission function which causes a reload or a redirect


25636748
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if the inner divs width or height is greater than the outer divs the overall layout structure will turn out wrong logically like in your case


25735875
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
in this case if i want to have a fixed width while keeping ratio i just set height to a very large number so that the resizer will actually ignore the resizer since the ratio of real height to desired height is far smaller than the ratio of real width and desired width


25739925
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
you should not be using the post method for requests that contain no actual data get method is better for that

Pattern(s): 7	
if you try to print a chars whose int value is greater than about 127 you might find your console prints gibberish


26457906
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 7	
as gnibbler pointed out cpython is slower in the simple implementation but pypy is jit compiled for much faster code when you need much faster code


26536703
free	realloc
Pattern(s): 10	
if you don t mind the libc allocator functions realloc is even more efficient the libc allocator functions realloc wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as free and if you grow the memory and there is memory free after the libc allocator functions realloc will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either


26560756
versioning	upgrade

27233355
subclass	accessor
Pattern(s): 0	
the indirection has some costs and is kinda ugly so if you want to keep this functionality you might be better off by implementing accessor methods and only log in a subclass of core

i think the reporters package is actually easier to use than knitr


27886189
width	height

28485941
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
guys after spending too much time looking around for an easier way to do this i combine the info from research to do this like this simply using the getimagesize function -if the height is larger than the width echo an image tag with a style having a height of 100 else echo the same image tag but with a style having a width of 100


28535295
rpm	yum
Pattern(s): 0	
both commands works in the same way only difference is yum list installed output maybe bigger than rpm -qa because yum will show package dependencies also in package dependencies output


28541798

29327795
int	chars	unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 10	
this is pretty simple for types sizeof int but unsigned chars short is more complicated and requires compiler specific packing


29451986
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 10	
if you re using typedef you no longer need to write struct all over the place by useing typedef code is more cleaner since useing typedef code provides a smidgen more abstraction


29680565
kerberos	ldap
Pattern(s): 0	
active directory is far more than ldap - at the very least you d need kerberos but active directory also tightly integrates with dns both srv and a records which d require significant trickiness to fake over an ssl connection

Pattern(s): 7	0	
the user applies to window objects but also to scrollable frames and elements with the overflow css property set to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or width of the user contents


29729201
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
as you can see what s happening here is sometimes the object falling out of the document because the width or height of the document + the randomized percentage is more than document width or height


29827603
range	max	range	min	min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
in general you want to have a range slightly larger than x max - x min and then divide a range slightly larger than x max - x min into the desired number of bins


30125058
mdpi	hdpi
Pattern(s): 7	0	
as mdpi is less than hdpi so it will take the values from the folder which is least below it in you case it is values which is applicable to all


30132700
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
now inside the ongesture protected function handler of crosszoom it actually checks the innerregion of your chart and if your current x or y is greater than the width or height you get this from the innerregion of the chart of your chart respectively it s reset to the width height of the chart width and height is


30219361
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 7	
so if it takes 1 second to generate each hash it becomes a bigger time sink than it would have been had you used a fast hash such as md5 of a version of sha


30359522
rxtx	jssc
Pattern(s): 7	
i have not found any solution for closing serial port of rxtx package in windows 8.1 environment i moved therefore to jssc package and jssc package works much better the full solution including closing port and event listener can be found here


30424479
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 7	
i find that the swing library is easier to use than awt although you do still have to use awt for listeners

often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh


30604790
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
since the svg s width is much larger than the svg s height every 1px change in the height of the svg is causing the width to change by about 10px


30655594
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
myisam is faster when the query is simple but the query s much slower in a high concurrent environment as the query table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock


30744177

Pattern(s): 7	
post makes post easier to semantically separate getting data from the web server get and sending data to the webserver post


30769972
cloudant	couchdb
Pattern(s): 8	
proper handling of the last case is more complicated under cloudant and probably couchdb 2.0 due to the last case totally broken quorum handling but that s a different topic.


31236608
width	margin
Pattern(s): 7	
adding margin adds more width making the total width of the two elements and their margin greater than 100 pushing the elements onto separate lines


31341201
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if either is larger than 1 it means the checkbox height or width is larger


31408821
rsa	aes
Pattern(s): 10	
note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has each encrypted chunk own padding and that rsa is much more computationally expensive than aes


31408821
rsa	aes
Pattern(s): 0	
if the message you re encrypting is large enough not only will the message you re encrypting is large enough take more time to process but the rsa encrypted message might be larger than an rsa encrypted aes key plus an aes encrypted message


31440012
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 2	
from a web page you can only choose between client-side mail letting the user confirm what everyone s browsers re sending and losing some proportion of respondants who aren t in a position to send mail or a web-accessible server-side mail forwarder either a third-party service or your own server in which case you have to work out the security yourself


31504088
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
since you want to track cars a simpler approach is based on the consideration that a person is smaller than a car or that with reference to people bounding boxes for a person usually the height is greater than the width usually a person is standing or walking for a car is the other way around


31670255
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if the width is smaller scale the image so the width is has the minimum width and crop it so the width is has the proper height


31826941
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 7	
the answer is simple here - pickle on pypy is slower because here - pickle on pypy s implemeneted in pure python as opposed to c in cpython


32159287
flyway	liquibase
Pattern(s): 0	
the downside is that you are losing the big part of the flyway s appeal in the flyway s simplicity and technically could be better off by using liquibase s dsl


32200916
uicollectionviewcell	uipageviewcontroller
Pattern(s): 3	
i would never recommend implementing uipageviewcontroller on uicollectionviewcell because uipageviewcontroller might kill your performance


32231586
jobs	cron
Pattern(s): 8	
sources for cron jobs as i am less familiar with cron jobs than with sed


32264487
super	implements
Pattern(s): 0	
the easiest way to stop a specific super-user from creating more super-users is to implements a form-in trigger on the protections table rejecting updates by untrusted super-users when untrusted super-users add more entries with super permission


32401117
metaspace	permgen
Pattern(s): 10	
in java-8 permgen was replaced with metaspace which is more flexible in terms of memory usage so you rarely need to tune it size explicitly


32402446
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 8	8	
a team which feels more comfortable with setter getter won t kill the project but you ll have to see a team which feels more comfortable with setter getter every day

to answer the real question why is myisam slower than innodb i can why is myisam slower than innodb give an authoritative answer


32805847
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 7	
an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of the application s though the application s may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screens

you may check that for some dimension box s max coordinate is lesser than min coordinate before inserting a new value into the rtree


33224211
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
i ll post more info as i get more info


33412031
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
the get is usually faster because the get has no encapsulation sends data via url usually with a 255 character limit as post exists encapsulation by being sent by the body of the http request


34097833
spaces	linefeed
Pattern(s): 0	
it makes minimal change to the text in particular it never splits a word doesn t change wc -w and for text with no more than single spaces in a row and no cr it doesn t change wc -c because it replaces spaces with linefeed rather than inserting linefeed


34165853
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
if you are working on an embedded system that has limited memory good chances are that the malloc returned a null because you were attempting to request more memory than the malloc had free in one contiguous block


34333821
jenkins	sonar-runner
Pattern(s): 0	
check the sonarqube scanner that you are using and make sure the sonarqube scanner running as part of the build job more than by the jenkins plugin itself version is compatible with sonarqube 5.2 compatibility info can be found in the scanner documentation e.g sonar-runner scanner for maven etc.


34463952
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 0	
now the inner text is the best time to point out that these properties are a little trickier than these properties look for example unset sometimes acts like initial and sometimes acts like inherited


34484169
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 0	0	
one more problem with folder name projéčť contains the non ascii characters éčť and therefore one more problem with folder name projéčť is important that in text editor used for editing the batch file the correct code page is set as otherwise directory projéčť would not be found


34511607
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the last operation in the case where max is greater than min is called self assignment


34590955
ceil	floor

a simple function to follow would be if greater than 0 floor else ceil using a multiplier to raise greater than 0 floor above the decimal point temporarily whilst doing it


34638837
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
your loops being a simple counter you might want to replace your loops with a for-loop as your loops indicates better that loops does not break because of some operations happening within loops


34689546
ienumerable	icollection
Pattern(s): 10	8	
a better way to do that instead is taking in an ienumerable which is more generic than icollection since icollection implements ienumerable and simply checking icollection implements ienumerable for null and else returning any from linq s operators


34759200
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 0	
the default keyboard s a little bit easier than the mouse but still a manual task


34846138
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 7	
but as the inline code gets longer the savings for inlining become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be inline must be smaller than the limit


35033950
pop-up	dialog
Pattern(s): 0	
the purpose of this parameter is to tell the dialog what setting this parameter will be shown in and if that s pop-up then the dialog elements are rendered smaller than the dialog elements would be in the full page version


35229490
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 3	
so i recommend using getter and setter unless you have good reasons not to do so


35253152
nuxeo	alfresco
Pattern(s): 10	
nuxeo is definitely more advanced in this because with nuxeo web interface you can customise almost everything but alfresco has other advantages


35462760
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
therefore when the code branch is introduced the decrementing of c happens once for every iteration of the for-loop that manages c since the decrementing is either or the decrementing will not reach 9 and end loops


35486819
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
i created a temporary id and assigned ef to the parent record and stored that for later use with the children


35689010
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
the device seems to work by seeing if the width is bigger then the height landscape so it also works on desktop really well


35774300
margin	height
Pattern(s): 0	
if you want to use it then add a bottom margin to the content_main which should be equal or greater than the height of the ad layout


36011861
tinyint	varchar
Pattern(s): 10	
using varchar is less efficient than using tinyint like aju john suggested in aju john comment but unless i m dealing with a really performance-critical or a huge table - i find it easier to deal with


36036177
minimum	diagonal
Pattern(s): 7	
even with 32 levels of recusions the recursion will never explode in a rectangular draw area whose diagonal is shorter than 2 32 pixels the limit would be reached only if you are splitting a virtual bezier in a virtually infinite space with floating-point coordinates but you don t intend to draw it directly because you won t have the 1 2 pixel limitation in such space and only if you have set an extreme value for the flatness such that your minimum square sine constant parameter is 1 2 32 or lower


36050569
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if the height or the width is larger than the contentsize the super view will scroll


36378899
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
so a better solution would be reading a better solution as a chars or string and then converting that into an int


36418780
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 10	10	
the other way round returning a subclassing that is a more specific class does not break the contract because a subclassing that is a more specific class has at least the same functionality as the superclass


36475044
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 7	
and then all your users are relying on your left right controls no matter whether all your users re using a mouse or the keyboard which gives you more control over how it looks at each stage


36564484
hikaricp	c3p0
Pattern(s): 0	
i would also recommend you to check hikaricp as hikaricp way much better than c3p0


36658801
jdom	dom4j
Pattern(s): 8	
for heavy due xml processing vtd-xml is the most efficient option available heavy due xml processing vtd-xml is far more efficent than jdom dom4j or dom.


36665967
width	margin
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the reason why your website is x-scrollable on all devices is that you forgot to add to and the row inside your website has 100 +15px left margin +15px right margin which is bigger than window width


36816500
eigen	openblas
Pattern(s): 10	
eigen has much more friendly api compared to openblas which also has arm-optimized code path


36899666
swing	windowbuilder
Pattern(s): 7	
in my opinion swing is easier to start because there are tools like the eclipse windowbuilder which enables you to create your application in a graphical interface but javafx is more likely to be used in the future because javafx has some great improvements over swing like css skins etc.


36975169
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	0	
as long as each parent is smaller than each parent children - it will work


37530245
lxml	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 2	
if you choose to use python and are new to the language check out the codecademy python course and don t forget to check out lxml as some people prefer lxml over beautifulsoup some people also use both in conjunction so lxml s all a matter of personal preference


37955314
emacs	sublimetext
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this is the one thing i think sublimetext does better than emacs


37988585
bmp	pgm	bmp	ppm	ppm	pgm
Pattern(s): 8	
i used ppm pgm files as ppm pgm files are simpler to write and more portable than bmp


38099246
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
hence post is more secure than get


38226082
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
this would become more apparent if you had a shape with much longer width than this height


38426289
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	0	0	0	
i am just stuck on when more than 5 int bytes are entered more than 5 int bytes wont re-prompt as more than 5 int bytes does when i enter in a chars data as more than 5 int bytes continues to dump extra bytes data to tty


38580413
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
that would explain why the width is correct but not the height for an image that is taller than the width is wide you d probably see the inverse


38671242
trie	tree
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the article says that a trie is better than binary tree as for a string of length m for trie binary tree takes o m time and for binary tree binary tree takes o m logn time


38682542
width	margin
Pattern(s): 7	
for example let s say width of one image you want is 200px then also you d like to have some space as margin between images too so let s say if browser width is more than 700px then we ll have images on the same row else we ll have them one below the other


38761908
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 2	
implementing iequatable isn t enough since groupby first uses gethashcode to determine the hashcode before the hashcode starts to compare objects with equals so that s the initial filter


38782197
qtableview	qtablewidget
Pattern(s): 7	
the qtablewidget is slightly easier to implement than the qtableview which also needs a qtablemodel as backend but your data has less capabilities


38875848
pthreads	fork
Pattern(s): 0	
multithreading is faster takes up less resources there is no separate namespace for it and you can run the 6 workers 4 times more than the fork but multithreading requires build php with non-zts some extensions do not work with non-zts and requires something you would understand pthreads model


38880727
bower	npm
Pattern(s): 7	
perhaps write a config file for bower and use npm for backend bower.json for bower and package.json for npm that makes things cleaner and you can ensure installation by running npm install


38899257
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 0	
the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say swift execute faster than objective-c but this is low level so it will be harmless


38964329
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 7	
suppose you were to choose a new tablet and you wanted a new tablet to have 1 a big screens and 2 a screens that is bigger than 20cm


38995345
bootstrapvalidator	formvalidation.io
Pattern(s): 10	
first the library you have used bootstrapvalidator is no longer mainteained they suggest to move to formvalidation.io library which has the same programming interface just replace the call with to even you don t replace the library i think the trick work on bootstrapvalidator library because t have similar api but if not work on bootstrapvalidator you can switch to formvalidation library and it will work like a charm


39058033
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
i d personally recommend using postgresql as postgresql has a cidr data-type and powerful functions to go with postgresql but there s an interesting discussion on doing similar things in mysql too


39174144
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
Pattern(s): 3	
if you have never installed fink or homebrew or macports i recommend choosing macports because macports interferes less with other tools


39303628
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
so just change your versioning to something else which must be greater than the upgrade versioning so that again first condition will be false and system will not check further and will connect without using tls

39542692
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
while compact the width is actually greater than the height so was pushing your label off the screen


39556790

while udp has less network overhead than tcp udp generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.


39601072
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 0	
gradle support is much newer and somewhat less mature than ant or maven but gradle support works


39780977
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
on landscape as the width is bigger than the height you should set top and bottom 0 and ratio 1 1 and center it horizontally in container


39960767
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
- that s the real problem the height is autmatically calculated from the width by the proportions of the image but when the calculated height is more than 710px the calculated height will be forced to be only 710px and the image proportion will be distorted


39972961
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
Pattern(s): 0	
it would be somewhat easier with imagemagick than graphicsmagick as anthony thyssen has put together some excellent examples - but anthony thyssen rely on imagemagick capabilities such as aside-processing in parentheses which graphicsmagick lacks

if the actual size of the parent s list of children is less than the parent s expected number of children originally read from the file push the new node s parent back onto the stack


40370424
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
however if you must use the same route you could separate you must use the same route by get and post since post is more common with registration type scenarios anyway


40467467
error-handling	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 2	
i would recommend #2 with exception-handling because if you use the return value for error-handling you can t really use it for it real usage returning something

Pattern(s): 7	
i would set the height after the page rendered but before check the height to see if the height is greater than your desired width


40971986

41121070
raft	paxos
Pattern(s): 0	
one thing that can be improved from standard paxos also raft zab .. is that there is a distinguished leader which ends up doing more than standard paxos fair share of the work and may therefore end up being a bit of a bottleneck


41173365
margin	height
Pattern(s): 0	
your wrapper has a height of 100 of the body which also has a height of 100 but your wrapper also has a top margin making the total outer height greater than the height of the window


41215350
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
the width is more arbitrary than the height but i made the width a function of the fontsize and the doubling so i could write the shade names in the rectangles


41315665
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 0	
base64 is usually used in instances to represent arbitrary binary data in a text format base64 has a 33.3 overhead but that s better than say hex notation which has a 50 overhead

Pattern(s): 7	
similarly for arraylist class uses linkedhashset and for arraylist class uses linkedhashmap


41962207
ienumerable	iqueryable
Pattern(s): 7	0	
for your view to expect an ienumerable you need to change your view declaration to be also if you really need to perform a find use iqueryable first you really need to perform a find use iqueryable return the result as ienumerable since the payload on ienumerable is smaller than iqueryable


41975185
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
the initial index seek step is followed by hash table building step in which the group by version incurs a higher cost than the max min version


41995275
atof	strtod

after that and more issues with cobertura our moved to jacoco and are very happy with the result


42347995
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 10	
i would advice to switch to server-side processing of table data instead of using client-side it is more preferable if your application works with a lot of rows more than several hundreds


42364711
jstl	taglib
Pattern(s): 7	
generally i noted that jstl sql taglib is much slower than java code because jstl sql taglib put all the result set into an hashmap

the process of inlining is more than just copy and paste the inline code has to make sense within the inline code the inline code is being injected into


42560476
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 7	
so i think a custom checkbox is the better choice here but if you really want to use a button i would use a hidden checkbox field and apply onclick functions to a button to change the value of a hidden checkbox field

ok if we say that the parent is always bigger than the children because the parent is above the children we write


43958549
multiplying	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	
the autojit compiler realizes you re multiplying by all 0s and removes the matrix multiplication completely and simply returns a matrix of all 0s in the 1s it skips the actual multiplication part and just does the summation part of a matrix multiplication which is slightly slower than just returning all 0s finally the final one actually forces the autojit compiler to have to do a matrix multiplication since it can t assume the answer


44021876
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 10

46007086
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if you want to convert an int to a chars you ll need to instruct the computer to interpret the bytes of an int as ascii values - and the computer s been a while since i ve done c but i believe the compiler will complain since chars holds fewer bytes than int


46145314
width	height
Pattern(s): 0

this also makes this an int field rather than chars which is easier to read compare and should work faster


47970311
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this solution is sufficient for the problem above.although the problem will shrink the imageview even if the problem is not necessary when height is smaller than width .if it bothers you you can add another ternary operator inside scalex scaley

48337103
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 10	
your query will need to process quite a lot of rows and will likely never be subsecond however you re using the output of an analytic function as a filtering where grouping aggregation is more efficient so by rewriting your query as below you ll see a slight improvement


48694459
width	height
Pattern(s): 0

minizinc s more flexible than ampl in some areas and less so in others


49708817
ampl	minizinc
Pattern(s): 0	
otoh minizinc seems to be better than ampl for solver-hopping if i write a mz model with a combinatorial constraint like alldifferent but then try to run a mz model on a solver that doesn t recognise such constraints mz will translate a mz model into something the solver can deal with


49806235
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 10	
i also notice that there were quite a few segmentation fault issues fixed in mxnet versioning 1.1 so if you are not using this versioning i recommend to upgrade to this versioning as this versioning is much more stable

Pattern(s): 0	
firstly good accuracy s perfectly possible to perform integer operations that have higher granularity than floating-point


49837278
memcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 0	3	
if you know for sure that src and dst don t overlap call memcpy as it won t matter which one you call for the result both will work correctly in that case but memmove will never be faster than memcpy and if you are unlucky it may even be slower so you can only win calling memcpy


49928834
ggplot2	lattice

post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
i simply stripped the portion of a script on the page which is near identical to what you would get with the request as well as the trailing semi-colon parsed that like you would with the request and used the data the same way - the actual post data is slightly more deeply nested but it s all there


50430191
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
the other approach is that you don a parent actually give the value back until all children have updated times greater than all children parent or whatever inputs are in your function if you do an insert then the child nodes won t exist until the child nodes re processed but you ll have to handle the case where you query a node that doesn t exist due to a rebuild versus the case where you query a node that just doesn t exist


50440569
hlsl	glsl
Pattern(s): 7	0	
either way finding hlsl shaders is harder than finding glsl shaders opengl is kind of a universal thing.. which can then be ported to hlsl
