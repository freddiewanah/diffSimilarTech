public protected
Pattern(s): 0	
making a listener for these three events would be a superior approach if you wanted to make access to these three events public because a superior approach provides a much higher degree of decoupling between the class and a superior approach listeners
making the access protected implies a higher degree of affinity between the class and the listener the designers of the class would end up making a protected runnerlistener interface for the listener adding a protected defaultrunnerlistener implementation for situations when you need to override one or two methods and adding a protected method for you to supply the listener



50869671
16-bit 64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
if you write the bottom bits al ah or ax nothing happens to the upper 16-bit of eax which means that if you want to promote a chars into a int you need to clear that memory first but you have no way of actually using only these top 16-bit making this feature more a pain than anything
now with 64bit amd did a much better job

setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 1	
to thoroughly understand this behaviour you have to understand all stages of event loop and especially how settimeout and setinterval is handled mdn article on event loop mdn event loop rising stack article will help you in getting a clear understanding of event loop along with micro and macro task rising stack event loop explained in nutshell all settimeout gets processed in same tick of the loop
also for your case setinterval is much better

rank percentile
Pattern(s): 1	
the value of fraction is the fractional part of the rank
this leads to the result for the values themselves the fraction part have to be zero so it is very easy to do the inverse calculation to get percentile i hope i made it more clear



50901544
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 1	
quick and dirty answer the simple answer is blobs smaller than 256kb are more efficiently handled by a database while a filesystems is more efficient for those greater than 1mb
of course this will vary between different databases and filesystems there is a microsoft technical report here compare blob and ntfs filesystems

51041732
multiplying multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
when you multiplying two n-dimensional matrices with numpy i suppose it automatically multiplies the two last dimensions together and keeps the first ones
the n-dimensional matrix multiplication is more or less like the 2d multiplication



51073285
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
any time you need a loops that removes elements from the container that is being looped through a for-loop is a bad choice to use
a while loops is typically better so that you have more control over the indexing



51077193
genfromtxt unpack
Pattern(s): 1	
so either stick with loadtxt or don t use unpack with genfromtxt
i think loading the structured array without unpack gives you more options when doing further processing



51142142
coalesce isnull
Pattern(s): 0	
coalesce -- although standard -- has the downfall that it evaluates the first argument twice
so when the first argument is non-trivial isnull is the better approach in sql server



51174053
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 1	
i suggest you download and install then you can use unix style cronjobs to run your jobs
you can also look into using the windows task scheduler but using the cron scheduler works better in my opinion because the windows task scheduler only allows once per 5 minute triggers



51192211
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
you can create spatial indexes in aurora using the default innodb engine

memcpy memset
Pattern(s): 1	
also since zero initialization doesn t work on heap-allocated structs there s something to be said for consistency of always using memset
similar goes for situations when you might want to copy a few adjacent structs part of an array - again if you always use memcpy code is more consistent

int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
so your table might be represented as then you set clear bits in the following manner to create a mask specifying numbered bits without hard-coding the hex value you can use an expression such as occasionally a visual binary representation is desirable - for chars bitmaps for example the chars a is much easier to visualise when represented in binary 00000000 00011000 00100100 01000010 01111110 01000010 01000010 00000000 the chars is possible to efficiently code such a table while maintaining the visualisation by exhaustively defining a macro for each binary value

post get
Pattern(s): 1	
in python post request is more complicated as compare to other requests.but here is the solution for post request in python
example#1 post request example#2 post request but in your scenario you re using the burp suite to get data and post data in python i don t know which specific version of python are you using but you should follow basic method of post request in python.if you re using the brup suite and must read the brup suite documentation here is the documentation link which ll explain you each step one by one and do keep an eye on the notes and todos while following the step in your scenario



51604831
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
ou just need to iterate it using either for or foreach loops inside controller action marked with httppostattribute for -loop version foreach -loop version note with foreach loops if request.files collection has duplicate file names the first matched file name will be stored multiple times even multiple times have different sizes related issue here
hence for-loop approach is more preferred and you can still get corresponding file name with uploadedfile.filename



51629512
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
there are some strange things here you make a post request but the view has no side-effects nor does the post transfers any data
in that case a get makes more sense

51805754
int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
vhdl superimposes type on file transactions unfortunately there s no way to declare a natural range value greater than 2 31 -1 if your int were bigger they wouldn t be portable
the above method treats files as chars files allowing superimposition of size of elements of the contents by conventions here in the host system if you want to read 32 bit unsigned you d want to read 4 chars and assemble a 32 bit value in the correct endian order



51857592
fadein removeclass

51980147
median percentile
Pattern(s): 0	
replace the output value if it is greater or equal than the 90 quantile by the median in all zero action rows before the first row in each group
note that the op is talking about to find values that more 90 percentile which implies a greater relation but the expected result had also values replaced where return equals the 90 quantile

in this particular case it makes little difference but in other situations mouseover can lead to unexpected outcomes whereas mouseenter is somewhat more predictable



52005974
multiplying subtract
Pattern(s): 0	
if range limits aren t a problem you could even fold the subtract in using an
simd fp multiplying has significantly better throughput than integer multiplying so it might be a win overall even with the extra cost of an fp round-to-nearest instruction



52028247
spaces delimiter
Pattern(s): 1	
the first solution is using results in getting assigned to loop variable b the entire line with leading spaces tabs removed while results in getting assigned to the loop variable b the entire line including leading spaces tabs
so the definition of an empty list of delimiter is better in general



52061395
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome 49 goes a step further and has support for the unhandledrejection event which lets you add a custom event handler to deal with all unhandled rejected promises
safari also shows a warning and since version 11 also supports the unhandledrejection event

metaclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
the metaclass overrides the __new__ method of deprecatedclass to always return an instance of newclass
subclassing is not much harder



52171071
super extends
Pattern(s): 0	0	
extends drink is the upper bound - so every object must then extends from drink to be legally assigned into that list
super is a lower bound - that means that any instance specified must be no lower in the inheritance hierarchy than the specified type
super drink is the lower bound - so every object must then either be a type of drink or a type of its ancestor - in this case object

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
that s doing it with while loops which may be what the instructor has specifically asked for
however since this is such a common pattern in c a for-loop allows you a more compact expression does the exact same thing placing the initialization and the increment of the counter variable all on the same line

if you are stuck with the old api consider one of the samples that record video using mediacodec and mediamuxer
it is more powerful than mediarecorder but requires more work



52389196
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
ou could then write code that loops through the arrays extracts the rate value for each arrays entry and prints the arrays
as others have said you could do this with a map statement but if you re new to programming then the for-loop approach is easier to understand

build.gradle gradlew
Pattern(s): 1	
when reviewing there some to be several possible causes you are using the wrong buildtoolsversion which can even be omitted in the build.gradle - in order to use the latest version matching api level 27
using com.android.tools.build gradlew 3.3.0-alpha10 is questionable. better use stable version 3 1 4

f you can t put all of the changes into a single transaction then patch is the wrong idea
that said everything you can do with patch can also be done with post -- post just offers fewer guarantees



52474427
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 0	
you could do it client-side but you d need to acquire an access token with adal.js msal.js and then request for the file and set it as the content of the img element via javascript
server-side is probably easier to implement point the img to an http route in your back-end acquire an access token call the api and return the bytes of the image as a result from the route

for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
the first error i see is that you need to declare the function type with the type of the returned value in this case the function has to be another error is in the for-loop the operation has to be same for the another see that you didn t declare the i which is a variable too
another way is doing is the same. if you already know the dimension of the two arrays maybe is better to take the arguments as pointers it will look like and you will have to allocate memory this coul be done with malloc at the end of your program you will want to free that allocated memory doing free wsk

versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
.net framework 3.5 is not compatible with any versioning of .net standard the earliest versioning is 4.5 as published in docs here obviously the further .net standard versioning you chose the higher .net versioning you have to pick on the client side as standard grows continuously and hence drops support for the older frameworks
if you could upgrade your client project to .net 4.5 having the lib in .net standard 1 would resolve your compatibility issue



53392712
width height
Pattern(s): 0	
your problem appears because the reference width is bigger then working width of your collectionview to fix this you must calculate your cells reference size properly
you re using uicollectionviewflowlayout so you can take an advantage of uicollectionviewdelegateflowlayout and implement the following method it is provided for the case when cells has fullscreen width and dynamic height keep in mind that if you re using multiple columns you should calculate cells width accordingly and mininteritemspacing should be taken into account



53393549
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
on a personal note i have to say calling core audio api from swift is oftentimes more pain than gain
because of that it might be faster although a bit unsafer wrapping those portions of code into objective-c or plain c and exposing them via the swift bridging header if your project allows the swift bridging header



53415089
int chars
Pattern(s): 0	0	
well we need to check what happens with vectors with multi-digits which you seem to have and their corresponding vectors of multi-character strings the int vector still occupies 4 bytes for each element the numeric vector still occupies 8 bytes for each element
however the size per element in the chars vector is larger for larger strings
thus the transpose coerced your data frame to a chars matrix and the size of each chars element is larger than its corresponding numeric element



53441160
cublas thrust
Pattern(s): 1	
cublas itself does not trap errors like this for performance reasons
however the thrust api uses more rigorous synchronization and error checking in some cases



53454555
uitableview uicollectionviewlayout
Pattern(s): 0	
with each cell being different size flowlayout will request sizes for each cell separately to calculate total size of collectionview - that is required to properly handle scrolling scrollbars
uitableview it s a bit simpler as it s layout is much simpler only height matters - that s why it s possible to use estimatedsize there
the whole core layout process is well explained here to overcome this problem i would recommend using your custom uicollectionviewlayout and move your caching logic and reusing sizes for cells inside collectionviewlayout not in your viewcontroller



53469086
folder directory
Pattern(s): 0	
he resources directory is for the resources directory uncompiled counterparts so your less sass files and javascript should go there before being processed by mix
the storage folder is for more general file storage use but i would have a look at the possibility of storing these files with a third party service



53470524
int double
Pattern(s): 0	
because according to the rules of overload resolution void function int y int w is a better match than void function float y float w and therefore there is no ambiguity
calls function 1.2 2 and function 1 2.2 both have one argument that is an int and is the exact match with one of the arguments of void function int y int w and so only one type conversion is required double to int

floating-point is a little more finicky but not too much harder



53510046
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
a for-loop is generally better for doing something a fixed number of times

53514132
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 0	
he reason for that is because map is a built-in function and works perfectly better with functions of a built-in function kind chain rule
based on your update you can just use str.replace instead of your function and a generator expression withing dict.fromkeys note that alternatively you could also use for constructing an empty dictionary which is also slightly faster than directly calling the dictionary type



53570256
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
prints 3 to console so you could use numbeo.length the -1 is because the for-loop uses less or equal condition in your case
the for-loop goes from 0 to 100 because your numbeo arrays s size is 100

igraph networkx
Pattern(s): 0	
the networkx graph will only connect to the 4 nearest neighbors
so igraph has a lot more connections

integer fractions
Pattern(s): 0	
xtra info so answer article 1 i supposed it is a random integer positive number although it s easy to generalize for negative numbers too which i suppose it is your problem case
for fractions numbers is s a bit harder to generalize this formulae 2 the log notation refers to logarithm in base 2

client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 0	
client-side is also harder to scale however this may not be an issue if this is a small personal project
i personally am using server-side sessions in my current rest api because authentication was easier and i wanted the scalability



53818152
clang icc
Pattern(s): 1	
often because the compiler was only designed for one or a couple targets like msvc or icc or various compilers that started out as x86-only or many vendor-supplied compilers for embedded chips
clang llvm was designed much more recently than gcc

flask django
Pattern(s): 1	
if in fact you just need a web api wrapper flask is probably a much better choice than django simply because django is huge and you d be using only a fraction of fact capability

some details can be found at consider using linux distribution for development
event virtualbox vm with ubuntu works faster than windows for all sap hybris related tasks



53946740
snmp mib
Pattern(s): 1	
for further information on how to use the device s snmp interface you should ask the vendor
the vendor seems highly likely to me that these names are built-in and cannot be altered even if the mib provides for more lenient devices



53965792
gdi direct2d
Pattern(s): 0	
gdi functions have limited transparency support so you might want to use a different technology like direct2d which has better integration with the gpu



53970630
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 1	
o assign to items you must assign the address of each struct to each element in items remember you have storage for pointers not storage for struct item -- and you must ensure fruits remains in scope for the duration of your use of basket putting those pieces together you could do something similar to the following note i have simply used typedef and removed the struct labels themselves -- typedef s up to you
further you should validate the return from find_first_in_range is not null before printing example use output also note i ve bracket the high low range for memory use error check in any code you write that dynamically allocates memory you have 2 responsibilities regarding any block of memory allocated 1 always preserve a pointer to the starting address for the block of memory so 2 typedef can be freed when typedef is no longer needed



53997252
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 1	
you can use a list comprehension within a dictionary comprehension
since you need both keys and values use dict.items to iterate key-value pairs map works more efficiently with built-ins so you may wish to use or since you have coordinates for tuple values the problem with your logic is python lists do not support vectorised indexing so you need to be explicit the verbose

ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 1	
one macos the other an ubuntu 16.04-based linux os elementaryos loki both using the official packages from docker.com
my theory is that the linux package is just more restrictive out of the box security-wise than the macos one

client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
in some cases i use same approach but i recommend to do same approach on client-side via javascript if same approach s possible and my next recommendation is to send all forms via ajax always
less code on server-side brings more benefits less cpu and memory consuption on server-side output of view can be cached better performance smaller transmission data here is a flash module with same functionality as in express.js but i don t recommend it for rendering some flash messages you can use controller.repository object or model or you can create some view engine helper

Pattern(s): 0	
however at least quicksort is not slower than mergesort for the random case



54100086
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
the for-loop is more concise
notice how we need a counter variable in this case i with the while loops



54183894
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
count with innodb is slower than count id because innodb doesn t cache the row count
on the other hand with myisam count query would be faster and return result in no time because myisam maintains the count of rows



54190274
mapr cloudera
Pattern(s): 0	
mapr has a faster version called mapr streams which implements kafka
i was not wanting to use that for what i was wanting to do but mapr sandbox has a lot of up-to-date items straight out of the box -certainly compared to cloudera



54204471
woocommerce shopp
Pattern(s): 0	
eav is somewhat necessary for a shopp site where only some items have dress size or f-stop or transmission type
in this case json may be a better pattern than eav. schema review yuck woocommerce is worse than wp reference prefix indexing meta_key 32 is rarely useful and often counter-productive



54208581
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
nd since we re using i as the index for the arrays element to examine the value of would never change and therefore loops would go on forever
and for what it s worth when you re iterating over an arrays a for-loop is a better fit because a for-loop allows you to define the iteration variable the condition and the increment all in one place

treemap linkedhashmap
Pattern(s): 1	0	
stream linkedhashmap code style
using treemap is more cleaner since you can achieve it in one line



54264093
treemap linkedhashmap
Pattern(s): 1	
to make things a bit more efficient with linkedhashmap you should provide an good estimator of the required size at construction so that there is not need for dynamic resizing so instead of linkedhashmap new you say
i m my opinion the use of a treemap is more neat.



54300159
namedtuple dictionary
Pattern(s): 0	
alternatively you can use pd.namedagg essentially a namedtuple which makes things more explicit
it is even simpler for series just pass the aggfunc to a keyword argument.t lastly if your column names aren t valid python identifiers use a dictionary with unpacking pandas 0.25 in more recent versions of pandas leading upto 0.24 if using a dictionary for specifying column names for the aggregation output you will get a futurewarning using a dictionary for renaming columns is deprecated in v0.20



54327594
post put
Pattern(s): 1	
eturn error range codes when the expected mutation has not occured a delete didn t happen or a put didn t change anything
however a post is more interesting because the spec says the spec should be used to either create resources at a new location or just process a payload



54361347
pyenv virtualenv
Pattern(s): 1	
pyenv is for installing and managing different versions of python so you might not need it
this way your virtualenv is more robost and easier to get up and running if you move it around or share it with others



54410046
vim emacs
Pattern(s): 1	
f you re writing prose you may be able to get by just with the evil mode plugin for emacs which is not complete but is a pretty sophisticated version of vim inside emacs
in general emacs is a little more pliable for people who really like to tinker and touch every part of the system to do new things so someone has probably written some good prose modes for general emacs

for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
here are two solutions at least the first is o n 2 and require to have two for loops to compare all the elements between two solutions at least the first is o n 2 self the second solution that you should use and that the problem force you to choose because the problem says that you can loops the arrays only once it is to find in one for-loop the minimum and the maximum of the arrays and control the arrays difference
if the arrays difference is more than the given number return true otherwise false



54566201
min max
Pattern(s): 1	
b our pop method returns the smallest item not the largest called a min heap in textbooks
a max heap is more common in texts because of a max heap suitability for in-place sorting



54603551
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
you can use for-loop while loops or do while loops according to your need
a for-loop is more common



54604415
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
but say you are doing something like this as suggested by elliott smith it might be better to simply do this for clarity reasons there is no major difference between for and while loops aside from the fact for-loop is neater to write in certain situations

versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
if you want to re-run expo build then you ll need to upgrade from sdk 25 preferably to sdk 32 so you won you want to re-run expo build need to update again for a while and also because each expo versioning is better than the last



54677492

Pattern(s): 1	
from the usecase it looks like you want the user to select the address type either residential or commercial so a raido button group seems more suitable
i have edited the html to create the radio button instead of checkbox

the tilde versioning modifier is less aggressive than the caret versioning modifier in the upgrade it will allow



54721057
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 1	
so if you called setinterval mycustomfunction 1000 it will repeatedly execute mycustomfunction after every 1s
this is not the behavior you want you only want a delay of 1s and for that settimeout is more appropriate



54745651
chart.js c3.js
Pattern(s): 1	
for future readers i was unable to create custom gridlines using chart.js
the c3.js package contains far more customisation options for gridlines and gives the option of providing custom user-defined grid lines described here



54747421
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
the difference between array.map and a for-loop is that the for-loop does nothing more than iterating over the values of the arrays
within the body of loops you can do whatever with these values



54763245

sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 0	
sudo -u postgres createuser viter -s this also makes viter a superuser

but here s my 2 cents anyway confluent s documentation might shed some light cpus most kafka deployments tend to be rather light on cpu requirements
as such the exact processors setup matters less than the other resources



54963329
strncpy malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
the easier way is to use the function strncpy which is more secure than just using strcpy
another way is to allocate with malloc space for where you wish to copy the string after you can modify the string at your please



54964903
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
you probably thought you needed the - 1 there since arrays index s start at 0 except since the for-loop is less than and not less than or equal to it will end at the last index



55033022
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
if you use cookies you may have to provide a disclaimer. if you want users to be redirected with client-side javascript such as by assigning to window.location.href when the visitor visits the landing page and the server has no need to see their locale information on every connection then use local storage
server-side redirection is probably more elegant but both methods are ok options



55064017
width height
Pattern(s): 0	
what you may want to do is prompt the user for width in pixels or inches and their string and calculate what size font to use based on the number of characters in their string
then calculate how tall that would make the barcode and if that height is larger than the user height requirement draw a white rectangle across the top of the barcode to snip the bars off at the correct height



55065451
coalesce isnull
Pattern(s): 0	
you also are missing the on clause on your first join a full join is not necessary as a left join to your catalog table covers what you need coalesce is sql iso standard but as you are comparing only two values and you are using sql server isnull is better to perform that operation use two left joins or you can use union all



55092748
domcontentloaded addeventlistener

the changes i made were adding a document.addeventlistener domcontentloaded function to make sure your html was loaded before you tyr to run the javascript
change the way you bind your onchange function to be document.getelementbyid length .addeventlistener change function evt basically the addeventlistener is more flexible than onchange



55106923
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
you shouldn t shy away from for loops in c++ since there is much less overhead compared to r

please upgrade surefire to 3.0.0-m3 or higher



55292075
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
the issue with your solution was that you were modifying the value of numbere by using inside the second for-loop this changes the value globally
moving the final column in to the nested for loops also makes it easier as you wouldn t need to define the temporary variable outside of loops



55297555
setinterval settimeout

for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
first your for-loop goes through the bullet arraylist however you are using that index to modify the enemy arraylist as well
so if bul.size enm.size the bullet arrays is bigger than the enemy arrays this would be what is causing the indexoutofboundsexception

Pattern(s): 0	
he largest item is always at the top of the tree which will be o 1 to remove and replace with the next biggest of the largest item s two children

ggplot2 aesthetics
Pattern(s): 0	
as background info you can read this chapter of r for data science focusing on the grammar of graphics
i m sure hadley wickham s book on ggplot2 is even a better source but i don t have that one
the main steps for building a graph with one layer and no facet are apply aesthetics mapping on input data in simple cases this is a selection and renaming on columns apply scale transformation if any on each data column compute stat on each data group per species in this case apply aesthetics mapping on stat data detected with or stat name apply position adjustment build graphical objects apply coordinate transformations as you guessed the behaviour at step 3 is similar to dplyr transmute it consumes all aesthetics columns and outputs a data frame having as columns all freshly computed stats and all columns that are constant within the group

cli interface design graphicsmagick imagemagick imho i prefer in fact only use graphicsmagick gm over imagemagick as the latter has higher chance of tool name clash which causes lots of issues in finding out why certain tools are not running especially during server side automation tasks
in summary graphicsmagick has much clearer design

minimum max
Pattern(s): 0	
basically you create all your variables on top of the file then loop until 5 numbers are entered in this example and do the necessary operations to calculate total average max and min values
the minimum value is trickier there is a workaround in the code below you could also add the check in your if elif block for minimum with a little help from the or operator

dictionary map
Pattern(s): 0	
rather than making a copy of the entire dictionary there is an easier scheme in which you ll just need to make a copy of all the keys in another linked-list
and in the original dictionary in each of the entries just also keep a reference to the linked-list entry corresponding to that key now if you want to iterate the 3 entries at a distance of 5 entries from 4297256046 you just need to do now the reason i mentioned linked-list was so that in case you want to delete any entries from the map you ll be also able to delete the corresponding entry from the linked list in o 1 time

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
that is just the wonderful thing about list comprehension if it can work normally like the for-loop people wont create it because the for-loop is more readable and understandable
you may find out that the result of list comprehension is always a list meanwhile the result of for-loop would always many single values and these single values is a part of iterable x +1 for x in range 1 5 2 3 4 5 for x in range 1 10 print x+1 2 3 4 5 you can simply understand that loops comprehension already have the list of values then loops comprehension already have the list of values just simply feed orderly to the condition value by value

Pattern(s): 0	
benchmarking parallel work correctly is a tough task it is affected by the great many factors and features of a cpu cache
try to replace your workload with one that is very suited for multiprocessing working in a parallel on different parts of an array matrix multiplication.. one more important thing spawning the new processes also takes time and for one more important thing spawning the new processes to pay off the work done in each process needs to be significant if you increase your loop s range a little bit the difference should be in favor of the multi-process version on my machine this outputs 0.44509196281433105 1.3775699138641357

versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
this happened to me trying to run a watchos app on device because my apple watch s watchos versioning was higher than my currently-installed xcode supported
i upgrade to the newest xcode which did also require me to upgrade to the newest macos and watchos versioning ran fine after that

median max
Pattern(s): 0	
you can solve it using divide and conquer approach find a random element in between the minimum and maximum check if it s median if the median is lower or higher than the median and reduce the problem to a smaller size only on a subrange of the array

integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 0	
reference 1.5.3 otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

dictionary map
Pattern(s): 1	
different mappings have different ways to hash the input values unless you want to use a sorted dictionary which is more memory efficient but slower

submit submission
Pattern(s): 1	
i would certainly use trigger like this from jquery docs on submit forms can be submitted either by clicking an explicit or or by pressing enter when certain form elements have focus
it seems to me that manually triggering form submission is a better workable approach

shadowing named
Pattern(s): 0	
in scheme you are making a local binding shadowing whatever is higher with let
since + and are just variables that just happen to evaluate to procedures you are just giving old procedures other variable named

ecdsa rsa
Pattern(s): 0	
for rsa as implemented in the modern era since about 1980 signing is much slower than verifying
for dsa and ecdsa verifying is slightly slower than signing

cpython pypy
Pattern(s): 0	
interestingly pypy is worse than cpython with __slots__ and stays stable for extreme field counts

distance mercator
Pattern(s): 0	
i do not need a great accuracy a variation of 5 from the real distance is definitely acceptable for me in this case you can definitely use web mercator
possible implementation in python note that web mercator implementation is much simpler than for example utm so the performance will be much better



56657622
post put
Pattern(s): 0	1	
when your case should use put if you know the id then your best bet is to do why post is meant more strictly for new resource creation
put is used more in situations where you want to create or replace which fits your requirement as closely as you re gonna get in my opinion



56692723
installation upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
the col function was added in solr 7 so if your solr installation is older than that the function won t be available
upgrade to a more recent version

cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
but here s my 2 cents anyway confluent s documentation might shed some light cpus most kafka deployments tend to be rather light on cpu requirements
as such the exact processors setup matters less than the other resources

pandas seaborn
Pattern(s): 1	
so if you are using pandas for basic plot you can use matplotlib for plot customization
however i propose an alternative method here using seaborn which allows more customization of the plot while not going into the basic level of matplotlib

post get
Pattern(s): 1	
on the other hand if republishing is expensive or should otherwise only be done on purpose then post is a more appropriate choice
that s ok then using get is fine -- and it even has some advantages when the requests are being sent across an unreliable network



56777094
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
you can speed it up a bit by not using foreach which uses an interator and instead use a for-loop
you can also break once you locate your id assuming they are unique assuming your id s are unique you could also make a duplicate of the items list and drop those that have been located so each loops is shorter like this you could also consider creating a map where the key is your id so you do not have to loops and instead you retrieve the item by id directly



56830622
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
this is evidently what happened in your example since your realloc call asks for less memory than was allocated by calloc and we can see that it didn t do that here since the address of ptr when free is called is the same as the block allocated by calloc
if the existing allocation is much bigger than the request realloc may choose to copy the existing memory block into a smaller allocation possibly acquired with malloc

int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
the int type is smaller than the float type
in general byte short and chars int long float double

prometheus metrics
Pattern(s): 0	
he prometheus server will pull metrics from your metrics api
but i can recommend that the prometheus server is better to use official jmx exporter

multiplying division
Pattern(s): 0	
use the product computed in the previous step multiplying it by the number entering the window and divide by the number exiting the window
division is slower but it will pay off for larger values of c

width height
Pattern(s): 0	
adjust your body s width and height to your desired width and height and if necessary you could create a div to surround the svg and set a lower width height there
the percentages will prevent your svg from clipping when the screen width is less than 800px width currently specified



57049751
post put
Pattern(s): 1	
remote authoring semantics put patch delete really don t fit well with a single actions endpoint
post does a bit better in that the constraints are minimal



57074827
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
so that is why the for-loop executes one more time than the body
the same reasoning applies to for loops of course



57206170
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
so on you can configure your own decider your own job steps as you said above for two different configurations like below and use your own decider seperately in commandline runners since the post is getting bigger i am giving the details of just the job and command line runner these are the two jobs here are the command line runners i am making sure that the first job is completed before the second job is initialized but it is totally up to the user to execute the two jobs here in parallel following a different stratergy hope this gives a complete idea of how this can be done

keras word2vec
Pattern(s): 0	
after poking around i found a research paper introducing focal loss and conveniently a github implementation of a research paper for keras
that combined with meowongac s suggestion i used google word2vec embeddings resulted in much better sampling of words with lower frequencies



57258117
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
only loops for odd numbers in d loops
switch b and d loops so that code in outer loops runs less times

aggregate-functions sum
Pattern(s): 0	
having is used to calculate aggregate-functions
like in your above case if you want to find out name of the countries having sum population is greater then 2 000 000 then you can apply having clause like this for more info about the same you may find this link

d3.js c3.js
Pattern(s): 0	
 just happened to need 4 for my code in your case you can do in data you can declare an x to have your supplied x labels i m not sure about the other libraries but c3.js is essentially a wrapper for d3.js so anything that can be done in one is most likely theoretically possible in both
c3.js is just easier to understand my code for



57354895
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if the code inside the setinterval takes longer than the time you have set the setinterval will create another process before the function finishes messing everything up
so choosing settimeout is actually better



57438399
apktool jarsigner
Pattern(s): 1	
apktool build output_folder next you need to re-sign the apk with the original keystore file jarsigner -verbose -keystore keystore_path -storepass keystore_password -keypass keystore_key_password apk_path keystore_key_name android-sdk build-tools 21.1.1 zipalign -v 4 apk_path apk_out_path

datediff difference
Pattern(s): 0	
you ll need lag and datediff to get the number of minutes between tran_date and the previous row
then basically a running total on the evaluation of whether or not the time difference is greater than 30



57489346
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
if you cannot control the server configuration you could switch your table to innodb which uses a significantly smaller stopword list
some additional notes the fulltext index uses a minimum word length by default 4 for myisam and 3 for innodb

uinavigationcontroller uipageviewcontroller
Pattern(s): 0	
i m not sure uinavigationcontroller is the correct container controller to provide what you need
you might find that uipageviewcontroller is a better choice i think uipageviewcontroller will provide the natural swipe gesture you are looking for out of the box although uipageviewcontroller s quite an opaque class with some quirks of uipageviewcontroller own



57554447
ostringstream std
Pattern(s): 1	
olding a lock while logging isn t great for performance although t s better than your existing log method which should use std lock_guard for exception safety
building and discarding a temporary ostringstream is probably better but if you care about performance you ll need to benchmark and may well end up requiring something more elaborate per-thread circular buffers mmapped files or something



57555123
imagemagick wand
Pattern(s): 0	
method 2 - write with opencv but modify afterwards with some tool you could use python s subprocess module to shell out to say imagemagick and set the dpi like this magick opencvimage.png -set units pixelspercentimeter -density 28.3 result.png all you need to know is that png uses metric dots per centimetre rather than imperial dots per inch and there are 2.54cm in an inch so 72 dpi becomes 28.3 dots per cm
if your imagemagick version is older than v7 replace magick with convert



57610953
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
here is a way to do it using a for-loop is faster than using a dictionnary since you don t have to iterate through the animal list for each dictionnary key
the update is done the other way around here is a performance comparison for-loop 5.21 µs 20.2 ns per loops mean std



57686469
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
also as mentioned is the answer of the question a for-each loops is better performance wise than the regular for-loop so using a for-each loops would turn in into



57708249
decoder encoder
Pattern(s): 1	
f you re concerned about performance you could write something like this that decoder the singleton object the singleton though and in our desired representation our have a wrapper
we can accommodate that with a single extra line at the end this will fit right in with a generically derived instance for our updated item class import io.circe.generic.auto._ io.circe.jawn.decode case class item id long name localizedstring and then the customized encoder is a little more straightforward and then this approach will work for any number of dynamic fields like this you can transform the input into either a or jsonobject and work with the key-value pairs directly
