for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
a simple for-loop is a better choice
you can use a while loops more efficiently on a large non-numerically indexed structure like this

tapestry sitemesh
Pattern(s): 1	
i have used sitemesh and sitemesh is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page

codeigniter cakephp
Pattern(s): 1	
i tested cakephp but it s too much a la rails style and i didn t like it
codeigniter gives you more freedom to do whatever you whant

freebsd linux
Pattern(s): 0	
the freebsd kernel has a much more relaxed license than linux i think you might find the freebsd kernel worthwhile



217514
disk ram
Pattern(s): 0	
for example the popular recursive quicksort algorithm provides quite reasonable performance with adequate ram but due to the recursive way that adequate ram copies portions of the array adequate ram becomes much less practical when the array does not fit in ram because adequate ram may cause a number of slow copy or move operations to and from disk



217675
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
note that inherited is harder to maintain than composition
also i would rename tests to testcollection if you subclassing list or something like testunit if it would contain list of test classes



229695
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
ut a list of childthing1 s cannot handle a childthing2 or indeed any implementor of iparentthing other than childthing1 - in other words if the was allowed to cast as a the would have to be able to deal with all subclassing of iparentthing not just iparentthing and childthing1
note that java generics have a way to say that i want a list of anything that inherited from this in addition to i want a list of anything that this inherited which allows for more interesting and in my opinion elegant solutions to some problems



357428
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
on a most basic level ascii chars string it is a sequential series of memory addresses each of which contain a short int corresponding to a ascii code and terminated by null chars 0
most higher level languages provide a string object which has a chars array as well as convenience methods because working with chars strings is more or less a pain in the rear



399039
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql is more oracle-like in syntax and in some of the features indeed it has been occasionally called poor man s oracle
mysql i am not sure what to compare to



408402
inherited base-class
Pattern(s): 1	
yours is more in line with class inherited which is typical of smalltalk java and yes c++
java particularly recently has tended to see inherited as all about managing types and now urges composition instead of inherited for code-reuse this is partly because inherited is less flexible in java than composition so prefering composition is good practice
and partly because of the brittle base-class problem



420255
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 1	
comparable which has comparator requires the objects to be compared in order to use a treemap or to sort a list to implement that interface
then you have to implement a comparator which is a bit less convenient to use



495913
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
now if this logic was in a viewmodel then i think the getter aspect is a little more forgivable expected



506252
multiplying division
Pattern(s): 0	
think of the hardware involved and you ll understand a lot better why it takes so much longer to divide than multiplying
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit



506929
division multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
float division is not much slower than integer division but the compiler may be unable to do the same optimizations
for example the compiler can replace integer division between 3 with a multiplication and a binary shift



582486
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky



592640
kerberos ntlm
Pattern(s): 0	
kerberos is complex to set up and even though kerberos generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site



610563
gif png
Pattern(s): 1	
in general jpeg is better suited for photos while gif is better for graphic objects like buttons or rendered letters
png is good in both regards but that discussion tends to get a little religious because there are license fees to pay if you develop a programm that reads writes gif or jpeg while png is free



640951
xstream jackson
Pattern(s): 1	
i ll second suggestion to use jaxb or possibly xstream former is faster latter has more focus on object serialization part
plus i ll further suggest a decent json-based alternative jackson which can fully serializer deserialize beans to json text to store in the column



688636
disk ram
Pattern(s): 1	
get a ram disk that supports automatically loading saving disk images so you don t have to use boot scripts to do this
sequential read write of a single disk image is faster than syncing a lot of small files



772256
wsdl.exe svcutil.exe
Pattern(s): 0	
wsdl.exe writse wsdl for your web service classes and proxy classes for your wsdl
svcutil.exe does a wider range of things but can generate proxies for wcf windows communication foundation services



915641
direct3d directx
Pattern(s): 0	
the way i read it they re simply providing thin wrappers allowing easy access to the direct3d api from .net
managed directx was a much bigger effort basically a separately designed api



1094085
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
just the table locking alone will affect speed such that innodb would be overall faster
also notice that myisam is much faster on inserts not so much on selects



1264516
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are certain that you will never use a hash scheme to authenticate like http digest auth hash password is more secure
to avoid rainbow table attack please use a nonce or salt



1387232
switching screens
Pattern(s): 0	
by automatically switching between these two modes the codec maintains video quality while maximizing compression
overall the windows media video 9 screens codec delivers better handling of bitmap images and screens motion even on relatively modest cpus



1443697
grass proj
Pattern(s): 0	
in my experience as soon as you try to use the vs install proj to do anything that can t be drag ndropped in the designer you re asking for trouble
in other words it sucks but i don t know whether the grass is greener on the other side installshield because i ve never used that

postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler



1698436
division multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
0 but most of the time n 10 seems enough and spare one division which was more expensive
i simply use multiplication and it seems to make it much faster almost 4x here at least on the 1..100000000 range



1704423
strtol atoi
Pattern(s): 1	
atoi is a basic one with very limited error handling capability
strtol is a better one



1786423
hash md5
Pattern(s): 0	
use a content based hash sha1 is what i use
md5 is weaker and faster but on modern processors speed isn t a concern



1890342
passenger webrick
Pattern(s): 0	
mongrel is still a valid option but passenger mod_rails is far more popular
you can try to use webrick which comes as a standard with rails



1892498
division modulo
Pattern(s): 1	
just use integers and division will just work for you
except of course the modulo solution is so much more elegant



2015064
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
the reason is primarily optimizer maturity postgresql can better handle the kinds of queries you re likely to run
mysql is more likely to get confused on five-way joins go bottom up when you run a subselect etc



2027294
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
and after reading your question completely -d it seems that your request changes in this case adds data which means using post is the more correct way
but as you only send it via get to your proxy and then via post to the other app as long as it works it is fine



2055824
ubuntu opensuse
Pattern(s): 0	
i have the same problem in ubuntu
but on opensuse it seems a lot better



2061570
width height
Pattern(s): 0	
irst calculate the size so that the width fits in the box
then check if the calculated height is larger than the box in that case you calculate the size so that the height fits in the box instead



2094577
profiling debugging
Pattern(s): 0	
rom your description your description appears that the problem happens in your extension so set up the profiling according to the documentation and look in the error console
other than that remote debugging requires seeing more of your code



2140717
ant maven
Pattern(s): 1	
also ant is platform-independent so you can collaborate with those who use other operating systems
maven offers even more compelling features



2145814
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
inherited thus implies a generalization
specialization hierarchy wherein a subclassing specializes the more general structure



2151314
glut glfw
Pattern(s): 1	
also much of your requirements is already handled by the various opengl utilities - namely glut and glfw
if you intend to stick with opengl both will do the job glfw is more advanced and provides more control



2169337
allocator stl
Pattern(s): 0	
f you need to pass the objects themselves around modify individual elements after the objects themselves are in the data structure without having to retrieve the objects themselves each and every time or if you re using a custom memory manager to manage the allocator deallocation and cleanup of the objects
putting the objects the objects themselves in the stl structure is easier and simpler



2179533
phpunit simpletest
Pattern(s): 1	
however i would like to say simpletest is seriously outdated
phpunit has way more features and is actively maintained



2198143
addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
addition is easy just add
multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor



2212938
ssl https
Pattern(s): 0	
i m using ssl on apache which handles access to our subversion repository on a small windows ec2 instance
in testing i found that https access was fractionally slower than http but that s for the obvious reason that encryption decryption is not an instantaneous process as you d expect



2294029
atexit main
Pattern(s): 0	
edit a lot of code will be unsafe to call during an atexit function
registering for uiapplicationwillterminatenotification on the main thread is safer



2375759
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 1	
strcpy will generally get the job done
strncpy is better if available



2586639
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
post allows bigger and more complex information to be passed
in terms of vocabulary the purists say that get should get information and post should post get should get information and post



2605364
stdout fflush
Pattern(s): 0	
occasionally the stdout needs more than a write method fflush is another common one which stringio will handle



2612738
codeigniter kohana
Pattern(s): 0	
i would personally suggest you to go with codeigniter it is easier and faster than other counterparts
or you may want to go for kohana said to be extended version of codeigniter



2678137
aggregate-functions sum
Pattern(s): 0	
hen using group by you should only return columns that are named in group by clause or that include an aggregate-functions
therefore the inner select here gets the col2 values where the sum is greater than or equal to zero then the outer select grabs the entire row for those values



2797218
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
i don t think that postgresql will affect your performance despite postgresql uses more resource since postgresql a full rdbm implementation in the long term postgresql will be the best option if you are looking for performance
number of sql queries is relative you must remember that to bring same results mysql and postgresql has their own implementations just to give an example mysql dont implement the full ps sql



3095876
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	1	
unsigned ints don t exist in math only natural numbers
and since most programmers have a mathematical background using an integer is more natural



3108501
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 0	0	
s an important side note it is quite common to find that inlining makes no noticeable improvement in performance and there are many cases where not inlining code is better than inlining it
i ve found this to even be true of simple one line accessor functions just because the code when inline requires fewer instructions than it does to call the function doesn t always mean the compiler will do a better job with the compiler



3155805
memcpy memmove
Pattern(s): 1	
memmove instead of memcpy .
memcpy is faster but it s not safe for moving blocks of memory where the source and destination overlap



3393794
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
the way i fixed it was to upgrade my jquery to 1.4
versioning 1.3.2 fails with newer prototype on ie8



3398838
passenger webrick
Pattern(s): 0	
passenger is likely the most popular choice for production now due to its easy configuration speed and features
if there is a specific use case for webrick that makes it better than any of the other server choices i d love to know



3440111
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 0	0	
fter spending years with scheme and common lisp i ve spent a year programming almost exclusively in c
when i go back to scheme scheme is much easier to express myself because i know the kinds of things the machine is good at



3455275
launch4j javaw
Pattern(s): 1	
launch4j looks like a good option as alternate to having java installed as it will allow seamless usage of the jar file
javaw is more or less uses java.exe with security permissions and some launch options



3524659
expander itemscontrol
Pattern(s): 0	
each of theses child object got another expander with an itemscontrol having around 10 childs
wpcoder as the itemscontrol rarely contains more than 10 objects and very rarely 45 and because the items can have multiple height and child virtualization did nt help me yes i ve tried



3572910
codeigniter yii
Pattern(s): 1	
no idea what codeigniter is
yii is much faster to develop just fyi



3685845
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 0	
quicksort generally performs better and takes less memory but many examples have worst-case performance of o n 2 which almost never occurs in practice
mergesort doesn t perform quite as well but is usually implemented to be stable and mergesort s easy to do part in memory and part on disk that is use the built-in sort function



3690009
vmware virtualbox
Pattern(s): 0	
and frankly if you re doing that then yes it s a real pita and vmware is way easier
my biggest beef with virtualbox is that you can t take a vm and move a vm plus a vm snapshots and branches to another pc



3763864
octal binary
Pattern(s): 1	
some languages use a 0 prefix to represent octal notation 0777
binary notation is less common often hexadecimal is used instead as it makes the notation a bit more compact and ends up using the right padding for octets



3789816
rss feed
Pattern(s): 1	
rss is more simple that s where its strength is
atom is better defined yes but that s the problem they made it easy to write a very complex feed when at the end of the day you want a simplified summary



3920125
codeigniter kohana
Pattern(s): 0	
in codeigniter you will probably have to do everything from scratch
kohana has cleaner coding style architecture but the lack of documewntation is crippling this could be solved if you arent shy about using their forum.



3941624
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
you have an acute limit on how much space you can use innodb tables take up a fair bit more space
you require full-text search capabilities myisam is better for this purpose



3966875
libxml2 xerces
Pattern(s): 0	
xerces imo is too large and overwhelming for my needs while expat is too low-level
my understanding is that libxml2 is a good higher level library



4010171
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 0	
you can do this client-side with javascript
doing the same thing server-side is trickier



4087592
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
myisam table is much faster than innodb but no rollback is possible



4103211
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are worried about instantiating too many serializable you can always keep them in a dictionary keyed by type
deserialization is harder as you have to know the type of object first - if you can t get the caller to tell you what type to expect you will need to read the data before you try deserializing to determine the type



4150714
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
i usually see this implemented with a while loops instead of a for-loop
i think those two will have the same effect but to me the while loops is clearer



4161458
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
udp is more or less applicable for reliable applications if you take into account that packets will be lost by design



4410552
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
i can think of a few reasons to use get rather than post
if the operation simply fetches results semantically the get method is more appropriate



4410552
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
get is used when you are fetching data
post is more used when you are submitting a change to the application



4534715
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 0	
client-side validation is more of a convenience to the user than anything else
then the first answer would be are you checking on the server-side



4552297
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
while myisam can be faster for some queries innodb is usually quicker if properly tuned



4586678
elementtree beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 1	
we do something sort of like this with rss feed using python -- we use elementtree since rss is usually guaranteed to be well-formed
beautifulsoup is probably better suited for parsing html



4636530
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
the second getter is fragile the second getter will crash if somebody access s the object s title and then releases the object so the first is generally preferable even if marginally slower
the first setter is more efficient and will work even in situations where an autorelease pool doesn t exist so it s preferable



4676970
mvp presenter
Pattern(s): 0	0	
from my experience a strongly enforced mvp pattern has been much better for data centric complex lob applications
mvp offers greater seperation as your presenter have no knowledge of web centric concepts



4715059
xsd.exe svcutil.exe
Pattern(s): 0	
xsd.exe adheres to what i ll term as a lean and mean interpretation of the xml schema standard
wcf s svcutil.exe tool recognizes an even smaller footprint of xml schema



4771539
liferay alfresco
Pattern(s): 1	
liferay seems more appealing at first but it lacks a couple of features at least the versions i tred that will slow you down in the middle of the deployment



5016045
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
for tcp this is easy once the connection is established the firewall will allow connection in both directions
for udp this is a bit more tricky since there is no concept of a session



5045411
int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
if sign magnitude ones complement two s complement are used to represent this value then -3 int requires more than one byte for the representation
this value when assigned to an unsigned chars will cause an overflow which produces undefined behavior



5136043
wordpress joomla
Pattern(s): 0	
do note that wordpress is not just for blogs you can create different kinds of websites with it
another choice is joomla it is also simpler than drupal



5177403
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
was getting weird cases where a different app engine instance was seeing different hash
using md5 which is faster than sha1 faster than sha256 for now



5191782
icriteria fluent
Pattern(s): 1	
i ask because the criteria api follows the fluent interface pattern and so might be considered fluent nh
the pros and cons of criteria vs hql are numerous but basically icriteria is better for programmatically building your queries and hql is better if the given query will never change excepting parameters imho



5226739
mouseout mouseenter
Pattern(s): 0	
sounds like your problem is because with the .hover because you have the new div opening over the old one the .hover causes the .hover to fire the mouseout function
the best solution is to add to the .hover so the mouseenter also includes the larger image that grows out of the smaller image



5269766
multiplying subtract
Pattern(s): 0	
similarly if you skip the five first elements your loop takes o n-5 time but that too is the same as o n because adding or subtract a constant is even weaker than multiplying by a constant



5381240
jsf wicket
Pattern(s): 0	
i m in the hate it part so anything i said is biased plus in our test prototypes developing in wicket was faster than jsf



5420141
lwjgl jogl
Pattern(s): 0	
jogl is simply opengl and so hard to learn if you are not used to gl
lwjgl is a higher level api aimed at games and systems like jmonkeyengine higher level still



5420483
width height
Pattern(s): 0	
.2 change the fb.canvas.setsize calls to fb.canvas.setsize width 600 height 670 where you can set your own width and height
this doesn t bring the user to the top of the page but the user resizes the short page to the user real height which is a bit better



5556127
inherited properties
Pattern(s): 0	
dependency properties in wpf support properties value inherited
with normal clr properties it is much harder to push values down to any child objects without modifying the child object

jdom and xom are probably the simplest
dom4j is more powerful but more complex



5868125
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	1	
so if you know how to use it it can be screaming fast innodb was much slower due to concurrency issues
myisam is faster for small simple selects is total bull postgres will zap a small simple select in 50-100 microseconds



5895463
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
if you want to use just get it is much simpler you only call from your php
depending to the response data format you can output you also want to get the response regarding to your post directly or parse your php first



5957862
folder directory
Pattern(s): 0	
put the file in some other common location such as in a folder on the c drive
just have the application work with the copy of the file in the output bin debug directory the directory that the application will be installed to - you can change the properties of the item in your solution to have the item copied to the output directory either all the time or only when the item in the solution directory is newer



5992872
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
v10.3 versioning is much easier and better integrated with mvvm
not sure if upgrade costs money we had sitewide license



6058730
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 0	
it works fine - in fact i rarely boot into windows anymore
ubuntu runs much quicker - even my wife prefers it
it s a bit of a leaning curve using a linux desktop - but that s what i wanted anyway



6088194
xslt xquery
Pattern(s): 1	
xquery can produce a modified copy of your document but it s not particularly easy because you need to explicitly copy all the parts that you don t want to change
xslt is a better bet for producing a modified copy of the document



6092869
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
firefox 4 has started doing the same thing in fact if you look in your task bar you ll see a plugin-container.exe process for firefox when flash is running
google-chrome just launches more chrome.exe processes



6104661
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
if you can t afford lost packets then tcp is probably a better option than udp since it provides that guarantee out of the box



6126448
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
you could try an ajax post
this will prompt the get and has a bit more flexibility than just using jquery



6165260
16-bit 64bit
Pattern(s): 1	
without knowing more about what exactly you need to do it seems to me that it would be more efficient to use a struct containing a 32-bit unsigned int for the number of seconds and a 16-bit int for the number of milliseconds the remainder
or use a 32-bit int for the milliseconds if 64bit alignment is more important than saving a couple of bytes.



6219147
post get
Pattern(s): 0	1	1	
get is better if you want to navigate back to the a page with a given set of variables
post is better if you re submitting a lot of content
however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to



6243852
recvfrom datagram
Pattern(s): 0	0	
socket.error errno 10040 a message sent on a datagram socket was larger than the internal message buffer or some other network limit or the buffer used to receive a datagram into was smaller than the datagram itself
so i am not sure why you would hang on recvfrom if a 6-byte message was originally sent



6380342
vsto add-in
Pattern(s): 0	
unfortunately vsto is only a managed wrapper around the office interop libraries so vsto has no more hooks than using the interop libraries
it just makes add-in development much easier with helpers and giving us designer support



6456747
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
post makes more sense in terms of http method definitions
get is supposed to be safe and make no changes to your system state database



6563020
disk ram
Pattern(s): 1	
relational database systems do relational database systems own disk swapping of course partly because relational database systems were designed when ram was more expensive and partly because relational database systems still sometimes deal with unusually large volumes of data

authorization access-control
Pattern(s): 1	
spring security s anonymous authorization just gives you a more
convenient way to configure your access-control attributes



6788970
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 1	
as a rule setinterval is good for doing small processes regularly
in this case you just want to put a wait into the processing which suggests to me that settimeout is better



6888070
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
post is more secured cuz it s not gonna be cached or saved in history or bookmarked
u can clearly notice that post s dont display in the browsers address bar but get do

7348124
alarmmanager timertask
Pattern(s): 1	
alarmmanager is better if you need to receive the intent even when your activity is not active
timer and timertask might be better if you only need the periodic behavior while your activity is running

qnx is most famous for being the real time operating system of which there are two versions qnx rtos v4 is an older product but is still used in many existing systems and still supported by the company



7528159
wordpress joomla
Pattern(s): 0	
in my opinion drupal is better for more complicated sites...joomla and wordpress can be extended to function as more complex websites but more complex websites great strength is that out of the box more complex websites can provide the majority of functionality that s needed for a basic website
essentially joomla is more of an off-the-shelf solution while drupal is a lot more powerful drupal s entire makeup is extensible and modular but requires more configuration and a slightly steeper learning curve



7589633
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
google-chrome had less of an issue most likely due to tabs being in isolated processes

put get
Pattern(s): 0	
since m k+1 m k + m k-2 + 1 you can replace with to get m k+1 m k + m k-2 + 1
you can make substitutions on the right-hand side of as long as what you put in is less than or equal to what you take out



7954071
ocean petrel
Pattern(s): 1	
this is not exposed through ocean as it is hard to understand and the side-effects are not predictable
inside petrel this is less so as the processes in question will update all the zone properties and keep all the zone properties consistent

free malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
his means using new gc instead of new gc_malloc instead of malloc and don t bother about free -ing or delete -ing memory objects
a couple of years ago i measured new gc_malloc versus malloc it was a bit slower perhaps 25µs for new gc_malloc versus 22µs for system malloc



8018700
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
or example you could have the central core of the application written in c++ set up a tcp server then have toolbar apps written in java send command packets to the core program via a dedicated socket connection
come to think of the core program udp is probably better for that

innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
innodb and myisam
3 innodb supposedly keeps data safer



8156982
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
instead of storing a list of links as strings store a list of md5 or sha1 hash for those links
comparing a hash to a list of hash is much faster than comparing a string to a list of strings

monotouch sdk follows the .net naming guidelines and public propertie starts with capital letters
private or protected variables starts with lower case



8300774
indesign framemaker
Pattern(s): 0	
framemaker is an excellent tool for books manuals and long technical documents
it is a bit harder to learn than indesign but has a richer set of tools for building variables and running headers and footers if you have the time and inclination to learn how to use them



8307079
pcm music
Pattern(s): 1	
as far as encoding the raw pcm that comes out of the mic is typically huge for a 16khz sample rate 16bits sample mono channel audio stream that would net out to 32000 bytes per second of audio
i have not found an easy or free way to encode in mp3 on the sl platform but fortunately speech as opposed to music is better encoded using the speex codec

remoteview appwidgetprovider
Pattern(s): 0	
for screen-resolution normal android design guidelines are necessary and sufficient because widget also follows xml layout techniue difference comes with remoteview methods only which has nothing to do with design
about implementation i will say extending appwidgetprovider is better then a broadcastreceiver approach to update widget contents



8640353
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
it s because superclass is a lower bound annotation meaning classes that are super to vector
if vectorb is a subclassing to vector then vectorb is a subclassing to vector won t work



8672362
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
other than that if you want to not block other js from running then you need to use the settimeout setinterval method of implementing this loops
otherwise a regular for-loop is faster



8768026
codeigniter cakephp
Pattern(s): 0	
for that you would use a php framework
i would suggest starting with codeigniter which is simpler than zend
i don t have experience with cakephp so i won t comment on that.

udp tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
i wish to discover all systems on the same local network as the computer running my program s primary ip address which are listening to a certain tcp port.
with udp this is a slightly harder problem - you could look for bounces but your packet may be eaten or lost as could the reply



9193258
ant maven
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want the jar to be created everytime you build try using maven or ant that does these packaging tasks for you automatically
maven is more powerful and you would love to see that it mainly does dependency management and your library is the dependency for your project



9264189
fixed-point fractions
Pattern(s): 1	
the primary difference between decimal and double is that decimal is fixed-point and double is floating point
that means that decimal stores an exact value while double represents a value represented by a fractions and is less precise

9279856
try-catch exception-handling
Pattern(s): 0	
in this case the try-catch version is not too bad but you still have to know which type of exception-handling is thrown and in which case
also in real-world code having a lot of try-catch statements makes code harder to follow



9352289
carrierwave minimagick
Pattern(s): 0	
when configuring carrierwave you will also need to setup the actual processor
i use the full-blown rmagick but you can use minimagick which is simpler to setup



9468534
opensuse linux
Pattern(s): 1	
opensuse and suse enterprise are developed by opensuse and suse gmbh but opensuse is more loosely developed with less testing before release where suse is tested to greater levels to ensure proper operations before it was released
like most linux distributions opensuse includes both a default graphical user interface gui and a command line interface option



9505126
tostring string.format
Pattern(s): 0	
you might as well replace showexp with tostring which is declared in object unless you want tostring to do something different
using string.format is a little cleaner than concatenating several strings in my opinion

the mpfr library can use mpir and provides much more complete floating-point support



9796712
boost allocator
Pattern(s): 1	
some people will suggest using std vector s of std vectors but this is inefficient due to the memory allocator and copying that has to occur when the vectors resize
boost has a more efficient version of vectors of vectors in its multi_array lib

9976913
try-catch exception-handling
Pattern(s): 0	
if you re planning on wrapping your code in a try-catch block with an exception-handling of nullreferenceexception then you should have something in place to handle this type of exception-handling and perform any necessary operations related to this error
that being said in situations where you know you may have the possibility of having an error which would throw an exception-handling it is better to check for this situation -- and not throw an error at all but gracefully handle it



10058020
for-loop while-loop
Pattern(s): 1	
you use a for-loop for an unknown number of loops iterations
this is not wrong but a while-loop is more appropriate

Pattern(s): 1	
you use a for-loop for an unknown number of loops iterations
this is not wrong but a while-loop is more appropriate



10070101
strlen realloc
Pattern(s): 0	
- infer a minimum pre-existing buffer size from strlen - this would mean that if you re say writing a long string then a short string then the original long string into the buffer the last operation will needlessly replace the buffer
clearly realloc is a better bet



10114896

upgrade you xcode with the latest one xcode 4.3



10541637
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
manipulating id s to find children is more difficult than using built-in jquery selectors to find children
i realize that in this case children are siblings rather than true children but you can still use .nextuntil parent to find all of the children of a parent



10640057
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
if you upgrade a module versioning a clean build need to be executed
minimum sdk versioning - checkout that the module min titanium sdk versioning parameter has lower value then the sdk you use

codeigniter fuelphp
Pattern(s): 1	
or you could use pyrocms which is an awesome content management system built on top of codeigniter
fuelphp is a more modern framework which can do some cool stuff but if you don t want to build a whole cms then you can t go wrong with pyro



11067557

orientdb or neo4j are graph databases that can be embedded
orientdb is less mature but has a better license



11128247
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
tcp is stream-based which means there s no guarantee everything will be sent received all at once
you might consider using udp which is less reliable but everything does get sent at once or coming up with your own delimiting scheme



11136921
hash salt
Pattern(s): 0	
 salt is not a constant if every password is hash with the same salt you re wasting your time
i would recommend using bcrypt instead of the sha512 salt approach bcrypt instead s much harder to brute force



11229402
range median
Pattern(s): 0	
o if you are calculating rolling median over a set of integers which vary from 1..65536 then you only need 128kb to store 128kb and can insert delete query using o ln n where n the size of the range 2 16 operations
this is a big win if the data range is much smaller than your rolling window



11341261
gif bmp
Pattern(s): 0	
by the way gif is better than jpg in this case jpg can cause unwanted artifacts making the barcode difficult to scan
bmp is usually too big



11371300
ant pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
a parameterized ant script has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but the actual pom.xml does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven



11581186
decoder encoder
Pattern(s): 1	
for most use cases h.264 will have much better compression than mjpeg but the encode decoder process is a lot more complex which is why things without much computing power webcams spit out mjpeg
google would have to be a rather pathological case for an good h.264 encoder to perform as badly as a good mjpeg encoder randomly generated pixel values



11583834
folder directory
Pattern(s): 0	
f a file or directory matches that string then it will not be copied
if you want to exclude folder it is safer to use the above string instead of simply folderc which might skip a file called folderc_listing.txt

leaflet openlayers
Pattern(s): 0	
here are several javascript libraries that you can use to draw maps in a widget on your webpage but the most common are openlayers and leaflet

you have two options webclient and httpwebrequest.
or you can use httpwebrequest which has more capabilities but is a little tougher to use



11993839
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 0	
by the way it would probably be a good idea to use bitwise operations rather than a union to convert the two bytes to a single unsigned int
that way your code would be more portable to other compilers where unsigned is more than two bytes



12083121
webclient httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 0	
webclient has a much simpler interface than httpwebrequest and takes care of reading and writing from the streams for you



12147389
webclient httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 0	
you may need to cast the result to httpwebrequest
note that the webclient class makes this much easier



12165978
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
this will give you the latest five postings assuming a higher id post is newer forcing each result to be from a different user
with this method if you need to load other user or post data it would be best to load it separately after you get the desired user ids and post ids



12237773
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 0	
but then apache s functionality is much bigger than just serving rack based apps
so apache s functionality makes sense to replace apache s functionality with something more lightweight for example nginx especially because you deploy apache s functionality once for every host you have



12338464

Pattern(s): 1	
on all of the computers i work with int is faster than unsigned significantly faster than signed chars



12399834

Pattern(s): 0	
but without any useful filtering oracle has to hash the entire table
tbone s query that only use a grouping by looks nicer and may run faster



12795730
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 0	
a server which reserves a thread or an entire process per connection such as apache with the usual mpm_prefork or mpm_worker keepalives are usually disabled entirely or kept quite short a few seconds
for an event-based server such as nginx which uses much less memory per connection the keepalive timeout can be left at a much higher value typically a minute or so



12808226
soundpool audiotrack
Pattern(s): 1	
mediaplayer and soundpool are the main playback classes
audiotrack is a more advanced lower level class allowing more control and complexity



12813429
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
myisam does not have relations foreign keys if you want to keep integrity between tables you have to code some triggers whereas in innodb you can use delete on cascade and this stuff
but innodb is slower when in migrations because it has to check constraints



12822575
jruby mri

i ve noticed however that jruby is more sensitive to memory leaks than mri



12873191
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
you use post
since you are not changing anything get is better



12879437
int boolean
Pattern(s): 1	
but take care you should not use this approach to functions that are not uniform in argument set say one function has one int argument and another zero arguments - that would throw an exception
but given your conditions i d go with boolean if statements because checking a boolean once is even less expensive than calling a function through a variable



12906984
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases
myisam is typically faster for table scans of read-only tables

alarmmanager consumes lesser battery power than timertask or thread



13053667
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 1	
so hard i recommend you uses the 32 bits if you want programme on linux
and in my vision the ubuntu 32 bits is the better plataform to developer to android how to i need make androoid and ios apps i m working on mac but the ubuntu is better if you only programmer on android



13128258
hive hdfs
Pattern(s): 0	
another way is to tune number of reducers - sometimes hive defines much less reducers then needed - so you can set it manually to better utilize your cluster
if you have number of queries to run to do your transformation - you can define low replication factor for this temporary data in hdfs



13145835
post put
Pattern(s): 1	
post can do anything but one use of post creates an object in a container that the client specifies and lets the server return the uri of the newly created object within that container
put is more limited



13327353

13384678
integer fractions
Pattern(s): 0	
the fractions part if present may have any number of digits but is always preceded by a decimal point
if the integer part has more than one digit the leading digit must not be zero



13396640
try-catch exception-handling

versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
i would recommend that you upgrade to the latest versioning it has a much better render engine for html



13442781
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 0	1	
that said using a standard sort with either comparable rows or a comparator is much better than mixing up the sort logic and the comparison logic
comparator is the more flexible way

alarmmanager timertask
Pattern(s): 0	
timertask
both of these are made for repeative execution on certain interval however alarmmanager uses lesser battery



13479885
joptionpane jdialog
Pattern(s): 0	
as i understand it joptionpane is great for what it can do but you can t really change the functionality beyond that not easily
jdialog is better to inherit from if you want to create your own custom dialogs



13597029
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
plus tcp is more complicated because you have to handle the protocol stuff
so when you create your system you have a choice - either tcp or udp packets depending on what you are trying to achieve and how you want to go about your system



13597249
dropbox skydrive
Pattern(s): 0	
dropbox officially haven t release sdk for windows phone yet you can still use it using sharpbox project click here
skydrive is better option specially for windows phone application as both runs on same platform and provide better features



13629530
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
myisam is liable to explode in the worst possible way if the system crashes or loses power during heavy write activity it s not journaled and can t always be recovered
innodb is much more robust



13633932

Pattern(s): 0	
ou could place a width-greedy-zero height with css empty element where the images are supposed to be loaded and test how much width it can get by selecting him via jquery
if jquery width is greater than 300 call the jail



13661451
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
verytime you make an ajax request you post the token you get from the fb.getloginstatus or fb.login and read it out in the php file and set it via facebook - setaccesstoken
not suitable in all circumstances you definately need to use post is slower and brings some security issues but still works



13720564
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
then bigger miss then more performance penalty will be introduced by processors
actually in the modern world cpu performs much faster then memory



13892105
ant maven

this does not answer your question but i ve spent too much time messing around with uploadify
in the end i ditched it and switched to plupload which seems much better



13950475
crossover mutation
Pattern(s): 1	
add a new operator alongside mutation and crossover that performs your local search
you might find that the mutation operator is less useful in the hybrid scheme so just replacing that could be viable.



13976274
disk ram
Pattern(s): 0	
when an index is too large to fit into ram mongodb must read the
index from disk which is a much slower operation than reading from



14148166
qgraphicsscene qgraphicsitem
Pattern(s): 1	
technically this could also be done by customizing a qtableview widget but qgraphicsscene is more robust for custom graphics and performance
from a high level view you can either create a composite object representing a cell item or you can subclass a qgraphicsitem and do all the custom painting yourself



14169451
coalesce isnull
Pattern(s): 1	
regarding isnull vs coalesce -
it seems that isnull is faster in this instance



14232816
xstream jackson
Pattern(s): 0	
if you use jackson you can check this answer and this example
there are many other json apis jaxb etc but imo xstream is the easier to start with



14349977
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
for that you have realloc
with malloc you would end up with a fixed size for your table just like if you had only declared it has static but with later initialization well i m a bit agains this sentence because malloc is much more than that but for this purpose this purpose is safe to say this purpose



14650512
kerberos ntlm
Pattern(s): 1	
however kerberos is much more widely supported
as for how you can use ntlm kerberos with http in the framework you are using



14761953
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
at first i tried using while loops but that required a lot more code and was a lot more confusing
then i started using the for-loop which works a lot better for this type of system



14767734
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	0	
in my experience postgresql is a more solid database and performs better with many simultaneous users especially when writing to the database although harder to learn its more strict
mysql is easier to learn and may be sufficient depending on the total number of request traffic



15283900
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	1	
to explain why a for-loop is faster than a for in loops is basically understand the underlying data structures used to store the data in memory
looping through an indexed based arrays is naturally faster because of the way an arrays is stored in memory



15402153
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 0	0	1	1	
the sensible thing is to use ant or maven maven is easier better in most cases
you write a build script build.xml or pom.xml respectively and run the builder ant or mvn



15403397
profiling instrumentation
Pattern(s): 1	
with the code you have here your instrumentation is much much more expensive than the work being done which makes the profiling data useless



15469131
fgets strlen
Pattern(s): 0	
fgets is simpler when you re reading character strings
as mentioned in the other answer strlen is a function that you need to call on a variable or char array to get the length of the string it holds



15565968
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
giving a quick guess here but post looks more like a w3c.org mime request for mail
you send headers on separate lines crlf add onto a line in that a string in condition similar to a get request by appearence of that string is url encoded unlike the headers just like taken from an html form and similar to json notation



15725413
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
his is wrong because the grade is a value in the arrays not an index
although the for-loop you wrote is simpler than a for-loop with an index sometimes you do need to know an index so you might want to rewrite your for-loop



15790529
jsdom cheerio
Pattern(s): 1	
cheerio does not execute these scripts and as a result content may not be visible as you re experiencing
this is an article i read a while back and caused me to have the same discovery just open the article and search for jsdom is more powerful for a quick answer



15863773
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
if you need your clients to stay connected and ready to receive data from server for example a push service you should implement it using tcp
if you want to implement a simple request-response service then udp is better choice



16053421
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 0	
econd you can implement a comparator to judge which is bigger
if you don t want the object to be comparable which means you don t want to change the existing code to let the existing code implement comparable this is a better way



16060045
min max
Pattern(s): 0	
find axis min and max values
if min is greater than 0 use 0 as min



16072349
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
try catch inside for-loop is probably closer as long as you don t mind the unassigned values left in the arrays



16135267
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 1	
n object should implement comparable if that is the clear natural way to sort the class and anyone would need to sort the class would generally want to do the class that way
if however the sorting was an unusual use case of the class or there can be multiple sort orders then a comparator is a better option



16273431
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
but it is designed to work with tcp since here package transmission is ensured alle packages are acutally delivered and in the right order
udp is less relieable so there was micro transport protocol designed for it



16374534
folder directory
Pattern(s): 0	
he key is to check the file dates in the tomcat directory of where you deployed the war
it may happen even though you are deploying an entirely new cleaned war and deleting all folder there were still older cached files in there probably because eclipse keeps older cached files to save compile time thinking older cached files don t have any changes



16395461
passenger puma

a fat filesystems saves files into clusters by 16 bytes or 32 bytes explaining the label of fat16 fat32 and basically wasting disk space
ntfs however is a little more dynamic than that files can be saved as that files own size but again the ram causes the files to be saved randomly on to disk therefor to clean up these empty spaces it is best to run disk defrag a default program on all versions of windows



16669714
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
see if you want to use inherited
have a base class with fields that you want to share with everyone and a subclassing which has more restricted data



16725606
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
get requests with url-encoded parameters are somewhat awkward with json-rpc
i think keeping everything in post requests is a better idea



17017131
printwriter bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 0	
printwriter is a richer api compared to bufferedwriter



17017726
getter setter
Pattern(s): 0	
i think the getter is a better place
if the setter is called first - well then the setter will set the property to whatever the setter is asked to do so and nobody cares what the previous value of the property was



17056799
int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
it s just a int number
technically chars was just a smaller 8-bit number



17137973
scheme racket
Pattern(s): 0	
see page 25 section 6.3.2 in the scheme r5rs specification for a full list of list accessing functions
racket probably has more



17235688
r-tree quadtree
Pattern(s): 0	
if you can use a database you can use the point datatype or you can write your own r-tree
when you have many overlapping pins maybe a quadtree is better



17302808
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
it should be noted that the enhanced for-loop is less efficient for arraylist then standard indexing
this is because we have to create an iterator object and call hasnext and next on an iterator object on each step of loops causing unnecessary overhead



17336556
onclicklistener ontouch
Pattern(s): 0	
use an ontouchlistener instead of an onclicklistener
ontouch gives you better feedback and it does everything onclick already does



17531361
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 1	
i would give sudo another look since sudo gives you more control
also the -s flag on sudo tells sudo to read a passwd from stdin rather than from a terminal so sudo would work in the context you give above



17604670
flot highcharts
Pattern(s): 0	
also flot does a better job to synchronise common axis scale with many series
highcharts does a really good job here mixing bubble chart with other kind of series but isn t free for us government context



17604670
jqplot flot
Pattern(s): 0	
i tried to do the same thing with jqplot which has some advantages but doesn t work with bubbles and other kind of series on the same graph
also flot does a better job to synchronise common axis scale with many series



17641528
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 0	
strncpy is safer than strcpy



17655235
tinyint varchar
Pattern(s): 1	
i always use tinyint
it takes up less space than a varchar and is much better for speed and indexing



17772874
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
if you f5 the page it ll update again if the action is get
post is marginally more difficult to tamper with but should not be relied upon as a security measure in itself.



17812053
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
if i run this in firefox it works
google-chrome has tighter security restrictions for loading scripts from local file systems



17918757
width height
Pattern(s): 0	
height auto
if you don t want to resize the image s whose width is less than 500



17944587
cassini iis
Pattern(s): 1	
this only happened when using cassini
when switching to iis this was no longer that case



17993556
codeigniter yii
Pattern(s): 0	
regarding performance from my expericnece yii is a lot faster because it comes with way less overhead



18163668
range max
Pattern(s): 0	
scanning backwards we can stop our scan when d is greater than the middle of the array s range
or when the current max is greater than the length of the possible sequence for d greater than the largest indexed difference



18168682
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
or maybe a getter is more complex than just getting the value of a variable maybe it does some calculations
if you didn t have to use a setter and could just access the variable directly some developer might miss the fact some developer re supposed to use a setter for the above reasons which would obviously create issues



18245604
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
question 1 - this is a for-loop - it is executing once for each row in the matrix or data frame x not sure what x is here exactly
changing it to 2 will mean loops happens one less time



18407020
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
completely removing the viewport width causes more problems than it solves
in order for webapps to have the correct viewport height the viewport width needs to be greater than 320 which unfortunately is the value that device-width reports to the browser



18563740
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
udp suits well for passing short messages but for transferring large amounts of data tcp is more preferable



18569053
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 1	
then you define the function to convert each entry into a two-element list which will be converted into dictionary automatically using the dictionary function
using map function is faster than just iterating over the list which is the beauty of python



18570990
clearinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 0	
clearinterval doesn t take second argument
and settimeout is easier to wrap head around.



18711016
d3.js raphael
Pattern(s): 1	
the two vector graphic libraries you can focus are raphael and d3.js but d3.js is much more powerful with data binding



18757820
width margin
Pattern(s): 0	
i believe it was only one single page whose width is more than the screen s width
and the default view is achieved by setting the margin or other property which is for you to findout using trial and error



18843676
nexus artifactory
Pattern(s): 1	
if you don t like big databases underneath artifactory may not be for you since it stores everything in jcr database although the authors stand behind their design choice
nexus is more file-system friendly and we ended up using it



18873186
int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
you can add multiplying shift print scan as you would with int short long or long long
chars has a smaller range than the others



19253271
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
also there are a few basic changes i would make to this program first of all - a for-loop should be used where you know how many iterations you will do
in your case a while loops or better still a do-while loops is better suited



19386604
getelementsbytagname getelementbyid
Pattern(s): 0	
between queryselector queryselectorall and getelementbyid
in the same conditions getelementsbytagname is better to use than queryselectorall .



19396429
nasm fasm
Pattern(s): 0	
 would suggest sticking with some portable assembly language compiler as fasm or nasm
imo fasm is the better one because imo fasm is self-sufficient and does not depend on any other tools



19457177
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
the is very little difference to the programming functionality between sending the form as or but the post method is more secure and can transfer more information so most of us use that
finally on the other end there are three ways to get the variable values php example



19564465
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
then run all upgrade scripts but scripts should be written in such way that they do not execute if current versioning is higher than versioning expected by the script



19621291
nsbezierpath appkit
Pattern(s): 1	
well in some scenarios nsbezierpath is more beneficial than cgpathref for example in nsbezierpath it provides the api which can draw the path using color but cgpathref does not provide any api to draw the path for drawing the same need to use cgcontext
this is the one difference and second difference is cgpath derived from applicationservice framework and nsbezierpath derived from appkit framwork



19689402
int double
Pattern(s): 0	
since double has more mantissa bits than int can have significant bits comparisions between double and int are precise in that regard



19742481
portrait landscape
Pattern(s): 1	
so my proposed solution that to run all the views in landscape and this one in portrait
having this view in portrait is more design logical to have the same orientation of the picker



19875253
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
remember to think of another cause for the values equalling 0 would be due to the for-loop as set i to zero loops until i is not less than or equal to dataset.length incrementing i by one every loops



19910684
range max
Pattern(s): 0	
also note that i changed your random range to 1 - 7
the max is one less so in your code you were never getting a number 6 for an image



19966067
thin unicorn
Pattern(s): 0	
if you use thin and your code doesn t clear requests very quickly then you re in trouble - since heroku uses random routing requests will stack up on a blocked dyno even if there are free dynos
using unicorn seems better if you can handle the memory hit because free dynos s less likely that all of your forks will get slow requests at the same time



20110614
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 0	
much safer to have apache or also my preferred nginx listening on 80 and passing along the requests
nginx is friendlier for sockets as well and someday you ll want those



20209624
multiplying addition
Pattern(s): 0	
if multiplying is slower than addition then case 2 is slightly slower than case 1



20643551
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
to get more post between certain dates you can start by requesting a feed with the max_timestamp parameter and then move backwards in time by 20 post at a time using the next_url which is in the pagination object returned by your request
do this until a post is older than min_timestamp



20950402
post get
Pattern(s): 1	1	
get is better for things that should be able to be bookmarked and simple queries with few short parameters
post is better for sensitive fields that the user shouldn t see for large binary transfers and for transfers with many fields or very long fields



20964388
post get
Pattern(s): 0	
you can either use post or get since i think post is a bit trickier to handle in wp



21113484
for-loop while-loop
Pattern(s): 0	
t changes two things using a for-loop instead of a while-loop and counting down instead of up
for my taste brain the for-loop is easier to grasp a collection is being processed until a collection end is reached



21126781
folder dir
Pattern(s): 0	1	
folder objects and their properties for example files are more flexible and complete but may be harder to understand
note dir and dir look the same but dir is marginally more efficient



21193738
mp3 wav
Pattern(s): 0	
i don t know why the player exception was caught with the mp3 temporary file but nothing goes wrong with wav
this is not really the answer i sought since the wav files takes a lot more space but at least it works



21193738
wav ogg
Pattern(s): 0	
this is not really the answer i sought since the wav files takes a lot more space but at least it works
i also tried ogg format which makes the same problem of mp3 .



21206426
mktime strtotime
Pattern(s): 1	
yeah entries are strings then mktime is more consistent to use the strtotime function



21230045
clientaccesspolicy.xml crossdomain.xml
Pattern(s): 0	
first you only need clientaccesspolicy.xml for silverlight and it has more features
crossdomain.xml is an older security access model with compatibility for flash etc



21244221
width height
Pattern(s): 0	0	
this is happening to you because the content width is bigger than 480px
it s the same when your page height is higher than your browser



21252711
post put
Pattern(s): 1	
the limit of post lies actually more on the server side than on the solr side
if you put solr into tomcat the it s the limit of tomcat s post which usually interest you if you put your tomcat behind apache or nginx then you put your tomcat behind apache or nginx max post size will also interest you



21275158
free malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
and your only initializing first variable of struct but while you are trying to free the memory you are unallocating memory which is not yet allocated astruct 1 and so on till 100
when you use a malloc a malloc actually allocates a bit more memory than you you specified



21286020
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
there is a firebug version available for google-chrome firebug lite but the firefox version is much better and i d highly recommend you at least try a firebug version available for google-chrome firebug lite out



21317666
int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
it expects a single chars input
for int i looks more like c++ than c



21349390
switching screens
Pattern(s): 0	
you can imagine this pointer switching does not require very much time
i hope you see now that directly writing an image to the screens actually causes much more delay and annoying flickering



21353571
devise cancan
Pattern(s): 1	
you may also want to look at a gem to manage permissions as devise is more for authentication
my personal favorite is the_role but others like cancan very much



21378968
int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
int has a higher type precedence than any of the n var chars types and so it tries to convert all of the strings to int s to see if they re 0



21526606
exif xmp
Pattern(s): 0	
xmp does allow richer metadata
but as the metadata you have got is from a camera raw file i would think they map directly to exif tags given exif was developed by the digital camera industry for exactly the use you describe



21665739
interpreted-language compiled-language
Pattern(s): 0	
an interpreted-language surely makes an interpreted-language easier but this is still entirely possible with compiled-language like c



21706038
maven m2e
Pattern(s): 1	1	
if you re doing osgi maven is less great
m2e however is less helpful and in my experience only leads to confusing headaches



21763325
width margin
Pattern(s): 0	
if the width is less than the screen size
margin auto



21944601
gridview repeater
Pattern(s): 0	
the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right



22095998
folder dir
Pattern(s): 1	
wordpress allow you to put uploads in year- and month-based folder
custom upload dir is somewhat smarter



22118467
magento joomla
Pattern(s): 1	
if you don t need all functionalities of joomla just disable those from back-end
if you need a pure e-commerce site you can use opencart lightweight solution or magento which is a much more complex e-commerce solution



22178187
division multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
he line works because of integer division the line works because of modulo
the line works because of operator precedence multiplication has a higher precedence than addition + so it will be done first



22178187
multiplication modulo
Pattern(s): 0	
he line works because of integer division the line works because of modulo
the line works because of operator precedence multiplication has a higher precedence than addition + so it will be done first



22203178
int double
Pattern(s): 0	
double s length is way more than int that s why you should be checking int first



22309310
do-while break
Pattern(s): 1	
edit if you want to keep the do-while
but the break version is clearly more readable



22407245
width height
Pattern(s): 1	1	
if width is more restrictive use
else if height is more restrictive use



22419247
width margin
Pattern(s): 0	
tables are one such instance that don t seem to align without margin auto
also make sure your div width is larger than your button width



22452751
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
here might be a cross-domain request problem but i give a cross-domain request problem no so many chances when your wfs post request is working while wms get returns a problem
usually a cross-domain request problem is vice versa the post is more dangerous and more cross-domain sensitive



22488897
multiplying multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
then to estimate the next 64 bit multiplying the highest 64 bit of x with this number and shift everything into the right place
multiplication is much faster than division



22509386
crypt hash
Pattern(s): 0	
to generate a bcrypt hash it is much safer to use the new password_hash function though there exists also a compatibility pack for earlier php versions



22710394
treemap linkedhashmap
Pattern(s): 1	
however a linkedhashmap is faster as seen here treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each.



22725662
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
you re initializing i to 2 in your for-loop
if your arrays has less than three items you will get an index out of bounds trying to access a location that does not exist



22729760

cleardb mysql database does require more effort than using the default postgresql database though but this guide might help



22783940
maven-antrun-plugin pom.xml
Pattern(s): 0

ant tasks executed by maven-antrun-plugin plugin inherit all properties defined inside the properties section of your pom.xml



22911417
rsa aes
Pattern(s): 0	
one of the reasons to do so is that rsa is much slower than for example aes



22918127
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
ou could manage it using foreach with a manual index setting to 0 before entering loops and manually incrementing it
but in this case the classic for-loop is probably better suited



23058020
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
it s posible you have update to xcode 5.1 and your versioning cordova is very older
i advice you upgrade project in cordova to last versioning and xcode too



23069175
width margin
Pattern(s): 0	
i noticed your website width might is bigger than the browser
instead of using margin -8px on you .container and .footer just set



23080381
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important



23134352
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 1	
if you later want to be able to sort by something else too then that would not be possible using comparable
so using a separate comparator is more loosely coupled and thus offers more flexibility



23240206
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 1	
ou also need to typedef the struct to pic_t not make the struct as an structure object
well the struct is better explained with code in user3386109 s answer



23306190
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
tip only use calloc if you actually need your memory zeroed
malloc is faster



23328099
trie tree
Pattern(s): 1	
ou can use a binary tree or a trie dependeing on what your id is whether it is a string or an int
for a trie lookup will be o k o 1 but a trie lookup works better with strings



23342089
openssl polarssl
Pattern(s): 0	
it shows polarssl rsa encryption and openssl encryption side by side
i believe the openssl wrapper is older and not maintained



23432451
disk ram
Pattern(s): 1	
as you stated in-memory databases are usually an order of magnitude faster than disk resident databases for obvious reasons
however ram is also significantly more expensive than hard drives and consequently not viable for large databases



23432451
disk ram
Pattern(s): 0	
of course this ends up undermining some of the benefits of in-memory databases by re-introducing disk i o as a performance bottleneck
in any case in-memory databases will likely become predominant as ram becomes cheaper



23596420
filtering grouping
Pattern(s): 0	
this would be my first implementation simply filtering out duplicates and seeing if the list shrinks
and here s another using the groupby method and seeing if any grouping has more than one element



23671780
many-to-many one-to-many
Pattern(s): 0	
just an advice since you separate mother and father from parent i think you d better avoid a many-to-many relationship
instead a one-to-many relationship seems better



23749835
printf getchar
Pattern(s): 1	
i can say that printf is more useful in more ways compared to putchar
better look in getchar and putchar respective manual pages man 3 printf man 3 putchar in terminal



23795519
treemap linkedhashmap
Pattern(s): 0	
linkedhashmap additionally provides iteration with a predictable order with only a minimal performance hit
treemap has a higher complexity and thus lower performance but it constantly keeps all entries sorted based on their keys



23889231
couchbase couchdb
Pattern(s): 1	
given the throughput i d expect that couchbase is more suitable for your needs
i ve not used couchbase as much but couchbase s very similar in couchbase s map reduce logic to couchdb



23936558
children parent
Pattern(s): 0	
it un-hides each and every div tag all children and descendants so this snippet can be used only if there isn t any problem in un-hiding each and every div
and also when hiding tab content just hiding the parent div is more than enough in most cases



24016276
folder directory
Pattern(s): 0	
 better solution instead of copying the linked files to the current project directory alongside the associated links copy the linked files to a hiddendebug folder within that directory or any directory you wish
keeping it in the current project directory makes it easier to manage and then to manipulate the paths during debug as i ll explain below



24298251

google-chrome uses the older gdi
firefox and ie use directwrite



24656056
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	1	
if we put we filter in between these calls either in getter or setter setter is more efficient as it is called only when filters change we modify original filtered list with we filter and return our filter back through the getter



24780231
fgets fread
Pattern(s): 1	
remember that fgets reads one line regardless of how long that is up to a maximum of 1024-1 bytes and appends a null-character
please not that for binary input using fread is probably more appropriate



24912697
inherited properties
Pattern(s): 0	
an ignore that is inherited has a lower priority than automapper s standard convention-based mapping
so where the source and destination types both have a referrer properties the convention-based mapping for the most derived types overrides the inherited ignore



24952975
subclass superclass
Pattern(s): 1	
java.sql.date is a subclass of java.util.date
this means that sql.date contains more details than java.sql.date s superclass java.sql.date is more specialized



24975853
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 0	
the integer to unsigned conversion routine to_unsigned can produce a warning if the input integer value is greater than can be expressed in the number of bits specified 6 so the result is clamped to 6 bits with the mod operator



25010461
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
if you re new to maven but have some experience with pde build then maven is harder
for maven pom-first there s a need to tweak pom.xml files quite often



25022918
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
note it is preferrable to use a series of if statements instead of a switch as long as the old versioning is smaller than the versioning for the n-th step upgrade that step



25179071
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
you always get all associated children because those are going to be managed as well
selecting the child and fetching the parent is much more appropriate for this task



25188670
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
as the simple for-loop is faster than a foreach loops



25227387
fadein hide
Pattern(s): 1

google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
for elements that are in the same node google-chrome treats later ones as if google-chrome treats have a higher z-index than the previous element even if it is not so
i has something to do with how google-chrome establishes a stacking context and also explains why preserve-3d is not required in some instances where firefox would require preserve-3d to display correctly



25588609
passenger webrick
Pattern(s): 0	
 realized that i had switched to using passenger as my web server from a singled threaded process webrick webserver
passenger has more than one process running on the same dyno and apparently the same dyno sends a callback url with a port number in the request



25739925
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
you should not be using the post method for requests that contain no actual data get method is better for that



25829657
mp4 webm

25883163
public protected
Pattern(s): 0	
 subclass may reside outside the package following scope levels again private default protected public - we can not narrow down the scope
protected is broader scope than default so java does not contradicts so java own guidelines



25942315
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
we know that the outer for-loop 1 to t is linear
the inner loops runs more over time



25982745
rsa 3des
Pattern(s): 0	
depending on your needs you can chose between des 3des aes or rsa which is in efficient in your case
des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes



26163166
margin height
Pattern(s): 0	
if not this is why the margin is bigger than you expected
if you set a height for outer you will notice the margin will scale accordingly



26236624
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 1	
and deserialization is not more complex



26249881
uiviewcontroller uipageviewcontroller
Pattern(s): 1	
if you don t want to do it the proper way with the uiviewcontroller transitioning api introduced in ios7 you ll have to use uiscrollview with pagingenabled
uipageviewcontroller is meant more for ibook type interfaces and uipageviewcontrollerdelegate s methods aren t very easy to work with ie

udp tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
so if you want a entire file of 93mb to be reassembled by transferring fragmented packets over the network such that no packets are dropped then tcp sctp is a better choice



26448916
cout cin
Pattern(s): 1	
hence cin and cout appear to be slower
however if the synchronization process is set to not occur cin is faster than scanf



26458977
hex binary
Pattern(s): 0	
if the hex input is more than 5 hex characters you will overwrite the memory allocated for binary_line



26509588
ffmpeg libvpx
Pattern(s): 1	
you would want to use ffmpeg instead of avconv ffmpeg is more active and reliable - my opinion
compile ffmpeg with libvpx support webm guide



26572258
openfire ejabberd
Pattern(s): 1	
however openfire is better documented and has a much more polished admin interface
also ejabberd lacks an rtp proxy plugin and the jinglenodes plugin is an enormous pain in the ass to set up on it



26613205
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
if you change your if statement to a while loops for example and you can do this as follows
however a for-loop is a much cleaner solution

if your int value is more than single digit
you need chars or chars to hold the converted data



26812634
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
this works but only in a default apache environment
nginx needs more configurations



26851704
bower npm
Pattern(s): 1	
bower is better suited for front-end packages and has amd libraries which you would use with requirejs etc
npm on the other hand has many libraries that are packaged as commonjs modules



26853765
feof fgetc
Pattern(s): 0	
you could instead check say with if feof stream to see if you are at eof but i think just checking the return value of fgetc is nicer

division modulo
Pattern(s): 0	
multiplier the integer division of the value by the divisor
if modulo is greater than zero the multiplier is incremented



27220257
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
you could more easily solve this problem by putting #rssnews outside and next to .barredcontent instead of inside and adding static width to instead but if you want a css- hack this is the only one i know of
i m not sure if this works anymore but if this does remember that this used to force the scrollbar to appear because 100 height is more like 102 of what you can actually see in the browser so you will have to reduce the height to about 98 if not 97



27310582
alamofire afnetworking
Pattern(s): 1	
fwiw i should have read the alamofire docs more closely-- the file upload i was trying to do needed to be as multipart data which alamofire does not yet support .
so using afnetworking here with its built-in multipart form uploading support worked



27479257
lzo snappy
Pattern(s): 1	
these formats allow various data compression codecs note that snappy is now much more popular than lzo and can also provide other benefits such as fast serialization deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata

27659793
knitr reporters
Pattern(s): 0	
you might want to use r markdown and knitr which is easier than using latex and r as also zhaoy suggested
you might also want to check out the reporters package

division multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
beware of this pitfall when using shifts additions and subtractions to perform multiplication operations
division is a bit harder need to think.



28161148
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
the jit may even be able to recognize that the same register can be used for both purposes so if using such a getter makes code more readable that s a substantial argument in favor
unfortunately the inability of struct members to indicate whether or not struct members modify the underlying structure makes the underlying structure impossible to use the same approach for an indexed property setter



28189916
folder directory
Pattern(s): 0	
try to delete the bin folder on the target server before publishing and check.
the only problem i could see is if the local bin directory contains newer versions of existing components

this is because the swift dictionary is more strongly typed than the objective-c nsdictionary



28253659
width height
Pattern(s): 0	
he function assumes that grid of rectangles canvas will always fit the height of a container area
you feed number of rows to the function and the function calculates rect size and determines whether canvas width is bigger than container width or not



28386962
super self
Pattern(s): 0	
so all super classes must initialize the object.
self is nothing more than a pointer to the object the method initializer is currently working on



28391618
trie tree
Pattern(s): 1	
as for a beter datastructure you should consider using a trie
a beter datastructure s also known as a prefix tree which is a more fitting name in this context



28487200
addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
but your computer can probably add 64-bit numbers just as quickly as it can add 8-bit numbers and a lot faster than any code you write to do addition of decimal digits
multiplication is much more dramatic



28505632
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
google-chrome debugger gave some pretty lame info
firefox debugger was much clearer

all three of these projects are stable and are currently being developed although wxpython s development is much slower than the others mentioned here
wxpython and pyqt both have widgets that allow you to load web pages



28704448
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
in fact many dns and web host providers actually provide this functionality as a service and will host the equivalent of above configuration for you though not necessarily with apache
nginx is probably more likely for this purpose these days



28758271
jar manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 0	
a jar file is little more than just a zip of all classes and resource files
you need to add details into meta-inf manifest.mf file so that the class containing the main method to be executed is know

29213798
children parent
Pattern(s): 0	
ou can do all the calculations in the code measure the parent container add children until the height is exceed etc
this is not an optimal solution but the parent container works in older browsers too



29232311
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
but adding the html directly to the string inside the for-loop solves your problem cleaned code
also note that if you have a fixed width values arrays using for in loops is much simpler understandable and maintainable than using for



29245172
put get
Pattern(s): 0	
usually you will also need to put quotes to end the string value and write your own request
get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side



29288180
isotope packery
Pattern(s): 1	
calling imagesloaded so width and height of elements are correct and isotope is function well
for my project packery is better then masonry because packery is filling up all gaps masonry is just looking for the first possible gap and doesn t fill empty gaps



29298903
width height
Pattern(s): 0	
2.now for the view that is immediate subview to your scrollview set all 4 constraints leading trailing top and bottom along with these set height constraints and make width equals to scrollview
if your immediate subview s height is greater than your screen size or scrollview it will scroll for sure



29300711
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 0	
this will make it easy to group the radio buttons on the client-side but requires a bit more work to determine which button was selected on postback
when i needed this behavior i found this behavior easier to keep the radio buttons as server-side controls and just enforce the button group w jquery



29327795
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
this is pretty simple for types sizeof int but unsigned chars short is more complicated and requires compiler specific packing

fflush stdin is undefined behavior and is always wrong
never use gets it is no longer part of libc and unsecure



29411211
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
you can place the popup markup in the for-loop and use the variables from the for or you can use data-atributes as you sugested to pass data from the looped markup to the popup
the avantage of data-atributes over placing the popup markup in loops is less markup on the page - small html page - fast render time



29556469
flask django
Pattern(s): 1	
django is a safe tool it handles many security issues but it might be longer to update the code
flask development is faster but you might spend more time on database orm settings configuration

division multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
division has higher precedence than subtraction
this subtraction operator occurs within the second brackets and so has a higher precedence than the multiplication



29704061
openfire ejabberd
Pattern(s): 1	
i have a user list in a sql-server database and the external authentification is really hard and not supported for updated versions of ejabberd
for me openfire is more open to different database and easy to integrate in existing plateforms



30036902
getter setter
Pattern(s): 0	
replacing the getter with a macro is straightforward
replacing the setter is a bit trickier since you need to return the correct value



30068523
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 0	
never use strcpy
strncpy is safer but still not that safe because it may not append a null character to your buffer



30219361

i think the link to the nshttpcookie is more under the hood than is needed for this question



30428727
strdup strtok
Pattern(s): 0	
now use strtok or sscanf to parse string by tokens into storage variables
in this setup i suspect strdup is the better choice



30487079
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 1	
magine a comparator as a pair of scales a comparator does not measure a comparator but two different objects weights
for this reference you have to implement another interface comparable which is more similar to the built-in object equals



30577548
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
don t use int32 it s generally best-practice to use int in this case
though for your situation double is more appropriate

post makes post easier to semantically separate getting data from the web server get and sending data to the webserver post



30745517
database-normalization denormalization
Pattern(s): 0	
database-normalization in many ways boils down to having larger numbers of tables themselves with fewer columns
denormalization involves having fewer tables with larger numbers of columns



30825957
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
consider using the linq method instead of a for-loop this looks cleaner
there s no other way you can cast an arrays of value types to an arrays of objects you can t leverage arrays covariance in this case because this only works between arrays of compatible reference types



30854551
scrypt pbkdf2

if you can t or won t upgrade apache you can downgrade the pcre package to the first versioning that contains libpcre.so.0 which is 7.8 i think



31096212
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
the post method is meant to be used when you are changing data on the server
in this case you are only retrieving data so get is the more appropriate method to use here



31158777
vlookup countif
Pattern(s): 1	
i would also try to avoid vlookup which is very slow
if all you need is to check for the existence a a value in a range countif is much faster



31218086
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
you re seriously better off using constraints even adding the default constraints will probably get you most of the way there but if you insist on sticking with auto resizing you need to set fixed left and right margins and flexible width
height is a bit more difficult you have to decide which elements will fill the extra space and have flexible height on those



31236608
width margin
Pattern(s): 1	
adding margin adds more width making the total width of the two elements and their margin greater than 100 pushing the elements onto separate lines



31318060
keydown keyup
Pattern(s): 1	
if you insist to use keydown add e.preventdefault to prevent that event s default behavior
but i think kiirosora09 s answer that switch to keyup is better



31327579
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
with the larger cache sizes of modern cpu s it is less necessary to need to go out to ram as often
when the cache needs to go out to ram the cache uses an asynchronous processors dma to grab more information allowing the cpu to switch to a different process entirely



31408821
rsa aes
Pattern(s): 1	
note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has each encrypted chunk own padding and that rsa is much more computationally expensive than aes



31440882
subclass inherited
Pattern(s): 0	
if you don t want the ihascommonfields interface you could create an abstract generic base class for your converter with abstract methods to get and set the common fields then override those methods in each subclass
honestly inherited does seem simpler than composition here as other answers have stated.



31451558
uilabel uibutton
Pattern(s): 1	
as time passes i found out that creating a single sprite + uilabel is much more flexible and useful brings a lot more possibilities
also if you for example have to have different sprites for uibutton s states disabled highlighted etc it would be a big pain to create n 4 sprites



31520585
for-loop loops

31960150
int double
Pattern(s): 0	
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the int is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly
but double floating-point format can since it has 52-bit fractions



31993049
int double
Pattern(s): 0	0	
f the int is 0 then the two double are equal
if the int is less than 0 then val1 is less than val2 and if if the int is greater than 0 val1 is greater than val2



32042591
pull push
Pattern(s): 1	
push is better for learning too because it is more in harmony with the spirit of xslt



32065449
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
the hash technique is usually more cpu-intensive because you will need to hash every file uploaded but you can then provide the hash to your clients to check the integrity of the file



32143759
jsf tapestry
Pattern(s): 1	
i think tapestry is more optimized for this
this doesn t recreate components on every request as jsf does

for example using a jython script using monkeyrunner you can input touch events like this slightly modified from their documentation
with adb this is even easier adb shell input tap x y



32507523
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to follow the spec then put says that the body is a representation of the url you put to while post is more general purpose
typically you would post to a substring of the put uri so in other words put some json to posts my-post whereas you can post some json to posts and possibly get a new uri back

33377069
distance polygons
Pattern(s): 0	
o for a polygons and a circle you can use gjk to find the minimal distance between that polygons and the center point of the circle then compare that distance with the radius of the circle
if the distance is less than or equal to the radius then the distance s a collision



33457443
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
in the for-loop the increment gets done after every iteration
the while loops is more controllable in that and you can do it in whatever place you want

33714850
dbcontext objectcontext
Pattern(s): 1	
despite the fact that the incident entity had an entitystate of unchanged objectcontext still recognised it as new
dbcontext seems much more state aware



33784216
filtering grouping
Pattern(s): 1	
for example this will display only secondlist items which have a grouping property equal to selectedgroup.id
you can use a custom filtering if your filtering is more complicated or a filtering function in your controller triggered with ng-change if you don t plan to re-use this filtering anywhere else



33802545
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 0	
but you d be crazy to do so apache uses a thread per connection and websockets uses persistent connections using a whole thread per connection when you re expecting a lot of proxy websockets in apache is a waste of resources a non blocking proxy like nginx makes a lot more sense

virtualbox parallels
Pattern(s): 0	0	
the virtualbox shared folder s strange that sequential builds don t cause these errors perhaps compiling the first file causes a sync that prevents the other files from locking until the virtualbox shared folder s done and since the build is parallels the other .cpp files run into the lock

Pattern(s): 0	
in my opinion swing is easier to start because there are tools like the eclipse windowbuilder which enables you to create your application in a graphical interface but javafx is more likely to be used in the future because javafx has some great improvements over swing like css skins etc.

ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 1	
it depends on what distro you re using but for example you can shut down lightdm on ubuntu using sudo etc init.d lightdm stop
unfortunately installing the nvidia drivers on linux is a bit more complicated than it should be so i would recommend that you have another device handy that you can use to search for solutions to problems you may encounter along the way

temp tmp
Pattern(s): 0	
so temp variable is no more and we have the address of first node of list is in temp so the value start becomes zero in the main function and accessing elements there is always a segmentation fault
to overcome this use a global head pointer to hold the address of first node or you can have the tmp variable as global

qpainter qgraphicspixmapitem
Pattern(s): 1	
the qpainter calls are very easy and very complete and i d strongly encourage exploring that instead
subclassing qgraphicsitem rather than either qgraphicsrectitem or qgraphicspixmapitem gives you much more control over the drawing so that s the routine i would recommend for your ultimate solution

Pattern(s): 0	
if the jobs takes more than one hour because of high cpu utilization for example then there will be another instance of the job and likely you will get the duplicated results in the csv file

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
i think using let in for-loop is the much better approach to handle this type of cases

the issue turned out to be that the azure powershell cmdlets up to and including versioning 4.1.x were using an older versioning of the microsoft.azure.management.streamanalytics assembly namely 1.0

button checkbox
Pattern(s): 1	0	
adio button is more use when you want a choice between several value
in you case case s more like a boolean so checkbox seems a better choice

qdialog qwidget
Pattern(s): 1	
it seems you cannot use a qdialog for that because it always wants to have exactly one default button even right from the beginning
qwidget instead is more nice but doesn t set the default property of its button when they get focus

also lwjgl being a thin wrapper will force you to learn opengl as soon as you need to do any transformation and that will take you some time
jzy3d is a higher level api but the tutorial is not free

noexcept throw
Pattern(s): 1	
noexcept allows for more efficient code generation in that it does not have to perform rtti on throw exceptions instead if an exception is throw from a call-frame underneath a noexcept-declared function std terminate is called short-circuiting the crazy std unexpected machinery specified by the 98 standard

git-svn svn2git
Pattern(s): 1	
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
so if your timeout is set higher than 995ms google-chrome will ignore your code and puke on your nice clean empty console that you worked hard to keep clean
firefox is not much better and there are unreliable requests that just timeout for well beyond any patience i have and in doing so ignore the ontimeout handler

dplyr stringr

range minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
for example in kinect an object has to be minimum 0.5m meters away to detect depth of any object
thus kinect v2 could be useful if the range is between 0.5m to 5m though the range is higher for this device

pop-up dialog
Pattern(s): 0	
if you are asking for the reason of that i believe that simply pop-up aren t intended and deeply tested for a lot of interactive content but just for small hints or small navigation menues
if you need to present to the user a lot of interactive content imho a page with the dialog option is a better choice

setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 1	
keep in mind that using setinterval is less efficient for this case then using settimeout which doesn t require comparing times at all as it schedules the alarm to occur at a particular time as setinterval will use more processor cycles to both schedule a check and then to compare the times

jar war
Pattern(s): 0	
weblogic 12c has additional libraries bundled and therefore an exception might be thrown because the jar contains older version of the same library and some classes methods might not be present in that jar
the workaround is to deploy ear that packages your war file and specifying the preferred libraries

multiplying division
Pattern(s): 0	0	
repeated add sub is normally a terrible way to multiplying divide but you want to loop that many times anyway so you use that as the loop counter
this is called a strength reduction optimization because division is stronger slower more expensive than subtraction

division addition
Pattern(s): 1	
i think division by a power of 10 other than 10 9 would be somewhat cheap but would require an actual division on each limb and propagating the remainder to the next limb
extended-precision addition is somewhat more expensive this way than with binary limbs because i have to generate the carry-out manually with a compare unsigned comparison

int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
you need to make sure the second input constraint is smaller than the alphabet - this is implemented by having the condition on the chars for loops as the minimum between the input l and the size of the alphabet
you don t ensure the third int is greater than the previous two - this can be implemented by starting the third loop from the maximum of the previous two

disk ram
Pattern(s): 1	
in client-server model and in computing in general we try to stay away from i o if possible and i o is everything that is not cpu including registers and ram

division subtraction
Pattern(s): 0	
similar to sam westrick s definition number of times you can subtract n2 from n1 without going negative you could also do integer division with addition and greater-than using the definition number of times you can add n2 to integer division before integer division is greater than n1 .
addition might seem like a conceptually simpler thing than subtraction

children parent
Pattern(s): 0	
as stated in my comment a dictionary where each key contains the children seems like a more reasonable idea
to achieve this we can loop through each element in your list which i renamed to l as to not override the built-in list function and append this value to the lists of all its parent in a dictionary d

union distinct
Pattern(s): 0	
the only records having a class_id in the class_fee table would be 10

the performance of a normal for-loop is slightly better because there is no function call for each element involved
despite of this this is recommended to avoid for loops when this can be written as a foreach statement



49164774
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 0	
objects can behave like dictionary because javasript is dynamically typed and there hasn t been a good alternative until now but t really aren t meant to be
the new map functionality is much nicer because it has the expected get set has delete methods you would expect while also accepting any type for the keys instead of just strings

x86 64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
all processors since the opteron in 2003 and the intel pentium 4 prescott the latter editions has 64bit instruction set and will all run 64bit windows
thus as long a msft continues to support 32 bit architecture x86 is the safer option although x64 would probably still work

Pattern(s): 0	
found a similar issue 349 on tensorflow s github and it is very probable that you are running out of memory
you are running out of memory suggest adding the argument --jobs 1 --local_resources 2048 .5 1.0 so that bazel spawns no more than one compiler process at a time and limits system resource usage
