firefox	safari
mode has been 100 correct emulating ie7 before release confirm that opera safari and chrome are still correct
these 3 are almost always correct provided firefox works

super	implements
i am getting really confused with cursors and am not sure if i need cursors and i m not sure what kind of adapter to implements baseadapter simpleadapter etc so i guess i m looking for three things the activity the adapter and the layout.xml just trying to figure this android stuff out definitely a noob here
i have a web service that returns a super simple list of objects myobject data webservicecall
myobject has 1 field i want to display name how can i turn this into an activity that lists just the name of these objects in a scrollable listactivity on android

profiling	debugging
it s sort of the de-facto standard php debugging and profiling tool
wincachegrind can crunch the profiling output
it s a bit buggy but it does the job

hide	show	hide	show
directly to the right - using the position utility of jquery ui the first time you hit the show the div button it works
also the hide the div works
then when i click to show the div again it appears to the right of where it is supposed to be

2688335
daemons	systemd
it s a job queue systemd based on rabbitmq which is yet another queuing server with excellent reviews
as far as creating a daemons in python there are a number of options
you can look at this page on activestate which is a good start

2688335
python-daemon	daemons
you can look at this page on activestate which is a good start
better yet you can use python-daemon to do it all for you
but if you use one of the above options or beanstalkd as recommended by mczepiel you probably won t have to make your process run as a daemons

2688348
junit	easymock
this also has the benefit that any bug in getcustomer does not fail the test for auditcustomers
they are not the same thing junit is a xunit testing framework - it has a test runner that loops over your test suites executes each automated unit test and records the results
easymock is a mock-object framework

2688388
button	checkbox
i have a page with a list of inputs as checkbox
i want to send values of selected button to a servlet using ajax jquery
in the servlet i want to extract these values and use them

2688411
free	malloc
when you call malloc the heap manager allocates a slightly bigger block stores service data at the beginning and returns an offset pointer
smth like then free will try to access that data by offsetting the passed pointer but if the pointer is to an automatic variable whatever data will be located where it expects to find service data
hence undefined behavior

2688480
public	protected
if you d make protected that wouldn t be possible
the thing that s weird is that you have a setter but are leaving the property public
assuming there s no __get magic going on. you usually want to use getters setters to get more control over what can be assigned to a property and what can t

2688522
memset	calloc	memset	malloc
most memset implementations for modern processors look kind of like this so you can see memset is very fast and you re not really going to get anything better for large blocks of memory
the fact that memset is zeroing memory that is already zeroed does mean that the memory gets zeroed twice but that only explains a 2x performance difference
the performance difference here is much larger i measured more than three orders of magnitude on my system between malloc +memset and calloc

2688584
clsid	shellexecuteex
to execute regsvr32.exe from code for more info on regsvr32.exe refer - - for more info on shellexecuteex refer - goodluck
regsvr32.exe if you ll check the registry hkcr clsid guidinquestion you can determine if the ocx is registered
to determine the guid for your ocx open the ocx with oleview.exe program-files visual-studio tools you will see something like - generated .idl file by the ole com object viewer typelib filename comdlg32.ocx uuid f9043c88-f6f2-101a-a3c9-08002b2f49fb version 1.2 helpstring microsoft common dialog control 6.0 sp3 helpfile cmdlg98.chm helpcontext 0x00030d40 check if the guid you obtained for your ocx exists in the registry

2688638
int	chars
initialize integer somehow chars bytes chars val
int len sizeof int
that said the best way to manipulate the bytes of an integer is to do bitwise operations

2688668
python-daemon	daemons
once i ve completed the process i ve made some adjustments to allow running it as a daemons mostly storing the standard output to a file to allow easy logging and then create a bash script that launch a start-stop-daemon command
i ve followed more or less this schema i discovered python-daemon just about one day late so after the work is done it makes no sense revisiting it but maybe it makes more sense for a python project


2688693
trie	tree
but if you want to get the first n children from a substree then a trie is the best choice because you simply visit less nodes than in a b+ tree scenario
the most popular task which is well-handled by a trie is a word prefix completion


2688789
uiview	subviews
what i am trying to achieve is to be able to zoom the uiimageview while keeping the semitransparent view static and not zoomed
if i add the semitransparent uiview on top of the uiimageview which is added to the uiscrollview everything zooms
however if i add both as subviews to the base uiview the touches only get tracked is the semitransparent uiview since its the last one added

2688789
uiview	subviews
however if i add both as subviews to the base uiview the touches only get tracked is the semitransparent uiview since its the last one added
i do need control to reside first at the semitransparent uiview for the touches since i may want to resize the semitransparent view
however i d like to pass control of the touches to the uiscrollview if two fingers are used

2688863
sorting	filtering
you should however use this together with some search result so it is already filtering based on some user input
to you the sortby in the same way seam-gen generates sorting for you you need to generate the complete list and not a part of the list as the entityframework of seam does it
ie now if you just for testing try to use this list in your sortby you will se it will work as you except

2688878
superclass	subclassing

i have a package with jaxb annotated classes with an abstract superclass
i want to use this superclass in web service interface so i can pass any of subclassing as a parameter

2688976
trie	tree
if your range is expressed as all words beginning by then a trie is the right choice i d say
on the other hand trie are not meant for requests like all words between xx and zz
note that the branching factor of the b+ tree affects its performance the number of intermediary nodes

2688976
trie	tree
therefore it means only 5 pointer dereferencing for going from the root to the leaf
it s more cache-friendly than a trie
finally b+ tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity

2689793
firefox	safari
the strangest thing with this is that it is working on ie6 7 8 chrome safari and firefox 3.6
here is a test page so you can see how it is marked up firefox 3.5.9 input text issue i can fix the issue for ff3.5.9 by adding padding-bottom 15px but this then puts the other browsers out of action
seems like such a minor issue but i just can t find a fix for it and i am not really into having to absolute position the inputs as that seems too hacky

2690043
int	double
it strikes me as horrendously bad practice to create a method that takes a double if it doesn t handle fractional values
or at least take an int so it s transparent to callers
edit just to further emphasise the point addseconds 1.5

2690143
put	get
i m trying to construct an ant build.xml file to streamline my build process but i m having troubles with the inclusion of the hibernate3.jar inside the final jar-file
if i run the ant script i manage to include all my library jars and they are put in the final jar-file s root
when i run the jar-file i get a java.lang.noclassdeffounderror org hibernate session error

2690202
lxml	elementtree
the python stdlib has a few decent implementations for working with xml dom parser sax parser and a tree builder called elementtree but more advanced xml requires a third party library
i ve used 4xslt and now defer to lxml when i need to do some real xml work in python


2690203
pop-up	dialog
from time to time i need to show dialog pop-up window to get a user response back cancel ok and other kinds of asynchronous user feedback while locking the background for interactivity
i need some management for my pop-up all pop-up notifications should be stacked up so that if two or more pop-up messages are initiated at the same time i show them one by one
should i employ a proxy to manage my pop-up sounds unreasonable

2690211
boost	stl
recalling that boost program_options variables_map derives from you can do perfectly legal stl map processing including an insert.
namespace po boost program_options
po variables_map vm

2690307
ilist	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
it is an implementation of ilist t and works by populating a private list with all results from the specified iqueryable t
the initialization occurs the first time you access any of the ilist t members
example usage would be the system.lazy t class works with any type and is not limited to iqueryable t

2690364
geocoding	geocode	geocoding	geocode	cllocationmanager	mkplacemark	cllocationmanager	mkplacemark	cllocationmanager	mkreversegeocoder
if request succeeds geocode s delegate will receive mkplacemark object with address info
a get your current gps coordinates you need to use cllocationmanager for that you may need to store manager to release it when it no longer will be needed - then your delegate object will be able to receive messages when gps location updates or fails to do that b transform them into a real address after you have gps coordinate of tour location you can create mkreversegeocoder object to query google reverse geocoding
if request succeeds geocode s delegate will receive mkplacemark object with address info

2690455
haskell	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
it seems in very strict fp like haskell and ocaml this is not possible
particularly haskell
the only thing i have seen is doing some sort of preprocessing or meta-programming ocaml

2690455
haskell	ocaml
the only thing i have seen is doing some sort of preprocessing or meta-programming ocaml
in other words you have to do lots of boring work to turn a data type in haskell into a json xml db row object and back again into a data object


2690673
int	double	int	chars
you can t use gettype because you may get string type of decimal writed in string
you must try to convert it in specified order check is double if double this may be a int you must convert and compare this values
if not this is chars if lenght is 1

2690761
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
it works somewhat like this overflow is in this case what happens when i add 1 to 9 subtract 10 from 10 add 1 to overflow overflow gets added to the next digit so think of how two numbers are stored like those 0 | 1 | 2 --------- a 2 - - b 0 0 1 the above represents the digits of the bigints 2 a and 100 b . - means uninitialized digits they aren t accessed
so adding the above number works fine start at 0 add 2 + 0 go to 1 add 0 go to 2 add 1 but when i want to do multiplication with the above structure my program ends up doing the following start at 0 multiplying 2 with 0 eek go to 1 .
i don t want to do any array moving flipping - i need performance

2690800
short	base
the 10 i is achieved by offseting the destination indices since bigint is in base 10
why are you using short to store digits in the a char would suffice you re thinking incorrectly about the multiplication
in the case of multiplication you need a double for loop that multiplies b with each digit in a and sums them up shifted with the correct power of ten

2690803
jstl	taglib
do it in the jsp
you can use jstl to control the page flow in jsp page
just drop jstl-1.2.jar in web-inf lib and declare the taglib as per the aforelinked tld documentation

2690988
multiplying	multiplication
i don t know what your platform is but in case of x86 for example you can use 32 bit ints and hardware support for giving 64 bit result of 32 bit multiplication
andreas is right that you have to multiplying one number by each digit of the other and sum the results accordingly
it is better to multiplying a longer number by digits of the shorter one i think

2691047
postgresql	mysql
edit mysql doesn t support xml nor cte s nor windowing functions
postgresql has support for xml cte s windowing functions etc
etc

2691187
margin	text-align
will work when you give the div margin left and right value of auto
margin 0 auto is a shorthand for margin 0 auto 0 auto top right bottom left
note the text is also centered inside the inner div if you want it to remain on the left side just specify text-align left

2691368
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi

i ve been reviewing the supporting multiple screens documentation on the android and i just need some additional clarification.
it s my understanding that designing three unique interfaces ldpi mdpi and hdpi would be the best way to go about supporting all the potential android screens with minimal scaling distortion

2691549
put	get
i have been trying to get it working with toggleclass
i simply put in the toggleclass statement so the code looks like so this works to some extend
the classes toggle just fine but the rest of the code only works the first time it is run

2691567
trie	tree
tries facilitate longest-prefix matching helping to find the key sharing the longest possible prefix of characters all unique
from your description i m not entirely sure if it could fit in your design but one way you could improve on memory usage without suffering a huge performance penalty is by using a trie
advantages relative to binary search tree the following are the main advantages of tries over binary search tree bsts looking up keys is faster

2691891
post	put
post updates a resource adds a subsidiary resource or causes a change
a post is not idempotent in the way that x++ is not idempotent
by this argument put is for creating when you know the url of the thing you will create

2691891
post	put	post	put
by this argument put is for creating when you know the url of the thing you will create
post can be used to create when you know the url of the factory or manager for the category of things you want to create
so post expense-report or put expense-report 10929

2691905
cells	tablecell
i want to add space between cells in tablecell something the equivalent of i am not looking for cellpadding or cellspacing because they both add space between the left cells border and the left table border wall
i want to add space between two cells not the table and the cells


2692369
16-bit	64bit	16-bit	64bit
the visual studio 2010 professional implementation of 64bit multiplication on a 32-bit processor compiled in release mode is as you can see it s a lot slower than normal multiplication
same way 32-bit arithmetic worked on 16-bit systems
in this case it uses 2 32-bit memory addresses to form a 64bit number together

2692369
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
in this case it uses 2 32-bit memory addresses to form a 64-bit number together
addition subtraction is easy you do it by parts the only gotcha is taking the carry-over from the lower part to the higher part
for multiplication division it s harder ie more instructions

2692559
int	chars	int	chars
since you re trying to capitalize a chars you need to dereference the pointer
there is not a built-in conversion from to int which is why the error occurs
since you re trying to capitalize a chars you need to dereference the pointer

2692607
put	get
edit yes the cleanest way to get rid of the warning is to use a protocol
just put this in a separate .h file protocol switchingdelegate - void didpressbuttontoswapview
end include this .h in the uinavcontroller header and say the uinavcontroller implements the protocol implement the method in the implementation you don t need anything more in the interface

2693049
x86	64bit
what do you want to do with 64bit values in your application
keys are redirected for important reason to not break behavior of x86 applications
for example clsid is used by com to find proper implementation for a given interface

2693227
agile	metrics	agile	sprint
for example a class with only getters and setters
2 from 1 you just mentioned code metrics but judging from your question about velocity you are interested on metrics on all the creation process so i would list some velocity the classic one and if used well it can enhance quite well an agile team performance since you will know what your team can really do on a fixed time
burn up and burn down charts they can give you a good notion about how the team is performing during the interaction sprint there are some articles on infoq about this

2693284
put	get
remember those magical arrays are created by php before your code executes and then are never touched again by php s internals
yo dude put it in a script fire it up in a browser
this is what you ll get before get yo dude request yo dude after get yo haha it s not the same anymore request yo dude notice that _request has not auto-updated with your new value

2693366
versioning	upgrade
the following are guidelines i provide to the team im currently working with cache your selectors try use id s instead of classes eg qualify your classes with the type of element eg provide a scope for your selector especially if nested inside another selector eg use chaining of selected elements eg there are also non-selector based optimisations such as upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery
each release seems to bring more performance enhancements make sure you are using the minified versioning of jquery
minify your own jquery code google closure compiler is the best imho beware of poorly written third party plug-ins move your jquery script tags including jquery to the bottom of the page - this gives a faster page load time

2693368
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
you are welcome to catch them well some of them but the compiler won t make you do it. unchecked-exception fall into two categories those that extend runtimeexception and those that extend error
i realize that i said earlier that classes inheriting from class exception are checked exceptions but that s only half true the whole truth is that classes in the exception hierarchy other than those in the runtimeexception sub-hierarchy are checked exceptions
exceptions that extend runtimeexception represent errors that you may want to handle although you re not required to

2693395
subclass	superclass
errors are intended to represent problems that the program cannot deal with such as running out of memory
from the javadoc an error is a subclass of throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch
runtimeexception is the superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown during the normal operation of the java virtual machine

2693499
sequence	permutation
since nodes are unique the sets of nodes contained anywhere within c and d are disjoint and neither contains a or b
functions pre and post generate ordered sequence of the form pre t a b pre c pre d post t post c b post d a where the function applied to a vector is defined to be the concatenation of the sequence resulting from applying the function to each element in turn
now consider the cases if a is empty the output of both functions is the empty sequence if b is empty the output of both functions is just a if c and d are empty pre t a b and post t b a if just c is empty pre t a b d and post t b d a where the primes indicate some permutation of the nodes contained within d if just d is empty pre t a b c and post t c b a if none are empty pre t a b c d and post t c b d a in all cases we can unambiguously partition the members of the two output sequence into the appropriate subsequences by using a and b if present as delimiters

2693600
maven	pom.xml
instead of looking for an algorithm to troubleshoot your non repeatable builds fix the root cause make them repeatable by following good practices maven builds are 100 repeatable if you use it right use the same version of maven on all machines of a given project distribute a packaged version use the same version of the jdk at least the same version for a given project lock down plugins versions in your poms for build reproducibility enforce the above rules using the maven enforcer plugin use a corporate repository and only the corporate repository avoid making builds non portable by adding non user specific things in .m2 settings.xml put everything under version control the effective pom.xml should be identical on all machines run clean builds on a build machine the reference i ve used maven in organizations with hundreds of developers without experiencing the problems you re describing
actually and i m sorry to say that the problems you are facing are not maven s fault they re just the result of poor development practices i don t mean to be rude but that s true


2693676
free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
this is a bug
according to free 3 ..
free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc . otherwise or if free ptr has already been called before undefined behaviour occurs

2693751
post	get
you can use data of type jsonp to get around this issue
ajaxian provided a post on a workaround that you can hopefully use
it doesn t use jquery but it may help

2693763
oncreate	setcontentview
you should add setcontentview layout
at the end of the oncreate method


2693783
width	height
then skip other white-spaces
read until the next white space convert your buffer to an integer width
then skip other white-spaces read until the next white space convert your buffer to an integer height

2693853
inherited	properties
this was one instance where i found inherited to be a key success point in a project
here is a personal example where i ve made use of inherited to greatly benefit a development situation i needed to develop a asp.net c# form control set which would allow both standard web forms bunch of form fields with submit button as well as a secure version which talks to a web service to submit the information over ssl
because of all of the similarities between the controls and concepts i developed a number of classes basewebcontrol custom base control class that inherits from system.web.ui.webcontrol class part of .net framework has custom properties and methods that are used in our application by all custom controls control state info etc. baseformcontrol inherits from basewebcontrol gaining all of its underlying functionality handles base form functionality such as dynamically adding fieldsets marking required fields adding submit button etc

2694059
instances	transient
when populating the data i grab a string representing the user s current locale and store that along the with localised book title in a new localizedbook object
each localizedbook instances is added to an nsmutableset which represents the one-to-many relationship
since the localised titles are being stored in the localizedbook managed object you can make the title attribute a transient but if you do that you can t use title in a predicate

2694109
post	get
just trying to get you started
mysql won t be able to handle your html form post
you will need to use a server-side language to check for those checkboxes being set and then modify your query with additional conditions

2694207
keystore	jks
if it is then you have what is known as mutual authentication
if the channel that you connect to has been configured with sslcauth required then mutual auth has been enabled and the qmgr must have your application s self-signed cert or a ca root cert that signed your app s cert in its keystore
hopefully whoever set up your jks file will have arranged for this already

2694544
post	get	post	get
as stated in the scroll view programming guide you can get the current scroll position this way
tell the scroll view s content view to post bounds changed notifications then listen for nsviewboundsdidchangenotification
as stated in the scroll view programming guide you can get the current scroll position this way

2694591
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
it uses the comparator or comparable instead
in order to make it work right you must follow the consistency with equals rule the ordering imposed by a comparator c on a set of elements s is said to be consistent with equals if and only if c.compare e1 e2 0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals e2 for every e1 and e2 in s
i guess you are not following this rule you didn t provide the implementation of the compareto method

2694626
strcpy	strncpy
glad to see i m not crazy
also there was no bounds checking on the strcpy
i usually use strncpy to avoid such things

2694658
equals	compareto
you have not overriden object.equals
use override public boolean equals object obj
there is a potential integer overflow error in compareto

2694879
nexus	artifactory	nexus	artifactory
storage is checksum based and identical binaries are stored only once no matter how many times they appear in the repo which makes artifactory more efficient storage-wise
move and copy are also very cheap because of this architecture in nexus there s no rest for move copy - you have to move stuff on the file system then run corrective actions on the repo to let it know content has changed
another important differentiator is artifactory has unique integration with hudson and teamcity for capturing information about deployed artifacts resolved dependencies and environment data associated with build runs which provides full build traceability

2694958
post	get
it turns out it is more confusing than it s worth and you don t get to re-use much
if your code above is anything close to the stuff in your post you really don t want to inherit dict
if it s not try posting your real use case

2694958
inherited	subclassing
if it s not try posting your real use case
here is what you really wanted to know when you inherited dict you are making a new-style class
ishynum is an old-style class because it doesn t inherited object or one of its subclassing

2695000
maven	pom.xml
pom.xml and the persistence.xml which i promise is in the classpath of the target as you may have noticed from some commented code i tried both the hibernate and the j2ee 6 implementation of jpa2.0 however both failed
any hello world maven jpa2 demo that actually runs
thanx in advance

2695015
cpu	processors
the differential in speed between memory and processors continues to rise
the greater the differential the more cycles the cpu can use and still produce a result within a single memory clock cycle or a specified number of memory clock cycles even if that s more than one


2695080
jpa	javax.persistence
pps note that javax.persistence persistence-api jar 1.0 is an api not an implementation it won t do anything by itself i mean it s not a replacement for hibernate eclipselink etc
hibernate entitymanager 3.4.0.ga is not a jpa 2.0 implementation so it won t support the standardized properties in the persistence.xml hence the exception about no jdbc connection being supplied
for jpa 2.0 you need hibernate em 3.5.1-final

2695144
qcombobox	qtablewidget
it s easy for a qtablewidget based table - but i need it for a very large data table
i have a column which when edited should create a qcombobox with the list of choices
the docs seem to suggest i need to write a qabstractitemdelegate and a custom paint function but that seems overkill to simply pop-up a standard qcombobox in qt editrole

2695291
put	get
for example with this if you get a token with a matching signature you know you generated it
that s not much help in itself but then you can put extra things in the token other than the randomness for example user id now each form submission has to be authorised by the same user who picked up the form which pretty much defeats csrf
another thing it s a good idea to put in a token is an expiry time so that a momentary client compromise or mitm attack doesn t leak a token that ll work for that user forever and a value that is changes on password resets so that changing password invalidates existing tokens

2695383
hash	md5
also if you store the password in a recoverable format as in a block cipher like aes or stream cipher like rc4 or an asymmetric cipher like rsa then you are in clear violation of cwe-257
passwords must always be hash using a secure message digest
currently many message digest functions are insecure md4 md5 sha0 and sha1 are all very broken and should never be used for passwords

2695594
curry	first-class
it has closures and first-class functions
using them you can create other functional programming techniques such as partial application curry
let s take an example using sys.puts from node.js to get rid of global side effects we can wrap it in a closure notice that we can t actually do anything with external or foo outside of the scope

2695729
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
copy the code block to a file named pom.xml and run mvn validate to see it work
perhaps you need to think more like ant and less like maven in this case
here is one solution

2695835
addeventlistener	onload
so if something else later overwrites that onload property the previous event handler is no longer used
addeventlistener is a way to register an event handler without overwriting a previous one
it s supported by most browsers other than internet explorer

2695906
junit	testng	junit	jbehave
i imagine junit will not be incorporating this natively any time soon since there is already such a rich set of alternative mock libraries available
when i explain unit testing i like to describe them as a list of phases test setup define and create all the data and objects you need for the tests expectations say what methods and parameters you expect to be executed during the test test the actual behavior method call you want to test assertions statements that make sure the outcome of the test were successful test tear down destroy any side effects that occurred during the test junit is a unit testing framework and provides all but the expectations phase of testing
alternatives in the java space include testng jtest jbehave sort of jdave sort of other language equivalents include php - phpunit ruby - test unit flash - flexunit the concept of mocking is what added the new phase of expectations and since junit saw most of it s major development prior to the mocking movement those features were not incorporated into the core and a set of tools to fill that gap in the java space have opened up

you could use chris pederick s user agent switcher in firefox but you won t get webkit rendering
the best option is probably to use the developer tools in safari and change the browser agent in the develop menu

httpwebrequest with post 2
webclient with uploadfile and uploaddata i get the same 404 error when the posted data is above 28.6 mb
i also tried putting a breakpoint right in the beginning of the receiving handler and debugging

ssl	https
if there are some missing configuration then can anybody inform me
i have gwt ajax code but server side is php not java. now i need to login to server side php server. but i need to connect with ssl
possiblity of solution i am thinking change the http to https php server side lamp or xampp must have ssl support

rtp	sip
you ll find most sip servers out there have some sort of capability in this regard and it s often call nat mangling or similar
a more conventional way to implement call recording would be to capture the rtp packets on the wire and put them together to create an audio file
there are quite a few tools around to do exactly that and it s even inbuilt into wireshark

2696431
sip	sdp
a lot of sip proxy s are forced to mangle the ip addresses in sdp when user agents put private ip addresses in them
you ll find most sip servers out there have some sort of capability in this regard and it s often call nat mangling or similar

firefox	safari
ie chrome safari opera etc
firefox has an error console
usually javascript errors would pop up there

qtreeview	qmodelindex
i m considering stylesheets as an option but have so far been unable to get that to work
if i set the qtreeview s stylesheet i can t figure out how to manually enable states that would keep only the desired rows at a particular state
if i try setting an individual item s stylesheet #modelindex is a valid qmodelindex modelindex.internalpointer .setstylesheet i get a segfault

2696776
width	height
in this example i use also gridresize .
there are some cases where jqgrid calculate the width a little incorrect
mostly i have problems with grid width but in some cases on ie6 also with the height

2696841
cpu	processors
several cpu architectures have multiple stack pointers - even lowly 8-bit processors such as the m6809
and even if the concept is not implemented in the cpu hardware you can easily create multiple stacks in software
a stack pointer is basically simply an index register so you could for example use the ix and iy registers of the z80 to implement multiple stacks

put	get
and this is the new campaign create form - form_for campaign do |f| f.error_messages p f.label name br f.text_field name p f.label client_id client br f.collection_select client_id client.all id name prompt please select the client class client_list now the association method vendor.clients will just list the clients through the campaign join model. if the campaign table is blank there ain t any clients i can get with vendor.clients but as you see in the collection_select in the new campaign form i have to be able to choose the clients that belong to the vendor
so i had to put the client.all call. though it renders the collection select all those clients will be listed though they don t belong to that vendor
if i do create the habtm association it will conflict with each other right

2697263
boost	allocator
different solutions have come up in time and most of them require dynamic allocator of the actual datum boost variant can avoid using dynamically allocated memory for small objects --thanks msalters
pure c approach store type information and a void pointer to memory that has to be interpreted according to the type information usually an enum in c++ you can improve this approach by using classes to simplify the usage but more importantly you can go for more complex solutions and use existing libraries as boost any or boost variant that offer different solutions to the same problem
both boost any and boost variant store the values in dynamically allocated memory usually through a pointer to a virtual class in a hierarchy and with operators that reinterpret down casts to the concrete types

2697266
multiplying	multiplication
your approach will end up even slower than normal long multiplication because of the shear number of multiplication and additions involved
don t limit yourself to working at one base digit at a time when you can multiplying approximately 9 at a time
convert the base10 string to a hugeval and then do operations on it

uilabel	nsstring	uilabel	nsstring
nsstring has several methods for drawing in current context look at nsstring s uikit extension docs for more methods
if you perform custom drawing in your view you must not draw uilabel or another ui element but rather draw text itself
nsstring has several methods for drawing in current context look at nsstring s uikit extension docs for more methods

2697577
client-side	server-side
you need to check server-side too that the user has accepted your terms
to do client-side form checking you will want to use js to override the submit button s action check the data as melaos demonstrates though jquery is not needed and display the comments next to each form element
a bit of a pain really

reflection and il are used under the hood to get the dynamic event subscription working but this is all nicely encapsulated so only code like the above is required to write event tests

firefox	safari
i m wanting to enable the resizing of an image in the browser also within a contenteditable area
firefox and ie already allow this to be done with their inbuilt handles and it works fine
i m wanting to implement something for safari however because it doesn t support this natively

2698010
base	tilde
then you can use we do this for all our website content items script images css
if you use in html the browser takes the given url as base for images that begin with
so in your case you can just ditch the tilde

internationalization	translation	internationalization	localization
one final point - maintaining the localization for future releases might cost substantially more than providing it in the first place
it depends on the quality of the original internationalization work
if everything is implemented correctly then it will be similar to adding support for a new european language - most of the work will be translation and testing

2698109
internationalization	translation
if everything is implemented correctly then it will be similar to adding support for a new european language - most of the work will be translation and testing
however if you ve only tested the software with european languages you might find a lot of problems with your original internationalization work
in particular you might need to consider bi-directional text ligatures joinining the characters rendering characters change shape depending on their position in the word number and date formats formats specialized input methods cultural differences for icons etc file encodings testing if you have custom code that implements software features in a way that isn t fully localizable then you need to budget for fixing this too

if you have manuals help text and other collateral that also needs to be translation then the software cost might not be such a large proportion of the total budget
also if you have plans to perform localization for any far eastern languages japanese chinese korean ... you might consider sharing the cost across those projects since many of the issues will be similar

inherited	properties
we wanted to use fluent nhibernate and it can be done using fluent as follows and when creating the session factory we use this new class as follows finally you need to set the adonet.batch_size properties to 1 to ensure that your new batcher class is used
in fluent nhibernate this is done using the adonetbatchsize method in a class that inherited from persistenceconfiguration see the sybaseconfiguration class constructor above for an example of this


2698255
textview	imageview
in each main row the text are textviews the image is an imageview and they are positioned probably via a relativelayout
the header rows are a textview
the rows are intermingled via some sort of adapter like for any listview

google-chrome	firefox
in addition the html page contains the following lines of code using these techniques firefox and ie always seem to grab the latest swf file every time
google-chrome however never gets the latest swf file - the only way to get the update is to hit shift+refresh in google-chrome


2698844
folder	directory
if you can at least be confident that it s in the program files folder this should give you what you need
this will give you back a string array of the paths to all files that have that name within the program files folder
if you can t assume that it s in program files then you can substitute any directory

2698882
x86	64bit
the problem with that is that if you tested your application on 32-bit windows say then it could break if you load 32-bit dlls and tried to run on 64bit windows
in vs2010 they defaulted all executable projects to be x86 that is 32-bit by default which for the most part mitigates the problem


2698921

paypal ipn seems to be easy to integrate and it works on my localhost
now the problem is that the amount and the business name are passed to paypal using post data
i know it s very dangerous to put it that way but i am not sure what are the alternatives

2698941
x86	64bit
this library is referenced by various other projects including a wcf web service hosted in iis
the web service is compiled using the x86 option and everything works fine on a 32-bit machine
however on our 64bit server the service fails when calling into the 32-bit delphi library

2698958
for-loop	loops
but whether or not you should is an entirely different question
the for-loop is more readable in this scenario and is definitely the convention you ll find used within virtually every language that has looping directives
if you use the while loops people are going to wonder why you didn t use a for-loop

2698960
versioning	upgrade
i just want to note for any readers that paramiko 1.7.4 has been previously known to be stable with fabric 0.9 but in the last week or two several users have started exhibiting this or similar problems disconnect timeouts so i m guessing some other component python upgrade or remote server package upgrade or something is coming into play that is tipping off a bug in 1.7.4
i will be checking out the changelogs for paramiko 1.7.5 1.7.6 and gathering more info about peoples platforms python versioning etc to try and see if a pattern emerges
edit newly created redmine ticket for this issue is here

i however have a lot of images need to ocr
frequent disk write and remove is inevitable and of course the performance hit
the only choice i could think about is changing the wrapper class and point the temp file to ram disk which bring this problem up

2699569
dictionary	map
if i did want something that worked a little more like std map i d probably use a database
this is generally what i do if stuff i want to store in a dictionary or for that matter stuff i store in a list gets too big for me to feel comfortable storing in memory
python has sqlite3 in the stdlib and drivers for all other major databases available

inherited	properties
in a lot of the fnh examples you see entity is a simple base class that usually just contains the id properties required by the classes being mapped
all the other classes you wish to map can then inherited from entity
this allows you to do things like change your id type from int to guid in a single place etc

2699752
uiview	uiwindow
so the application is created and a uiwindow is alloc d
a single viewcontroller is then alloc d which makes and adds its own blank self.view to which the other uiview representing the different game states are attached
interestingly enough this error is does not happen on the simulator but happens consistently on the device

2700053
folder	directory
be sure to save any per user instance data in their appdata folder roaming if it should follow them from computer to computer or local if its a cache or local to taht machine only
if you need to share settings between users use the c programdata folder with the appropriate permissions
a program shouldn t try to store settings in its installation directory

2700121
division	multiplication
lots of bits interact here--high middle and low
that is the purpose of the division step it cuts off the bottom chunk of the result where there was not as much interaction
the top chunk is not usually chopped off because the computer drops the upper bits when the multiplication do not fit into a machine word any more

if you re willing to give up properties semantics you could do this
if inherited isn t appropriate and you want to reuse code you have to use either composition probably overkill for the simple case you ve described or extension methods
extension methods are a great way to simulate multiple inherited in c# though there are no extension properties maybe someday says eric lippert

phpunit	simpletest
simpletest - the answers to that question notably gordon s managed to convince me of phpunit
unit testing frameworks like phpunit are built more for testing the functionality of separate logical units classes not so much the behaviour of entire live sites

freertos	ecos
ecos is great in that it has a large ecosystem of add-on features and device support that rivals most commercial offerings
however something like freertos are likely to be easier to bring-up but provide no more than a thread scheduler and inter-process communication mechanisms
stuff like a file system or tcp ip need to be sourced from third-parties although there equally small and free solutions suitable for embedded systems for that too

2701271
switching	screens
modal windows were designed to obtain information or user action that the underlying application requires to continue
non-modal windows allow the user to switching back and forth between the window and the underlying application
a good use for a non-modal window might be screens help or a tutorial where the user needs a reference tool and access to the underlying application

2701545
try-catch	exception-handling
in fact it s likely that the _memorystream variable is itself the culprit - if it s null then invoking a call on it would raise that exact exception-handling
the application is blowing up on a line inside of a try-catch block
shouldn t it just be failing silently

2701556
junit	testng
in our case we were happy with web driver and setup method of junit for us so we didn t move to testng

inherited	subclassing
the subclassing should not extend the other class
it s best to prefer composition over inherited

screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
apps today should be written to support different screens in which case the px and dp units will behave as desired on all screens
if your app does not say it supports densities then android will run in compatibility mode where it makes the screens look like an mdpi screens scaling all coordinates and drawing to match the real screens density
running in an hdpi screens like droid this is a 1.5x scaling so every other pixel will be mapped to two pixels on the screens

2702235
timeit	itertools
obviously the only way to check is to benchmark -- save in aaa.py and see... so clearly itertools is faster here -- benchmark with your own data to verify
btw i find timeit much more usable from the command line so that s how i always use it -- it then runs the right order of magnitude of loops for the kind of speeds you re specifically trying to measure be those 10 100 1000 and so on -- here to distinguish a microsecond and a half of difference a hundred thousand loops is about right


2702392
junit	testng
spring test has a very nice approach with test execution listeners which can prepare your test instances
this is somewhat similar to junit rules

range	infinity
we are now given some constraints in the form of a list of x-values and for each x-value a pair of y-values that the function must lie between. we can represent that as a list of x ymin ymax triples such as graphically that looks like this constraints on a cdf we now seek a curve that respects those constraints. for example fitted cdf let s first try a simple interpolation through the midpoints of the constraints plotted f looks like this interpolated cdf that function is not surjective
also we d like it to be smoother. we can increase the interpolation order but now it violates the constraint that its range is 0 1 interpolated cdf with higher interpolation order the goal then is to find the smoothest function that satisfies the constraints non-decreasing
tends to 0 as x approaches negative infinity and tends to 1 as x approaches infinity

inherited	properties
since in python we have properties we would not need an api change in that instance so we can safely avoid the boilerplate and cruft of setters and getters
it wouldn t hurt to inherited numbers.rational python 2.6 and up which lets your class automatically do several things numbers are expected to
you will have to implement everything it needs you to but then it will automatically make a lot more work

sorry if this isn t what you re looking for but the result you want has the li always showing with its child ol being hidden test 1 2 3 another test cool test 1 2 but your css hide the li elements for some reason
if you instead hid the ol elements you could simply do a filter and show them as needed

cdf	splines
criteria 1 is somewhat satisfied though there certainly could exist smoother solutions
i don t think you ve specified enough criteria to make the desired cdf unique
if the only criteria that must hold is ol li cdf must be fairly smooth see below li cdf must be non-decreasing li cdf must pass through the error bar y-intervals li cdf must tend toward 0 as x -- -infinity li cdf must tend toward 1 as x -- infinity. ol then perhaps you could use monotone cubic interpolation . this will give you a c 2 twice continously differentiable function which unlike cubic splines is guaranteed to be monotone when given monotone data

2702931
interpolation	splines
if the only criteria that must hold is ol li cdf must be fairly smooth see below li cdf must be non-decreasing li cdf must pass through the error bar y-intervals li cdf must tend toward 0 as x -- -infinity li cdf must tend toward 1 as x -- infinity. ol then perhaps you could use monotone cubic interpolation . this will give you a c 2 twice continously differentiable function which unlike cubic splines is guaranteed to be monotone when given monotone data
this leaves open the question exactly what data should you use to generate the monotone cubic interpolation
if not you might as well make some arbitrary choice to guarantee that the points you select are monotonically increasing because the criteria does not force our solution to be unique

drive	createfile	createfile	deviceiocontrol
to ensure data integrity be sure to become familiar with deviceiocontrol and how other apis behave differently with a direct access handle as opposed to a file system handle
this page seems to have some relevant information on the subject you can open a physical or logical drive using the createfile application programming interface api with these device names provided that you have the appropriate access rights to the drive that is you must be an administrator
you must use both the createfile file_share_read and file_share_write flags to gain access to the drive

2703437
drive	createfile
you must use both the createfile file_share_read and file_share_write flags to gain access to the drive
once the logical or physical drive has been opened you can then perform direct i o to the data on the entire drive
when performing direct disk i o you must seek read and write in multiples of sector sizes of the device and on sector boundaries

so i am messing around with simple layouts here and they work fine in my latest versions of firefox safari google-chrome and opera but ie6 is basically saying if you haven t set a width or height on me i m assuming it s zero

maven	pom.xml
once you configure your development environment you will be grateful maven does the work and you can almost forget about dependency management
to build the jdeveloper ide files we are using the maven jdev plugin so mvn jdev jdev would build generate our project files and set up dependencies on libraries and among them to compile properly
updated of course you need to refer to adf libraries in your pom.xml files

2703922
versioning	upgrade
if you go with the maven approach it will take you some time to build your local repo at first but once that s done it s very easy to maintain and the whole cycle development build test packaging and deployment will be simpler having a more consistent configuration
it s true that in a future you ll have to update to later adf versioning but as your repository structure will already be defined it should be something fast
for future upgrade i d recommend to keep the adf version as a property on the top pom that will allow you to switch faster to a new version

google-chrome	firefox	versioning	upgrade
what are the reasons a business cannot upgrade
and b somebody must have figured out how to install google-chrome or firefox on ancient versioning of windows by now
another reason is roi

versioning	upgrade
they could upgrade but they won t beacuse it costs too much
usually because they have some old web application that doesn t work with newer versioning of ie and that is critical for their work
they could use a different brand of browser but usually they don t have the computer skills to use multiple browsers

nsmenu	nspopupbuttoncell
the second column is an nspopupbuttoncell which is supposed to allow the user to pick a handler for the given document type think of xcode s file types preference pane and you re pretty much there
i can generate an nsmenu for a given item in the tree populated with options based upon the launch services database entries for the uti complete with the relevant application icon and and so on
in fact the menu itself works wonderfully populated by way of nspopupbuttoncellwillpopupnotification

multiplying	modulo	multiplying	modulo
i get the concept but in an example they provide a polynomial which we will represent as the array has an inverse g of so that when we multiply them and reduce the result modulo 3 we get 1 however when i use the ntru algorithm for multiplying and reducing them i get -2
here is my algorithm for multiplying them written in java it basicall taken in polynomial a and multiplies it b resturns teh result in c n specifies the degree of the polynomials+1 in teh example above n 11
and m is the reuction modulo in teh exampel above 3

post	put
but preparing the post directly is always possible since the almost-rest api is documented as the protocol underlying all language-specific apis
while the docs call it uploading everything boils down to sending an appropriately formatted http post request so of course it can actually be a new creation rather than an actual upload of an otherwise existing file
creation through post requests is similar to what s normally described as a rest api though in real rest you d typically use a put request instead of course

actionscript	haxe
i assume there is no easy way to get the flash sdk has to build without an ide to read and do something useful with a .js file
my only thought is that i could write a code-generator that takes the .js file and places it in an actionscript wrapper
just to pre-empt an obvious answer i know about cross-platform languages like haxe

folder	directory
basically i have a project with the following folder structure project root directory which contains the .sln file etc. project myproj contains the code project myprojtest the test folder project testresults now with this project i need to have a common folder where i can stick a bunch of files for use with the application without having to copy the files to multiple locations etc
ideally i would like to have the folder as project resourcesfolder so that both the code folder and test folder can access it
i ve tried application.startuppath environment.getcurrentdirectory but they both just return the current folder which is not what i want

2705051
opencv	emgucv
in real applications you almost always need to filter the image to get rid of artifacts induced by imperfect image captures
a common library used for this kind of bit whacking is opencv it takes advantage of dedicated cpu instructions available to make this fast
there are several .net wrappers available for it emgucv is one of them

2705224
mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
to detect that this has happened from the outer div check the target property of the event the usual problem with mouseout is you get it when the pointer moves out of the parent even if it s only moving in to the child
you can detect this case manually by looking up the ancestor list of the element the mouse is moving into this is the mousein mouseout model it is only interested about which element is the mouse s immediate parent
what you more often want is the mouseenter mouseleave model which considers element trees as a whole so you d only get mouseleave when the pointer was leaving the element-or-its-descendants and not moving directly into the element-or-its-descendants

2705294
installation	upgrade
is it even possible
i want to use mercurial to capture changes made to the vanilla installation of a piece of software we use
everytime we upgrade the software we need to manually edit the various configuration files and add 3rd party libraries that we use in the current version of the software

put	get
so your connection string is trying to log in without any credentials which is why you get that error message
to fix it you need to put back to use the current windows user identity or you need to put in a specific user name and password
also reading your comments please note the difference between an un-enecrypted connection string and sending a password over clear text an encrypted connection string is useful when you are storing credential information such as a password in your web.config file

2705536
inherited	properties
it may also be a foreign key to some lookup table in your database identifying which numbers correspond to which types not table names just descriptions
the other way to do this is multiple-table inherited which is better for your database but not as easy to map in code
you do this by having a base table which defines some common properties of all the objects - perhaps just an id and a name - and all of your specific tables person etc. use the base id as a unique foreign key usually also the primary key

firefox	safari
the below code generally works in firefox safari and ie8 see here for chrome woes

mbunit	nunit
but the salient issue here is that nunit tests should not have sequential stipulations or dependencies
if you need to have tests depend on other tests use mbunit
this is an example of fixture dependency using the dependsonattribute

2706140
implements	extends
if you were thinking in object oriented terms you might be asking questions such as should employee and customer share a common person base class that defines name age and address properties which employee can inherit and extends by adding a salary property and customer could extends by adding a creditcard property
maybe both your employee and customer business objects will implements an istoreable interface that defines methods which are called when you want to save load them to from a database
perhaps you would use a customerpresenter class that maintains a reference to a customer object and manages the way that it is displayed by the customerdetailsform for editing

2706156
put	get
worker code is something like that code is really simple just to show a place where i have my problem it works all smothly accept for 100 cpu utilization because of while loop being cycling all over again if i have my clients doing send- receive- disconnect routine it s not that painful but if i try to keep alive doing send- receive- send- receive all over again it really eats up all cpu
so my first idea was to put a sleep there i check if all sockets have their data send and then putting thread.sleep in point2 just for 10ms but this 10ms later on produces a huge delay of that 10ms when i want to receive next command from client socket
what can be done so my processor won t get 100 utilization and my server to react on something appear in client socket as soon as possible

so far i have this code however at the top for loop where it does not use the range function with the cells i can only do this for cells a1 d9 and if i use the second for loop with the range i get the value 9 appearing in every cell from a1 to d9

2706653
stdout	fflush
when you run a compiled haskell program ghc stores output in the buffer and only periodically fflush it to the screen
it does so if a the buffer is too full b if a newline is printed or c if you call hflush stdout
the other problem you may be seeing is that getchar may not fire until a newline is read but then the newline is in your input stream

2706763
textarea	textbox
here is the html structure when the user clicks focuses on the chat box i want the textbox to be automatically focused
i have this onfocus handler on the chat box this works but the problem is that in firefox this makes it impossible to select text in the messages div since when you try to click on it the focus shifts to the textarea
semi-related issues in chrome textarea.focus doesn t seem to shift the keyboard focus to the textarea

mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout
you could also listen for the mouseout event if you want the div to disappear when the mouseleave the container div
if the divs are hidden they will never trigger the mouseover event
you will have to listen to the event of some other unhidden element

2707104
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout
you will have to listen to the event of some other unhidden element
you can consider wrapping your hidden divs into container divs that remain visible and then act on the mouseover event of these containers
you could also listen for the mouseout event if you want the div to disappear when the mouseleave the container div

for-loop	loops
could it be that because literals are the only thing being multiplied the java compiler is optimizing out the multiplication and using a precomputed literal
i just noticed something concerning for-loop performance that seems to fly in the face of the recommendations given by the google android team
look at the following code when i run this code i get the following output in logcat i looptest 726 elapsed time recompute loops limit 759 i looptest 726 elapsed time literal loops limit 755 i looptest 726 elapsed time precompute loops limit 1317 as you can see the code that seems to recompute loops limit value on every iteration of loops compares very well to the code that uses a literal value for loops limit

min	max
very basic outline you are given zero to max speed maxv based on number of items in list and a de-acceleration factor
get finger swipe acceleration from device a and length of time it was applied t calculate an initial scroll speed from v min maxv at apply de-acceleration factor to current speed until you reach zero raising list scroll events at a rate proportional to the current scroll speed
perhaps look at kinetic scrolling demo with source

illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
if you think that you can do and have that be useful then you need to step back right now and do some reading on what it means for string to be immutable and what it means that java passes all references by value
for the first option there is an illegalargumentexception that is often used for this purpose so you can use that instead of your own custom exception class
it extends runtimeexception meaning it s an unchecked-exception

there are many many more informations available but only if they were published

nsfilewrapper	nsdocument
as background i m working on an extensible editor that stores the user s documents in a package
this of course required some fun to get around some issues with nsfilewrapper a somewhat sneaky writing and loading process to avoid making nsfilewrappers for every single document within the bundle
the solution i arrived at was to essentially treat my nsdocument subclass as just a shell -- use it to make the folder for the bundle and then pass off writing the actual content of the document to other methods

2708053
subclass	superclass
give the queue object a handler to the ui thread when it s created and make all list modifications using that handler but this seems improper you could use a handler or you could call post on your attached listview
off the cuff i d create a subclass of arrayadapter named threadsafearrayadapter and use it in place of queue
threadsafearrayadapter replaces add insert and remove with ones that have the superclass do its thing on the main application thread via a handler or post

make a usercontrol instead and give it the full chart object and let it render it self name it chart.ascx and put it in your shared view folder

inherited	properties
as a result if you do not set this properties at either the page or the control level the value of the enableviewstate properties determines view-state behavior. see
it is backward compaitable as the default value is inherited
if the parent control has set enableviewstate to false then viewstatemode allows child control to enable it giving much more fine grained control over your viewstate

the resource dictionary xaml i use to style the tabitem of a tabcontrol is given in full here

multiplying	subtract
that s because we have again to check compute pow x n-1 hence t n-1 and multiply the result by x

int	double	int	boolean	int	chars
i have posted some links to explain the difference between the two but here are a list of primitive types byte short chars int long boolean double float which means you are not allowed to make an arraylist of int s like so also you can use your own objects here is my monster object i created here we have a monster object but now in our main.java class we want to keep a record of all our monster s that we create so let s add them to an arraylist i helped my girlfriend s brother with a java game and he had to do something along those lines as well but i hope the example was well demonstrated
without more details as to what the question is exactly asking i am going to answer the title of the question create an array create an arraylist this means create an arraylist of string and int objects
you cannot use int because thats a primitive data types see the link for a list of primitive data types

np-hard	set-cover
if we could build a pangram over a b c...x y z ж alphabet that requires minimum symbols that would be a pangram with minimum words if we remove all ж letters
this proves that the original problem is np-hard but unfortunately we need a reduction to some np-hard problem to reuse its hopefully already known heuristic
set-cover has a greedy heuristic with logarithmic approximation but i don t think it applies to the original problem nature of the set-cover problem requires taking letter-rich long words

haskell	ocaml
and i recommend you structure your code that way mdash
but it doesn t change the fact that many more people call from haskell into c than from c into haskell
likewise for ocaml

2709811
inherited	properties
it lets you set the properties attributes enumerable writable or configurable which can be really useful
with only one level of inherited your example may not let you see the real benefits of object.create
this methods allows you to easily implement differential inherited where objects can directly inherit from other objects

2709856
accessor	properties
the vb.net team really pained about this they decided for a completely different syntax removehandler someobj.test addressof somemethod even the above c# statement is sugar the real code looks like this someobj.test.remove new testdelegate this somemethod
where remove is the accessor function for an event
and this is required to initialize the delegate.target properties

rubygems	rvm
just keep in mind rails 3 works best using ruby 1.9.2 install with rvm by running rvm install ruby-head and is still in beta meaning it isn t terribly stable and should not be used for anything production grade yet
if you re looking to do ruby rails development on mac i d strongly recommend not using the version of ruby rubygems shipped with your mac
what i do recommend is installing homebrew and using that to manage software packages on your mac

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s worth noting that the site you link to uses a large-ish css-sprite to create the same effect but
one way of achieving a similar effect is with the following css and the html demo page over at the animation i m using is the -webkit-transition which is of course limited to working on webkit google-chrome and safari browsers
firefox gets the changed-position but would need js jquery to smooth the transition

2710359
goto	break
all that said it has been noted a nearly infinite number of times that break is almost always the default behavior that you d rather have at the end of every case
historically it s because the case was essentially defining a label also known as the target point of a goto call
the switch statement and its associated cases really just represent a multiway branch with multiple potential entry points into a stream of code

2710567
subclass	superclass
though expect you already knew that. 3 a better way to initialize the fields of a superclass is to pass the arguments to the superclass constructor
for example the reason this approach is better is that the loan class takes responsibility for its initialization and doesn t rely on the various subclass constructors doing the job
if you add an extra field to loan and add the corresponding parameter to the loan constructor the compiler reminds you to modify all of the subclass constructors to provide the initial value in the super constructor chaining

perforce	cvs
that s a very different development model than perforce cvs subversion vss-- take a look at hginit for a tutorial on distributed version control before going this route it will really help
if you re developing alone perforce is free for up to two people and five machines and works very well for a single-developer model
if you don t mind your projects being opensource github implements git servers or for 5 a month you can have 5 projects closed-source

goto	break
the identifier is declared to be the label of the immediately contained statement

identifier statement labels are used with break 14.15 or continue 14.16 statements appearing anywhere within the labeled statement

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
in my testing array.reverse is very slightly faster than a simple for loops
in this test of reversing a 1 000 000 element arrays 1 000 times array.reverse is about 600ms whereas a for-loop is about 800ms
i wouldn t recommend performance as a reason to use array.reverse though

2711121
post	get
just use getattr class webmethodbaseclass def post self methodname getattr self methodname kapow the only caveat is that you have to make sure that only methods intended for use as webmethods can be used thus
the simplest solution imo is to adopt the convention that non-webmethods start with an underscore and have the post method refuse to service such names
if you really want to use decorators try this and get post to check for the existence of the is_webmethod attribute before calling the method

2711405
chunked	transfer-encoding
if you don t know the content-length setting context.response.bufferoutput to false will send output as it s written the the output stream using chunked transfer-encoding
chunked transfers are essentially a work-around to permit sending documents whose content-length is not known in advance
asp.net however by default buffers the entire output and hence does know the overall content length

atomic	interlocked
i don t think that the support for interlocked operations in boost is more than implementation detail i m currently dealing with an somewhat older version of boost so it s possible that this isn t the case anymore
there are some portable libraries that support atomic compare and exchange and other atomic operations as documented parts of the interface apache apr glib intel thread building blocks also note that c++0x will have support for atomic operations like compare exchange - i m not sure what the level of support is in current c++ compilers it doesn t appear to being vs 2010

put	get
thanks ittai
what i d like to do is have files in a central location so that when i add people to my development team they can see the base version of these files but meanwhile have the ability for the rest of the team to work with their own local version. i know i can just put the files in source-control we use tortoiese-svn and have my team change the local versions but i d rather not as the exclamation mark signaling the file has been changed and needs to be committed quite frankly irritates me greatly. i ll give two examples of what i mean we use quite a few build.xml files which relate to a single properties files which contains many definitions
some of them can be different between team-members mainly temporary working directories and i d like a new team-member to have the ability to get the properties file with the base config but change it if they wish

2711647
sdl	devil
those libraries don t need such a function and doesn t make much sense either because you can do it yourself quite easily by accessing pixels in the buffer and writing it out yourself even with the screen buffers you can access pixel data
just the other day i showed somebody how to do this with the haskell sdl bindings use a library that can write out to .png files they will most likely take a raw pointer to pixel buffer which you can get from sdl gl or copy it to a format which the library needs
i just found a haskell binding for the library devil which can output .png files

sharepoint	spsite
but you are not allowed to dispose objects from spcontext that will definitely cause you problems
you must use option two if your code is not run in context of application pages like sharepoint timer or workflow because spcontext.current object will be null
link and yes if you open spweb or spsite object you must dispose it

changelistener	listeners	changelistener	listeners
it s worth mentioning that changelistener has been deprecated since gwt 1.6 as have all listeners so sliderbar should probably be updated to use the new hotness changehandler but adding a changelistener will still work in the meantime
sliderbar has a method addchangelistener which takes a changelistener whose onchange method will be called when the slider is moved

2712397
implements	modifiers
then you give anything that needs to call addorder a proxy which can do just that and anything which needs to call executeorder a proxy which can do just that
you could potentially leave both methods public and just make tradingsystem implements two interfaces - but that would allow clients to just cast to the concrete type and make the call anyway
access modifiers shouldn t generally be used as a layer of security by the way - if this is a genuine trading system rather than just an example of the sort of separation you want then i d expect the security to be implemented rather differently

2712575
for-loop	loops
edit note as xtofl correctly points out that the lifetime of i is the entire for-loop while the lifetime of a is the block in the curly braces a single iteration of the for-loop
there is a single definition within the for-loop
the variable gets created used then destroyed at the closing curly brace and recreated in the next loops iteration

2712817
folder	directory
i highly doubt using the findfirstfile will help much as the actual number of files enumerated will only ever be 0 or 1
i m assuming although i don t know for definite that because you re calling getfiles on a network drive it adds considerable time to retrieve all the files from all 30k folder and enumerate through them
i ve found an alternative directory enumerator here on codeproject which looks promising

2712817
folder	directory
you could create a webservice on the server that enumerates everything for you and returns the results after
edit i think your problem is more likely the folder access
each time you access a directory in the network drive you re going to be hitting security and permission checks

maven	pom.xml
you can simply use getclass .getpackage .getimplementationversion to get the version information that is stored in a .jar-files manifest.mf
luckily maven is smart enough unfortunately maven does not write the correct information to the manifest as well by default
instead one has to modify the configuration element of the maven-jar-plugin to set adddefaultimplementationentries and adddefaultspecificationentries to true like this ideally this configuration should be put into the company pom.xml or another base-pom

detailed documentation of the element can be found in the maven archive documentation

put	get
1 get qcf and q properties from jndi. 2 access in servlet
tomcat is the same as standalone you just have tomcat running in a jvm and all you need to do is put the proper classes in the classpath
everything here is in the manual 1 you need to have a hornetmq server running

2713567
google-chrome	firefox
load.html test.php the result is interesting in firefox and opera no loading indicator is shown during xmlhttprequests
google-chrome lets it spinning.
i suspect google wave doesn t use long polling anymore but for instance polls every x seconds to save resources but i can t test it as i don t have an account

2713585
put	get	put	get
for the strings create the localizable.strings only available under the macosx resources right click the new file and get info click the button make file localizable this will automatically add one language - english for me in the groups files you should now be able to expand the resource file and see the new language from the command line run the command
this will parse your .m files and extract all the nslocalizedstrings and put them in the file
if you do get info again you should be able to add more languages for the xibs right click on them and make file localizable

2713653
folder	directory
rather than getting all the directory and then checking each for files try and get everything from one call
in .net 3.5 there is no one method to recursively get all files and folder so you have to build it yourself see below
in .net 4 new overloads exist to to this in one step

2713709
folder	directory
when you use getfiles you must wait for the whole array of fileinfo objects to be returned before you can access the array. therefore when you are working with many files and directory enumeratefiles can be more efficient
this way not all the files are retrieved from the folder if the enumerator has at least 1 file the folder is not empty


2713746
pdcurses	ncurses
the only thing you d need to port a program would be to recompile
there is very similar library pdcurses
it uses the same calls as ncurses but works on win32

2713798
javadb	hsqldb
hypersql hsqldb is also popular
java 6 ships with derby renamed javadb
it can be used in memory or server mode

2713884
uilabel	uibutton	hide	show
inside the footer i put a uilabel and a uibutton
clicking on the button hide or show some rows updates the uilabel in the footer view and finally resizes footer view
basically everything is working fine

2713919
post	put
i ve submited a bug report
post rewrited
you shouldn t put that comma after last and only element in data

2713990
integer	unsigned
modular types work a bit like unsigned types in c they don t have negative values and once you reach the largest representable value if you add one you will get 0
if you were to try the same with a normal non-modular integer in ada you d get constraint_error


2714074
post	get	post	get
the following code block allows me to control anon access from iis7 without having to muck about in the metabase where gui changes on iis6 get applied
no that s not quite right but i can t do a code block in a comment reply so i ll post a new answer .
the following code block allows me to control anon access from iis7 without having to muck about in the metabase where gui changes on iis6 get applied

2714261
prepare	execute
eventually i realised that the statement handle was being changed execute with different param which means the call to fetch in the while loop will only ever work once then the function calls itself again and the result set is changed
so i am wondering what s the best way of using pdo prepare statements in a recursive way
one way could be to use fetchall but it says in the manual that has a substantial overhead

2714324
put	get	put	get
the jquery is smart enough to get the computed width of the element you specify
you can put jquery to use and use its width method for that
the jquery is smart enough to get the computed width of the element you specify

2714389
multiplying	multiplication
your tags imply you are not interested in floating point floating point is a completely different beast you cannot apply any of these fixed point rules to floating point they do not work
multiplying two 32 bit numbers results in a 64 bit answer two 8s give a 16 etc
binary multiplication is simply shifting and adding

2714561
children	parent
once you ve patched all child ids in the respective parent you can discard the vector
it seems like you could save the data in the following syntax that is to say when serialized the root node contains all nodes either directly children or indirectly other descendants
writing the format is fairly straightforward just have a recursive write function starting at the root node

2714561
children	parent
iterators are stable
once you ve inserted the root node its iterator will not change not even when inserting its children
hence when you re reading each node you can already set the parent iterator

2714581
children	parent
if you want the latter some of your choices will also depend on how static the structure is
if it s subject to change is there a limit on the maximum number of children
alternatively since it looks like at least most of the data in an individual node has a fixed size you might create a database-like structure of fixed-size records and in each record record the record numbers of the parent children

2714598
sudo	passwd	sudo	passwd
however instead of users being prompted for their passwd in a terminal window they ll get a dialog prompt via the authorization services api
this also looks promising cocoasudo it uses the osx native authorization services api for mac os x cocoa-based apps there is analagous ability to sudo provided via the authorization services api
use of the api allows you to prompt the user for their username and passwd requesting the ability to escalate privileges

2714798
post	get
if however you override the metadata for the datagrid.datacontext property you can get it to work properly
example code below i sourced this post by jaime rodriguez in creating my solution


2714824
nunit	mstest
if you use mstest to test pre-4.0 applications that s an argument against moving to vs2k10 at all
you d need to port your app to 4.0 or port your tests to nunit
there were some bugs in beta 1 regarding the layout of the solution explorer

2715028
children	parent
i wondered if explicitly setting the child control s visibility property would allow for an invisible parent and visible child and it did not
can you have a container control that is hidden with visible children
i m still trying to wrap my head around a lot of what i ve been reading

2715105
jar	war	jar	war
update i pasted the provided pom in my war project changed it to use the version 2.8 of the eclipse plugin and removed src main webapp from the resources element it s not a resource and this is what i get when running mvn eclipse eclipse looks fine to me
update 2 as i wrote in a comment to your own answer i don t think the eclipse plugin will generate a dynamic web module for a project with a packaging of type jar
if you change the packaging war it should behave as expected

2715299
isnull	nullif
as temp
we had the same problem and this is the solution to force entity framework to use a column as a primary key use isnull
to force entity framework not to use a column as a primary key use nullif

2715366
buffering	sigpipe
the pipe 7 man page contains lots of useful info about pipes including on linux at least how big the buffer is
linux has buffering of 4k or 64k depending on version
edit tim mentions sigpipe which is also a potential issue that can seem to lose data

2715659
post	get
if the functional test must click then i just have to create dummy html page with the needed html form elements
i can t seem to perform functional test on file uploads through the sftestfunctional s post method
my action handling the http post is able to get all parameters except the file upload field

2715690
organization	naming
you can put language-specific links on your pages linking to the sibling page of each page in each other language
so it s an organization aid for you and it s also nice for sophisticated users who can then choose to go to the site in their favorite language
beyond that it s just a naming convention

2715856
webkit	gecko
and here is some direction toward using gecko if you prefer that. webkit2png provides instructions for os x but there s really no reason it shouldn t work on nix being that webkit itself is cross-platform
figuring that out can be left as an exercise to the reader but it may be worthwhile as khtml has historically lagged behind webkit for new html5 css3 etc features
i haven t tested any of these solutions but it might be enough to get started if you want more control over the screenshot generation

2715877
datatrigger	eventtrigger
i m trying to enable editing of wpf treeview labels with a doubleclick - i ve googled around this and it looks like the two ways of doing this are with a custom control or with a style which hides one of a textbox textblock
using a style to set the label to be a textbox based on a datatrigger seems easy enough eg 1 below but it means that any time a row is selected it s being edited
what i d really like to do is to enable this transition to textbox on a mousedoubleclick event but it seems that eventtrigger can t be used in the manner below because they re transient

2715915
implements	extends
...it could be straightforward to implements our custom xmlserializer class using reflection
if you need to handle specific attributes dictionary or any class you can implements the ixmlserialiable interface which will allow you more freedom at the cost of more verbose coding
there is an interesting article which show an elegant way to implements a sophisticated way to extends the xmlserializer

2716025
put	get
if you modify the list while an iterator is interating over it then you will get a concurrentmodificationexception
you can wrap the arraylist with collection.synchronizedlist or use a thread-safe collection there are many or just put the add calls in a synchronized block


2716150
post	get
the default request method is already get
the setdooutput true will however force it to post
i d replace all of those lines by and retry

2716182
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
see also this q a on x86 addressing modes mostly discussing 32 64bit addressing modes and the x86 tag wiki
this is because isn t valid in any addressing mode on 16-bit x86 see this site for more info
or should work

2716250
folder	directory
no other project s commits should cause project 1 to build and project 1 s changelog in hudson should only have commit notes from project 1
i typically setup svn to host 1 big project per repository but a lot of our infrastructure has changed and we now have one main svn server that has a hierarchy like so branches tags trunk project1 files folder project2 files folder project3 files folder projects1 2 and 3 do not share anything amongst themselves they are independent projects each with their own solution file to be built
i can setup projects in hudson like so repository url local module directory optional trunk project1 and that will maintain a separate workspace for each project but every time you commit to project 2 or project 3 a build gets kicked off in hudson for every project based in that repository

2716278
inherited	properties
it s meant for layout purposes only
you might want to look into one of the controls that inherited from itemscontrol such as listview
the properties you d bind your list to is called itemssource

2716337
hide	show	hide	show
hide a tab me.tabcontrol.tabpages.remove me.tabpagemynicetab show this same tab again me.tabcontrol.tabpages.add me.tabpagemynicetab
you can easily hide tab by removing them from the tabpages collection of the tabcontrol
this doesn t destroy the tabpage that you ve build in the ide so you can show them again just by re-adding them to the tabpages collection

2716470
int	chars
how many rows fits into this depends on the size of each row
the greatest value of an int has little to do with the maximum number of rows you can store in a table
it s true that if you use an int or bigint as your primary key you can only have as many rows as the number of unique values in the data type of your primary key but you don t have to make your primary key an int you could make it a chars 100

2716553
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
unless there s some specific functionality you want that comes with uinavigationcontroller i would just subclass nsobject
i don t see any reason to use uiviewcontroller for this
uiviewcontroller inherently has a uiview that it controls--you d be ignoring most of what uiviewcontroller does

2716553
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uiviewcontroller inherently has a uiview that it controls--you d be ignoring most of what uiviewcontroller does
a custom controller object would probably be more appropriate unless you need specific non-view functionality in uiviewcontroller and i don t know why you would
edit again i m not sure why uinavigationcontroller would be a better fit

2716558
submit	submission
i m building it on code igniter if that makes any difference
i m coding a sweepstakes entry form in php where the user submit some information in a form and it is stored in a database
i would like to find a way to restrict this form to one submission per person

2716604
postgresql	mysql
the summary from the article is as follows unlike mysql postgresql implements several clean and documented ways to select the records holding group-wise maximums including window functions and distinct on
however to the lack of the loose index scan support by the postgresql s optimizer and the less efficient usage of indexes in postgresql the queries using these function take too long
to work around these problems and improve the queries against the low cardinality grouping conditions a certain solution described in the article should be used

2716768
post	get
also contrast what file had to say on the binary you tried ie 32-bit with what you get for your bin gzip which is what i get on ubuntu 9.10 for amd64 aka x86_64
edit your expanded post shows that as the readelf output also reflects a 32-bit build


2716777
client-side	server-side
type 3 the pure-java driver that talks with the server-side middleware that then talks to database type 4 the pure-java driver that uses database native protocol
from wikipedia jdbc drivers are client-side adapters installed on the client machine not on the server that convert requests from java programs to a protocol that the dbms can understand
edit types there are commercial and free drivers available for most relational database servers

2716840
put	get
make a simple function that just returns 0 get all of the save load stuff working to your satisfaction then put the slow bits back in
rather than putting the function in a string i would put the function in its own file
call it time_consuming.py for example

2716877
for-loop	loops
modify a plot with a timer you can also use a timer object instead of a loops to execute the updates to the plot
in this example i ll first make a function timer_fcn that i want executed each time the timer fires now i can create the plot and timer and start the timer as follows this will display the same animation as the for-loop example
and once you re done with the timer object remember to always delete it delete animationtimer

2717216
hash	md5
so far i ve only been able to tap into more cores if i happen to need multiple hashes of the same file say an md5 and a sha256 at the same time
i can use the same i o stream to feed two or more hash algorithms and i get the faster algorithms done for free as far as wall clock time
as i understand most hash algorithms each new bit changes the entire result and it is inherently challenging impossible to do in parallel

2717273
folder	directory	folder	directory
for foo baz indicates that it exists in the repository or more precisely in the information in foo .svn but the actual file directory in your local copy is missing
meanwhile if the problem is just a .svn folder itself that s gone missing that will show up like this that means that foo .svn says that there should be a foo quux and foo quux exists but there is no foo quux .svn
finally if the problem is that a directory has a .svn that s pointing at somewhere else other than the subdirectory of its parent -- say you ve done an svn switch on that directory -- then you ll get this if you re in windows and using tortoisesvn you can get the same information by right-clicking in the top-level directory and selecting tortoisesvn - check for modifications from the pop-up menu

2717454
for-loop	loops
as most of us know if you declare a variable in a for or foreach statement it only lives as long as what s inside which makes it seem like the variable is the same as a variable declared in the statement-block of such a statement but that s not right
to understand it better take the following for-loop
then i ll re-state the equivalent loops in a while-form

2717513
int	double
but not double func
int func
where in the former it s clear in the latter it s ambigious

2717907
hide	show
this progress bar show the status of scripts loading
a sample is this progress bar is in #indexloader which is blocking the website being loaded behind its css is after the progress bar reaches 100 i want to hide and remove #indexloader for that i used but the problem is although the scripts have loaded the pages are not fully loaded i see images and other things still loading


2717936
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
update i ran the same program i have above on windows 7 with ntfs and it does maintain full millisecond accuracy
the msdn link mdma provided further notes that fat filesystems is accurate for creates with 10 ms resolution but for access is only accurate to 2 seconds
thus this is truly os dependent

2717940
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
check your pom.xml to see if the right junit version is the articfact
you may already be doing it but this can happen if your maven dependency is using old junit version 3.x instead of junit 4.x where these annotations are respected
check your pom.xml to see if the right junit version is the articfact

2717945
retaincount	dealloc
so outside of your function you must somehow retain the object
when you add the objects to the array it increments the retaincount by one
that is why releasing it doesn t dealloc the object

2717961
subtraction	add
carry look ahead is the term you want to google or just read it groups bits and does some clever logic to greatly reduce the number of steps to add the numbers together
there is a parallel process for subtraction i just can t remember the name


2718030
int	chars
each two chars represent a byte which employ the leftmost msb bit as the sign rather than two s complement
i am converting these to signed int within a loop and wondered if there s a better way to do it
there are too many conversions and i am sure there s a more efficient method that i am missing

2718070
hash	md5
md5 is considered completely broken in this regard
while it is true that there must exist multiple even infinitely many messages that have the same hash the goal of a cryptographic hash is to make it infeasible to find such collisions
you might be thinking that one could just find collisions by calculating the hashes of random messages until you eventually get the same result twice

2718070
hash	md5
you might be thinking that one could just find collisions by calculating the hashes of random messages until you eventually get the same result twice
however you d be underestimating the size of the space of possible hash values
for md5 the size of the hash is 128 bits

2718132
int	double	int	double
prints 0.5 d is a special suffix for numeric literal to specify that it s a double -precision value
there s also l for long 64-bit int
a double value needs to be stored in a double variable

2718168
hash	md5
so if i knew this was the algorithm i d say great i ll use the password 99978
it hash to 78 so the password validation algorithm will pass it and i m in
obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits

2718555
hash	md5
to make this more concrete let s look again at the function f x x x
in that case you could make a very good guess that a hash of 25 came from a value of 5 and not -5
this is indeed how people are able to break hash functions including md5 which is it turns out not a very good cryptographic hash function

2718750
submit	submission
i could define some flag when submission form but this does not solve the problem
because response on form submit from web server takes some time browser doesn t unload the current page immediately and waits response from server
and during this waiting user may close window or navigate anywhere

2718921
put	get
how to get a literally is depending on what shell interpreter you are using
for bash you should put single quotes around the instead of double quotes like


2719018
stdout	stderr
however i want to just redirect the stdout to some filehandle no stderr
my stdout is going to be a line-by-line output of key-value pairs that i want to insert into a mao in perl
that is why i want to redirect only my stdout from my java program in perl

2719129
hash	md5
compute the md5 or sha1 hash
fetch the url again and check if the hash has changed
there are other ways such as the last-modified http header but they don t work with all servers

2719202
uninstall	upgrade
one of our clients has their own custom scripts that does exactly that
i would then provide the customer with this cleanup tool and say after uninstall if you want to remove all user data then use this
consider the following cases customer uninstalls prior to installing a new version major upgrade which will uninstall the old version so you need to be aware of this accidental uninstall by a user who shouldn t have done it but had the ability to do so if you must must must remove the data then the cleanest way to remove this data for all users that i can think of would be to take advantage of active setup and use this to trigger a per-user script that runs the next time each user logs on

2719202
uninstall	upgrade
consider the following cases customer uninstalls prior to installing a new version major upgrade which will uninstall the old version so you need to be aware of this accidental uninstall by a user who shouldn t have done it but had the ability to do so if you must must must remove the data then the cleanest way to remove this data for all users that i can think of would be to take advantage of active setup and use this to trigger a per-user script that runs the next time each user logs on
the data won t be deleted during the uninstall but at the next logon
and you ll leave a few registry entries lying about however it would be less likely to cause corruption than enumerating user profiles

2719203
width	margin
the first is the line wrap column and the second is the left margin column and the settings for both of these markers are found in the document type
these markers are drawn as a solid vertical line one pixel in width


2719636
git-rebase	amend
amend the commit with git commit --amend --no-edit
do a git-rebase --continue which will rewrite the rest of your commits against the new one
repeat from step 2 onwards if you have marked more than one commit for edit

2719672
public	protected	public	protected
for example i might want all the member functions public protected or private declared before the say private data members
the class is correct public is just a access qualifier and will apply till the next qualifier is seen or the end of class declaration
there is no limit to how many of these access qualifiers public private protected you can have in a class

2719761
getter	setter
a field that is marked as readonly can only be set once during the construction of an object in the constructor
a property that has only a getter is said to be readonly
cause no setter is provided to change the value of the property from outside

2719890
put	get
l means this is the last rule so if it matches don t continue running other rules qsa means append the original query string so other get parameters are still passed to the php script you could maybe replace the pattern which matches the groupname with something more restrictive
you can also put the configuration in one of your apache configuration files which can be faster than parsing the .htaccess file on every request


2720090
hide	show
the constrain is once the mouse enter into li element and if it s stay inside 3sec then it need to show
once i leave from li element immateriality it should hide
for this i am using it s work fine

2720167
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseover can fire multiple times if you have child elements within the li element which would set the interval multiple times and overwriting the value of the showtimeout variable
this means when mouseleave fires only the last interval to be set would be cleared
try changing your mouseover event to mouseenter instead

2720200
post	put
otherwise you would according to common definition and usage of put replace the pack with just this one dog
version 2 outside of the url path post the dog you want to add to dogs packs p1
post by definition creates a subordinate resource so that would add the dog to the pack

2720262
odt	opendocument
see oasis opendocument essentials especially the the virtues of cheating paragraph
odt odf is basically zipped xml so any xml library will do
you ll need to know the specification though if you re going to write a new odt file from scratch

2720262
odt	opendocument
you ll need to know the specification though if you re going to write a new odt file from scratch
it s much easier to unpack an existing odt and insert data into contained the content.xml file
see oasis opendocument essentials especially the the virtues of cheating paragraph

2720290
folder	directory
one of the things on that dialog is an option called working directory
by default when you create a new build definition it provides a calculated folder for this value
this is where the build agent will do the checkout from tfs for the build attempt

2720440
int	chars
then you are calling func with parameters based on different types for the first 3 parameters int and chars but func expects them to be based on the same type
try writing down with what types func will be called with and try matching that to a signature for func with type being substituted to say int
e.g

2720659
folder	directory
directory
if you re creating for example universal administration where presenters controllers are present which is placed in proper module folder every framework has this feature i wouldn t worry about shipping it so
but you may consider packing it such as whole project

2720672
toolbar	tabs
image link
how to create scrollview in a toolbar which is under just below navigation bar same like shown in the image which is available there in the below http link
please see the image where it located in the below link and a scrollview created tabs are video us world etc. under my title navigation bar

2720782
uitableview	reloaddata
one solution is to check isediting in the fetched results callbacks and just do a bulk reloaddata rather than dynamically inserting deleting rows but i m wondering if there is a way to check specifically for the reordering mode
i have a uitableview backed by an nsfetchedresultscontroller which may trigger updates at any time
there don t seem to be any table view delegate methods to detect this

2720865
jar	war	jar	war
which package archive should i use jar war the packaging will depend on the type of application you ll write it s not something that you choose upfront it s just a consequence
ejbs are packaged in an ejb jar and typically deployed inside an ear
servlet based web services are deployed inside a war

2720989
put	get
i know the function i should use is gtk_editable_set_editable but i don t know how to make it take a gtkentry widget as an argument here is the code i m using so far as getting keyboard focus i think i need the panel_applet_request_focus function
it requires that i pass it the applet in question and the timestamp of the event triggering the window focus i m not sure what to put in for the timestamp
i compiled the code as above and i still can t get keyboard focus when i click the applet

2721305
lisp	scheme
lisp is more or less in camp 2
the consequence it is theoretically not really satisfying and makes it impossible to statically parse source code if the code transformations are based on arbitrary lisp functions
the lisp community struggles with this for decades see for example the myriad of approaches that the scheme community has tried

2721332
required	placeholder	required	placeholder
i imagine if you put whatever content you want within a panel or placeholder it should be fine
okay so this is disturbingly easy but many of the tutorials on the web that talk about this kind of thing push to do extravagant things that required the control to parse listitems or such
so this solution is purely so that you can build a control that for whatever reason has a placeholder in it that could have anything inside it kind of like a content area on a master page

2721404
installshield	dtf
i recall using a dtf custom action to publish a certificate but i can t recall if that was needed for office 2003 or only for office 2007
i ve not done this in wix but i have done it in installshield
below with my notes from that time one problem you will have is that wix doesn t have a bootstrapper so you will have to find a way to chain the .net framework and vsto redist also possibly the office 2003 pias

2721656
pyexcelerator	xlrd
xlrd you appear to know about
xlwt is a fork of pyexcelerator with bugs fixed and several enhancements
pyexcelerator appears not to be maintained

2721836
integer	unsigned
seander bithacks.html#integerlogobvious just make sure that any shifting you re using to work out the highest bit set needs to be done on an unsigned version of the number since a compiler implementation might or might not sign extend the operation on a signed value
you re looking to determine the integer log base 2 of a number the l highest bit set
sean anderson s bit twiddling hacks page has several methods ranging from the obvious counting bits in a loop to versions that use table lookup

2722036
put	get
it s late here.
a rather confusing sequence of events happened according to my log-file and i am about to put a lot of the blame on the python logger which is a bold claim
i thought i should get some second opinions about whether what i am saying could be true

2722199
portrait	landscape

if i start the app in portrait orientation everything works great
if i start it in landscape orientation the 3rd tab works perfectly

versioning	upgrade
recently i recompiled the program with .net 4.0
my program s versioning number also increased
but when i run this versioning upgrade doesn t seem to to detect any previous versioning settings and does not reload them

crypto++	keyczar
but if i had the opportunity to choose right now i think i d invest time to experiment with keyczar
crypto++ is amazing in power but suffers from its complexity and a lack of automation documentation
it also suffers from a lack of debugging i think when the check does not work it just does not work but you re given little hints as to what could cause the failure.

toolchain	binutils
the kernel is modded for which i ve the source
i m working with an embedded linux deployment and am using a cross compiler toolchain that doesn t compile i2c library function calls
i don t intend to replace the libraries deployed as i do know they work including i2c so i believe i need the following binutils version gcc version glibc kernel for the headers i think i can assume from the following that the binutils library is version 2.2.5

xunit.net	specflow

if so how

apache	nginx
the idea is that nginx is very very fast at serving static files and will do that very quickly
anything else will be passed to the local apache instance s and your server load will probably fall down - despite having two webservers running

once i fixed those and compiled with gcc it compiled fine and i got the following output 5 6 7 when i compile with g++ i get this output 5 6 700 that happens because func3 is not static in inline.h

the snippets you show don t compile inline.h has extern inline int func1 void that doesn t make any sense

a couple of the possible arguments to bzr upgrade include --rich-root --rich-root-pack --1.9-rich-root try bzr help upgrade for more details or see bazaar s page on upgrading branches
the current trunk that you re using at c blahblah does not support rich roots older versioning of bazaar use pack-0.92 by default which apparently is not rich-root compatible
you need to use bzr upgrade to upgrade your branch as the error message says

to be honest this particular example is not the easiest one to get started with maven because it requires to understand several concepts that can t be covered in a single answer and i would warmly recommend to check maven by example for a good introduction of maven before to go further

basically what you need to do with maven to put a library on the class path is to declare this library as a dependency of a maven project

extends t should be used since any instance of a subclass of t is also a t
super t should be used because an instance of t can legally be passed to any method that accepts some supertype of t

ant	maven
i usually find maven s dependency management a big time-wasting annoyance that i usually don t need so i do my build management with ant
at the price of a hand-tuned build file ant gives you very good control over which files go where when
if you copy newly compiled classes to your web-inf classes directory and touch web.xml to trigger a reload you don t have to stop and restart tomcat

then to get a new hash function rather than choosing the second element which would have some confusing dependencies on the first element they choose a whole new permutation and take the first element again
people who happen to have the same hash value 2-4 times that is the same first element in 2-4 permutations are put together in a cluster
this algorithm is repeated 10-20 times so that each person gets put into 10-20 clusters

free	memcpy
and it is arguable which version is more readable
still many people might appreciate the free opportunity to write such concise one-liners as the first version above
quite often people find it confusing that memcpy returns the destination buffer pointer because there is a popular belief that returning a pointer form a function should normally or always indicate that the function might allocate reallocate memory

i haven t run it through a compiler
this doesn t make any sense unless you re running on a 16-bit machine
based on the way that you re calling malloc you re planning to have the first n bytes be a pointer to something else where n may be 2 4 or 8 depending on whether you re running on a 16- 32- or 64bit architecture

i can deal with differences in endianness easily but i have hit a wall in attempting to deal with possible float memory formats
i know that modern computers have all a standard int format but i have heard that they may not all use the ieee standard for floating-point int

there is some configuration in index.php but you really shouldn t be touching that unless you want to change the directory things are stored in
the config folder is used for config files of your custom classes
since you obviously don t have any in an empty project the folder is empty

2725053
disk	ram
this would let you perform the computation in a reasonable amount of time especially if you parallelize it
it seems as if your input set must be very large if a lookup table will be too large to store on the disk
i assume that that the data will not fit in ram then which means that whatever algorithm you use should be tuned to minimize the amounts of reads and writes

2725053
disk	ram
i assume that that the data will not fit in ram then which means that whatever algorithm you use should be tuned to minimize the amounts of reads and writes
whenever disk are involved space time because writing to disk is so slow
the exact algorithm you should use depends on what kind of graph you have

content-length	content-type
the character encoding which is usually present as an attribute of the content-type header is mandatory to know how many bytes a character will take into account because randomaccessfile is byte based and for example utf-8 encoding is variable-byte-length
here s a kickoff example leaving obvious exception handling aside if those headers are not present especially content-length is important then you ll really need to store it on disk first until end of stream and then re-read and reverse it the same way with help of randomaccessfile
update it would actually be tougher than it look like

2726135
superclass	subclassing
the way to deal with this is
the superclass doesn t need an empty constructor specifically
the subclassing simply needs to call a constructor in the superclass

2726135
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
the subclassing simply needs to call a constructor in the superclass
if the superclass has a public or protected no-arg constructor this is called automatically otherwise you need to be explicit
default constructor here super specifies no constructor so one is added

printf	strcpy
also by definition sizeof char 1 in c so is redundant
james is correct about printf stopping when it gets to the null character and uri is correct that you need to allocate a 7-character buffer to hold hello n
some of the confusion with terminators would be mitigated if you used the usual c idiom for copying a string strcpy ptr hello n rather than memcpy

tlbimp	regsvr32
can use oleview.exe to view tlbs directly
rest of brain dump the upside of using tlbimp especially from an msbuild script is that you can then get your product to properly build for both 64 and 32 bit targets
otherwise you end up with a 64 bit build targets using the tlbs that were last regsvr32 d which are most likely the 32 bit com objects with 32 bit interfaces

versioning	upgrade
however you won t be able to open the newly upgrade solution file in previous versioning of visual studio so back these up first if you want to retain them - though it may be possible to hack the .sln files to go back if really necessary
you can however have multiple versioning of visual studio installed at once but remember that only one versioning can have default file extensions associated with it and this will likely be latest versioning you install
incidentally if you are interested in why you can t open older solutions in new versioning without conversion then read this official vs blog entry

2728272
metaclass	subclassing
circular references are usually not a big issue because we nowadays have the cyclic-gc module gc that takes care of them but it can t always clean up reference cycles for instance when your class also has a __del__ method. and lastly storing bound method objects generally makes your instances unserializable most serializers such as pickle can t handle bound methods
you may not care about any of these issues but if you do there s a better approach to what you re trying to do metaclass
instead of assigning bound methods to instance attributes as you create instances you can assign normal functions to class attributes as you create the class now sub.get and sub.get really are aliases and overriding the one and not the other in a subclassing works as expected

2728274
versioning	upgrade
if you mean that you published an app to the market at version 1 you upgrade the app in the market to version 2 you discovered that that upgrade had a bug in it and you now want to publish a new upgrade if that s the case then you have to post a new version as version 3
however remember that there are two things you control when posting new versioning
there s the versionname which can be anything you want and then the versioncode which must be a number and each release must have a higher number than the previous one

there are also a number of other systems accounting crm payroll ms exchange that hold critical data that we need to integrate use for data validation in other systems report on and otherwise expose

if you try doing something like which throws filenotfoundexception and does not extend runtimeexception you ll get a compiler error and a suggestion from eclipse to use a try catch block or to declare that the enclosing method also throws that exception
eclipse relies on compiler errors to suggest try catch exception and numberformatexception extends runtimeexception which does not give an error if it s not surrounded by try catch block to avoid putting everything in blocks - think of nullpointerexception which is also a runtimeexception and everything that can cause it

accessor	properties
or that accesses
these are basic concepts in objective-c but here s a quick rundown instance members are generally considered to be private and you should kind of never access the instance members of other objects except through accessor
hence the need for the properties declarations are like method definitions

my folder structure is as follows web pages- resources- css css pages web pages- resources- pics images web pages xhtml files try the below background-image url .. pics logo.gif


2729331
accessor	properties
that syntax in objective-c is how you access properties
the default scope for instance variables in objective-c is protected which means anything outside your class can t access them without going through an accessor method of some kind
you need to declare and define the methods - uint8 value and - void setvalue uint8 avalue and use them

2729402
children	parent
no you don t need critical sections at all - the child and parent don t share memory
all your need is something like this in your default case forget what i said before about initialising children to 1 i didn t notice that children++ was supposed to be before the while loop


2729498
integer	unsigned
i would simply truncate my big integer take the highest order 32 bits and treat them as an unsigned integer then divide it by 2 32 to bring it into the range 0 1 converting it to floating-point as i divide and plot it that far round the circle
i guess truncating the big integer to get the leftmost 32 bits is equivalent to dividing it by 2 128 but there might be a better bit-shifting approach or you may be able to simply grab the bits directly


2729534
int	chars	int	chars
you wouldn t need hashes just a key - value store since you know what it s going to contain in advance where the standard ascii chars are keys and their corresponding identifiers are values

client-side	server-side
but the future is coming as part of the html5 effort there s a file api being defined which will allow javascript to have client-side access to the specific files the user identifies by selecting them in a file input element a
this opens the door to for instance client-side validation of file size limits file format restrictions etc
these can t take place of server-side validation mdash

2730146
client-side	server-side
these can t take place of server-side validation mdash
client-side validation is always a convenience not a guarantee mdash
but they make for a much better user experience. it also opens the door to using those files on the client-side without ever having to send them to the server

qgroupbox	qwidget
i suspect that the title is not an independant qwidget but a part of the qgroupbox widget thus drawn by the qgroupbox paint
however the groupbox widget supports the font property and since the only text displayed by a group box is its title you can apply your font style to the qgroupbox widget

uiview	calayer
the general rule i follow with using calayer or uiview s is to use calayer objects when i don t need any user interaction
if the user is going to touch it use the uiview it s a very lightweight object so the overhead is negligible
that said i ve found cascrolllayer remarkably useless

gtkmm	glibmm
i figured that i need to make a queue that has one consumer and multiple producers would like to use std queue
i have seen some code on the gtkmm threading docs that show a single con pro queue and they would lock the queue object produce data and signal the sleeping thread that it is finished then the producer would sleep
for what i need would i need to sleep a thread would there be data conflicts if i didn t sleep any of the threads and would sleeping a thread cause a data signifcant data delay i need realtime data to be drawn 30 frames a sec how would i go about coding such a queue using the gtkmm glibmm library

if the request is to retrieve information a partial search hint result or a new page to be displayed etc... you can use get
if the data being sent is part of a request to change something update a database delete a record etc.. then use post

make sure the sdktoolspath is set and the tool exists in the correct processor specific location under the sdktoolspath and that the microsoft windows sdk is installed now i do have prior versioning .net 3.5 of the windows sdk installed on the build server and the full .net 4.0 framework is installed but i ve not run across a .net 4.0 specific versioning of the windows sdk
after a bit of experimentation and research i finally just setup a new environmental variable sdktoolspath and pointed it to the copy of sgen.exe in my windows 6.0 sdk folder

int	chars
if you really need client_id to be int and validate length you can probably use
client_id column is int
validates_length_of uses size method to find out length of the field and for the int it just gives you size of the variable in bytes which is probably 4 for first 11 chars and 8 for 12+

hash	md5	128bit	64bit	128bit	64bit
or put another way with a 64bit hash you d expect a collision after around 4 billion strings so if you re dealing with up to say a couple of million strings the chances of a collision are pretty negligible
another option would be md5 which is a very strong hash practically secure but it is a 128bit hash so you have the slight disadvantage of having to deal with 128bit values
i would say md5 is overkill for these purposes-- as i say with a 64bit hash you can deal fairly safely with in the order of a few million strings

client-side	server-side
javascript alone can always cut it but the advantage jquery brings is that it makes things easier and faster and cuts out a lot of the browser issues in doing ajax and dom manipulation
javascript is code that runs client-side in the browser
ajax is a term used to refer to the process of javascript contacting the webserver directly and getting a response as opposed to the user navigating to a different page jquery is a javascript library that provides an easy-to-use abstraction over top of ajax and the browser dom django is python code that runs server-side in some situations you can do the same operation on either the client or on the server

converter	multibinding
therefore the code you want looks something like this where divisionconverter is the key of a custom converter
the converterparameter in this example allows the developer to pass in a denominator instead of having to create a separate converter for each number
here s an example of the custom divisionconverter you will need to create if you wanted to incorporate both division and subtraction in the same binding you would need to either create a special converter or use a multibinding which would also require you to create a special multibindingconverter

do tests verify the performance of each if one really is faster there isn t a lot you can do about it

primes	modulus	primes	modulus
hashes boil down to multiplication and modulus operations which means that you never want to use numbers with common factors if you can help it
in other words relatively primes provide an even distribution of answers
the numbers that make up using a hash are typically modulus of the data type you put it into 2 32 or 2 64 modulus of the bucket count in your hashtable varies

in addition there is a wordpress blog styled to match the style of the application suite integrated into the ui and a link to a mediawiki wiki application as well

sitecore ultimately can use normal .net user controls if you want though it s slightly against their model but it works
one thing i ll warn you of is sitecore must be the root of your website it has to control the root of the domain it has a urlrewriting module that needs to be at the root and you can tell it to exclude certain folders where your applications might live

for round 1 you d simply need to get the next previous player based on if it was even or odd for the next round if the user s last round.position was even you ll need to make suer that the next position up has a winner select player from rounds where position playerroundposition - 1 if not the next player isn t decided or there s a gap don t allow gaps
if the users last round.position was odd you ll need make sure there s a user below them and that there s a winner below them otherwise they should automatically be promoted to the next round as there is no one to play on a final note i m pretty sure you could use something like the following to reduce the queries you write by using something like update looking over my original post i find that the rounds table was a little ambigous
in reality it should be named matches

in tackling dependency issues maven makes any dependency tweaks explicit a change to your pom.xml overriding the dependency rather than implicit as is the case with manually managed jars in version control where the jars are simply present with nothing to support weather they are the correct dependency or not

for change management you can compare the old set of dependencies for your project as a whole with the new set and any changes can be carefully scrutinized tested etc

free	malloc
but if you re going to or are forced to code in c learn the language including it s dark side - you ll become a much better coder for it
as an aside i think what you re asking for is a way to track aliases of a pointer so that if you free the memory behind one all aliases are automagically set to null you could achieve this this by doing a form of indirection in c
in other words intercept malloc manually or using some gcc-like lazy binding trickery so that instead of returning a pointer to an allocated block it returns a pointer to an allocated pointer to an allocated block

2734515
free	malloc
in other words intercept malloc manually or using some gcc-like lazy binding trickery so that instead of returning a pointer to an allocated block it returns a pointer to an allocated pointer to an allocated block
the free calls would also have to be modified so that they free the block but not the allocated pointer which would be set to null
indirection operations within your code would then have to be double indirections instead of in graphical form when you called myfree the data would be free but not the tmp000 pointer
