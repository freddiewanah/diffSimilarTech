entity-relationship	diagram
here s my opinion
the classic entity-relationship entity-relationship model identifies relationships but does not implement them as foreign keys
in an entity-relationship diagram relationships appear as lines between boxes

2736495
for-loop	arrays
for arrays or any other c++ container there are other idioms that can be applied
next follows my preferences the best way to iterate on sequences is to use the range-based for-loop included on c++0x if your compiler don t provide this yet use iterators and if you can not use neither std begin end p.s boost.foreach emulates the range-based for-loop on c++98 compilers

int	chars
the only reason we can use zero chars as something special in string context is because it s meaning is reserved for that specific purpose
in general case in int context reserving zero for that purpose is plainly impossible for obvious reasons zero is as useful as any other int value
yet if in your specific application int zero can be used as a reserved value feel free to use it that way

2736499
int	chars
there s no way to determine the end of an array even with strings because all you can hope for is to find the end of the string which is not necessarily the end of the array that stores that string
if you explicitly added a zero to the end of your int array your first cycle would happily stop at it
for some reason you explicitly added 0 at the end of your chars array and the second cycle stops but you didn t add a zero at the end of your int array and the first cycle doesn t stop

int	boolean
in general i would advice you to send only primitive datatypes as extras like string int boolean etc
in your case it would be string fname string lname int age and string address
my opinion more complex objects are better shared by implementing a contentprovider sdcard etc

put	get
to get othersite in the search engines without removing the iframe might be possible but you will have to make a decision
the idea put url rewriting on your iframe site othersite.com so that it will serve all the pages from site1.com
use url rewriting not url redirects so that the page appears to be coming from the othersite.com

2737322
implements	extends
it automatically handles retries from the site this custom tool extends wcfproxygenerator to provide an exception handling proxy
it generates an additional proxy called exceptionhandlingproxy which inherits exceptionhandlingproxybase - the latter of which implements the meat of the proxy s functionality
the result is that you can choose to use the default proxy that inherits clientbase or exceptionhandlingproxy which encapsulates managing the lifetime of the channel factory and channel

googletest	gmock	googletest	cppunit
i would say that you d better rethink the following questions why do i need to port my tests what would be the benefit of this operation and do i really want to study a whole new testing framework and then rewrite all of my tests for some purpose
googletest and cppunit seem to share somewhat the same syntax for invoking tests but as i suspect have too much differences in that syntax
i m almost sure you can t somehow automate it and this operation would require rethinking and recompositioning of your tests to follow the googletest semantics if you use something specialized to create your mocks then porting them to gmock would require even more effort simply because gmock s approach is not the obvious one and is actually complicated

here s what the code for the web service method and relevant classes looks like in c# the web service works great with using soap xml but i can t seem to get a valid response using javascript and jquery because the message i get back from the server has a problem with my hand-coded json
i can t use the jquery getjson function because the request requires http post so i m using the lower-level ajax function instead the ajax function is submitting everything specified in data which is where my problem is
how do i build a properly formatted json object in javascript so i can plug it in to my ajax call like so data therequest i ll eventually be pulling data out of text inputs in forms but for now hard-coded test data is fine

2737638
hash	salt
using the user name or hash thereof as a salt leverages user name uniqueness usually on a given system at a given time user names are unique
this prevents locally space-wise sharing if the attacker gets a snapshot of all hash passwords he cannot attack them in parallel with cost sharing
he will have to incur the hash dictionary cost for every attacked password

maybe this can also help you to solve your problem too
with dockstype.top you can t change the width of your textboxes cause they are docked
you can only change the height

for-loop	arrays
with that you won t have to look at each single object

my suspicion is that it s trying to figure out whether x will fit in a 32-bit integer but i can t for the life of me figure out why it has the odd range at the beginning and why it makes the big positive exception and the -1 or other big positive depending exception
what it does is validate that x is in the range 0..2020202020 or x 2 31-1 2147483647 the maximum positive value in a 32-bit signed integer or x 2 32-1 4294967295
which would be -1 in a two s complement 32-bit signed integer value or the highest value that can be stored in a 32-bit unsigned integer value

versioning	upgrade
you can use that versioning name when you backup the code and when you refer to the versioning or when you move it somewhere you name the subdiectory that will contian it after the versioning
the versioning that you will put on prod in the near future is a different versioning and if you make changes again this is also a different versioning
as a rule of thumb increase the versioning number when you move or export the code when you swap or exchange or upgrade between locations when you make a demo and after each feature or milestone and each time when you do a full backup

implements	extends
solution i chose i finally decided to write a myveryowninterface that extends myinterface and adds as part of the signature of the faulty methods the myruntimeexception
let s say i have the following java interface that i may not modify and now the class implements it is like this i can t recover from not reading the file
a subclass of runtimeexception can clearly help me but i m not sure if it s the right thing to do the problem is that that exception would then not be documented in the class and a user of the class would possibly get that exception an know nothing about solving this

2738851
implements	extends
define an interface itableadapter as following all tableadapters are partial classes so you can extends them and add your custom code in partial custom class for tableadapter
implements itableadapter on each tableadapter in your typed-data-set
so it might look like this

2738851
implements	extends
edit2 i just came up with another elegant solution for this problem
all you need to do is define the interface itableadapter to map the already implements methods in tableadapters that are generated by the dataset-designer
and extends your tableadapter partial classes like this

i could manually write a simple timer using gettimeofday or something like that but for some cases it won t give accurate results

superclass	subclassing
however if only one is given then you must satisfy its requirements
consider the following code and pay particular attention to the various constructors and how they work with the superclass s constructors edit your code that you added will usually not compile
the subclassing s constructor usually must provide all parameters to the superclass s constructor

2739975
subclass	inherited
this is particularly true in languages which allow for multiple inherited - as the order of execution can be difficult to determine at first glance in some cases. edit in most languages your edited code will not compile
the subclass typically needs to pass arguments of the same type to the base class constructors
this is language specific but often looks something like in some languages mainly dynamic languages the language will try to automatically convert but you often may still need to specify which of the parent constructors to call

2740068

in c i have a function that looks like this this int returned by this function is an error code in case it fails
the arguments are buff is a chars buffer len is the length of the data in the buffer curse the another chars buffer that contains the result of calling dustyvoodoo so you can see where this is going the result is actually coming back via the third argument

only start this service if a particular command is passed on the command line
the following traits will ensure a very fast startup of this service host this service as the first operation of the client application use the net.tcp or net.pipe binding because they start very quickly keep this service as simple as possible to ensure that as long as the console application doesn t terminate it will remain available the test runner can attempt to connect to this service
retry the attempt if it fails until the console application terminates or a reasonably short timeout period expires

you can only use delete to free memory that was allocated by new

width	height
to be more precise requires javascript
css provides only limited semi- events however you may be able to use the width or orientation media queries to apply different styles based on the width of the window
thus for some browsers you can use which will paint all the text red when the window width is less than its height

2740480
width	height
thus for some browsers you can use which will paint all the text red when the window width is less than its height
more accurately you can use width which will paint the text red when the window is less than 800px wide
try resizing this page to see the effect

2740875
innodb	myisam
another alternative is to pack a myisam table but i believe that makes the table read only and doesn t compress as well as the other options
if you are using the innodb table type in mysql with one of the more recent versions then it s possible to enable compression on an innodb table itself
it s managed at the low level so doesn t change your queries or anything

2740901
for-loop	loops
my question would then be how would you express this in python
even the title of this is going to cause flames i realize python made the deliberate design choice to have the for-loop use explicit iterables with the benefit of considerably simplified code in most cases
however sometimes it is quite a pain to construct an iterable if your test case and update function are complicated and so i find myself writing the following while loops the problem with this is that the update is at the bottom of the while block meaning that if i want to have a continue embedded somewhere in it i have to use duplicate code for the complicated awkard update and run the risk of forgetting it and having my code infinite loops i could go the route of hand-rolling a complicated iterator this strikes me as waaaaay too verbose and complicated

2740976
free	realloc
the reason is because std string s implementation details are part of it s definition
the standard dictates a minimum functionality set for std string but compiler writers are free to implement that however they choose
one might have a function named realloc to handle the internal reallocation while another may have a function named buy_node or something

do i have separate classes that populate each of their relevant attributes with a single query

2741240
put	get
if your output starts with two lines you don t want then you can just do iterating over multiple known values in for f the problem with your second code snippet is that for iterates line-wise
so when you give it a single environment variable it will tokenize it and put the tokens into different variables but the loop runs only once per line
also note that using set here is a bit error-prone as you might get more back than you want

isapi	iirf
there are also other third-party url rewriters with varying degrees of mod_rewrite-compatibility and varying price points

haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme
if you want to look at some powerful tools commonly used by academic language designers i suggest that you check out functional programming languages ml scheme lisp haskell ocaml scala clojure etc.
personally i prefer haskell with parsec but there are many options
i think the common consensus is that the structure of these languages is more conducive to language design and implementation at least in a theoretical sense

2741810
x86	mips
ok here s another alternative here s variation on the above that includes the suggestions from cpstubing06
one possible alternative might be for x86 architecture the alignment isn t going to matter that much it s more a performance issue that isn t really relevant for the code you have provided
for other architectures eg mips misaligned accesses cause cpu exceptions

this will also address your playing around concern
if the developers need to share code they can just pull from each other

but i m not sure how to make this exception for accessor in checkstyle config and suspect it may not be possible
so we d like our accessor to look something like this in fact we d rather not have trivial accessor at all and instead just annotate the private member variables with properties or something and have the accessor generated for us since writing endless get and set code delivers no real benefit but that s a general java frustration and an aside as far as this question goes.

boost	allocator
this is probably what your friend meant when he said you shouldn t be using new you should be using a container class instead in which case he would be mostly correct.
although there are smart pointer classes such as boost shared_ptr which provide you with these same safety guarantees and where you would still need to use new so he still isn t quite right
note that if you have only one object array that you are allocator then this is not an issue.

if you mix secure and unsecure requests in a page the user will get a warning so when the page is requested using https it will have to requests the scripts using https also

it s not obvious to me where in the code you want to do this although i do have a couple of other comments about your code conceptually pyobject_istrue returns a boolean

apache-fop	xhtml
xsl-fo is generally used to generate pdf
for that you will need an xsl-fo engine such as apache-fop renderx antenna house ibex etc
however you can convert xsl-fo into xhtml and then render in the browser

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
it is possible to create both xsl-fo and xhtml at the same time without maintaining two complete sets of stylesheets to create similar output in different vocabularies
rather than choosing between one format or the other or having to maintain two distinctly diffirent but similar stylesheet libraries you can create your main stylesheet library to generate either xsl-fo or xhtml and then use a second transform to convert from xsl-fo to xhtml and vice-versa
there are existing xslt stylesheets that you can leverage to do this

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
there are existing xslt stylesheets that you can leverage to do this
in the past i have developed xsl-fo stylesheets and then used the render-x fo2html stylesheet to convert the xsl-fo to xhtml output
it converts elements into into etc

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
it converts elements into into etc
i haven t used them before but you could also try using html2fo stylesheets to convert xhtml outut into xsl-fo
out of the box you can get amazingly similar output in both formats while maintaining one xslt library dedicated to one particular output format

folder	directory
this is very useful if you have to overload some built-in matlab functions for a subset of your code

i have modified startup.m so that it recursively looks for directory in my matlab startup directory and adds them to the path it also runs svn update on everything

2748443
folder	directory
otherwise you can look into object-oriented code where you store all the methods in a objectname folder
however this may lead to a lot of re-writing code that can be avoided by updating the path there is even a button add with subfolders if you add the folder to the path from the file menu and doing a bit of moving code
edit if you would like to organize your code so that some functions are only visible to the functions that call them directly and if you don t want to re-write in oop you put the calling functions in a directory and within this directory you create a subdirectory called private

2748528
jobs	cron
for instance instructing the machine to zip a large file or to run some processing script on a large input file would typically be a job

getattr	subclassing
for example this is how unittest.testloader finds the names of all the test methods to run lifted from usr lib python2.6 unittest.py just like your proposal unittest uses dir to list all the attributes of testcaseclass and filters the list for those whose name startswith prefix which is set elsewhere to equal test
i suggest a few minor changes if you place the functions in mymodule.py then of course the import statement must be import mymodule use getattr instead of .__dict__.get
not only is it shorter but it continue to work if you subclassing mymodule

the comparators are essentially the same as your s x y function though if you really want this to be fast you shouldn t be using min and max because then you re doing twice the number of comparisons that are necessary

to use the orm you ll have to set up the django environment in your script
looking at a manage.py file shows how to do this from django.core.management import setup_environ import settings setup_environ settings now you can call whatever view you want from myapp.views import some_view some_view ... keep in mind that the convention is for view functions to take an httprequest object as their first parameter and to return a httpresponse object
you could build a request object yourself but if you really aren t interested in using httpresponse or httprequest objects perhaps you should just not call your methods views

installation	upgrade
that s fine if you are happy running perl 5.8.9 rather than perl 5.10.0 hint if you aren t sure of the differences then the differences don t matter
it s usually advised to not make extra installation to the system perl
apple may upgrade components through regular system updates which could interfere with any modifications you have made and if you make a mistake with an installation it s difficult to remedy it without doing a full system reinstallation or having some serious understanding of the operating system guts

apple may upgrade components through regular system updates which could interfere with any modifications you have made and if you make a mistake with an installation it s difficult to remedy it without doing a full system reinstallation or having some serious understanding of the operating system guts
so since you ve already got another perl installation ready i would strongly encourage you to stick with that one
however you probably shouldn t be manually installing libraries if there is already a distribution available on macports

int	chars	int	chars
with c and c++ prefer use of int over chars and short
the main reason behind this is that c and c++ perform arithmetic operations and parameter passing at int level if you have an int value that can fit in a byte you should still consider using an int to hold the number
if you use a chars the compiler will first convert the values into int perform the operations and then convert back the result to chars

however wxpython is more straight forward and you can easily start working on it and learn it from zero fast .it provides and awesome resources and decumentation
but qt provides more powerful features that you cant find in wxpython for example the multi touch detection qt also provides good support for drawing devices like pc tablets and so on . qt also provides a good designer that makes u create interfaces faster

subtract	add
keep a queue of all the values of x within the first 8 minutes and the total for that 8 minutes
every time you advance one second you can dequeue the oldest value of x and subtract it from your running total

inside the ac_check_header i then add the location to cpflags and the #include of the header file in the actual c code picks it up nicely
given a configure argument that has been put into location and the name of the needed files are helper.h and helper.a which are both in the same directory here is what works so far where i run into difficulties is getting the binary .a file linked in
no matter what i try i always get an error about undefined references to the function calls for that library

fgets	fread	fgets	fread
speed is not a reason to use one over the other as those two functions just don t do the same thing if you want to read a line from a text file then use fgets if you want to read some data not necessarily a line from a file then use fread
fgets reads a line -- it will stop at a newline
fread reads raw data -- it will stop after a specified or default number of bytes independently of any newline that might or might not be present

subclass	inherited
the problem is that static properties are not being inherited in subclasses and so if i use the static keyword in my main class it sets the variable in my main class as well
it works if i redeclare the static variables in my subclass but i expect to have a large number of static properties and subclasses and wish to avoid code duplication

versioning	upgrade
if your project is hosted on a shared host you will have to stick with the python versioning installed on the host personally i am stuck with python 2.4.4 hoping my hosting provider will upgrade to 2.5 or 2.6 which will not come anytime soon
for a web project chose the python versioning that is supported by your hosting provider
if you are lucky to have a dedicated server then chose whatever versioning is best supported by the framework you chose

dependencyobject	observablecollection
currently i have with the following xaml unfortunatly when i actually run this i get an exception stating a binding cannot be used within a textbox collection
a binding can only be set on a dependencyproperty of a dependencyobject
this only seems to be a problem when the attached property is of type observablecollection so it seems like wpf is trying to do something magical when binding properties of this type and getting confused in the process

next	except
using the other two validation controls together need no extra implementation except for a couple of attributes being set and it is the expected way of doing this type of validation with webforms
consider the next programmer that is going to come along and see your different setup and wonder why you went to all this extra work when none of it was needed


2752239
imperative	declarative	imperative	declarative
one thing to consider is that functional languages like f# benefit from a more declarative style of programming
in a sense you are over-specifying the solution in imperative languages such as c++ and this limits the compiler s ability to optimize
a more declarative programming style can theoretically give the compiler additional opportunities for algorithmic optimization

subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
it s one less than a power of two so it can be optimized to a cheaper shift and subtract
the book is saying that you should take advantage of these mathematical equivalences thus is equivalent to where essentially for each basic addition and basic subtraction you replace it with an advanced version that mod the operands and mod the results
since operands to the basic multiplication are now in the range of 0..m-1 the biggest number you ll get is m-1 2 which can alleviate overflow if m is small enough

daemons	systemd
why not install it systemd wide and just make a config file for the daemons involved inside
i ve seen buildout recipes that build supervisor into the buildout i suppose to control the daemons inside
however it seems to me that one would still need something in etc init.d for example to run said supervisor instance on boot

on some architectures ia-32 included citation needed integer division of int_min the smallest representable negative integer value by 1 triggers the signal because the quotient a positive number is not representable

i believe mark has already shed some light on why you are having this particular problem

access it directly array throughout your methods in your class implementation and via its property getter obj.array from other classes

pyquery	lxml	pyquery	beautifulsoup
but beautifulsoup is pure python and thus works on google s app engine as well
or you could be using pyquery since beautifulsoup is not actively maintained anymore see first install pyquery with easy_install pyquery then your script could be as simple as pyquery uses the css selector syntax familiar from jquery which i find more intuitive than beautifulsoup s
it uses lxml underneath and is much faster than beautifulsoup

2752761
fgets	fread
i would get into the habit of trying to stay away from it unless you really need to have it
you can just as easily open up the content when needed using fopen fgets fclose
or fread or file_get_contents instead of storing it into the database why not store it as a file on the server using file_put_contents

you can use case expressions as a more readable alternative to the multiplication

it is also assumed nn is a supervised clasification algorithm that you have a lot of already well classified images your training set

if you are building a web interface i would choose an engine that provides readable markup templates such as genshi does
if you are building a rest server and need to return other types of data i would go with one of the more text oriented engines such as cheetah or mako
for building html pages i prefer genshi over cheetah or mako even if it s quite a bit slower

implements	extends
remember extends a data model is almost always easy add a new table a new column etc. but changing your data model is hard and requires data migration
i advocate using an agile development process implements only what you need right now but make sure you understand the complete problem before modeling it
another thing you should check before starting to hack away your code is wether your chosen infrastructure is appropriate

inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
in this situation does object of subclassing hold an object of its super-class directly or just hold a pointer pointing to an object of its super-class

the shared base-class subobject is called a virtual base class. .
from lippman virtual inherited only avoids duplicate sub-objects inherited from multiple inherited

debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
the only difference is that on linux the current directory is by default not in path so typically you do . myapp if you add current dir to the path then windows-like way myapp will do but this is not recommended due to security risks at least in shared environments you don t want to run tmp ls left by somebody
in windows i simply distribute the executable files with the corresponding dll files if any if you are serious about distributing you should probably learn about .deb ubuntu debian and .rpm redhat centos suse
those are packages which make it easy for the user to install the application using distribution-specific way

post	get
one of the solutions is to follow post-redirect-get pattern
first post do something with data and then redirect if you want to pass something between redirects you can use tempdata after redirect modelstate is gone so the is no value to override
post-redirect-get pattern also helps to get rid of form reposting effect when you press f5 in browser

implements	extends
this is not very useful as it is but it shows how to create an instance of an anonymous inner class that extends object and override its tostring method
see also jls 15.9.5 anonymous class declarations anonymous inner classes are very handy when you need to implements an interface which may not be highly reusable and therefore not worth refactoring to its own named class
an instructive example is using a custom for sorting

2755464
try-catch	exception-handling
if you were to decide to wrap most of the program in that try-catch block but would still like to dynamically allocate the simplemidiout object you could make the memory management a bit easier by using an auto_ptr to manage the memory for you in the event of an exception-handling ...but you may as well just create the simplemidiout object as local rather than dynamic
personally i prefer the first style you ve used - method 1 - that of allocating the simplemidiout object as local to the scope of the try-catch block
for me one of the benefits of a try-catch block is that is provides a neat tidy place for that error handling code - the catch block - that allows you to specify your business logic in one nice readable unbroken flow

multiplying	add	n-gram	words
bleu is an evaluation metric that is used to score how similar the translations produced by a machine translation system are to translations produced by humans
smooth bleu is calculated like the normal bleu score except that you add one to the n-gram match counts so that you avoid multiplying anything by zero when evaluating short segments of text
smooth-bleu should be much faster to compute than the levenshtein distance while still capturing words order information since it looks at n-gram matches rather than just matches between single words

if it matches user s pw is reset note that the user s password is already stored in a hashed and salt form and i m just hashing it once more to get a unique but repeatable string

union	distinct	union	distinct
if your engine s optimizer doesn t do an efficient job with that i might look deeper but anything else would probably involve a lot of left joins since it looks you are joining two distinct uses of annotations for the same reason your inner join attempt failed all join criteria must be satisfied you would have to change almost everything to left join or left join to a nested inner join - i think the union is simplest

by reading the code i can see in the method columnseries.updatedatapoint there is this line of code so that s a pretty definitive no you cannot change the gap in between columns by setting a public properties

later edit ok i got it to work

int	boolean
this variant provides conversions between different types so sqlvalue 2010-05-03 01 01 04 .astimestamp gives the expected timestamp object
sqlite itself recognizes only five data types null int real text and blob

unfortunately it depends on your php installation what the default algorithm is so you will want to check if it s something that s still considered reasonably secure

spaces	delimiter
the problem i ve got is that the data isn t obviously delimiter technically i suppose it s space delimiter
now if it wasn t for the fact that some of the values contain leading or trailing spaces i could probably make a few reasonable assumptions and code something to break a row up based on spaces
but as the values themselves may or may not contain spaces i don t see an obvious way to do this

otherwise any insert update delete statements that run on your myisam tables while mysqldump is running may or may not be reflected in the output depending on the timing of those statements
if you are using innodb then you can run mysqldump with the --single-transaction flag and get a consistent snapshot without locking the tables
if you are using myisam then you need to lock the tables to get a consistent snapshot

here is my new approach and wanted to see if anyone can provide feedback code review before i implements my suggestion

in essence i would like to have a validator which conforms to this regex but i don t want the user to ever have to type a space as delimiter
likewise when editing what they types the spaces should be managed implicitly

struts	stripes
when you stripes away all the buzzwords from spring what you re left with is a simple framework for integrating disparate application components making it easier to swap these components out for alternatives modernising as you go
for example spring gives you integration with struts 1 making it easier to introduce struts 1 components into the spring way
your struts apps should operate as before but now they ve got the leverage to get themselves modernised from the bottom up

i ve tried rebuilding all and cleaning the project already
in flexbuilder 3 for some mxml files i can purposely put in syntax errors and the compiler will seem to compile the specific page but actually not compile it or report any errors for that page
is there any way that you know of to get the compiler to report the errors to me so i can get it to compile the page

integer	unsigned
i can t recall where but i read somewhere that arithmetic on unsigned integral types is modular so if that were the case then -1 uint_max mod uint_max+1
i have read in many places that integer overflow is well-defined in c unlike the signed counterpart

i do not understand the documentation for gprof regarding how to compile your program for profiling with gprof
in g++ is it required to compile with the -g option debugging information in a addition to the -pg option or not

if you were to plot the matrix it would look like a handful of white dots on a black background. 3 use the use morphological dilation to take every position point and set the values of their neighbors to 1 instead of 0 so that when you plot you get a set of disc-shaped white objects centered on the points from step 2
4 use a program to write each matrix from 3 to an image file and put them in a common folder
5 at runtime use another program to import each image from the folder one at a time displaying them on the screen in the same figure window

udp	tcp
the fastest way with wcf would probably be using net tcp with one-way messages but you still have quite a bit of overhead
i d suggest that you consider programming the sockets directly using udp or look into a c# lib that does it for you like lidgren here are some nice beginner tutorials but they are in c c++ but they show what you need to consider when you want to write networking code for games otherwise have a look at how networking is done with xna
here is a networking example it really depends on what kind of game you want to use it for

in order to create the second view in my uinavigationcontroller i had this i took that code from another forum and it did work straight away so i could not imagine that i was going to have problems with it
with the above code if i understand it correctly i m creating a new uiviewcontroller for my second view and that s why i was able to switch to that second view and have a working back button
anyhow in order to configure my own button to go back i should have written the following apparently i was initializing correctly a random uiviewcontroller but as i was not indicating properly which one it was fueluplift2viewcontroller my method to return to the first view could not work properly

sorting	grouping
the problem you are actually looking to tackle is the 2 dimensional bin packing problem with bins of equal size and items of variable size
as mentioned in this answer to a question about bin packing sorting your items from largest to smallest and then fitting smaller words in between the large ones will usually result in a fairly good approximation
you will have to try it out with the types of words you ll be using to find out whether this will work for you his approach may result in many small words grouping at the bottom of your cloud

2762020
int	chars
only a few substrings of the type names matter as for as the type affinity is concerned
int int smallint tinyint int affinity because they all contain int

2762020
int	double
as for the capacity of each type integer is always signed 64-bit
note that sqlite optimizes the storage of small int behind-the-scenes so tinyint wouldn t be useful anyway
real is always 64-bit double

noexcept	throw	noexcept	throw

i think i can correctly trigger this via the upgrade checking code like so where 1.0.x was the old way and 1.1.x will be the new way thus i could do something in a custom action based on movesavefilesupgraded but the heart of the problem i cant see how to move non-installed files from one location to another
to support window vista in my game i have changed were the save files are placed from under program files to my documents for both xp and vista installation
now i would like to be able to move the current xp users save games from the old location to the new location

use it with care
if others have already pulled your repo they won t be able to pull that new master history without replacing their own master with that new github master branch or dealing with lots of merges
there are alternatives to a git push --force for public repos

2763140
int	double
it s a variation simplification of some big int libraries i ve developed in the past and its associated output
just wait around for a 256-bit compiler then use int - no seriously since you just want to start with 1 and keep doubling your best bet is to get a big int library like gnu mp
you would do that with a piece of code like untested you could code up your own data structure of an array of longs with only two operations double and print but i think it would be far easier to just use gmp

2763164
udp	tftp
the only difference i m seeing so far is that tftp doesn t do the + 1 .
there s no special handshake for udp -- each udp service if it needs one specifies its own
usually though a server doesn t expect the client to be able to listen on all of its ports simultaneously

2763188
accessor	properties
this leads to the desire for lightweight events which are events that don t hold onto a reference
this is not offered by default in .net framework out-of-the-box so if you wanted to implement this you would have to use the add and remove accessor when declaring your event along with a weakreference to store the delegate that is passed through the implicit value parameter
then when you fire the events you would check your weakreference collection you have to maintain that separately to do this specifically the isalive and target properties to determine if the delegate has been collected

2763306
int	double
c++ requires the function to be declared before it is used c does not unless you tell your compiler to warn you about the issue
a holdover of the c language is that it allows functions to be called without actually requiring the declaration visible within the translation -- it just assumes that the arguments of such functions are all int
in your example c++ allows for overloading and does not support implicit function declarations - the compiler uses the visible function fun double and the linker fails because the function fun double is never implemented

maven	pom.xml
if project-a-1.0.jar is used by all projects one possible solution would be to declare this under the dependencymanagement section of a corporate pom.xml to not repeat yourself
global exclusion of artifacts would be a nice feature to deal with this kind of situation - same artifact with different names - until maven provides a better way to deal with specs jars aka virtual dependencies
unfortunately such a feature is currently not available see mng-3196 and mng-1977 so you will have to declare dependency exclusions to exclude the unwanted artifact from the dependency pulling it transitively

superclass	subclassing
the reason for this is
i dont know until runtime what the class is that i want the nib object to be though they will have the same uiview based superclass and i dont want to create a different nib for every eventuality - as the .nib will be the same for each apart from the class of one object
i have been successful with a couple of methods but either have some knock on effects or am unsure of how safe the methods i have used are method 1 override alloc on the superclass and set a c variable to the class i require this works well and i assume is reasonably safe though if have a nib with the correct class as the class identity in the nib or i alloc a subclassing myself without setting theclassiwant - an object of the base class is created

maven	m2e	maven	m2e
just in case if you decide to install m2e make sure to install the optional maven integration for wtp component from the the m2e extras update site
you shouldn t mess with facets and eclipse configuration files manually these files should be derived from the maven poms
to do so either use the maven-eclipse-plugin to generate eclipse specific files from your maven project or use the m2e plugin to make eclipse able to deal with maven projects

2764201
maven	m2e
to do so either use the maven-eclipse-plugin to generate eclipse specific files from your maven project or use the m2e plugin to make eclipse able to deal with maven projects
both approaches provide maven eclipse integration and support the wtp allow to get your project recognized as a dynamic project than you can run on a server.
but are also different

noexcept	throw	noexcept	throw
the compiler probably doesn t know that and throw a warning which becomes noise which probably just gets disabled by the programmer for being useless negating the point of the warning
a similar issue is if you have a function which is not specified with noexcept ie
can throw exceptions which you want to call from many functions some noexcept some not

post	get
so they can not communicate directly
you ll basicly have two options post the value make a form with a post action submit the form and you can access the value in php with the array disadvantage is that the browser leaves the page to submit the form but it doesn t require javascript
use ajax get the value in javascript make an xmlhttprequest to the server and you can access the variable too via or depending on how you sent the value

2764530
msg	eml
if you want to check and see whether your smtp mails actually are sent out you can also add these lines of code to your app s app.config or web.config and let .net put your mails into a directory as eml files your mails will now be stored into the c temp mails directory as eml files and you can have a look at them and check to see whether they are as they should be
you might want to wrap your smtp call into a try...catch block - that way you can easily catch any obvious smtp related errors that might happen this will handle the most obvious errors like smtp server not found smtp server not responding smtp refusing you to send because you didn t provide any or valid credentials once the smtp server has your msg it s out of your .net hands..
you can t really do much except check for the smtp server s logs for errors

put	get
i want to get a list arraylist of all the numbers integer objects that appear in each list
my thinking so far is iterate through each arraylist and put all the values into a hashset this will give us a listing of all the values in the lists but only once iterate through the hashset 2.1 with each iteration perform arraylist.contains 2.2 if none of the arraylists return false for the operation add the number to a master list which contains all the final values
if you can come up with something faster or more efficient funny thing is as i wrote this i came up with a reasonably good solution

if you can limit the length of the string to a realistic max size the following might work write each entry into a binary file the entries have the same size so you waste some bytes with each entry int a int b int stringsize string padding to read an entry open the file as a random access file multiply the index with the length of an entry to get the offset and seek the position
put the bytes into a bytebuffer and read the values the string has to be converted with the string byte int start int length charset ctor
if you can t limit the length of a block dump the strings in an additional file and only store the offsets in your table

short	base
every match is a base number the shortest one a direct number plus extension all longer ones i d mark those in the database for faster lookup if possible

folder	directory
make sure you don t accidentally uninstall a module which has an uninstall script attached you can use the dnn file manager to upload delete rename files within the portals directory so it may make sense to put files there if site administrators should have control of them putting content outside of the module s folder will make it slightly more difficult to link to especially if it s on a portal specific folder you have to ask the portalsettings object for the path every time it s uncommon to keep resources outside of the module s folder and so may cause confusion if you bring an experienced dnn developer into the project
if you own the entire dnn installation then it can certainly make sense to consolidate all of your resources into one place whether its the resources folder used by dnn or a different folder that dnn doesn t know about
if you re developing a module that will be installed onto a site that you don t totally own then the considerate thing to do is to constrain your resources within the desktopmodules folder for your module

actionscript	haxe
my personal advice to web developers is to have a look at haxe
it is a much more powerful elegant and expressive language than actionscript and it allows you to target many platforms
enough to build a whole web app on classic platforms with only one language

2766529
client-side	server-side
on the client side you could use something like jquery to find these elements and hide them i would probably do this in response when the page is fully loaded one downside to hiding elements in javascript is that if there s enough data it may take a second and cause content to flicker
another difference is that hiding content client-side does not remove it from the dom - the content is there just hidden
hiding controls server-side prevents their content from even being emitted to the html

maven	pom.xml
do you have the this local profile and the local filter
while applicationcontext-test.xml overrides the default datasource to supply a unitils datasource the applicationcontext.xml still declares the following property that gets replaced during maven filtering so if you want to run integration tests against an hsqldb database unitils seems to be configured to do so my understanding is that you are supposed to use the filter filters-local.properties that is triggered when using the local profile and declares you can check the target classes applicationcontext.xml to confirm this but it seems obvious that you re not getting the above value but postgresqldialect
the odd part is that the pom.xml of mysticpaste declares the local profile as activebydefault at least the version in the project repository it should just work

cpu	processors
a thread will execute for n amount of time milliseconds nanoseconds whatever before the thread scheduler switches execution to a different thread
a lot of cpu instructions can execute in the typical thread timeslice
you can think of it as having a fairly large chunk of free play exclusive processors time during which you probably won t run into resource collisions because nothing else is executing on the processors

2768002
cpu	processors
you can think of it as having a fairly large chunk of free play exclusive processors time during which you probably won t run into resource collisions because nothing else is executing on the processors
when running on a multiproc machine though cpu instructions in two threads execute exactly at the same time
the size of the free play chunk of time is near zero

ready	each
each team has a clone of our shared master repository on which they are applying their changesets
the changesets are verified at that level at which point they are ready to be pushed into the master
to simplify lets say developer a and b are both on red team

operands	scalar
i just get this warning warning imaginary parts of complex x and or y arguments ignored
the operator is the matrix multiplication operator which requires its operands to have matching inner matrix dimensions
the operator is the element-wise multiplication operator which requires its operands to have the same size or for one to be a scalar so it can perform multiplication on each matching pair of elements

2768172
hash	salt
if the user loses the password in this case instead of emailing the password to the user you email the user a new randomly generated password
storing only the hash value protects your data even further since even if the user has read access to your database the hash values offer no advantage and there is no secret key that will unlock all of your hash values
when you hash the passwords be sure to use a random salt value and store the salt to protect your list of hashes against rainbow attacks

cpu	processors
to select only 32-bit operating systems.
the simple wmi query that you used does indeed return a result for every physical cpu in the computer
it will only return one result if you have a single processors multiple core cpu

cpu	processors
it will only return one result if you have a single processors multiple core cpu
we can safely assume the computer has atleast one cpu so lets just use the information from cpu0

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for some reason the widths of the characters on firefox are smaller
oddly in the test case i measure two things the total width of the entire text the sum of the widths of each character in the text in google-chrome they both come out at 399px
in firefox the first comes out as 393px the second at 367px

2768559
post	get
the biggest problem with token based csrf protection is that it takes alot of time to go back and fix every request and you will probably miss a few requests
a secure way to implement this is to check the referer on all incoming post requests and use post for sensitive functions like changing passwords adding user accounts executing code making configuration changes
get should only be used for navigation or searching basically get is safe for anything that doesn t cause a state change

nsmutablestring	nsstring	nsmutablestring	nsstring
for an nsstring this is simply the contents of the string
there are a few problems with your sample code you should be using a nsmutablestring to build up an output string by appending multiple parts
nsstring is an immutable class which means that each time you call stringbyappendingformat you are incurring the overhead of creating an additional new nsstring object which will need to be collected and released by the autorelease pool

2768606
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring is an immutable class which means that each time you call stringbyappendingformat you are incurring the overhead of creating an additional new nsstring object which will need to be collected and released by the autorelease pool
you should use appendstring on your nsmutablestring to append content instead of stringbyappendingformat or appendformat
the format methods are intended for creating new strings based on a format specifier which includes special fields as placeholders

winpcap	pcap.net
if you don t mind using c# you can try using pcap.net which would do all that for you much more easily including the parsing of ethernet ipv4 and tcp parts of the packet
if by hijack you meant sniff the packets then what you should do to do it with winpcap is the following find the device you want to use - see winpcap tutorial
open a device using pcap_open use a function that reads packets from the descriptor like pcap_loop this will loop until something wrong has happened or the loop was broken using a special method call

2768753
folder	directory
add the directory with the debug versions to your delphi configuration
there should already be a folder listed there that contains the delphi-provided debug dcus
when you set up two different versions you allow yourself to choose whether you want to step into the library code

2768810
csv	tsv
tsv instead of csv it also occurs to me that i m not wedded to csv. tsv would make a lot of the headaches with delimiters and quotes go away just replace tabs with spaces in the entries of the 2d array and then just intersperse tabs and newlines and you re done. let s include solutions for both tsv and csv in the answers to make this as useful as possible for future searchers
for example given a 2d array like this return the following string a b c 1 2 3 n i comma-heart you i heart u too which when printed would look like this a b c 1 2 3 i heart you i heart u too i m taking csv.dictwriter s word for it that that is in fact the canonical way to output that array as csv
excel does parse it correctly that way though mathematica does not

2768954
versioning	upgrade

any versioning of data alias built before versioning 1.08 released october 22nd 2010 bst won t work with perl 5.12 as data alias prior to 1.08 is broken in perl 5.12
upgrade to the latest versioning 1.08 or newer and it should work

2768958
csv	tsv
one workaround is to just use tsv instead of csv. i tested the above with tsv and it seems to work even with tabs embedded in the entries of the array
consider the following 2 by 2 array if we export that to csv and then import it again we don t get the same thing back looking at tmp.csv it s clear that the export didn t work since the quotes are not escaped properly
according to the rfc which i presume is summarized correctly on wikipedia s entry on csv the right way to export the above array is as follows a b c 1 2 3 i heart you i heart u too importing the above does not yield the original array either. so import is broken as well

maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
the following is its pom.xml file
basically you can use source dependency with eclipse s referenced projects binary dependency using the jar of bundle a but since binary dependency is much cleaner it is also the kind of dependency best managed by a release management framework like maven
and you can integrate maven in your eclipse project through m2e

2769058
maven	m2e
and you can integrate maven in your eclipse project through m2e
the maven plugin to use would then be maven-bundle-plugin that you can see in action in using maven to create an osgi bundle osgi felix sample bundle plugin for maven getting the benefits of maven-bundle-plugin in other project types how to build osgi bundles using maven bundle plugin consider this more real-world example using felix log service implementation
the log service project is comprised of a single package org.apache.felix.log.impl

post	get
check out the resources and see if that helps you a step or two further - if not we ll have to get a lot more info from you
the best starting point would be tom hollander s three part blog post msmq wcf and iis getting them to play nice part 1 msmq wcf and iis getting them to play nice part 2 msmq wcf and iis getting them to play nice part 3 and have a good look at the msdn docs on queues in wcf - lots of stuff there too
the error you re getting would indicate some problem with the communication channel - something went wrong the channel has been faulted rendered unusable

2769175
folder	directory
i thought about displaying them like wordpress is previewing its templates with a small preview window displaying the concrete file with styles and everything
i believe i can manage but it is the concept itself about iterating over several folder and then finding all index.htm and index.html pages and displaying them
i ve not worked very much with directory in php and the only references and code stumps i ve found so far is just to list all the files in a certain directory like what it contains

2769296
union	distinct
so you could run a separate query for each distinct value and generate the results you need much faster than by using a group by query that creates a temp table to do the sorting
or you could run a subquery for each status value and union them together because your covering index includes cp_flag and web_status these queries never need to read the actual rows in the table
they only read entries in the index which they can access much faster because a they re in a sorted tree and b they may be cached in memory if you allocate enough to your key_buffer_size

put	get	put	get
try the following this should get you what you re after though you may want to put a margin on all 4 sides not just 2...
if you just want an outer border the easiest way is to put it in a border control the reason you re seeing the border completely fill your control is that by default it s horizontalalignment and verticalalignment are set to stretch
try the following this should get you what you re after though you may want to put a margin on all 4 sides not just 2...

2769378
hash	md5
edit at the end of our php we get an md5 of the xml output of the plist we are generating on the server like this then we get the hash of the plist on the iphone from userdefaults like so and the server s hash from the nsurlrequest like so then we compare the two and start the download only if the hashes don t match this code is written by my very capable partner oliver rice
we check for updates by querying the server for a hash value in the header of a plist that is spit out via a php file that queries the server database
you can store that hash locally and compare it to the last time the app ran

2769565
strsplit	substr
then simply substr the text with the area you found
second method use strsplit by the n character creates an array of strings each one containing a different line from the text in order of array index
find the index of the line the text is in and then simply grab from the string index for the line before including and after

2769583
for-loop	arrays
an alternative for the checks on position could be something like - which would handle both of them at once
using the linq extension methods to get the right strings this can of course be optimized a bit by quitting the for-loop as soon as the index has been found and probably a number of other things
you can probably even linqify so you never need to actually store that extra arrays but i can t think of a good way to do that right now

2769668
udp	tcp
here are the api docs for changing the receive buffer size with boost the example appears to be wrong in that it shows a tcp socket rather than a udp socket but changing that back to udp should be easy the trivially obvious change should be the right one
one option is to take advantage of the fact that when the local receive buffer for your udp socket fills up subsequently received packets will push older ones out of the buffer
you can set the local receive buffer size to be large enough for one packet but not two

2769744
public	protected
obviously you can get carried away with classes but it s typically easier to test a lot of small single-operation classes as opposed to one or two large all-encompassing classes
the question on public vs
protected depends on how you plan to use this code

2769936
gedit	nano
c# as this is your native language i guess you need to know what features you wanna implement ...if it s using a gui or just from a terminal like nano vim how syntax highlighting works how to open and save files how autocompletion works etc
you might want to take look at some open source editors like dev-c++ or gedit also as you in person are more web-devvy you might want to start creating one which runs in a web browser
this is often easier and helps you understand the basics of creating a code editor

2769962
shadowing	named	shadowing	named
it s why it s a good idea to named your variables so that they don t ever have named which could clash
one variable is shadowing the other
it s just like if you declared a member variable named x and then had a member function which declared its own x except that here one of the variables is in the base class and one is in a derived class

user-controls	tabcontrol
most importantly i m binding a tabcontrol to an observablecollection of viewmodels
this means that am using a tabbed mdi interface that displays a user-controls as the content of a tabitem
the issue i m seeing in my application is that when i have several tabs and i flip back and forth between tabs the content is being refersh each time i change tabs

2770737
base	fractions
define base conversion in terms of a function double alternate_base double base const
base conversion is simply dividing the logarithm by the natural log of the alternate base
it is probably most convenient to return the integer and fractions parts together in a single double

2770891
queue	fifo
the answer depends greatly on the sort of queries you re going to be executing but the answer may be some kind of no-sql database couchdb or berkeleydb etc
if the queue has a large-ish number of messages on it then enumerating those messages will become a serious bottleneck
msmq was designed for fifo kind of access and anything that doesn t follow that pattern can cause you lots of grief in terms of performance

2770938
firefox	safari
the third menu isn t vertical because the lis have float left use the following css to correct you will need to set the left top options for the .menu3 to position it on the page where you want
if you use firefox firebug you should install the web developer and firebug extensions
if you use safari you can enable the developer tools if you use internet explorer 8 then you can also enable developer tools

uiview	caanimation	uiview	calayer
using other uiview static methods you can control several details of the animation
every uiview has a calayer that also has a few properties that can be animated the most interesting of which is the 3d transform property
if the basic animation is not sufficient for you needs you can either look into caanimation and related classes or look to a third party animation library

2771080
gtk	jhbuild
use jhbuild shell to start up an environment
original answer the best way to compile gtk programs on os x is to install macports and then use that to install gtk by typing sudo port install gtk2 in a terminal
install any other packages you end up needing in the same fashion

2771853
ftp	smb
as mentined by gxg if this is a windows or smb environment and you had the necessary permissions and file sharing was enabled you could try ipaddress share filename
if the remote machine is across the internet or file sharing is not available protocols such as ftp are designed for uploading files to a remote machine but the remote machine will need to be running an ftp server
.net has native support for ftp since .net 2.0 you could roll your own listener that listens for connections on the target machine and receives the binary file stream and writes it to disk

2772381
inherited	subclassing
there might be other possibilities largely depending on your environment requirements like function pointers delegates the strategy pattern gof or such constructs
what you usually can do to ease the situation to some extent is use inherited
if you for example have two classes increase and nonincrease that are subclassing of the same superclass you can have a method dosomething that does - well - something according to whatever class you currently have

2772491
opera	safari	opera	firefox
it looks like it is some kind of extension in firefox
this will not work in opera ie or safari
for those they might use different methods

2772602
getter	setter	public	protected	public	protected
valid modifiers are private internal protected
if you have an existing private variable and you want to expose some public properties then you should do the following you could also avoid the need for the internal private variable by using a automatic properties as jwl has pointed out in the comments you can also set modifiers on getter and setter
valid modifiers are private internal protected

2772641
moq	typemock
inversion of control and dependency injection are some possible design strategies that can reduce coupling and increase cohesion of your classes and eliminate the need to mock internal methods
i don t believe there is a clear path to non-public mocking with moq
but if you absolutely must you can use typemock isolator to mock just about anything

2772672
moq	moles

not with moq
but you can use the free moles framework from ms to do such things

2772934
floating-point	integer
to figure out which range it lies in you could walk linearly through your array or you could do a binary search
you could skip the normalization step and the use of floating-point if you wanted
assign cumulative probabilities 1 3 6 10 ... but make it understood that the actual probability is the stored integer value divided by n n+1 2

altitude is neglected from calculations

2773226
udp	tcp
so here the local an remote machines can reliably send the data back and forth using the established ports
for udp this is not the case i am assuming you are using datagramsocket
since udp is asynchronous as opposed to synchronous like tcp to recieve data you are not creating a binding to another specific machine so for example if you were to try the udp socket does not know where the data is coming from so there can not be a unique mapping like tcp also unlike tcp the port you specify is your machine s port not a remote machine port

2773357
superclass	subclassing
let there be the following interfaces and classes then there would be a class which will return one of the above classes depending on a condition which is passed in through a method then a class which uses the above factory method which returns the appropriate implementation depending on a condition
it is not possible to conditionally control whether or not to use a superclass constructor as one of the superclass constructors must be called before constructing one s own object
from the above there is a requirement in java that the first line of the constructor must call on of the superclass constructor -- in fact even if there is no explicit call to a superclass constructor there will be an implicit call to super it should be stressed that it is not possible to call the superclass constructor after performing something else the alternative that said a way to achieve what is desired here could be to use the factory method pattern which can select the kind of implementation depending on some kind of condition in the above code depending on condition the method can return either an instance of b or c assuming both are a subclassing of class a

2773408
content-length	content-type
extension at post below
rfc2616 the content-length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body in decimal number of octets sent to the recipient or in the case of the head method the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a get
it doesn t matter what the content-type is

2773412
content-length	content-type
an example is content-length 3495 applications should use this field to indicate the transfer-length of the message-body unless this is prohibited by the rules in section 4.4
any content-length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value. section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body if a content-length is not given
note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from the corresponding definition in mime where it is an optional field used within the message external-body content-type

2773417
submit	submission	submit	submission
in this case the content-type header is usually application x-www-form-urlencoded and the content-length header gives the length of the url-encoded form data here s a note on url-encoding . the cgi script receives the message body through stdin and decodes it. here s a typical form submission using post post path script.cgi http 1.0 from frog jmarshall.com user-agent httptool 1.0 content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded content-length 32
from this page the most common use of post by far is to submit html form data to cgi scripts
in this case the content-type header is usually application x-www-form-urlencoded and the content-length header gives the length of the url-encoded form data here s a note on url-encoding . the cgi script receives the message body through stdin and decodes it. here s a typical form submission using post post path script.cgi http 1.0 from frog jmarshall.com user-agent httptool 1.0 content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded content-length 32

2773465
content-length	content-type
in case of content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded the encoded data is sent to the processing agent designated so you can set the length or size of the data you are going to post
the content-length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body in decimal number of octets sent to the recipient or in the case of the head method the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a get
content-length content-length 1 digit an example is content-length 1024 applications should use this field to indicate the transfer-length of the message-body

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i fix a problem so it works with http 1.1 allowing it to work with google-chrome and firefox safari 4 on windows crashes the proxy though for some reason
when i tested in firefox and google-chrome i discovered the performance problems were not there which implied it was an ie problem not a problem with the proxy
after resetting the browsing history settings the problem went away

2773490
submit	submission
alternatively prevent submission by making the form s submit handler return false
the clicking of the button will submit the form the normal way when placed inside the form
return false at the end of your click handler and it should work as expected

2773564
installation	upgrade	installation	upgrade
since it runs on the 2.0 environment there is no need to upgrade the machines if the have .net 2.0 on them
yes you can just include the 3.5 libraries you need with the application installation just use the copy local when you build the project
since it runs on the 2.0 environment there is no need to upgrade the machines if the have .net 2.0 on them

2773803
innodb	myisam
your index definition does not include emp_no so in myisam using index would be impossible even with the force index clause
however innodb tables are clustered and every index implicitly contains the primary key as a record pointer
this means that your index is in fact an index on dept_no from_date emp_no dept_no and hence contains all the fields required

2773840
filesystems	xfs
there is only one disk and if every deletion requires a write to disk it is going to be slow
your best bet is to switch to a journaling filesystems that does deletions quickly
i have had good luck with xfs deleting large files 10-40gb quickly but i have not tried deleting directories

2773840
filesystems	xfs
i have had good luck with xfs deleting large files 10-40gb quickly but i have not tried deleting directories
in any case your path to improved performance lies in finding the right filesystems not the right shell script


2773943
free	malloc
however i don t think malloc is necessarily bad practice and i wouldn t change it just to change it
of course you should make sure you always match the allocation mechanisms properly new- delete malloc- free etc.
you could also add a constructor to the struct and use that to initialize the fields

2773953
subtraction	multiplication
i don t know if this is faster or not it depends on whether or not you can do division and multiplication faster than a lot of subtractions
another way to speed up the subtraction approach is to use binary search
if you want a mod b you need to subtract b from a until a is smaller than b

2774040
hash	md5
from there the aspx page creates its own md5 has based off of the userid and the date both passed via the query string
if the 2 hash are identical the user is authenticated and the program loads
here is an example classic asp redirect.aspx

asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
result no more broken links but the site renders ugly urls
i am running asp.net-mvc in a subdomain which points to the test directory on my webhost4life account
html.actionlink about about home it renders a link to -- which gives a 404 the link should be

2774095
icollection	iqueryable
for example what i want to accomplish is to return a collection that is iqueryable so that i can run paging and filtering off of the collection directly from the the parent
i want to have that query executed specifically by nhibernate and not a get all to load a whole collection and then parse it in memory which is what currently happens when i use icollection
the reasoning behind this is that my collection could be huge tens of thousands of records and a get all query could bash my database

2774221
pascal	delphi
there s some dispute over whether it was used by borland delphi 1.x far in a segmented architecture computer a far pointer is a pointer which includes a segment selector making it possible to point to addresses outside of the current segment
for completeness far and pascal are prepreocessor macros that when compiled for 16-bit systems expand to the keywords that were necessary to declare the calling convention and pointer size
on 32-bit systems they generally expand to nothing unless you have a weird default calling convention

2774319
subtraction	addition	subtraction	modulo	subtraction	modulo	addition	modulo	addition	modulo
if the sum is greater than the modulo you then subtract the modulo
if you can predict the overflow you can do the addition and subtraction at the same time
doing the modulo at each step will also reduce the overall size of your multiplier same length as input rather than double

2774319
multiplication	modulo
b edit b here is my implementation in python def mod_mul a b m result 0 a a m b b m while b 0 if b 1
0 result + a if result m result - m a a lt lt 1 if a m a- m b b 1 return result this is just modular multiplication result a b mod m
the modulo operations at the top are not needed but serve a reminder that the algorithm assumes a and b are less than m

2774319
multiplication	modulo
the modulo operations at the top are not needed but serve a reminder that the algorithm assumes a and b are less than m
of course for modular exponentiation you ll have an outer loop that does this entire operation at each step doing either squaring or multiplication
but i think you knew that

2774344
namedtuple	dictionary
for example
the namedtuple is an excellent idea if applicable
but if you want to stick with dictionary s that is also of course possible just substantially less efficient

2774426
ant	maven
that s why i don t want to put the logic in it into another environment groovy code or maven configuration
i take a list of properties environment and machine names that can differ widely in number and names to my mind this cannot be put into modules from an xml file and want to execute ant builds for each of those machines
i found the executetarget method in the javadocs but not how to set the location of the buildfile

2774454
filtering	grouping
i had tried using pagedcollectionview for grouping and wasn t happy with the grouping styles but i hadn t tried using it for filtering
i m now wrapping my datagrid s old itemssource inside of a pagedcollectionview and then setting the filtering of it to a method that returns based on the visibility property of my data item
the only problem with this approach is that since it s not using binding to filtering it will not refresh the filtering if it sees a property changed event on mydataitem.isvisible to solve this i m responding to events on my row items and calling updatefilter every time an item is expanded or collapsed

2774493
icmp	tcp
this is in a colocated environment so the latency is on the order of 500 us .5 ms
i understand that cisco gear frequently deprioritizes icmp traffic making ping times unreliable
can i use tcp acknowledgements to determine the minimum latency to the remote server

hmac	md5
about known attacks the known attacks on md4 md5 and sha-1 are about collisions which do not impact preimage resistance
it has been shown that md4 has a few weaknesses which can be only theoretically exploited when trying to break hmac md4 but this does not apply to your problem
the 2 106 second preimage attack in the paper by kesley and schneier is a generic trade-off which applies only to very long inputs 2 60 bytes

2774744
hash	md5
that s where you see that the trade-off has nothing magic in it
the rest of this message assumes that the hash function you use sha-1 is a black box with no special property that the attacker may use
that s what you have right now even with the broken hash functions md5 and sha-1

serializable	deserialization
anyhow if i go to another project that references this usercontrol create a form and then drop the control onto the form i get this error system.runtime.serialization.serializationexception type querydefinition+queryfilter in assembly .
i have used the serializable tag to get rid of this
but recently we were rebuilding projects visual webgui upgrade and now i run into the unable to load type required for deserialization issue

2774745
serializable	deserialization
but recently we were rebuilding projects visual webgui upgrade and now i run into the unable to load type required for deserialization issue
instead of figuring out that problem i decided to try and figure out why we need the serializable tags in the first place
thanks

maven	pom.xml
the relationship between those two artifacts is the release number
this can be solved by taking a look into the maven assembly plugin faq the second thing you mentioned web interface this can be achieved with the assembly plugin as well take a deep look into the docs
may be you can post the pom.xml s you have so we can help in a more detailed way

2774779
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
may be you can post the pom.xml s you have so we can help in a more detailed way
btw you don t need ant for that
maven can handle that

udp	tcp
for tcp just use so_ snd|rcv buf
so_max_msg_size is for udp
here s from msdn so_max_msg_size - returns the maximum outbound message size for message-oriented sockets supported by the protocol

folder	directory
the following solution worked for us in iis navigate to the folder in your website that contains your solution
right click on the folder and choose properties
in the directory tab under application settings click create to make the folder into an application i believe this can also be accomplished simply by making the folder a virtual directory

2775495
cpu	processors
all the lock-free resource sharing techniques i m aware of require the use of atomic swaps aka interlockedexchange
this usually translates into a specific instruction in the cpu and or a hardware bus lock lock prefix on a read or write opcode in x86 assembler for a very brief period of time
on multiproc systems atomic swaps may force a cache invalidation on the other processors this was the case on dual proc pentium ii but i don t think this is as much of a problem on current multicore chips

2775635
int	chars	strtol	atoi
you might want to make your phone element a string rather than an int phone numbers typically contain non-numeric chars
if it really has to be an int then use atoi or strtol to convert the ap_phone string to an int and then just assign this value to phone


2775776
folder	directory
svn copy -m testing
i was expecting file.txt to be inside testbranch src folder after executing the command written command
but i get entry at testbranch src to be a file type rather than directory type

2775776
folder	directory
but i get entry at testbranch src to be a file type rather than directory type
in web browser if i look under src folder of testbranch it shows file contents of file.text
svn copy -m testing

2776016
infobox	infowindow
you might consider using a custom infowindow called an infobox
you can view one of my sandboxes here in the maps.js you should be able to read through and take what you need of the infobox stuff and implement it for your own work
this gives you full control over the way that your windows look

2776134
int	chars	range	minimum
as written your code pretty much guarantees this but extra sanity checking may not be a bad idea
as for the phone number a regular int may not be and most likely won t be wide enough to hold a 10-digit number assuming you re storing area code or extensions the minimum range guaranteed by the language standard is
not to mention that phone numbers are generally represented with non-numeric chars such a 999 -999-9999

multiplying	multiplication
once you ve explored that you should use peasant multiplication
a left shift by 1 position is analogous to multiplying by 2
a right shift is analogous to dividing by 2

2776228
multiplying	addition	multiplying	add
a right shift is analogous to dividing by 2
you can add in a loop to multiplying
by picking the loop variable and the addition variable correctly you can bound performance

2776844
m2e	pom.xml
there are many issues about resource filtering though maybe check to see if you can find an similar one
yes this is mentioned in this lengthy discussion the topic is not exactly about resources filtering but the current behavior is mentioned when resource filtering is enabled m2e will run specified goals process-resources resources testresources by default to filter resources into project s output folder target classes or target-eclipse classes as part of eclipse build
m2e skips filtering if there were no resource changes during incremental build and my understanding is that this was a design choice see the last message from eugene there was concern that resource filtering may affect performance in the ide and not always needed when filtering is only used to store some stuff about build into the result jar so after a change in your pom.xml you should update the project configuration right-click on your project then maven update project configuration and this will trigger process-resources

2777225
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition
if i recall correctly modern processors if pipelined properly can do multiplication just about as fast as addition by messing with the utilization of the alus arithmetic units in the processor
to multiplying in terms of adding and shifting you want to decompose one of the numbers by powers of two like so _2 means base 2 as you can see multiplication can be decomposed into adding and shifting and back again
this is also why multiplication takes longer than bit shifts or adding - it s o n 2 rather than o n in the number of bits

2777254
int	double	int	double
to fix this cast occur to a double before the division
when you divide occur by sum you are dividing an int by an int which truncates to 0 in this case
it doesn t matter that you are assigning the result to a double

2777297
int	double
the wildcard declaration of means that the variable foo3 can hold any value from a family of types rather than any value of a specific type
it means that any of these are legal assignments so given this what type of object could you add to list foo3 that would be legal after any of the above possible arraylist assignments you can t add an int because foo3 could be pointing at a
you can t add a double because foo3 could be pointing at a

2777372
put	get
or if instead you d have the middle class just do what the top level shape class does and then in the circle class
it seems to me you could have x y coordinates for shape and initialize those in the constructor and initialize a radius in the circle or sphere class but in 2d or 3d shape classes i wouldn t know what to put in the constructor since it seems like it would be identical to shape
so is something like this valid i get a compile error of illegal member initialization shape is not a base or member so i wasn t sure if my code was legal or best practice even

2777383
cpu	processors
on the same box the http version of the test harness runs between 130mb s and 200mb s depending upon how i tweak it
in both cases cpu usage is low and the vast majority of what cpu usage there is is kernel time so i m pretty sure my usage of c# and the .net runtime is not the bottleneck
the box has two 6-core xeon x5650 processors 24gb of single-ranked ddr3 ram and is used exclusively by me for my own performance testing

2777384
width	height
the image has a scaletransform set as one of it s layouttransforms
i ve got it setup to fit the width of the image into the actualsize of the scrollviewer
my problem is that if the image height requires the vertical scrollbar to be present i have it set to auto then my image is scaled just a little bit to much

2777384
width	height
my problem is that if the image height requires the vertical scrollbar to be present i have it set to auto then my image is scaled just a little bit to much
i know how to determine if the scrollbar would be present and how to get the correct scale but i cannot figure out how to determine what the actual width of the scrollbar is
i guess i could just guess at it but i d like something that would work if i later add styles to my application that would result in the scrollbars being a different size

2777403
listview	gridview
the dvwp ships with all versions of sharepoint and is basically a regular gridview and pretty much the most customizable webpart there is when it comes to displaying list data
the listview webpart allows only 1 connection at a time source look at the notes under the ways to filter a listview wep part header so the described approach won t work
there is a work around though by using the data view webpart dvwp or dfwp data form webpart as it is sometimes called through sharepoint designer to create a webpart that mimics a listview

2777412
int	boolean
for objects that you don t control you cannot change this but there should be no need to boolean are ints because of the liskov substitution principle
code that notices a difference between the bool returned by the builtin types __eq__ methods and any other int is using the result wrong
the __future__ module isn t relevant here

2777542
return-type	return-value
from gccs warning options
to avoid this problem use -wreturn-type warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to int
also warn about any return statement with no return-value in a function whose return-type is not void falling off the end of the function body is considered returning without a value and about a return statement with an expression in a function whose return-type is void

put	get
your must have list can be met by a simple database engine berkeleydb or esent
put all the words into a table and then use seeks to look up the words
a b-tree with 8kb pages should get at least 250 strings page which would result in 1m leaf pages giving a b-tree of height 3

2777608
disk	ram
after doing a bunch of queries the response time drops to 5ms
to support a lot of concurrent users you can either add more cache or faster disk
completely caching all the data is probably possible 8gb of ram is quite affordable these days and the typeahead data will certainly be small enough to fit on an ssd which would provide a ridiculous number of iops

2777652
hide	show
i chose to show a 50x50 area since yours was kinda small to see under the pointer
i didn t hide that either


2777739
oncreate	setcontentview
get rid of the setcontentview call
next you call your trying to create an intent to display in a tab by passing in this class which itself is a tabhost and will try to do this all again when its oncreate is called
if android let this happen you d have just created an infinitely recursive call and it would crash the phone when it ran out of memory

2777902
prepare	execute
it s processed by the shell program not the sql engine so you can t execute it like an sql statement
reading code for sqlite s shell.c it seems that .import is simply a loop reading lines from the data file splitting on the separator and passing the fields as parameter values to a prepare insert statement
so you should be able to mimic the behavior of .import with python code easily

autofac	castle-windsor
using mef and castle-windsor to improve decoupling in your architecture nhibernate and wpf the guywire - although it s written in the context of wpf the same concept would apply to a webapp
i ve used autofac and have been very happy with it
configuration is mostly done in code so you get compile time checking for your mappings as opposed to programming in xml and hoping for the best

2778475
keystore	jks
since amqsputc is definitely not the thing you will be using in production the first thing to do is determine what you will be using in production so that you get the right key store type
no sense in getting amqsputc to work using a kdb if your actual app needs a .jks keystore
once you know whether you need a kdb or a jks you can proceed accordingly

2778661
bash	tcsh
if you have a sed with the gnu extension allowing insertion of a newline in the pattern space one suggestion is these examples are with tcsh yes i know its the wrong shell with cygwin
edit for bash remove set and the spaces around .


2778748
folder	directory
also with regards to .htaccess you should only need a .htaccess file in the top level of the directory tree so in your example above you would put one in each of application include library and design
the easiest method and the method that the zend framework setup is designed to be used with is to only put the contents of the public folder under the documentroot
everything else should go outside the documentroot

2778748
folder	directory
php includes can be from outside of the documentroot normally
if you re following the typical suggested zend framework application folder structure correctly all resources which need to be directly accessible from the browser ie
images flash multimedia javascripts css and index.php should be inside the public directory

2779027
cpu	processors
the northbridge share access to the memory bus agp and pci graphic and internal bus for connection with southbridge
check diagram and cpu control fsb access via several hardware pins pbri# pin is used to arbitrate for ownership of fsb
bro# pin is used by the processors to request the bus

2779198
mtu	icmp
i can send an icmp ping to www.google.com that is 1472 bytes and get a response so it s not their router first few hops
i found that our application sets the df flag for these packets and i believe a router along the way to the server has an mtu less than equal to 1100 and dropping the packet
this affects 1 client in 5000 but since everybody s routes will be different this is expected

2779204
setinterval	settimeout
whether that pulse timer uses setinterval or settimeout is a judgment call based on what you re seeing with your actual code
the issue with multiple setinterval s is twofold
the first is as you indicate since all javascript on browsers is currently single-threaded one timer s execution may hold up the next timer s execution

2779209
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
for example in terms of your constructor though you ll have to either specialize your template to have contructors with the correct number of parameters or you will have to wait for c++0x to use initializer lists or you will simply have to settle for a somewhat less powerful syntax where you pass in an initializing arrays
for all the other functions though you can just use a for-loop using dims for the dimensions of the points
i should also point out that boost arrays class may already provide the functionality you need and if not it might be advisable to build whatever functionality you need on top of that class as it is very similar to what you have

2779399
hide	show
i.e
you could use an approach with a panel or div container so that you either hide or display the container accordingly
where show button is a protected public boolean variable on server side code which will take the value true or false according to your condition of showing the button or not

2779479
folder	directory
several relayers can connect to the broadcaster at the same time send information and the broadcaster will redirect the message to a matching relayer for example relayer1 sends to broadcaster who sends to relayer43 relayer2 - broadcaster - relayer73... the server part is working as i have tested it with a telnet client and although its at this point only an echo server it works
both relayer and broadcaster sit on the same server so i am using af_unix sockets both files are in different folder though
i have tried two approaches for the relayer and both have failed the first one is using socket_create this returns warning socket_connect unable to connect 2 no such file or directory in relayer.class.php on line 27 and its running from command line it often also returns a segmentation fault

2779580
datamapper	activerecord
in the future datamapper is likely to include a separate library called veritas which is intended to provide relational functionality to data sourced from any data store not just rdbmses
arel is unfortunately tied directly to generating sql and thus is unsuitable for datamapper s needs
the way i would put it is that arel is an explicit query model for activerecord that generates and optimizes sql queries for rdbmses

2779580
datamapper	activerecord
the way i would put it is that arel is an explicit query model for activerecord that generates and optimizes sql queries for rdbmses
datamapper on the other hand is a genuine mapper for data and can interface with non-relational data stores already
in the future datamapper is likely to include a separate library called veritas which is intended to provide relational functionality to data sourced from any data store not just rdbmses

2779972
integer	unsigned
-2 31 in case of a unsigned integer the max is simply 2 32-1 and the min 0
i m using a 32bits signed integer in this example. 31 bits are used for the value creating 2 31 possibilities
as zero has to be included you have to subtract one

2779972
range	min	range	max
as zero has to be included you have to subtract one
2 31-1 when negative zero doesn t have to be included thus you get the full range
-2 31 in case of a unsigned integer the max is simply 2 32-1 and the min 0

2780096
vim	kate
it is called ctrl-l only because some editors allow you to enter it with ctrl-l
for instance in vim one can type ctrl-q ctrl-l to enter that character and it also appears as l
in kate ctrl-l is a shortcut for saving all files so you cannot type it that way and i m not sure there is any way of entering that character easily

2780469
hash	salt
from a rainbow table is a lookup table offering a time-memory tradeoff used in recovering the plaintext password from a password hash generated by a hash function often a cryptographic hash function
a common application is to make attacks against hash passwords feasible
a salt is often employed with hash passwords to make this attack more difficult often infeasible

2780518
opera	firefox
in firefox newer versions it is positioned correctly but both the header footer text and content text is displayed so it looks like a bad mix of browser header text and your page content
in opera the page content hides the header when using a non-transparent background in the standard css and the header footer position conflicts with content
quite good but looks strange if margin is set to a small value that causes the header to be partially visible

2781032
required	placeholder	required	placeholder
get out of the habit of using submitted data without using placeholder or escaping first
the original error is due to a missing semicolon on the required line
as others have said you need to learn about sql injection and using placeholder

2781086
int	double
in java we can assign a int to a double or a float
i have put that because int are normally of fixed length or size - the precision for storing data is finite where storing information in floating point can be infinite essentially we lose information because of this now i am a little sketchy as to whether or not i am hitting the right areas here
i very sure it will lose precision but i can t exactly put my finger on why

int	double
jls 5.1.2 widening primitive conversion the following 19 specific conversions on primitive types are called the widening primitive conversions int to long float or double rest omitted conversion of an int or a long value to float or of a long value to double may result in loss of precision -- that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value
in this case the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the int value using ieee 754 round-to-nearest mode
despite the fact that loss of precision may occur widening conversions among primitive types never result in a run-time exception

2781404
put	get

you have to put your finger on each row for a minimum of one time
in the case of a bunch you also get every line only one time but with lesser events which could also result in a faster code but to be sure i would do profiling on that

ssl	https	ssl	https
but if i do it from the local bmachine s browser it works perfectly from remote browser it stucks with https its not changing after that here is my web.xml s snap and some other filters of richfaces.problem is strange.if i try to access the web app from local s machine s browser it works fine but in remote machine s browser once it get into http all the forms of that page aswell as href stops working. jsf facelet is used.
in my application it is required that only certain pages need to be secured using ssl so i configured it and added filter but only one hazard is there.i am using it with richfaces
once it goes to https its not changing the page i mean if i perform post action it doesnt actually happens

2781524
folder	directory
subversion works by putting a hidden folder called .svn in every folder that is under version control
this does not work well with folder that might get deleted and recreated by a tool because the tool will probably not respect the existence of the .svn folder
that includes the whole build directory the contents of which get wiped every time you clean your project targets

2781577
x86	64bit
first and foremost is a 64bit operating system e+c only works for 32-bit code
fix that with project + properties build tab platform target x86
it is also an option that might have been turned off

2781677
public	protected	ivar	subclassing
i always define instance variables as private except iboutlets and use accessors to access them outside of the class
public means that the ivar is accessible anywhere
private means that the ivar is accessible to instances of the class protected means the ivar is accessible to instances of the class and subclassing

2781786
ant	maven
i ve used ant in the past with great success but know others who swear by capistrano maven and others
using ant i wrote a script that would pull the specific revision i wanted from my vcs create a tarball of the target directory on the remote machine in case a rollback was required create a mysql dump file of the database also for rollback purposes delete the remote directory and ssh the new content just pulled from the vcs perform various other logistical operations setting file perms ownership etc. create a release branch on the vcs itself create a tag with the appropriate version information so i always had a snapshot of the code base at that moment of deployment
hope that helps some

2781823
folder	directory
the visual studio project system provides a list of files that should be versioned to scc providers such as ankhsvn and it is this list of files that you see as new in the ankhsvn pending changes window and commit dialogs
you should never ever add the obj folder to version control as it is a folder completely managed by msbuild which will add and remove files and subdirectories whenever it likes to
the bin directory should not note the difference be versioned as it contains output instead of source files

2781889
16-bit	64bit
when working with larger units than the native word size the compiler will again handle most things for you
for instance on a 32-bit machine you can easily handle 32-bit int operations but to run the same code on an 8-bit machine or a 16-bit machine the compiler would generate code to do the smaller operations and combine them to get the results
this is partially why it is generally considered advisable to run a 64bit os on a 64bit machine since otherwise you might be performing multiple instructions and read writes to simulate 64bit on a 32-bit os rather than a single instruction or memory access

2781891
jocl	thrust
however cuda can be easily ported to opencl and by looking at how those libraries work algorithms strategies etc is actually very nice as you learn a lot with it
i ve been using jocl and i m very happy with it
the main disadvantage of opencl over cuda at least for me is the lack of available libraries thrust cudpp etc

post	get
you can add this to the loadcomplete event
to allow the checkboxes to always be click-able use the checkbox formatter s disabled property to answer your second question you will have to setup an event handler for the checkboxes such that when one is clicked a function is called to for example send an ajax post to the server
here is some example code to get you started

2782463
versioning	upgrade
we use the following format project 1 dev folder feature 1 branch main root branch release folder release 1 branch rtm folder release 1.0 branch release 1.1 branch this keeps all of your branches at the same level so you do not have any doubt as to which is a branch and which is a folder
that s your team project structure but what about the actual folder structure under each of the branches the idea is that it is the team s choice whether to use a new versioning of an external product or reference library
just because one team can upgrade to a new versioning of nunit does not mean that another team chooses not to as it is weeks of work

2782492
lxml	beautifulsoup
so for the highly literal stackoverflowers you can use xml.dom.minidom but no one will recommend this over the alternatives.
i would recommend lxml
i like beautifulsoup but there are maintenance issues generally and compatibility issues with the later releases

2782492
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib
i like beautifulsoup but there are maintenance issues generally and compatibility issues with the later releases
i ve been happy using lxml
later the best recommendations are to use lxml html5lib or beautifulsoup 3.0.8

my previous employer was using perforce linux servers mac windows clients my new employer is transitioning to svn
here s what i ve run into i do not miss perforce s branching
this could have been the environment though

2782882
subclass	superclass
i ve done two things the first is to make a copy of the old method with a new name in the subclass the other thing i ve done when appropriate is to use the template pattern and have the superclass call a method that for it has no behavior
the subclass then add behavior to the empty method
this only works if your call structure is such that holes can be added appropriately

2782966
bazaar	perforce
distributed revision control is gaining a lot of momentum and i d highly recommend that you become familiar with it if you re going to be a code monkey professional
look up mercurial also referred to as hg or bazaar
if nothing else perforce - a professional commercial revision control tool - is free for up to two users

2783187
ready	each
each worker thread increments the global counter and downloads that data chunk number and assigns the result to the nth slot in the global list of data chunks
if your question is about how to determine which thread is downloading the first chunk and when that first chunk is ready for use use an event per thread and keep track of which chunks you ve assigned to which threads
keep track of which event you pass to the first thread that will be downloading the first chunk of data the event you pass to the second thread for the 2nd chunk of data etc

2783208
post	get
all windows systems should get what ms provides and ms is pretty good though not necessarily perfect about making new ones backwards compatible
if these are causing you problems you might want to post details of which dlls they are and maybe versions so people can answer with more specifics like what might need to be configured to ensure that windows setup installs the dll


2783268
ubuntu	linux
at this point i ve been looking at asp.net mvc and mono
i run an ubuntu distro and want to do development for a web application some of the other developers use windows and run other .net items with visual studio
if running this on linux later shouldn t we use monodevelop

make sure you get the right one for your compiler
after you put the fire out sit down with your boss and convince them that if you re going to pretend to be a software company you have to act like one
get a real production environment

2783352
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
i m not sure if there exists a comprehensive list of things missing in mono
monodevelop is now available on both windows and linux so you re probably best off using it
however monodevelop does appear to use the same project file format as visual studio and sharpdevelop so you could make an attempt at mixing ides

2783451
getter	setter
for example if you re using a service locator you would probably want to consider removing at least the setter on the applicationactions.exitapplication property and storing the delegate in the service locator instead
if the exitapplication getter were to remain it would provide a simple façade to the service locator instance retriever

hash	md5
you state that there are some tools that try to decrypt md5 and sha1 and at least in some cases they seem to work as hashing algorithms are non-reversible this is not possible
there is no decrypt option my best guess is that you are referring to a tool that looked up a hash from a precomputed table and it returned a valid input string likely to be your password
these tables are called rainbow tables

post	get
so my thought is to have it like this the user model the guestbook model model and then the guestbook post model but then i can think of one problem
that when i just want to fetch the user information like a nickname and a birthdate then it will have to fetch all the users guestbook post
and if each user has like a thousand post in the guestbook it will get really much to fetch for the system
