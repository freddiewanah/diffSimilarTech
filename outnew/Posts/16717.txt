mongoid	mongomapper
it crashes with connect_to_master failed to connect to any given host port mongo connectionfailure the descriptions online heroku mongohq are more directed towards mongomapper as i see it
i m running ruby 1.9.1 and rails 3-beta with mongoid
my feeling says that there s something with which it says the mongohq addon sets but i haven t set mongohq_url anywhere in my app

realloc	malloc
to get the effect of malloc call localalloc lmem_fixed
to get the effect of realloc call localrealloc lmem_moveable
include lmem_zeroinit in either case if you wish

next	except
i ve made custom functions and variables to maintain a counter basically calcmedtotal is fed a sum of a group and maintains a running total of that sum
then in the group total line i output returnmedsubtotal which is supposed to give me the accumulated total and reset it for the next group
this actually works great except - it is resetting the groupmedtotal value on each page break

comparator	comparable
comparable allows you to make the object act like you just described strings in fact string implements comparable
the second comparator allows you to do what you are asking to do
you would do it like this collections.sort myarraylist new mycomparator

2784571
comparator	comparable
you would do it like this collections.sort myarraylist new mycomparator
that will cause the collections.sort method to use your comparator for it s sorting mechanism
if the objects in the arraylist implement comparable you can instead do something like this collections.sort myarraylist

folder	directory
i couldn t get my sql store to update when running on the simulator
turned out i was looking in the wrong application folder for the simulator
if you restart the simulator or the cpu it sometimes creates an entirely new directory for the app

2784888
folder	directory
if you restart the simulator or the cpu it sometimes creates an entirely new directory for the app
i kept looking at the original application folder when all the changes i had made where being written to the new one
if that s not the problem i would look at the definition of the systemparameters class and see if there could be a fault there

2784978
cpu	irq
where it is necessary to be specific about which version is being referred to you use names of the form r13_mode r14_mode where mode is the appropriate one of usr svc for supervisor mode abt und irq and fiq
according to the arm manual it should be possible to access the banked registers for a specific cpu mode as for instance r13_svc
update

2785335
submit	submission
there is not much you can do apart from change your use of the image_submit or intercept the form submission with js and edit the parameters
you may also be able to use a regular submit and style it using css to display an image or use an image and attach js to it to submit the form


2785429
innodb	myisam
for myisam tables that last changed time is available in show table status
unfortunately that s usually null for innodb tables
in mysql 4.1 the ctime for an innodb in its show table status line was usually its actual last update time but that doesn t seem to be true for mysql 5.1

2785455
innodb	myisam
that s probably less than ideal as the myisam table will not respect your transactions if a transaction failed on innodb your changes made to myisam in that transaction will still appear
you could use a dedicated full-text search system like sphinx which is what i have used for full-text searching since my database is innodb


2785544
range	min
here s a full code break down let s imagine that i have the following dataset where history_id is the primary key
i simplified the structure a bit regarding the dates for ease of reading. table history history_id id type user_id date 1 1 news 1 5 1 2 1 news 1 5 1 3 1 photo 1 5 2 4 3 news 1 5 3 5 4 news 1 5 3 6 1 news 1 5 4 7 2 photo 1 5 4 8 2 photo 1 5 5 if the user wants to select rows from the database based on a date range we would take a subset of that data select history_id id type user_id date from history where date between 5 3 and 5 5 which returns the following dataset history_id id type user_id date 4 3 news 1 5 3 5 4 news 1 5 3 6 1 news 1 5 4 7 2 photo 1 5 4 8 2 photo 1 5 5 now using that subset of data i need to determine how many of those entries represent the first entry in the database for each type id pairing
so i use a with min query

2786011
submit	submission
you could also write javascript that will trigger the form submission and tie it to another element
yes structurally the submit button needs to be inside a form element for the document to be valid x html
but visually you can position the submit button anywhere you want with appropriate css float absolute relative positioning etc

2786224
int	chars
you should either change the field type from int to varchar or chars if # of digits is always the same
store the number as int but prepend 0 in your presentation layer as needed


2786267
put	get

basically what you need to do is put those time values into datetime structures
once you have your two datetime variables just subtract them from one another - the result is a variable of type timespan timespan has a ton of properties that get sets - the difference in all sorts of units milliseconds seconds minutes etc

2786646
post	put
also on v7 you can use pub-sub...which brings me to my second observation
based on the description in the original post i would have done this in pub-sub
the app which puts the message needs only put one and it does not even need to know it s putting to a topic

2786666
int	double
these test versions only allow strings and int and the only operation is add
adding int results in the sum of the int values adding strings concatenates the strings and adding an int to a string converts the int to a string and concatenates it with the string
the final version will have more types double arrays javascript-like objects where new properties can be added dynamically and more operations

2786825
gprof	callgrind
they re much better and less arcane tools
on my system gprof shows only one call to crt_ls_file as it should be so it seems you gprof is lying which it sometimes does
if you really want to profile this program there s little use try callgrind and kcachegrind instead

2786855
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the main advantage here is less clutter less reading and less clicks
if they are on gray at the beginning it will be clear to the user that this state is possible and the deviation from usual checkbox behaviour should not be much of a problem
use a dropdownlistfor with options yes no and don t care

2786876
inherited	properties
classes a class is a data structure that may contain data members constants and fields function members methods properties events indexers operators instance constructors destructors and static constructors and nested types
class types support inherited a mechanism whereby a derived class can extend and specialize a base class
so function member or method would be correct for c#

generally its not a good idea to expose an api to the public unless you want people to call it and possibly abuse it from time to time
this is what i would do put an authentication layer between the web service and the outside world instead of making your webservice a public interface make the authentication layer the public api
get the authenication layer to then call the webservice on behalf of the caller

width	text-align
i d suggest deciding on the number of columns in advance 2 or 3 then using elements with their width set to 50 or 33 and text-align property to center
if the width of the elements and their count is not fixed i would write a code which generates custom markup depending on the situation
however it may get tricky because with the web medium it s hard impossible actually to calculate the actual size in pixels of a text block no way of knowing what font will a browser use and get its metrics

maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
so for a project with a of type jar jar jar is bound to package and will be run during the package phase but prior to that the goals bound to phases preceding package will be triggered including the one that copies the resources into target classes
the jar jar goal of the maven-jar-plugin is used to build a jar from the current project and does only one thing it packages the content of target classes into a jar in the target directory and that s all
so when you run mvn jar jar the plugin configuration in your pom.xml is used but jar jar won t do more things than what i mentioned

disk	ram
what matters more to a sql server than processor on large data sets though processor certainly affects the time it takes not the threshold of query data it can handle is memory and space both hd and ram since it ll overflow to tempdb for large operations this is speaking in terms of capacity
for performance you need disk io memory and processor power all together
the short answer to can it handle it yes provided you have enough space

spweb	splist
this isn t to say you have to manually muck about in the ui to accomplish the task though
using the object model in something like a custom code workflow you can sweep across your entire spweb and create a new view on each list that has the specified content type
all you need is a workflow with a single code activity which iterates across all of the splists in spweb.lists and check if that splist has the content type with the same name as your target content type

as a ui front end developer engineer i know the awesomeness of jquery and the lack of prototype therein
feel free to debate that elsewhere -- this ticket doesn t concern that question ha. i ve been curious for some time if it s possible to port jquery into tapestry instead of prototype -- as in completely removing prototype and scriptaculous -- i realize it kind of defeats the purpose of the already bundled prototype but i wanted other opinions on the matter

throttling	throttle
then based on that estimate you can throttle the bandwidth you use
so what would happen is that you d start running the application about as you do now collect statistics for a while then impose throttling based on what you measure during that initial time period

the float will be upgraded to a double by c itself and then gmp will turn that into an mpz_t type for you

inherited	subclassing
constructors must not be inherited so they are not considered to be members
constructors are not inherited because their task is to initialize attributes of their specific class
any subclassing must initialize its additional attributes and for this task it needs an own constructor that knows about the additional attributes

this technique uses brace expansion to produce a list of 32 random numbers mod 16 each followed by a space and one of the numbers in the range in braces followed by another space 11 00

2794106
bash	zsh
if there are fewer arguments the unmatched format string portion is ignored but that doesn t apply in this case
i tested it in bash 3.2 4.4 and 5.0-alpha
but it doesn t work in zsh 5.2 or ksh 93u+ because random only gets evaluated once in the brace expansion in those shells

implements	extends
macker extends some concepts made popular by pmd regarding validations of source code
a good example is when you d like to guarantee that all classes from a package implements a certain interface
so if you are very paranoid like me

oncreate onstart and onresume will run when you start your application there s no further interaction needed
onpause onstop and ondestroy will run when you exit by pressing the back button repeatedly

xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
for these scenarios jsonp is actually easier to use and works cross-browser as implemented in jquery
this works but not using the standard xmlhttprequest object
for example in ie8 you should use the xdomainrequest object to send the request

2794742
post	get	post	get
but this would lead to the fact that different servers would serve a distinct resource only depending on issuing a get or post including different header fields
the background is that i have an abitrary web server that handles post requests with some logic behind
the same resources also contain static content that can be retrieved using get

2794853
submit	submission	submit	submission
as for why you don t see anything happening in firebug your default form action is currently happening submission to # going nowhere...so no traffic for firebug to see
you need to wrap your code to run on document.ready like this currently is running before the form is present in the page so it s not finding anything to hook that submit handler to making it wait to run until document.ready will fix this

2794855
put	get
the closest thing you can get to true nested transactions in sql server is the save tran statement combined with some try catch blocks
if you can put your logic inside one or more stored procedures this would be a good option
otherwise you ll need to use separate transactions for each invoice as per oded s suggestion

2795051
int	chars
error codes are inferior to this
error codes were designed in an age where the only way for a function to tell the caller that something went wrong was to assign a special meaning to one or more values of those which can be returned and very frequently only a native int or so was available for returning that special value
for instance in c the get chars routine returns the next chars value in ascii but returns a negative value if for some reason something went wrong

2795178
memcached	apc	memcached	apc
memcached does not do opcode caching like apc eaccelerator xcache etc
just to add memcached is only going to benefit you greatly if you are running multiple servers which need to access a shared data cache

your solution would work
paradox files are not dbf
these belong to dbase

2795241
paradox	dbase	paradox	dbase
these belong to dbase
i think paradox files have a .db extension
in any case whether the files you are working with belong to paradox or dbase you can easily convert the data into a format h2 can import

2795286
int	chars
the functions usually also available as macros in allow you to classify chars
the functions in provide reliable conversions from strings to int of various sorts
so you can think about doing something like this code is a bit out of my league at the moment

2795495
hide	show
yes but instead it show a complicated confusing dialog full of information that makes no sense to anybody resulting in a ui so scary that it makes junior programmers soil themselves
the trick is to ignore the whole window hide behind your desk and click the fix it button and it fixes it
edit - added 12 2010 when you get source code especially when resolving merge conflicts other windows are often brought to the front either the solution explorer jumps in front of my pending changes view which i have docked in the same tabbed area or the source control window vanishes behind another document window

2795595
int	double
you get a pointer to your variable which is a double but you tell the compiler that it s actually a pointer to two consecutive long variables
then you read and write from them but what is really happening is that you are moving the underlying bit representation in other words the two resulting long variables have no meaning with respect to your number they are not the int part or the decimal part for instance
of course this only works if on your platform and provided that the communication protocol doesn t alter the bitwise representation of the variables in any way

2795629
int	double	int	double
my intuition says yes since double has more fractional bits more exponent bits but there might be some silly gotchas that i m missing
there are certain int values that a float can not represent

put	get
2 - get the price from the cell in the same row whose class begins with price multiply that by the quantity and update the total cell of the same row
3 - re calculate the grand total the sum of all totals and put that value into the .grandtotal cell
try it here

2795823
int	double
for the exponent the wider range is no problem
you can represent all byte-values with an int and the same is true for the exponent
the mantissa is a bit different but if you fill the extra bits of the double mantissa with zeros you will get exactly the same value as the float

2795834
minimum	max
the cucumber documentation explains very well how to use it to find some good business value and has a very good sample so instead of paraphrasing it i m quoting the explanation below business value and mmf you should discuss the in order to part of the feature and pop the why stack max 5 times ask why recursively until you end up with one of the following business values protect revenue increase revenue manage cost increase brand value make the product remarkable provide more value to your customers if you re about to implement a feature that doesn t support one of those values chances are you re about to implement a non-valuable feature. consider tossing it altogether or pushing it down in your backlog
focus on implementing the mmfs minimum marketable features that will yield the most value

2795906
serializable	deserialization
failure to do so is opening up the data to unauthorized use
serializable is the process of turning an object or an object graph into a form that is independent from the specifics of the current execution environment
deserialization is the reverse of serializable

2795906
serializable	deserialization
deserialization is the reverse of serializable
it is the process of reading the data written during serializable and restoring the object or object graph in the current execution environment
serializable is similar to data marshalling as both describe writing out an object as execution-independent data

folder	directory
here s how to check the apppool user account start- run- compmgmt.msc or right-click my computer and select manage navigate to services and applications - internet information service iis manager find your site under web sites and right click- properties on the virtual directory tab make a note of the application pool setting cancel this dialog and navigate to application pools in the iis manager right click the app pool you noted above select properties and select the identity tab this shows the user account that is running the site
now my suggestion is to check the folder permissions where you are trying to write the log and make sure the app pool user has write access to the folder
if that s not the problem i d recommend turning on the log4net internal debugging

post	get
i used to have remove.php that would get _gets from whatever that needed to be deleted such as.

put	get
imagine if amazon adding things to your cart based on a get request
all i d have to do is put an image on my page with that url and everyone who visited that page and logged into amazon will have products added automatically
to match your example i don t like jame s post so i put an image on my site like this and i send him a link to my page and ask him to check it out hoping that at the time he s logged in to your site

2796182
post	get
so you are right to be concerned about using get
if you don t want to litter pages with forms then confirm the action by post


2796242
int	chars	strtol	strtod
for floating-point input use strtod
the strtol library function will convert a string representation of a number to its equivalent int value and will also set a pointer to the first chars that does not match a valid number
if chk points to something other than whitespace or a string terminator 0 then the string was not a valid int constant

2796242
floating-point	integer
if chk points to something other than whitespace or a string terminator 0 then the string was not a valid integer constant

2796355
pull	push
some may also offer staging servers that you can push your content onto but it really isn t going into the cdn
rather the cdn will just pull content from their own servers as traffic happens
this might be adequate for what you want usually they offer ftp ssh and other interfaces

2796356
superclass	subclassing
i don t know if calling first will create a problem but the class reference for nsobject says you should free your memory first and then call after performing the class-specific deallocation the subclassing method should incorporate superclass versions of dealloc through a message to super
there is a difference in that you are guaranteed the existence of ivars in the superclass prior to the call to
after that call the ivars will be gone

2796375
hide	show
i am interested in figuring out a way to make it asynchronous and still hide the asynchronous nature of ajax
how would i design an api to hide the asynchronous nature of ajax and http requests or basically delay it to provide a fluent interface
to show an example from twitter s new anywhere api vs this asynchronous nature of each call is clearly visible it finds the user gets their tweet timeline filters only the first 20 tweets applies a custom filter and ultimately uses the callback function to process each tweet

subclass	inherited
inherited is always called from the file that is defining the class
consider the following a.rb require pp class base def self.inherited subclass pp caller end end b.rb let s run this


2796841
snmp	mib
alt text there is a great book that covers this aspects called reversing secrets of reverse engineering as said before this is a long path but probably the only one to achieve what you want to do you might want to reconsider the viability of project after investigating a bit the topics i mentioned
i think snmp is the correct approach
most printers implement the standard printer mib and the rfc 1213 mib so any property you can get from there is going to be model independent

2796869
x86	mips
although as i pointed out you may actually wind up contending with mips anyway.
if you re experienced in the x86 -64 world then yes the move to a risc processor is a good sideways move to keep your mind opening
your questions are good ones

the same code in matlab works exactly as i expect
i m doing some image processing in python using pil i need to extract the luminance layer from a series of images and do some processing on that using numpy then put the edited luminance layer back into the image and save it
the problem is i can t seem to get any meaningful representation of my image in a ycbcr format or at least i don t understand what pil is giving me in ycbcr

2797156
ready	each
how to use it obviously you need to make sure you have the latest jquery library at least 1.3 already loaded in your page
after that it s really simple just add the following code to your page make sure to wrap your code in jquery s ready function the above line of code will apply autosuggest to all text type input elements on the page
each one will be using the same set of data

2797163
spaces	delimiter
fscanf will stop scanning a string s when it sees a white space character
you need to change your s format specifiers to allow spaces to be included
you can either just exclude your delimiter or specify what characters to include i think i d probably go for the first option

2797379
width	margin
i have made up an example for you
basically you have to define a width for your form and float left input and float right the label so the label gets next to your input
the is a trick to center relative possitionet elements in css margin 0 auto but you have to define a width

2797482
move	drag
that is probably the message you want to trigger on
when you start dragging a window the system enters a modal move resize loop
it does not return to your own message loop until the drag action has finished

2797528

2797750
x86	64bit
now the project itself juggles with lots of data and we hit the limitations we have with a forced x86 on the whole project due to that one assembly if we used 64bit any cpu it would raise a badimageformatexception once that x86 is loaded on a 64bit machine
that tiny dependency on that x86 assembly makes and keeps 99 of the project heavily limited


2797763
serializable	deserialization
edit on request i m also adding code used to serializable and deserialize server client deserialization is invoked with

lets say i wanted to give each of my members 100 money for each post in my forum
this query works but if one member has posted more than once they only get 100

2797824
serializable	deserialization
the root element should always look like this correction the xmlserializer does appear to work without these on deserialization but it always adds them on serializable so something s fishy if they re missing. second edit i strongly suspect that your issue is encoding-related
i don t know why you have to mess with the serializable so much and can t just use the default utf-8 encoding but regardless the following code works without any errors so if something is failing for you it s very likely going wrong during the conversion of byte array to xml string on the client side
that s the only code you still haven t posted

2797880
redmine	gitorious
they are saved in the file system hashed when you use gitorious so linking those repositories to redmine would be a bit complex otherwise
my script makes links to those repositories in a much more readable format so linking them to redmine is really simple and only required once when you create the project
you can find the script here

2797880
redmine	gitorious
you can find the script here
basically you don t need to worry about the integration a lot since redmine supports git out-of-box - sort of
of course you need to have the git service running on the server where you production repositories are those that you link to redmine do your automated tests etc but this is also solved with gitorious

2797973
client-side	server-side
in your case looking in to php scripting might be the best way to go
your problem is javascript does not have an input output i o api as it is a client-side scripting language and consequently has no access to the file system via the server
you would need to use a server-side scripting language to save data to a server

2797973
client-side	server-side
you would need to use a server-side scripting language to save data to a server
there may be hacks to solve your problem client-side but they are probably either unsave or otherwise buggy
did you make that up

width	height	width	height
see also it may also pay to add a zoom 1 to the element s style to trigger haslayout which can sometimes fix finding the height if i recall correctly
try document.getelementbyid id .style.pixelheight elm.style.pixelheight width is an ie-only property. i ve found sometimes it works but not offsetheight for some reason

inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
-winline warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline
even with this option the compiler will not warn about failures to inline-functions declared in system headers. the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

just remember to remove the dragged element from its original parent and put it in the canvas or drag some kind of copy and do the reverse on mouse up
all panels but canvas use some kind of constraint to position their children
only canvas lets you use absolute positioning

2798803
folder	directory
whatever happens i m going ot have to store the directory reference in a file in the settings folder
the program needs a data inbox that is a folder that the user can dump files then run the script to process these files

int	double	int	double
also long is slightly better than double for int with 63 bits compared to 53 bits of precision assuming positive numbers
if the problem requires int you can use biginteger
also long is slightly better than double for int with 63 bits compared to 53 bits of precision assuming positive numbers

2798924
put	get
note that doing it your way is also okay since java is garbage-collected so the old allocations will eventually get cleaned up
still it s better to avoid lots of new allocations and garbage generation so the better way would be to move those declarations outside the loop and put in calls to clear inside it
for your second example either way is fine

2799083
x86	64bit

rtos	qnx	rtos	ecos	qnx	ecos
many other rtos designed for micro controllers similarly do not support an mmu such as ecos and freertos
of rtos s that do support an mmu qnx is probably amongst the most robust and mature while still maintaining high performance


2799147
qmainwindow	qapplication
it s not pretty but it definitely does the job
create a qmainwindow derivative with all of your actual gui code in it and overload the event function of this class to call this- show create a class let s call it runner which will hold a pointer to your qmainwindow derivative and give it a run function
in the runner runner start up a thread which will call runner run in runner run which is now running in it s own thread construct a qapplication and an instantiation of your qmainwindow derivative

2799175
quicksort	mergesort
other notes java uses mergesort when sorting objects because it is a stable sort the order of elements that have the same key is preserved
quicksort can be stable or unstable but the stable version is slower than the unstable version


2799190
sequence	permutation	sequence	permutation
it can also produce sub-permutations the idea behind my algorithm is that any permutation can be expressed as a unique sequence of swap commands
for example for a b c the swap sequence 012 leaves all items in place while 122 starts by swapping index 0 with index 1 then swaps 1 with 2 and then swaps 2 with 2 leaves it in place
this results in the permutation bca

2799237
inherited	properties
function objects need to have the above internal properties and the only way that they can be constructed is by the three methods i mentioned early you can see how internally functions objects are created here
obj01 is simply an object that inherited from a function object you can t create functions in this way
the typeof operator returns function only when its operand is by itself callable

2799298
appfuse	spring
at the same time you experiment on the back end frameworks you can learn front end frameworks like spring mvc for the server side and jquery or prototype for the client side javascript
check something like appfuse which will give you an application skeleton you can enhance


2799299
integer	unsigned
you could change it to unsigned int maximum value +4 294 967 295
temp is a 32bit signed integer
in this line it computes maximum value for an signed integer is +2 147 483 647 which creates an overflow it becomes a negative number and later you try to access the array with this result by accessing the array with a negative number you get the segmentation fault

2799450
ssl	https
if not is there an easy way i can use https for the login page and maybe the registration page and then have it stay on https if the user is logged in but switch back to http if the user doesn t log in
i just added this ssl middleware to my site which i used to secure only my login page so that passwords aren t sent in clear-text
of course when the user navigates away from that page he s suddenly logged out

2799543
union	distinct	intersect	contains
the count method checks for an icollection implementation so that this operation is o 1 instead of o n
distinct groupby join and i believe also the set-aggregation methods union intersect and except use hashing so they should be close to o n instead of o n²
contains checks for an icollection implementation so it may be o 1 if the underlying collection is also o 1 such as a but this is depends on the actual data structure and is not guaranteed

2799600
put	get
link to the jquery library in the head and ideally give the table an id or class so that you can identify it and create a class that half the rows will get
then put this in your javascript that s it really
if you don t want to create a separate class you can always add the style on the fly

2799727
post	get	webclient	httpwebrequest
you are working on a line of business application that uses things like validation rules data binding crud operations etc
if you want to just do basic http you can use the webclient class to get and post data
if you need more control over the requests you can use httpwebrequest but this is somewhat of a pain if you don t need the extra control

submit	submission
i would also say that a captcha or recaptcha is very important
it may be worth considering some basic obfuscation use non-standard names for your form fields don t just use subject submit etc
the less your form resembles a standard email submission form the less likely standardised scripts will work for it

2801458
qgraphicsitem	qgraphicswidget
since you want to connect widgets with path you will need scene coordinate to define the control points use qgraphicsitem scenepos to obtain the position of your qgraphicswidget in the scene
if you use the qgraphicsitem pos it gives you the position of the item in the parent coordinates
when using qgraphicslayout the parent is probably the cell containing the object thus the coordinate is equal to zero

2801776
post	get	post	put
or when your syntax to the page is person getperson 123 just append the id to the url and put in the place of the data parameter
the getjson does a get request and doesn t post variables to the url but instead adds them to the querystring
instead use

cells	tablecell
whenever that tablecell is initialized i draw the properties of the cells on the cells itself
so when you need an image on there dont use an uiimageview but just draw the image on the cells
also all the text i need i just draw on there

2802304
primes	modulus
from a security point of view your generation process is not uniform in that some primes integers will be selected more often than others
in particular a primes p such that p+2 is also primes will almost never be selected
with a proper modulus size this should not be an issue that special kind of bias was studied and found out not to be a big issue but it is bad public relations nonetheless

2802353
put	get
in some very special cases you might store reference to a grid in a cell or pass it as parameter to it s methods but it just feels wrong in introduces too much coupling
if you want cell to know it s location then just put it inside the cell
there s no point of keeping it out of the class not that single cell can be used in different grids since you already want to get it s location and that places such a restriction

qtreeview	qmodelindex	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview	qtreewidgetitem	qtreewidget	qmodelindex	qtreewidget	qtreeview	qtreewidget	qabstractitemmodel	qabstractitemmodel	qtreewidgetitem
qabstractitemmodel has a call flags qmodelindex index where you would return the appropriate value for your column
looks like you will have to forgo using qtreewidget and qtreewidgetitem and go with qtreeview and qabstractitemmodel
the widget classes are convenience classes that are concrete implementations of the more abstract but more flexible versions

multiplying	multiplication
the full arrays have about 500 000 entries each while the sparse ones are only tens to hundreds entries each
i did some experiments with toy versions of dot products. first i tried to multiplying just two double arrays to see the ultimate speed i can get let s call this flat
then i tried to change the implementation of the associative array multiplication using an id array and a values array walking together on both id arrays and multiplying when they are equal let s call this double

floating-point	integer	floating-point	integer
notice in 2018 main browsers and nodejs are working also with the new javascript s primitive-type bigint solving the problems with integer value magnitude
all numbers in javascript are actually ieee-754 compliant floating-point doubles
these have a 53-bit mantissa which should mean that any integer value with a magnitude of approximately 9 quadrillion or less -- more specifically 9 007 199 254 740 991 -- will be represented accurately

there are about 200 offices and each office will have it s own versioning which can be one of 7 different ones
the company wants to upgrade all applications to the latest versions which will be versioning 8

the problem is that they don t have a separate database for each versioning
nor do they have a separate database for each office

for-loop	loops
you may to check out the following mozilla article for a brief introduction working with closures note i would also suggest not to use var inside the for-loop because this may trick you in believing that the i variable has block scope when on the other hand the i variable is just like the buttons variable scoped within the function
you are having a very common closure problem in the for-loop
variables enclosed in a closure share the same single environment so by the time the onclick callback is executed loops has run its course and the i variable will be left pointing to the last entry

move	drag
you should then respond on wm_lbuttondblclk and restore your position manually
what you describe is a bit weird - the maximized window can t usually be move
in particular it occupies the whole desktop area and afaik the system doesn t drag it when its caption - the area for which hit test was ht_caption is dragged

well i hope this at least helps somebody else as well
i managed to find the answer to this myself i had put the eclipse installation folder under c program files but when i moved it directly under c instead the plug-in installation worked just as it should
i assume that is because eclipse wasn t allowed to write to its own installation folder but i didn t get the usual question from windows that something was trying to access program files either...

also get rid of the quotes

plm	glm
thank you
edit it would also be helpful if i could figure out how to extract the matrix that plm is using when it does a regression
for instance you could use plm to do fixed effects or you could create a matrix with the appropriate dummy variables and then run that through glm

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m seeing the expected behaviour in firefox but not in safari or google-chrome
looking at the document in google-chrome developer tools and firebug both show the following - however looking at the resource loading view google-chrome seems to parse whichever is returned first from the server while firebug always loads them in the order the script tags were added even when b is returned first from the server
using google-chrome 5.0.375.29 beta on os x 10.6.3 edit 10 5 10 when i say parse i mean execute - can see many benefits of aggressive parsing - thx rikh edit 11 5 10 ok so i put together a test along the lines of that by juandopazo below

2804212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this means all the test fail except the jquery append method
image 2 - google-chrome 5.0.375.29 beta results google-chrome results firefox results on firefox however it appears that if the first method is used and async is false not set then the scripts will reliably execute in order
image 3 - firefox 3.6.3 results firefox results note that safari seems to give varied results in the same manner as google-chrome which makes sense

2804212
firefox	safari
you may have to refresh a couple of times to see chrome and safari fail on everything
it seems to me that without a method for doing this we are not taking advantage of the ability to retrieve data in parallel and there is no reason why we shouldn t as firefox shows

django	web2py
web2py s existing documentation more than meets the needs of 90 of the users
the remaining 10 have to go take a look at the framework library code not as much of it as django and not as scary
also if you get to the point where you are spending more than 30 of your time going through library code it is time to move away from frameworks and move towards collections of libraries such as pylons

2804311
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
web2py should reach critical mass any day now in the next 2 years i predict
conclusion spend a day read the django book ch 1-7 and read the pylons book part 1 and then think about why you are using a framework to begin with
for me it was to get as much done as quickly as possible and without looking up documentation 30 the time

clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
read more here if the connection request was from a webclient or an http class to a cross-domain site the silverlight runtime tries to download the security policy file using the http protocol
the silverlight runtime first tries to download a silverlight policy file with a name of clientaccesspolicy.xml at the root of the requested target domain using the http protocol
if the clientaccesspolicy.xml is either not found the web request returns a 404 status code returned with an unexpected mime-type is not valid xml or has an invalid root node then the silverlight runtime will issue a request for a for the flash policy file with a name of crossdomain.xml at the root of the requested target domain using the http protocol

the name is being generated from the pom.xml file and it s a concatenation of up until now i ve got away with just injecting all the resources using ejb but now i need to access the customerservice ejb from a jsf converter so i m doing a jndi look up like this which will clearly break when the application is properly released and the module name changes
so the million dollar question how can i set the modle name in maven or how do i recover the module name so that i can programatically build the jndi name at runtile
i ve tried setting it in the web.xml file as suggested by that link but it was ignored

nsdateformatter	nscalendar
at this point you can use the compare which is typically reserved for sorting operations or the laterdate or earlierdate methods
be careful using nsdateformatter like this as you may run into issues with internationalization
if you need to add information about the current date to the date you get from datefromstring such as the month day and year you ll need to use nscalendar s datebyaddingcomponents todate options method

2805151
queue	fifo
you can then pop items off of a list to remove them
if you pop items from the same end of the list that you add them you have implemented a stack or a last-in-first-out lifo data structure if you pop items from the opposite end then you have implemented a queue - although usually the terminology is enqueue and dequeue
this is a fifo fifo data structure

post	get
if you wanted the next and previous along with the current in a single query then you could do something like with orderedposts as select ... row_number over order by publishdate as itemrank from .. where ... select from orderedposts where itemrank between itemnumber - 1 and itemnumber + 1
you need a means of ordering the post
if you have that then you could do something like the following in sql server 2005+ where you pass in the item number you want in the site code you would need to keep track of what number you were currently on and then subtract one and requery to get the previous or add one and requery to get next

qfile	qnetworkaccessmanager
the post request isn t closed until i manually kill the application at which point the whole file shows up at my server end
from some debugging and research i think this is happening because the read operation of qfile doesn t return -1 when you reach the end of the file
i think that qnetworkaccessmanager is trying to read from the qiodevice until it gets a -1 from read at which point it assumes there is no more data and closes the request

2806274
qiodevice	qfile	qiodevice	qfile	qiodevice	qnetworkaccessmanager
i ve confirmed with some test code that the read operation of qfile just returns zero after you ve read to the end of the file
this seems to be incompatible with the way that the post method of qnetworkaccessmanager expects a qiodevice to behave
is there some other way i should be using either qfile or qnetworkaccessmanager to push a file via post

2806274
qfile	qnetworkaccessmanager	qfile	qnetworkaccessmanager
you need to attach a slot to the finished signal of qnetworkaccessmanager to determine when the post is actually finished
in my case it was easy enough to keep the qfile around more or less permanently but i also attached a slot to the finished signal in order to check for error responses from the server
i attached the signal to the slot like this when it was time to send my file i wrote the post code like this note that compressedfile is a member of my class and so does not go out of scope after this code the finished qnetworkreply signal from qnetworkaccessmanager triggers my postfinished qnetworkreply method

capitalize	capitalization
i would like to modify this data in some way but i d like to make sure that if any errors occur with the modification the table isn t changed and the method returns something to that effect
for instance this is kind of a dumb example but it illustrates the point so bear with me suppose i want to edit all the entries in a name column so that they are properly capitalize
for some reason i want either all of the names to have proper capitalization or none of them to have proper capitalization and the starting state of the table is that none of them do

throttling	throttle
i wish to respect the performance of the external site and so would like to throttle the rate at which my app executes the calls
i have done a little bit of searching and the overwhelming amount of tutorial material and pre-built libraries i have found cover throttling inbound api calls to a web app and i can find little discussion of controlling the flow of outbound calls
being both an amateur web developer and a rails newbie it is entirely possible that i have been executing the wrong searches in the wrong places

2807310
virtualenv	setuptools
actually setuptools does this all by itself but pip acts as a front end handle dependencies better. another key issue is preparing a clean environment with a known package set across both environments
python s virtualenv is a god-send in this respect allowing you to configure a completely customised python environment with your own choice of packages without requiring root access or os packages rpm or dpkg and without being constrained by whatever packages and versions thereof that happen to be installed on your distro
finally one annoying bug-bear is the difficulty of creating command-line scripts that play nice with python_path

printf	strlen
thus printf x a cb 0 must always return 3 although strlen x afterwards would return 1
printf and printf will continue past a 0 character inserted with c because their output is defined in terms of the content of the format string and c does not denote the end of the format string
this includes their count

jboss	weblogic	jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic	glassfish	geronimo
if money is a concern i think glassfish gives you the best chance of being on the bleeding edge of the standard implementation
open source implementations of the ejb spec would be glassfish from sun geronimo from apache jboss from jboss.org the open source version not the red hat one or openejb running under tomcat
if you have cash to burn on licenses try weblogic from oracle bea or websphere from ibm

preorder	inorder
each node looks like this child1 value1 child2 value2 child3 value3 child4 also why would anyone want to do a preorder traversal of a btree since an inorder traversal is what will display the values in ascending order
i m trying to figure out how to do a preorder traversal of a btree
i know that generally preorder traversal works like this what s confusing to me is how to make this work with a btree since in each node there are multiple values and multiple child pointers

2807745
int	double
i would advise you to stay away from double if the input might be bigger than 2 53 after which not all integers can be exactly represented as double
wikipedia s article on int square roots has algorithms can be adapted to suit your needs
newton s method is nice because it converges quadratically you get twice as many correct digits each step

int	double
in this case the compiler will probably have to generate sqrt and double multiplication in software and you could get advantage in optimizing for your specific application
as pointed out by other answer there is still a limitation of big int but unless you are going to run into those numbers it is probably better to take advantage of the floating point hardware support than writing your own algorithm


2807946
superclass	subclassing
this way you ll have very little duplication in your code yet be able to accomplish all you need to
best solution to your quandary i think is to use generics put the common code in a possibly abstract common superclass parameterized by say nodetype
each of a and b can subclassing respectively and and override where needed to do something specific to their individual node type

versioning	upgrade
now we can take advantage of the fact that for windows installer packages only the first three fields are significant 1.0.0.1 and 1.0.0.2 both are interpreted as 1.0.0 this is explicitly mentioned in the documentation so we can rely on it. extending this logic we can auto-increment the ignored fourth versioning field with every build but prevent upgrade when the first three are the same
the upside is this is completely transparent to customers but prevents internal test qa teams from installing one build on top of another and you also need to ensure that immediately following any public release you manually increment one of the first three versioning fields

maven	buildr	maven	pom.xml
yes xml is verbose but it is perfect for the job and allows to benefit from nice things like validation transformation code completion which seem important to me
now nothing forces you to use maven if you don t like it and feel free to use gradle or gant or buildr if the size of their communities is not a concern
just in case note that maven 3 offers polyglot support see this post and this one but as i said writing a pom.xml in groovy yaml etc doesn t only have advantages validation

qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager
you need to create the qfile on the heap you will of course need to keep track of it and then delete it once the post has completed or set it as the child of the qnetworkreply so that it it gets destroyed when the reply gets destroyed later
you re creating compressedfile on the stack and passing a pointer to it to your qnetworkrequest and ultimately your qnetworkaccessmanager
as soon as you leave the method you re in compressedfile is going out of scope

udp	tcp
if you still want to use udp you could have a simulated three way handshake to begin the connection
a session id could then be added to each udp packet
this will increase the connection overhead by 2 packets and a few bits per packet however you will still gain from udp s speed for the rest of the session when compared to tcp

2808522
udp	tcp	arp	tcp	arp	udp	spoofing	traffic
this will increase the connection overhead by 2 packets and a few bits per packet however you will still gain from udp s speed for the rest of the session when compared to tcp
however using tcp or udp as a transport layer still leaves you open to other attacks such as sniffing and man in the middle attacks using arp spoofing or dns cache poising
another problem is if both the attacker and the gamers are on the same local lan such as a wireless network or another broadcast network then you are able to receive traffic regardless of the source dest address and only then does spoofing a three way handshake become possible and an hmac can t help

filtering	grouping	filtering	grouping

you can then capture this event on your form by doing the following alternatively if you only care about the form you can just use the form s doubleclick event as that will fire after holding the mousedown for a second or two

the use of the finger relates to the events click mousedown mouseup and mousemove

the main difference resides in the fact that propertychangelistener are applied to bound properties while vetoablechangelistener are applied to constrained properties
a bound property is just a property while a constrained property is a property on which listeners can express themselves about a change that is going to be made they can refuse this change from happening

the clincher here is your phrase must be run once a week at a particular time - go for a scheduled task
the basic rule i follow is if you need to be running continuously because events of interest can happen at any time use a service or daemon in unix
if you just want to periodically do something use a scheduled task or cron

implements	extends	implements	extends
with the following traits trait a trait b extends a trait c extends a trait d use as follows this only looks at the interfaces that are the directly implemented by the class of the instance passed in but could be extended to recursively look up the inheritance hierarchy
how about something like this this finds all traits that clazz implements that are themselves subtraits of basetrait

2811857
multiplying	add
changing the first line of push should be sufficient
you re multiplying next_index by sizeof struct myinfo which isn t necessary
when you add to a pointer type the offset is automatically calculated in terms of the size of the pointed-to object

2811882
coalesce	isnull
it takes two arguments and returns the first of the two that is non-null or null if both are
coalesce - this is newer and preferred for new development
similar to isnull but can take more than two arguments

2811958
octal	decimal
that converts to 10 in decimal
if you execute an instruction with the same first byte as one of those 11010101 or 11010100 respectively but change the second byte to another value say 00000100 it ll do the same basic thing but in the base you ve specified octal for 00000100
edit you seem intent on turning your question into one that almost nobody can really answer

2812030
twitter	myspace
additionally rpx is integrated with uservoice getsatisfaction kickapps wetpaint viewpoints and other saas web technology solutions
unless you want to build and manage relationships with all the id providers and keep up to date on new services as the idps role them out keep up with changes in openid oauth portable contacts microformats activity streams as well as facebook twitter linkedin liveid proprietary formats you might want to outsource this capability
if you also want integrated activity-based social publishing to facebook myspace yahoo twitter and soon google microsoft and linkedin another reason to outsource it

2812428
maven	pom.xml
you don t need to use one if you don t want to you are free to create your own pom.xml and put your source code and tests wherever you want as long as you configure the non-standard values in your pom.xml
maven doesn t want to control all aspect of developing it is a tool which is based around a set of best practices and standards standard layouts build lifecycle projects should have versions the idea of release vs snapshot dependencies etc.
you are free to not use these best practices but to do so you need to configure maven for what you want

2812484
pyenv	virtualenv
update you may install both at once with virtualenv burrito
update the correct answer is now probably pyenv
for scientific computing the corresponding tool is anaconda

uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
then override - bool navigationbar uinavigationbar navigationbar shouldpopitem uinavigationitem item . you should set up a custom delegate protocol that your view controllers adopt and if you allow it to pop call your super navigationbar shouldpopitem else return no to the above method
you must subclass uinavigationcontroller for this to work

put	get
at this point all i m looking for is the functionality to iterate through a list of flashcards quiz the user and let the user know if they were right or not
in ruby it didn t take me long to write the problem i m having with rails is figuring out where to put the logic to loop through all the cards in the list
after each quiz page generated i d need to get an answer back from the user respond maybe flash whether it was right or not and then continue onto the next question

2812809
implements	extends
i found a simple functional recipe for bit a field class but it was lacking a few features i needed so i decided to extends it
i ve just got to implements __str__ and __repr__ and i want to make sure i m following convention
__str__ is supposed to be informal and concice so i ve made it return the bit field s decimal value str bit field 11 would be 3

2812926
client-side	server-side
you may also restrict access to your application.html for non-authenticated users by you creating a spearate non-gwt login page say login.html
you can t use page-level security in this scenario because your views are being changed at the client-side
the only way to implement a role-based security in such kind application is to use a method-level security in your server-side code

2813007
maven	pom.xml
windows
maven has a lot of holes in functionality which require byzantine workarounds
this leads to pom.xml files that are incomprehensible and unmaintainable

2813007
ant	pom.xml
this leads to pom.xml files that are incomprehensible and unmaintainable
ant is super-flexible and understandable but ant files can get pretty big too because it s so low-level
for any significant project developers have to create their own build deploy structure beyond what the tool provides

2813281
post	get
this is why you get blog blog area controller
you can either give it a completely different name blog view blog post blog recent etc
or a default like home

httpresponse	request	httpresponse	request	httprequest	httpresponse
a request for txt html rtf and doc files works well however when i request a spreadsheet in either .csv or .xsl format the result is unexpected
i m using an httpresponse object to store the result of a an httprequest
when i request a document in .csv or .xsl format the httpresponse.parseasstring method produces an entire html page which appears to be the google docs home page

2813493
datamapper	activerecord
actually there s a rubysoc project to port ar arel to work with do and there s a chance it could become the default driver for activerecord
i am the maintainer of datamapper and we ve been using dataobjects under the hood for several years
it is production ready

2813634
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
try searching for the specific task you are trying to accomplish maven plugin version number update rather than the more generic modify pom.xml
depending on what you are changing there may be maven plugins
for example the maven release plugin updates the version information in the pom.xml and checks the changes into version control

2813659
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
how do i use a for-loop or foreach loops to make it that whenever a user clicks on an ad it makes an arrays in the cookie
i m just totally lost in creating a for-loop that sets the cookies
any help would be appreciated

2813865
post	get
thanks a lot
we re in the first steps of what will be a ajax-based webapp where information and generated html will be sent backwards and forwards with the help of json post techniques
we re able to get the data out quickly without putting to much load on the database with the help of a cache-layer that features memcached as well as disc-based cache

2813961
hash	salt	hash	md5
most people don t know what a salt is and when you explain it to them they think it s pointless
truth is sha-512 or md5 or some very weak hash once rainbow tables are precomputed doesn t make any difference
sha-65536 should it exist i m being facetious here would be no better than any other hashing algorithm once rainbow tables are precomputed

2814114
ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist
ilist ienumerable or iqueryable collections
i can t just make an ienumerable collection of those on the model and then retrieve an item list in some repository method or even business model method. should it be iqueryable so that i actually pass my queries to repository all the way from the business logic model layer
this is an example of what i had in mind architecture figure 1 so my domain objects would look like where bid would be defined as a normal class

2814130
next	except
that would be the unit test
the next is really an integration test to see if the gc s behavior wrt softreference is as you expect
i m not sure i would go to the effort to fully automate such a test except in perhaps the larger context of load testing but if that is important i would spin up a jvm with a very tight maximum amount of memory and load up enough memory to trigger soft-reference collection

2814212
sequence	permutation
once they have been matched the regex engine refuses to try a different permutation this is achieved by using the possive quantifier ++ instead of just a +
after that it matches a dot your version would have matched any character and a sequence of alphanumeric characters
then a quote and then it checks if a space or end-of-string follow

2814299
feof	fread
restructure your loop to use the return value of fread and check against feof only if fread fails
this stands out to me you should not use feof as a loop condition
the end-of-file indicator is not set until after you attempt to read past the end of the file so your loop will execute one too many times

2814516
appdata	uninstaller
update i ve completely uninstaller vs 2008 and then re-installed and applied sp1. same issue occurs
i then removed the following directories c users username documents visual studio 2008 c users username appdata local microsoft visualstudio c users username appdata roaming microsoft visualstudio no change
issue still occurs

2814583
macbook	bootcamp
the only drawback is i have to go through a kludgy hack to disable the backlight but not sure if you have an desktop or notebook
i use a macbook pro to build asp.net sites using windows 7
it was incredibly easy to setup bootcamp

2814831
public	protected
you could still come up with a better name than abstracttruck and use basetruck or defaulttruck instead since the abstract is in the definition
but since abstract classes should never be part of any public facing interface i believe it is an acceptable exception to the rule
making the constructors protected goes a long way to crossing this divide

2815349
netfilter	pcap
the goal of pcap is to transparently receive a copy of every packet in the system
you should investigate how to inter-operate with the existing firewall in your system or how to add your own filters to the netfilter system on linux


2815425
next	except
what i want is for that wheel to have one single option - new user
once that new user fills out a bunch of text fields that i am using nsuserdefaults to save i want that user to be saved on that spinning wheel so that the next time they open up the app they have the option of returning to all of the variables that they previously put in or creating a new user so they can input all new variables
i know how to do everything except write the code to create new users automatically

2815604
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if not then you at least know that the problem is not the parameter and is elsewhere in the code
you should not attempt to catch a nullpointerexception
instead the best way to avoid null pointers is in any function that takes parameters where you assume that the parameter is non-null always check that the parameter is non-null and throw an illegalargumentexception if it is null

2815757
width	margin	width	margin	width	height
html css please note that this might overlap any content that you have at the top of the page so use a top margin to push it down under the toolbar or simply set
edit ok so to add a static toolbar like object that has a width which is 100 of the page and a height of say 25px you would do this
html css please note that this might overlap any content that you have at the top of the page so use a top margin to push it down under the toolbar or simply set

postgresql	mysql	hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
let s start with some ground rules a password foobar12 we are not discussing the strength of the password
a language java 1.6 for this discussion a database postgresql mysql sql server oracle several options are available to storing the password but i want to think about one 1 store the password hash with random salt in the db one column the automatic fail of plaintext storage is not open for discussion
found on so and elsewhere are solutions with md5 sha1 and use of dual-columns both with pros and cons

2815860
salt	md5
the problems become evident once one groks rainbow tables and md5 collisions and i ve grokked these concepts
dual-column solutions rest on the idea that the salt does not need to be secret grok it
however a second column introduces a complexity that might not be a luxury if you have a legacy system with one 1 column for the password and the cost of updating the table and the code could be too high

2815954
distance	pdist
i further assume that the robot can calculate the position of every tree using angle and distance
then you can identify the landmarks by iterating through the trees and calculating the distance to all its neighbours
in matlab you can use pdist to get a list of all unique pairwise distances

2816277
vsto	add-in
for example my latest project requires the following assuming but verifying .net framework 3.5 is installed vsto runtime 3.0 vsto runtime 3.0 sp1 microsoft office 2007 primary interop assemblies hotfix for office kb976477 - all users get the application-level add-in
i also remember reading that vsto was not ideal for commercial software
internal software is another matter and it has finally made inroads at least in my organization

2816277
vsto	add-in
vsto only supports as far back as office 2003
in addition vsto required dependencies have been painful to distribute in the past although this lessens over time with new windows releases
for example my latest project requires the following assuming but verifying .net framework 3.5 is installed vsto runtime 3.0 vsto runtime 3.0 sp1 microsoft office 2007 primary interop assemblies hotfix for office kb976477 - all users get the application-level add-in

folder	directory
is there any better method to create a virtual drive other than subst
folder created with subst cmd not working on iis 6
in iis 7 with windows 7 the virtual drive is not listing when browsed inorder to set physical path for virtual directory

2816412
pull	push	pull	push
more modern versions of git refuse to update a branch via a push if that branch is checked out
the easiest way to work between two non-bare repositories is either to always update the repositories by pull or fetch and merge or if you have to by pushing to a separate branch an import branch and then merging that branch into the master branch on the remote machine
the reason for this restriction is that the push operation operates only on the remote git repository it doesn t have access to the index and working tree

range	minimum
for 31 this rather bad - already for and you have the same hash value as for and
since this is interesting i ve written a little program that searched the whole int range for the best prime in this sense
that is for each prime i searched for the minimum value of math.abs i + math.abs j over all values of i j that have the same hashcode as 0 0 and then took the prime where this minimum value is as large as possible

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
i m not sure how to explain it without a picture so here s a comparison of google-chrome opera firefox so you can sorta see how in google-chrome the background image is in one non-repeating piece whereas in opera firefox the image has oddly been broken up and placed slightly differently
i m confident this is due to an error on my part but i ve had no luck at all figuring out why the image is being mangled in opera and firefox
edit i changed the css a bit and it halfway-fixed the image i don t understand why and the bad alignments i hadn t yet noticed those

post	put
put this in a partial class that adds the following methods to your object context
if you are using entity framework which your tag indicates then this stackoverflow post should be able to help you out
basically you can intercept the savingchanges event and do whatever you want

2817830
hash	salt
but if i were making a regular ol web app i would just go with salt hash
you re going to store the key or public key if you re using asymmetric key encryption as you could encrypt the hash of password user provides and compare that to the value from the database on the application server anyway
if someone tries a dictionary attack through the app server it s going to take the same number of tries either way

2818048
tostring	getter
i think it would be better idea to do one of the following depending on how you are assembling the log messages change the logger calls in your code to assemble the log messages using alternative getter methods on userinformation that obscure the sensitive fields
change the tostring method on userinformation to obscure the details


2818061

a server side solution can be implemented as i have full access to the server
i m starting a blog with a hosted wordpress instance and i would like to be able to stream music using a flash player on some post
the problem is that every player i find uses a simple param to get the file url which makes it very easy for someone to find that url and just download the file. i know that it s probably impossible to prevent this all together but i at least don t want it to be obvious

pop-up	dialog
eg select id from table limit 1 i ve got some other jquery ui using v1.8 code that displays some modal dialog boxes on the screen simply put if post.php returns something from the db i need to initialise the dialog to pop up onto the screen
i ve done all the pop-up stuff i am just having issues joining all these bits together - i ve added some pseudo code of how i expect this to work
thanks in advance

2818470
getter	setter
if it is not called probably you forgot to add your prop to property map or something like that
your html code looks like correct here is a sample i would try to set a breakpoint to the property getter and check whether it is called
getters are always called before setter during control initialization

2818675
integer	fractions
we are essentially just shifting the entire 32-bit value integral and fractions part 10 places right so no loss in precision but an increased range. you may even be able to create custom container that does this mapping for you
one of the responses to the so question mentions the the problem stems from the representation of points watch out the maximum size of a silverlight canvas is 32767 points. this is because the size of uielements is not stored as floats as it is in wpf but in 32 bit quantities of which 16 bits form the integer of size and 16 bits form the floating part of it
there is enough precision but not enough range

2818690
isapi	iirf

for iis6 you need an isapi dll that does the same for you
use iirf it works just fine

folder	directory	folder	directory
reason is that it is trying to find database.php under d servers htdocs myapp config and the correct path is d servers htdocs myapp app config database.php you are in the wrong directory therefore it can t find your database config
i wrote a test shell under d servers htdocs myapp vendor shells move your shell out of the global vendors folder at d servers htdocs myapp vendors shells to the application s vendors folder at d servers htdocs myapp app vendors shells instead and try again
note i m not actually sure where the global vendors folder should be when you have a setup where the cake and application directory are split from each other but you definitely have to be in your application directory when running commands and not the myapp directory you re using. if you add d libs cake console to your path environment variable remembering to close all cmd.exe processes afterwards then you will simply be able to execute the following from within the application directory otherwise you will need to type the full relative or absolute path to the cake console executable and or provide cakephp with the absolute path to the application directory if you are not in it etc.

hopefully you can see why just adding the correct folder to your path makes things a lot easier

you can then query its properties not including its full path and even read it directly without sending it to the server
the file api was originated by mozilla and is supported by firefox 3.6 upward earlier versions supported an earlier version of it
chrome and safari also have it i believe

if you have an encoder you can create the media type record take pictures film on your android device

my other guess would be that it is related to the store that the windows folder resides in and the privileges you have for it
my guess is that this is specific to the windows folder but i am not too familiar wit hthe emulator
i just tried the call on the windows directory in a ram based image and received a number larger than 0

2819647
udp	mtu
one of the problems with this code it seems is that the bytebuffer size is set to 0 meaning that the datagram is discarded as it mentions in the comments
if you need to receive any information over udp and you are on a reliable network you can set the size quite big and receive big datagrams made up of multiple packets
otherwise on an unreliable network set this to the mtu size

.htaccess	httpd.conf
how can i write the same stuff that i have written in .htaccess to httpd.conf file
on our local dev enviornment we had just one server and to add far future expires and cache control header to static images we kept a .htaccess in the root of the application things worked fine
but on our prod we have multiple apache servers having aliases to a code base on a different server

2819940
inherited	properties
i don t think this is intended to work since the class that was serialized derivedsample simply doesn t exist in any form in the deserializing application
serialization seems to work best when the class itself is versioned rather than using inherited
so you would modify sample to add the new properties rather than deriving from it

just prioritize and make it clear that the guy you are mentoring has some serious studying ahead of him

2820540
mvp	presenter

have a look at the mvp pattern - you could have your form implement an iview interface
your other object would be the presenter that would call for example iview.updatetext when something changes or have your view subscribe to the presenter events - i prefer the method approach

2820633

this makes it so you can t have some easy to forge get post request to download the file you actually have to simulate a protocol interaction which most children can t do
most public hacks don t even use a browser they just simulate the behavior of a browser and ignore any security though obscurity measures you put in place
most children love these downloaders

2820738
maven	pom.xml
the maxmem configuration in the pom.xml only applies when you set the compiler plugin to fork javac into a new jvm
otherwise the plugin runs inside the same vm as maven and thus within the memory passed on the command line via the maven_opts
to set maven_opts under windows 7 right click on my computer and select properties keyboard shortcut press windows + pause break click the advanced system settings link located in the left navigation of system properties to display the advanced system properties go to the advanced tab and click the environment variables button located at the bottom of the advanced system properties configuration window create a new user variable set the variable name to maven_opts and set the variable value to -xmx1024m or more open a new command window and run mvn

2820935
maven	m2e
downgrade the maven-war-plugin to 2.1-alpha-1 deactivate the cache by modifying the maven-war-plugin configuration and i think that configuring m2e to not use maven embedder but the version you use on the cli would also solve the problem and this is my suggestion
you ll find this setting in window preferences maven


2820978
hgrc	hgignore
i found that hgignore doesn t obey entries for files that are already in the repository so that s not an option
define aliases in your hgrc for the commit command that excludes the file you don t want to track in the commit
the hgrc reference says that you can define aliases with the same name as existing commands

2821102
cvs	svn
however svn is free while vault costs about 300 user but im my experience we ve saved several multiples of that due to developer-time-saved with vault
regardless just don t use sourcesafe or cvs
if you already have the visual studio team system tools you may be tempted to use them but i would recommend staying away from them unless you have a lot of time to kill orif you really want an ulcer

though there may be difficulties with the precision of double

2821311
accessor	properties
i can update the multibound textblock with the count properties just fine but the days properties always shows 0 even though the days input accurately reflects changes
i believe that this is because my accessor are different for days - namely the set method
this class is in a different file

2821334
accessor	properties
it is only valid on class struct enum constructor method properties indexer field event interface delegate declarations
applying attributes to specifically the accessor is perfectly fine for any other attribute provided that attributetargets.method is set up in its usages which is true for obsoleteattribute

the answer to your question depends a lot on what you want to do in particular

uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
you can always add and remove subviews of your uiwindow in places other than applicationdidfinishlaunching
unfortunately the documentation for uitabbarcontroller states the following when deploying a tab bar interface you must install this view as the root of your window
unlike other view controllers a tab bar interface should never be installed as a child of another view controller

inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
basically it means also unlike some object-oriented languages c++ has the concept of scope alteration in subclassing
basically the public keyword in the inherited syntax means that publicly accessible members inherited from the base class stay publicly accessible in the derived class
a class that is inherited with the private keyword will similarly make all publicly accessible members in the super-class private in the subclassing

2821690
jar	war
the easiest way to tell the jvm where the required libraries can be found is with a search path called classpath
export an environmental variable that looks like this for unix linux for windows --- edit after clarification that this is a web application --- since this is a web application you don t put the jar file in the classpath
you place it in the web-inf lib directory internal to the war file you create

width	height
the best one first 1 set minwidth and maxwidth to the same value namely the value you want the width to remain
2 create a parent element with fixed width and make that the containment
i don t know how this will work on the height but by default a div with no height specified grows if its content does so it might work

2822133
lifting	combinators
stream structures are the key to understanding how the two paradigms can come together
by lifting standard functions into a stream logic format they can exhibit problem solving behavior that looks a lot like prolog
you should also look at parser combinators

2822162
testunit	cucumber
so you could add another class to your test for the current controller set the controller to test against within the new class and implement your test cases
you didn t provide code so i can t provide a coded solution but here s a blog post regarding testing all methods on controller under rspec personally i moved away from rspec testunit for controller tests beyond route checks and fuzzy testing
i much prefer integration testing cucumber for something that involves multiple parts of the system.

inherited	properties	inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
ideally when faced with an abstract class that is then subclassing activerecord would provide the abstract + concrete properties to the concrete class being instantiated in this case audio
effectively that way when creating an instance of audio we would have and then naturally when you assign audio.path dev null and performed a save operation activerecord would know that the path attribute has been inherited thus needs to be persisted at the parent class level
furthermore on that same save operation should you set a non inherited properties of audio activerecord would also persist those changes in the audios table

put	get	client-side	server-side
option #2 does have its clear advantages but again it only works if you control both sides of the communication it only works if both sides are .net code since you don t use the built-in add service reference mechanism you might need to manually create some of your client-side configuration it s really not that hard i hope this gives you a few ideas and insights - if you have further concrete questions - you know where to ask
if you control both ends of the communication both the server side and the client and both are .net you have two options either add your service references like you normally would if you don t control both sides - in that case you get a client-side proxy class which implements the proxy for the service methods and all the data contracts are duplicated you get classes in your client proxy namespace that will serialize to and deserialize from the same xml representation in the message that is sent back and forth - but the classes are different since they live in a different namespaces or optionally you can put all your service contracts data contracts and so on into a separate myservice.contracts assembly call it whatever makes sense to you and then you can share that assembly
on the server-side your code that implements the service contract will have a reference to that shared assembly - and on the client side you do the same thing basically your client project will add a reference to that shared assembly and now you have all your data contracts your message types only once - in the shared assembly namespace

ienumerable	iqueryable
list methods return iqueryable for further processing in business layer service objects
service layer returns list or ienumerable so there is no deferred execution in views
this code was created using ef1

2822834
daemons	systemd
add your httpd s user to the sudoers file with a nologin directive just for that one process
that way you don t have to worry about writing a daemons that will always run with root privileges and your script would also return immediately
if you just used a setuid root script other users on the same systemd could exec your script unless you checked their real user id

concave	convex
gl_polygon only works on convex polygons
alternatively you can use the stencil buffer to render concave polygons


2823186
setinterval	clearinterval
however you can stop executing the code by using clearinterval interval
i would use code from to add commas i d then use setinterval to count up to 1000 something like this the trick is to get it to happen in 3 seconds since the execution speed of javascript varies between browsers
the 10 millisecond delay and counting in jumps of 100 worked for me in firefox and google chrome

2823980
sdl	pyopengl
wheaties suggest is quite good as well although pyogre also has a steep learning curve as it is indeed higher-level
on another thought there is also pygame which is a python wrapper of sdl
i personally prefer pyopengl and you can use wxpython or pyqt to create your rendering context

migrate	upgrade
you will not want to interop anything that is vb6 you plan to migrate
interoping your own code will lead to a longer complex transition and typically requires back-tracking and reworking retesting already migrate codes
clearly this is not the most efficient and understandable upgrade path

int	double
if the list has 20 or 100 items that s a lot of updates for a simple drag operation
itemname| order value int --------+--------------------- apples | 1 salad | 2 mango | 3 orange | 4 i d rather do it with only one update
one way i thought of is if internal order is a double value

integer	unsigned
or is this the only way to do it
i am looking to define a template class whose template parameter will always be an integer type
the class will contain two members one of type t and the other as the unsigned variant of type t -- if then

2824654
accessor	properties
data just like methods should be public named without a leading underscore if they re part of your class s designed api which you intend to support going forward
in c++ or java that s unlikely to happen because if you want to change the data member into an accessor method you re out of luck -- you ll have to break your api and every single client of the class will have to change
in python and other languages supporting a properties -like construct that s not the case -- you can always replace a data member with a properties which calls accessor methods transparently the api does not change nor does client code

you could post to paypal from your action method but it will be difficult to show the user the response
in addition you want to take the users to the paypal website without using a get request get exposes the parameters in the url string and paypal probably does not accept a get request

in addition you want to take the users to the paypal website without using a get request get exposes the parameters in the url string and paypal probably does not accept a get request
from what i understand you have a form with some fields that post to paypal
before the form is posted to paypal you want to capture the fields on the form do some processing with it and then let them post to paypal

this will solve your problem
the js is and the html is very simple here edited the issue with your code is it hide and displays all the ul components inside any li components on hover of any one li
here is the code to solve this issue this will hide show the ul which comes inside the current li

firebird	bde
bde is long-since deprecated and i seriously doubt if you could get php to jive with it

you ll want something like this i haven t tested this as i don t have a username password - but it should get you on the right track
you can put this in a script in lib and call it from your controller using your preferred method
edit so i tried this with a dummy username and password and using the --verbose flag to curl and the headers looked right

your actionscript code to create and play the sound should be
from the livedocs - basics of working with sound ... although there are various sound file formats used to encode digital audio actionscript 3.0 flash player and air support sound files that are stored in the mp3 format
they cannot directly load or play sound files in other formats like wav or aiff. ... but apparently there s a workaround

2826299
ssl	https
to use ssl to secure your own site you need hosting that supports it most do you need to purchase an ssl certificate from a signing authority verisign is an example and you need to write into your web application to switch to ssl when needed
ssl is an encryption method to send data securely over http
if you ve seen a site with https at the beginning that means that it is using ssl

then you could use some javascript to show two different images over the checkbox depending on whether it s checked or not
i don t think you can with an html button
it doesn t have up and down states

2826565
inherited	properties
just make sure to have a text properties on it or a constructor that takes in your text string so that you could set it to a different text on each page
you could make one master view that contains all the controls that you need standard background picture scroll view appropriate buttons etc and make any subsequent views that you create inherited from this view so that they all contain those controls
you could also use just one view and work with multiple instances of it one instance per page

2826660
allocator	stl
while java s design probably hits the 90-95 mark for what you need from data structures the stl s flexibility raises it to maybe 99 with the iterator abstraction meaning you re not completely on your own for the remaining 1
when you combine that with its speed and other extensibility and customizabiltiy features allocator traits etc. you have a quite excellent package
i don t know that i d call it the best data structures package but certainly a very good one

2826694
maven	pom.xml
if you need to build for both windows and osx set up two different build profiles in your maven pom.xml to call the appropriate bundler
save yourself some grief and convert your eclipse project to a maven project and then use the osx app bundle plugin
maven projects are easily loaded in eclipse through either the use of mvn eclipse eclipse or by using the m2 plugin

2826812
short	base
i access these configsections through classes which inherit from .net s configurationsection base class
so in short for every project i had a separate configsection and for that corresponding configsection i had a class in that project inheriting from configurationsection to access the config section settings
this works all sweet

there is a comprehensive tutorial about creating a firefox toolbar here google-chrome plugins are written using the same combination of xml html javascript and css but may require the use of browser specific apis which are not guaranteed to be compatible with the friefox apis

put	get
if it can t be done in css use jquery but do t use jquery where the overhead isn t needed can usually be this.id many things are available strictly on the dom and still in a cross-browser way
when it s not needed sometimes you need jquery for cross-browser ccs3 selectors sometimes you re using a css selector that s already available put it in the stylesheet
there are a hundred other examples but if you can get by in a cross-browser clean way without it then there s no need things like fading aren t trivially done

2827536
mvp	presenter
our justification is that we are unable to unit test the view directly anyway we use waitin for testing this layer so the main goal here is to have a unit testable presenter which is separated as far as possible from the view model
from my experience you re never going to achieve completely clean mvp in webforms anyway due to the nature of the beast they d really love you to just use that code behind file... so i wouldn t get hung up on it
at the end of the day you need to evaluate the reasons for separating out the view and presentation logic and determine whether either method is going to help hinder you later on..

2827596
super	extends
had it been declared as follows then you d have to have to use sort
super t bounded wildcard collections.sort becomes more flexible
see also effective java 2nd edition item 28 use bounded wildcards to increase api flexibility also pecs principle producer extends consumer super

2827616
super	extends	super	implements
without the super signature sortedlist would not be able accept the type of java.sql.date because it doesn t implements a comparable of itself but rather of a super class of itself
super in generics is the opposite of extends
instead of saying the comparable s generic type has to be a subclass of t it is saying it has to be a superclass of t

2827616
subclass	superclass	subclass	superclass
instead of saying the comparable s generic type has to be a subclass of t it is saying it has to be a superclass of t
the distinction is important because extends tells you what you can get out of a class you get at least this perhaps a subclass
super tells you what you can put into the class at most this perhaps a superclass

2827624
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
by the way i can t so simply upgrade to snow leopard because it s a hackintosh so i prefer a different way
i got leopard with xcode 3.1 and sdk 3.0 when opening the organizer and trying to debug on my ipod i received the versioning of iphone os on ... does not match any of the versioning of iphone os supported for development with this copy of xcode... . it tells me with my xcode i can only develop for iphone os 3.0 or less so i downloaded the new xcode + sdk installation bundle knowing the sdk can t be installed on leopard
in the installation it tells me if you don t want to install the sdk press disagree and so i did but in the next screen he forces me to choose a drive for the sdk and then says you can t install the sdk on leopard system and i can t pass this screen

2827647
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
this allows the list of a s to be constructed with any valid comparator
it means that the type t must implements comparable of t or one of its super classes
for example if a extends b if you want to use a must implements or or in fact just comparable

2827647
comparator	comparable
for example if a extends b if you want to use a must implement or or in fact just comparable
this allows the list of a s to be constructed with any valid comparator


2827664
setattr	subclassing
some people do a different thing where they use a subclassing of dict that allows attribute access to get at the keys
d.key instead of edit for the addition to your question using setattr is fine
you just can t use setattr on object instances

2827786
onchange	onsubmit	onchange	onsubmit
best solution would be to set an onsubmit handler on the form itself to copy the dropdown value into the hidden field
if the only purpose of the hidden field is to duplicate the selected value of the dropdown then there s absolutely no reason to use an onchange handler
best solution would be to set an onsubmit handler on the form itself to copy the dropdown value into the hidden field

put	get
here s an example of a uda which will accomplish something very close to what you re asking
it s all about performance and what you are willing to put up with
for a small amount of elements you can most certainly get away with a nested select but for large n you ll notice that the query plan essentially runs the nested select once for every row in the output list

2828449
folder	directory
mylibrary has method and when i run my winforms application i get error file couldn t be find

children	parent
while there are elements in the stack pop an element off the stack and add it to where it belongs in the tree
find all children of this element in your array and push them into the stack
to add element to the tree step 3 you d need to find their parent first

2829135
button	checkbox
the grid is within the page of a wizard and has a select checkbox for each row
in one stage of the wizard i bind the gridview and when the finish button is clicked i iterate through the rows and check what s selected but at this stage gridviewmatches.rows.count 0
i expect the view-state to maintain the state

2829141
floating-point	integer
# is the type-declaration character for a double. following a number with this symbol means that it will treat the number as a double instead of trying to guess what exact variable type to use it would likely have treated the 0 as a integer without this
cdbl convert an expression to a double a data type that holds double-precision floating-point numbers as 64-bit numbers in the range -1.79769313486231e308 to -4.94065645841247e-324 for negative values
4.94065645841247e-324 to 1.79769313486232e308 for positive values

2829230
postgresql	mysql
you can set up multiple repositories just by saying something like datamapper.setup repository_one mysql localhost my_db_name
datamapper then tracks all the repositories that have been setup in a hash that you can reference and use for scoping the default scope just being datamapper.repository which you can set up by saying datamapper.setup default postgresql localhost my_primary_db or the like


2829360
width	margin	width	height
width and height is calculated independently from the margin and padding.
so by having width 100
on your iframe.toc plus a margin-left 0.5em you are basically telling the browser the following use the full width of the parent element and offset it 0.5em to the left

2829405
maven	pom.xml
the container it is deployed to will expect certain xml files which can easily be found somewhere inside the source project
as i told you in this previous answer the typical layout for a maven project with a war and an ear module would look like this
|-- ear | |-- src | | -- main | | -- application | | |-- meta-inf | | | -- application.xml | | -- config | | -- connections.xml | -- pom.xml |-- web | +-- src | -- pom.xml -- pom.xml where the files under the directory will be included in the ear this is the default value of the earsourcedirectory parameter

2829405
folder	directory
|-- ear | |-- src | | -- main | | -- application | | |-- meta-inf | | | -- application.xml | | -- config | | -- connections.xml | -- pom.xml |-- web | +-- src | -- pom.xml -- pom.xml where the files under the directory will be included in the ear this is the default value of the earsourcedirectory parameter
the source folder contains various container specific xml files
but these files do not map directly to where the container expects them inside the ear file

2829462
client-side	server-side
i have been looking at javascript apis like google s but i found them to be slowing down things at client side i am plotting a quite large number of points
i also found that with client-side libraries the performance was quite varied depending on the user s computer
with moving to a server-side library i would cut down on this variance and would have more control over data flow my data is in a mysql database

2829491
onkeydown	onblur	onkeydown	onblur
i thought that i would use the onchange event but this seems to be interpreted as the onblur event on ie
so then i thought i would use onkeydown but the problem comes in if the user wants to paste a value into the field then the function never gets called
there are no other form boxes so i can t rely on onblur or expect that they will change focus ever

2829513
int	chars
for example the method getint can be used to retrieve any of the numeric or chars types
the data it retrieves will be converted to an int
that is if the sql type is varchar jdbc will attempt to parse an integer out of the varchar

2829516
post	get
one way would be to wait for the first one to finish before calling the second and post a notification when the first is done
so in -connectiondidfinishloading of your first request in your webservicecaller i m assuming post a notification back to your controller telling it that the first request finished successfully
something like then back in your controller register for that notification if you have a lot of calls that wait on each other like this it can get pretty confusing and hard to maintain so there may be a design pattern you should consider not that one comes to mind at the moment

2829652
post	get
and where i need to apply them
i m reading through rob ashton s excellent blog post on ravendb and i m working through the code as i read

2829868
inherited	properties
this is a good thing as it will prevent you from releasing code that might accidentally throw a method not found runtime error
uiimagepickercontroller inherited from uinavigationcontroller
the delegate properties is part of uinavigationcontroller so it requires that its delegate conforms to the uinavigationcontrollerdelegate protocol

2829965
union	distinct
if you used union all you would get two records
the default behavior for union is that duplicate rows are removed from the result
the optional distinct keyword has no effect other than the default because it also specifies duplicate-row removal

2830111
put	get
saying form.submit isn t going to get very far
assuming form name of frm or something put something in the likes of earlier in your code


2830225
spaces	delimiter
this would mean that your delimiter is comma rather than space but it would handle all the escaping and unescaping for you
if a value contains spaces that value is enclosed in quotes if a value contains quotes then a quote character is escaped as 2 quote characters hello would become hello to write the details to a file to read them back csv reader.parse file.open csvout rb do |row| p row end


2830383
haskell	scheme
write yourself a scheme in 48 hours is pretty efficient
combine that with some lessons from real world haskell and i don t think learning an entirely new programming paradigm and getting a useful program out of it in one month is impossible
one you ll learn a totally new way of programming the functional style

2830713
mouse	keyboard
this is the easy part because a onmousehover handler can set the focus
i would like the caret to be where it would be if the user had clicked using the mouse to set the focus caret
the basic use case is user clicks on a link and waits mouse barely moves a page is delivered it contains a big textarea only full of text user types using keyboard characters are inserted right below the mouse cursor today the user has to wait until the caret is visible at the top left of the textarea and then click to move the caret before typing

2830835
openssl	m2crypto
i will also be trying some additional libraries and seeing if they work any better
i can do this with openssl
now how do i do the same in m2crypto

2830899
pbkdf2	salt
for instance it is available as pkcs5_pbkdf2_hmac_sha1 in openssl header evp.h
consider using pbkdf2 from pkcs #5
it takes as inputs as passphrase a salt and an iteration count

2830899
hash	salt
it takes as inputs as passphrase a salt and an iteration count
the iteration count specifies how many times the passphrase should be repeatedly hash
using a large number for this 1000 to 10000 is common helps make password guessing attacks harder

2830899
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
due to the design of pbkdf2 it would be very difficult to guess a hash generated with one salt even if you knew the hash that was generated by the same passphrase for a different salt
pbkdf2 is already implemented and available out of the box in most any crypto library of note
for instance it is available as pkcs5_pbkdf2_hmac_sha1 in openssl header evp.h

2830931
g++	gcc
gcc 4.0 produces some different errors though behaves similar
i am trying to build a universal binary on macosx with g++
however it doesn t really work

2830965
pthreads	fork
spork is a test server than can be invoked via drb
on pthreads systems spork uses kernel.fork
on windows fork is not an option so spork creates a pool of preloaded processes which avoids the huge rails start up time

2830992
allocator	stl
nothing against the stl but that s bad voodoo
