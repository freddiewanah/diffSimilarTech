int	double
this is specified as follows jls 15.21.1 numerical equality operators and if the operands of an equality operator are both of numeric type or one is of numeric type and the other is convertible to numeric type binary numeric promotion is performed on the operands
if the promoted type of the operands is int or long then an int equality test is performed
if the promoted type is float or double then a floating-point equality test is performed

2832165
int	chars
if your language of choice does not support direct numeric truncation you can convert to a string representation and only compare the first n chars
if you were working with int i would suggest comparing bit patterns but you are using floating point so this is not really an option

put	get
so the output should look like this
i m working with fusebox for a long time but still can t understand this part circuit structure is something like foo bar widgets any way once my idea was to use the custom lexicon called parent or anything for each controller fuseaction where you put the name of previous level fuseaction
but as i remember this method was applicable only when using xml-style circuits where you can always get any fuseaction info from the global container -- so i didn t make it because of intensive use of no-xml style

ord	chr
many thanks
i was wondering if anyone has the following php function equivalents in objective-c for iphone development ord # returns the ascii value of the first character of a string
chr # returns a character from the specified ascii value

2832733
try-catch	exception-handling
otherwise make sure to catch any foreseeable exception-handling with try-catch blocks
either in dispatcherunhandledexception s delegate or in the catch section of a try-catch block you can then call a function that writes the error message to a log file

mvp	presenter
how would you do it
i am thinking about implementing a user interface according to the mvp pattern using gwt but have doubts about how to proceed
these are some of my goals the presenter knows nothing about the ui technology uses nothing from com.google

2833377
jlist	jtable
add an editor for booleans using something similar to mytable.setcelleditor boolean.class new defaulteditor new jcheckbox is enabled
your custom renderer is simply governing the appearance of the jlist contents not adding any functionality such as the ability to modify the components check box - imagine it simply as a rubber stamp used to display each list cell in turn
i d recommend solving the problem by use a single-column jtable instead of a jlist

put	get
get into the habit of doing it from the beginning
first things first put some more braces in
it ll make it clearer what s going on as well as saving untold heartache when you come to edit this in future

2833669
hash	md5
another approach would consist of obtaining a hash of my password as stored by operating systems and then search for collisions
depending on the type of hash used we might get the password a lot quicker than by the bruteforce attack
how do i think about the time it takes to find collisions for md4 md5 etc

2833934
public	protected
in that case the ordering of the class members is irrelevant
in c++ it makes sense to put the public interface of the class at the top so that any user of the class can open up your header file and quickly see what s available
by implication protected and private members are put at the bottom

postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
particularly for web applications using mysql are there tricks to making sure data integrity is maintained
in various postgresql vs

2834267
sorting	filtering
an assumption is made that the itemorder is ascending starting with 1 with no holes and that it is restarted for each parent. this could be converted back to using integers as then it will be more obvious how the sorting can overflow loose precision with number of levels
edit answer updated originally was sorting by level which was not asked of. also the answer is not tested
updated again the seed query was not filtering on is null edit2 here s an update that will use floats and subquery to get the maximum number of leafs branches

2834598
width	font-size	width	height
you could try experimenting with different font-size s and line-height s
i have experienced problems controlling height and width of elements or inline text elements in general where the content may give you unwanted trouble even when content is empty
things like line height font size etc

2834613
explode	implode
so all together in one line
you can use explode to split your path into the path segments array_map to apply rawurlencode on each item don t use urlencode that s only for application x-www-form-urlencoded encoded query arguments
and implode to put the segments back together

2834686
hash	md5
i ve noticed that visual basic messes with files every time the project is opened in seemingly random ways but i didn t think that would make it into the executable nor do i have any evidence that that is indeed what s happening
to try to guard against that i tried generating the executable multiple times within the same ide session and checking the hash but they continued to be different every time
so that s generate executable generate md5 checksum verify md5 for current executable md5sum -c x.md5 generate new executable verify md5 for new executable md5sum -c x.md5 fail verification because computed checksum doesn t match

ienumerable	ienumerator
it basically allows you to quickly return ienumerable and ienumerator objects without explicitly coding them
consider a scenario where you want to return the intersection of two ienumerable objects
here is how you would do it using the yield keyword

2834881
post	get
it seems that model binding was not occurring during my test
it appears that the model binding does not take place unless a post occurs
by forcing the attempted model binding i was able to get the test to pass

2835262
nsurl	nsstring
you should get afilepath by sending -filesystemrepresentation to an nsstring containing the path
another way you might get what you want is to construct an nsurl fore a file url pointing to the file you want and using -resourcevaluesforkeys error to get the nsurlcontentaccessdate resource value


2835476
exponent	twos-complement
if you used a twos-complement representation for the exponent a small positive number with a negative exponent would look like a very large integer because the second msb would be set
by using a bias representation instead you don t run into that -- a smaller exponent in the floating point number always looks like a smaller integer
fwiw this is also why floating point numbers are typically arranged with the sign first then the exponent and finally the significand in the least significant bits--this way you can take positive floating point numbers treat those bits as integers and sort them

2835694
webchromeclient	webviewclient
you can just do this and your webview will in theory have all features implemented as the android native browser
from the source code using webchromeclient allows you to handle javascript dialogs favicons titles and the progress
take a look of this example adding alert support to a webview at first glance there are too many differences webviewclient webchromeclient

integer	unsigned
i tried 0x800000000000000i64u and 0x800000000000000u64 but got compiler errors
i read about the microsoft specific suffix i64 for integer constants
i want to do an unsigned shift to a ulonglong

switching	screens
be back soon screens on your server while replacing the files to avoid any disturbing error messages to your users
when i switching to a new release i just stop my apache replace the php files on the server via checkout from my vcs and restart apache
it mostly takes less than 30 seconds to pull this off it s even scriptable

2835819
put	get
not great design since it should really stand alone but will get the job done
quick and dirty solution - put both buttons on the form and bind their visibilities to the value of the bool one negated obviously - that way only the valid button will be shown
if you do want to use a converter though i d be inclined to use it on the command binding pass in the clr object and the value of the bool and allow it to return the right command to bind to

2835908
post	get
or should i be using the key i get from the manage domains page
right now i m using the key i got from the manage domains page also complicating this is that the actual appspot domain is mustrun2sun .appspot too new can t post more than one link .com but i set it up in google apps so that only users from my domain can log in and also so that the app is deployed on my domain
app is deployed as everything refers to it as such even in the manage domains thing. i m using gdclient 2.0 classes so i m fairly sure that everything should work as planned.

2835937
dictionary	map
that is to say if your dictionary file had only the words ape gum and mug your data structure would look like then you can simply go through permutations of the player s letters and quickly identify if that key exists in the map
you pay a little bit of processing time setting up the dictionary at startup but then you only have to perform a few quick lookups rather than iterating through the whole list every time


2836166
hash	hmac	hash	hmac
an hmac is a hash-based message authentication code
usually this involves applying a hash function one or more times to some sort of combination of the shared secret and the message
hmac usually refers the the algorithm documented in rfc 2104 or fips-198

2836185
actionscript	mxml
the down-side as i see it is that the flash plug-in is required and i fear that the flash plug-in is going the way of that other dodo wordperfect which once roamed the earth with 99 market share
i really wish one could design in flashbuilder taking full advantage of actionscript s oo features
mxml and the fb debugger and then cross-compile to extjs

2836620
printwriter	bufferedwriter
i don t understand the use of chaining the bufferedwriter bw to filewriter if it isn t used later on in the actual writing

g++	gcc
for the sake of discussion and simplicity here s an example program the program is purposely causing the 3-bit bit-field to overflow
here s the correct output when compiled using g++ -o0 3-bit field cast to int 7 3-bit field cast to int 0 here s the output when compiled using g++ -o2 and -o3 3-bit field cast to int 7 3-bit field cast to int 8 checking the assembly of the latter example i found this the optimizations have just inserted 8 assuming 7+1 8 when in fact the number overflows and is zero
when can i expect gcc to be right about this

2836980
strstr	strcmp
when assigning values into the array r substitute true for 1 and false for 0
i m not sure what exactly you are asking but if you mean to find pattern in text then strstr text pattern
or if you mean to just compare text and pattern then strcmp text pattern note that it returns 0 when text and pattern are equal

2837127
pull	push
you shouldn t ever need to push unstable code to your client s repository
you can simply pull the unstable code to your 2nd computer from the 1st
having said that git handles branching great and should be an integral part of whatever methodology you end up using

2837410
width	height
any ideas of other ways to attack this would be greatly appreciated
first problem you have 400 pixels width to go on and need to fit some text within that constraint as large as possible thus the text shall use that amount of space
throw in a new constraint if the text is just a then it shall not zoom this above 100 pixels height or some specific font size

2837710
versioning	upgrade
maybe have a really small table create table db_properties key varchar 100 value varchar 100
then you could add a row key | value versioning | 12 then you could just create a sql update script or set of scripts which updates the db from versioning 12 to versioning 13
depending on what upgrade paths you wanted to support you could add more cases

2837847
with-statement	continue
for reading writing files you might have with open filename r as file for line in file # processing.... # file automatically closed afterwards or if there was an exception thrown if it doesn t support it then you can always use try...finally as in try # do some processing finally # cleanup the finally clause is executed no matter how the try finishes whether it completed successfull or an exception was propagated but caught or an exception was thrown and will continue to propagate
if mysqldb supports it then you could use with-statement
with-statement exists for just that reason

2838141
post	get
no change would be required to the should now contain the required information to select your listbox items
you could do the following i think this should return you the proper list with the values from the post selected
you will need to make the getalltagsbypostid postid and have a new method that takes in a postid to make sure the tags get selected properly

2838177
imperative	declarative
of note sql is a declarative and or functional language and enjoys enormous popularity. if we had been initially trained on a lisp-y or haskell-y language from the start we d all think functional programming languages are perfectly normal
i believe that imperative languages are more prevalent simply because that s what more people are used to
neither functional programming nor the imperative programming model is more obscure or academic than the other

2838403
restructuredtext	asciidoc
i m more familiar with and therefore a larger proponent of restructuredtext personally but asciidoc is just another option out there
given what you ve described so far it sounds like moinmoin would be a good fit on the basis that it has a restructuredtext parser and it can export pages to pdf
you should be able to extract the source and run it through whatever other standalone tools as necessary but you might need to preprocess them to strip out any moinmoin-specific markup

2838469
uiview	subviews
you need to add pdfview to your view controller s .h file with an iboutlet connect it in ib and then refer to it thru the outlet that you declared in your view controller
inside your subclass of uiviewcontroller the self.view refers to the viewcontroller s big view which is a uiview
your pdfview should be a subviews in self.view if you added it in ib

client-side	server-side
s preview html with server-side html validation no embedded javascript code
it shows how to implement a client-side whitelist in the wmd editor to restrict wmd s preview pane html to known-safe html elements and known-safe html attributes
it does the validation after wmd geneates its html so even if there s a bug in the wmd editor s html generation which allows bad script to get through the whitelist blocker will catch it

2838773
client-side	server-side
that said you also need server-side validation too if you re using php html purifier is a good choice because even if you fix the client that doesn t prevent an attacker from simulating a browser and saving malicious markdown by post-ing it to your server
so doing client-side wmd previewer validation isn t actually required except to defend against an obscure case where an attacker manages to get compromised markdown onto the server and convinces a site moderator to edit the page
in that case client wmd previewer validation might prevent an attacker from taking over the entire site

2838773
client-side	server-side
in that case client wmd previewer validation might prevent an attacker from taking over the entire site
also doing client-side validation can be helpful because then you know that the same tags and html allowed by the client will also be allowed on the server
make sure to sync the server-side whitelist with the client whitelist

trouble is that when i enter from another view i don t know which view to attach it to since the loading of the tabbarcontroller is carried out in the viewwillappear method

2838958
entities	entitymanager
you can cast entitymanager factories and entitymanager to them and do the usual hibernate stuff
i don t think there is such option - jpa supports scanning the classpath for entities or explicitly listing the entity classes in the persistence.xml
since you re using hibernate as the persistence provider however you can always resort to hibernate code

you ll get your appwidgetmanager via everything else is as normal

the idea is to generate these .properties to have unified comments in all of them. my plan is to create a template.properties file that contains something like and a bunch of files like then bind to generate-resources phase to create a copy of template.properties per profile_data_ and filter that copy with profile_data_ .properties as a filter
the easiest way is probably to create an ant build file and use antrun plugin
other option is to create a maven plugin for that tiny task

qmainwindow	qpushbutton	qstackedwidget	qtreewidget	qstackedwidget	qmainwindow	qstackedwidget	qpushbutton
in your settings you seems to use two stacked widget a qwebkit widget and a qtreewidget
to have them displayed in the qmainwindow you have to set the central widget of the qmainwindow to be the stacked widget and uses qstackedwidget changecurrentindex slot to pass from the first widget to the other
here is a code sample using a qpushbutton and a qlabel as elements of the stacked widget

2840146
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
in other words if you have filesystem of type org.apache.hadoop.fs.filesystem just use
fileinputstream doesn t give you facitily to read serialized objects directly
you need to wrap it into objectinputstream

2840412
postgresql	mysql
on the other side linking to a mysql library is not the same that just connecting to the server and issue commands you can do that with closed source
postgresql is usually the best free replacement of oracle and the bsd license should be more business friendly
since you prefer a non relational database consider that the transition will be more dramatic

just use the statuses-update rest method

2840507
children	parent
if your hierarchyid is a clustered primary key then that s bad for performance it will cause page splits similar to the way a uniqueidentifier will
if you generate sequential children it s highly unlikely that you d ever need to worry about running out
you can have literally millions of children for each parent

post	get
per your example i tried your find all trick with similar results this looks like a bug in named_scope because i can take will_paginate out of the picture and get similar mayhem to occur so far this only appears to happen when i am using mysql
i think i read another post on stackoverflow where someone had a similar problem using .size with ar results and mysql and the solution was to always use .length on their ar results
i have tried modifying will_paginate to replace all instances of .size with .length but alas it was not that simple but i suspect that this or a similar issue is somehow affecting will_paginate

2840764
xsl-fo	xslt
a complete example using this svg image another option would be to refer to the svg image from a fo external-graphic if you want automate this you could just write a xslt which transforms the svg to a xsl-fo document with the svg embedded
based on your previous question i assume you want to create an xsl-fo file from an svg image
one option would be to just include the svg image inline in a fo instream-foreign-object

post	get
this allows you to for example alter which adapters will get used on a particular object and which browserview s will be defined on it
i apologise that i haven t gone into enough detail to be able to implement each of these examples straight away but they d take approximately a blog post each


2840879
rank	max
with this structure given the rank of an element even min max you can access delete it in o log n time
this makes all operations access insert delete by rank pop front back insert delete search by value o logn time while allowing custom sort methods
also apparently python has an avl tree one of the first balanced tree structures implementation which supports order statistics so you won t need a custom implementation

2840973
free	malloc
similarly everything that was allocated with new must be freed with delete and never with free
this logic goes even further if you allocate an array with you must free it with and not just with delete . always use corresponding counterparts for allocation and deallocation per object
2 malloc and new speaking again of c++ don t do exactly the same thing

2841024
inherited	subclassing
also writing well-performing queries can be quite a challenge
as pointed out by scott postgresql inherited is only really useful for table partitioning where it s a performance tradeoff to begin with
there are 2 common ways to use standard sql idioms for class inherited every object has an individual row in a superclass table and subclassing objects also have a row in a subclass-specific table that refers to superclass fields by a foreign-key reference

2841028
daemons	systemd
for gnu linux systemd or perhaps i should say x based systemd jwz s xscreensaver project would do the trick
it has a main daemons that will do the keyboard and other such work for you
you just have to give it a program that can write to the root x window

2841087
disk	ram
edit the way i see it is perfectly described here it shows how many bytes have been allocated by processes and to which the operating system has committed a ram page frame or a page slot in the pagefile perhaps both but i have read too many things that contradict my belief like those two points above and others like this one for instance
when i do virtualalloc with mem_commit this allocates physical storage in memory or in the paging file on disk for the specified reserved memory pages quote from msdn article
all is fine up until now but the description of committed bytes counter says that committed memory is the physical memory which has space reserved on the disk paging file s . i also read windows via c c++ 5th edition and this book says that commiting memory means reserving space in the page file..

2841306
comparator	comparable
comparable is not the same as comparable public class check implements comparable spelling matters as well
compairto isn t the same method as comparator

weka	mallet
java - java folks have classifier4j weka lucene mahout and as adi92 mentioned mallet

2841743
put	get
one could use espr or drools to do the same thing storing rules and executing them with timer but i am not sure how dynamic you could get with making rules they have to be made by end user in a running system and preferably in most user friendly way ie no scripts or code only gui the end user should be capable of changing the parse rules
it is also possible that end user might want to change the archived data as well for example in the above example if a new value of filllevel is added one would like to put a filllevel -99 in the previous values to make the data consistent
please ask for explanations i have the feeling that i need to revise this question a bit

2841746
prepare	execute
you can still interpolate unsafe content into the string before you prepare it
the prepare only sees a string it doesn t know whether you wrote it literally or if parts of the string came from untrustworthy sources
you can use a parameter placeholder in the sql query and then when you call execute on the prepared statement you supply the dynamic value

2841776
post	get
you ll be surprised how efficient you can get the sql with linq minimizing unnecessary queries.
i would move them out into their own assembly class library and create repositories based on aggregates. meaning create a repository and datacontext for all operations that share a purpose post comments tags etc
this will help separate what each datacontext should be doing and minimize the tracking that the datacontext is doing behind the scenes

uitextview	uiresponder
if you take a look at uiresponder.h you ll see the following comment near the paste method these methods are not implemented in nsobject meaning that it s not necessarily safe to call them on just any uiresponder
they can only safely be called on subclasses such as uitextfield and uitextview which actually implement them
this was a really strange design decision on apple s part

innodb	myisam
if it s myisam one statement or the other takes a lock on the table and there s little you can do to control that short of locking tables yourself
if it s innodb it s transaction-based
the multi-versioning architecture allows concurrent access to the table and the select will see the count of rows as of the instant its transaction started

i want to dynamically allocate a 2d array so i m passing a pointer-to-pointer from my main to another function called alloc_2d_pixels ... where i use malloc ... and for ... loop to allocate memory for the 2d array
well after returning from the alloc_2d_pixels ... function the pointer-to-pointer still remains null so naturally when i try accessing or try to free ... the pointer-to-pointer the program hangs

hash	md5
this id can be constructed as a hash like md5 sha1 or sha512 from the information which is important for you some information about software and hardware component
you can make your solution more secure if you sign such hash with your private key and your software verify during the starting that the key signed hash value is signed only public key must be installed together with your software
one can expand such kind of solution with different online services but corporate clients could find online services not so nice

integer	unsigned
note some 64-bit builds once used 32-bit integers particularly older windows builds of php values outside of these ranges are represented by floating point values as are non-integer values within these ranges
the interpreter will automatically determine when this switch to floating point needs to happen based on whether the result value of a calculation can t be represented as an integer
php has no support for unsigned integers as such limiting the maximum value of all integers to the range of a signed integer

comparator	comparable
conclusion you can follow the example set by string and do something like this then you can sort a as follows
you should make but not itself implements comparator
a comparable type defines the natural ordering for the type and a comparator for a type is usually not the type itself and defines their own custom ordering of that type

2843079
puts	gets
the gets function has no means of preventing you typing the characters and so should be avoided
instead you should use fgets which allows you to limit the number of characters read so that the buffer does not overflow. the puts function is perfectly safe provided the string that you are outputting is null-terminated

your error message from your answer that i believe is the root of the problem caused by java.lang.numberformatexception for input string minidle i believe the problem is that propertyplaceholderconfigurer isn t initialized
if you configure this with the element all placeholders will be substitued with corresponding values from a properties file in a post process operation at the end of the initialization process and before the spring container is in the operational phase
if it was a parse error and the properties file contained a line like this then the error message would have used demo string instead of when it comes to parsing spring will handle the parsing for you with the value annotation and your minidle field works fine on my computer the only way i managed to get your exception message is if i forgot to add the element

integer	unsigned
bare in mind that i m still ignoring several crucial features such as unique and foreign key constrains which could only be validated on the db
i don t understand why you think such functions would be useful because if you could set up your database to work in strict mode and then simply try to insert the values if the query fails you know something is wrong quoting the mysql manual in nonstrict mode when an out-of-range value is assigned to an integer column mysql stores the value representing the corresponding endpoint of the column data type range
if you store 256 into a tinyint or tinyint unsigned column mysql stores 127 or 255 respectively

there are some syntax definitions and omnicomplete plugins for actionscript that work pretty well -- not full autocomplete like you ll find in many graphical ides but enough to make vim a very good option for flash and flex development

2845034
hash	md5
in this case successful search for collisions is not as useful as in the previous case
finding collisions should still be concerning to any use of a hash algorithm as history has shown it can open doors to future discovery of much more significant vulnerabilities
personally what is most alarming about tls to me is the previous case where md5 sha1 is commonly used for signature verification when checking the trust chain between root and intermediary certificates

passenger	webrick
any time you run tests by doing rake test rake test functionals etc rails will automatically load up anything you have in your fixtures into the test database and use that

folder	directory
for more explanation see my latest comment entry below
you need to change the permissions on the folder containing the file not just the file itself
use sudo chmod and sudo chown on the directory that contains the file you want to access then check to make sure the permissions where changed with the ls -rl command

2845616
int	chars
defines a struct named bytes but declares no instances of it
note that technically reading from a member of a union other than the member that was last written to results in undefined behavior so if you last assigned a value to int you cannot read a value from bytes there s some discussion of this on stackoverflow for example in this answer to another question
chris schmich gives a good explanation of why you are hearing beeps and seeing control chars so i won t repeat that

executable	upx
you could consider using an executable packer like upx this will reduce the executable size but will have an impact on performance
you can make your compiler optimize for smaller filesize rather than faster executable as well
if you really desperately need a small executable then besides not using the vcl framework you should consider not using the rtl and dynamicly linking many of the required functions like memory allocation etc

versioning	upgrade
but the rubygems developers don t make their bugfixes available separately the only way to get a bugfix is to upgrade to a new versioning with potentially different behavior
therefore the debian-ruby developers cannot just take the rubygems sources unmodified they have to reverse engineer the bugfixes from 1.3.7 and apply them to their versioning of 1.3.6 to ensure backwards compatibility
in general you should avoid mixing package managers

submit	submission
regarding your robots.txt it has to be in the root path - - and if your rating system is at blah rate you need to use disallow blah rate instead of disallow rate
you should use post for actions which change things as search engine usually do not submit forms
additionally this will prevent users who download your website recursively with wget from submission tons of votes

2848792
maven	pom.xml
to do this in maven alone use the exec plugin to launch maven passing the command parameters in the same way as done using the ant java task
you can redefine the properties on the maven command line using -d and these will override the properties in your project file
for example in pom.xml in your ant build.xml you can then invoke the mvn command line like which will set myprop to b in the project

2848792
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
for example in pom.xml in your ant build.xml you can then invoke the mvn command line like which will set myprop to b in the project
the mvn ant task page discusses using a macro to invoke the maven commandline
this can be easily customized to also pass the additional properties

sys.path	distribute
it s best your give the whole thing a shot and then ask further questions if you have them
you will have to place your mylib.py somewhere in your load path this the paths in your sys.path variable and then you ll be able to import it fine
your code would look like import mylib mylib.myfunc generally speaking you should distribute your packages using distutils so that they can be easily installed in the proper locations

2851386
codeigniter	cakephp
and since mvc such as cakephp and codeigniter is all classes that can t be good
i am looking for beginner beginner books i just started reading the codeigniter manuel and i think i am going to use that
basically just separate say profile.php into 3 different files the view controller model

put	get

or you can try transform just be sure to put every factor you d like to convert to character
or you can do something like this and kill all the pests with one blow it s not good idea to shove the data in code like this i could do the sapply part separately actually it s much easier to do it like that but you get the point.

ironruby	ironpython	ironruby	ironpython
you can add ironpython support using the tools from
there is no equivalent for ironruby yet
right now there is no integration between ironpython and asp.net mvc

2851498
ironruby	ironpython
finally you can use the ironpython tools mentioned above to edit your code and use cpython to run it - you don t get debugger support but most everything else should work just fine
also ironruby will run rails just fine but you don t get visual studio support

subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
so 56 - 66 56 + -66 56 0x38 38 in hexadecimal -66 0xffffffbe complement of 0x42 in a 32-bit system if you do would add these hex numbers you will end up with 0xfffffff6 which is a negative complement of 0xa which is a decimal 10
computer does not do a subtraction
it does the addition of a negative number

2851542
int	chars
if you see an a you ll need to subtract off a and add 0x0a
to convert from a string to an int you ll need to take a look at an ascii table
iterate through each chars in your string until you hit the end and based off of what the chars is and which range it s in 0 to 9 a to f a to f you ll need to subtract the value of the bottom chars in it s range and add any appropriate amount

2851542
subtract	add
i guess you ll also need to check for any values that hint at what base the value is in for instance i d expect hex values to be prefixed by 0x
so for instance if you see a 1 you ll need to subtract off 0
if you see an a you ll need to subtract off a and add 0x0a

2852046
setinterval	clearinterval
then you can use that in a call to clearinterval so that would be done like this
justin check out the section on setinterval on this page
basically if you can isolate your code to cycle the pictures into a simple function call you would just do setinterval myfunction 500 which would call your function every 500ms .5 seconds

daemons	systemd
the reason for it is that although being quite fluent in bash i feel it s somewhat archaic language and since our systemd is in the first stages of its developments i think switching to python now will be the right thing to do
for example we have an init.d daemons script - is it ok to use python for it
thanks

jsf	stripes
actually i will choose between spring mvc and stripes
problem in order to get correct impression about action-based frameworks in comparison with jsf i want to be sure that i use them correctly in a bigger or a lesser extent

i have 3 class libraries that i want in the web-inf lib directory so i created custom ant builder rules for each of the class library eclipse projects to create the lib classlib .jar file whenever the project sources change search for creating a project builder ant buildfile in the eclipse help
i then added each of these jar files it s not sufficient to add just the project references to the java ee module dependencies section of the web project
when you export the web project they will appear in the .war file

2852528
inherited	subclassing
messages are sent through selectors to the receiving object which either responds to the message by invoking an imp a c function pointer or by forwarding the message to its superclass
if no class in the inherited chain responds to the message an exception is thrown
it s also possible to intercept a message and forward it to a wholly different class this is what nsproxy subclassing do

2853036
submit	submission
you don t want to be browserdependent so forget it and go ahead with disabling the form s individual elements
jsf relies on the presence of the name-value pair of the submit button to invoke a specific action in the server side
if you disable the form at least the button before submission the form then no information will be available in the request parameter map and jsf will not invoke any action

2853418
sorting	grouping
my image of this step is bit blurry but i can imagine that it is doable for graphs like your example
you could try using topological sorting
in a first step you can determine the levels top to bottom of the layout by performing a topological sort and always grouping independent nodes in a single layer

2853440
put	get
i don t understand why this query is taking so long mssql server 2005 typical output 3k rows 5.5 minute execution time pointdata is the biggun but i thought its definition should allow me to pick up what i want easily enough pointdata is 550m rows and point source of pointid is only 28k rows. i tried making an indexed view but i can t figure out how to get the last timestamp value out of it in a compatible way no max no subquery no cte
this runs twice an hour and after it runs i put more data into those 3k pointid s that i selected
i thought about creating lasttime lastvalue tables directly into point but that seems like the wrong approach

2853609
capitalize	uppercase
personally i d find nasajpl the easiest to scan since the uppercase letters easily mark word boundaries and give the name a distinctive shape
pep-8 does cover this at least partially note when using abbreviations in capwords capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation
thus httpservererror is better than httpservererror

2853901
serializable	deserialization

i d like to avoid splitting serializable into separate save and load methods for maintenance reasons
one suboptimal implementation of serializable this handles the deserialization case but in the serialization case the cached value is killed and must be recomputed

2853921
qstring	qobject
since qt is full of custom data types xcode doesn t know how to display their values in the debugger s summary pane
so you can t see what value a qstring has for example
don t work for qobject

2853990
inherited	properties	implements	sealed
has it changed anything
perhaps you could inherited base your own implements openfiledialog using the system.io namespace objects such as directoryinfo for instance which will allow you to get the browsed folder files with the getfiles method then filter yourself through linq to display the files with no extension only with the fileinfo.extension properties
edit #2 since the openfiledialog is sealed you may use it as a nested type and implement your own methods using this nested type

2854067
versioning	upgrade
if you do this you cannot for example charge someone to upgrade in order to get a new feature
the features must be built as plug-ins as opposed to versioning specific updates which may not be a bad thing but it has to be a conscious decision from the outset
it can be a chore to separate tenant s data should they wish to have a copy of their data or wish to host their own data or if you wish to move them to another database server

2854070
children	parent
what to avoid avoid the abbreviation as it may cause with not good optimizing xpath engines an extensive traversal of the whole subtree even document that starts from the node against this is evaluated
the problem this selects all the group elements satisfying the predicate which are children of the current node
however you want all group elements satisfying the predicate -- from the xml fragment it is clearly seen that not all group elements have the same parent

2854512
put	get
most quicksorts avoid this by swapping the pivot with an element on the edge and then sorting the rest of the array
another way to handle this would be to put in a line to make sure that you don t add the pivot to the leftlist like then you d add the pivot to the templist in between adding the leftlist and adding the rightlist
edit nick is correct in that you will get the problem for other cases like 5 2

2854778
put	get
i don t know about kde but in gnome you can check open with terminal to ensure that the program is launched from a new terminal session with the same environment you d get from .bashrc
my suggestion is to add the following to the start of your script to ensure that it is being invoked and then elsewhere in your script you should put printf echo statements to determine where it has gone awry
if you do that and post your script it may be possible to assist you further

post	get	post	put
of course due to web browser support only get and post requests have really been adopted because post does all that put does it s just not designed for idempotent requests
we should avoid post requests when the request is idempotent and does change server state it should not change the server state each time it is performed in document creation this means the document should only be created once
post is suitable when the request is non-idempotent

m2e	pom.xml
now we have resource processing with maven and there are some additional maven tasks defined in our pom.xml when building the webapp

maven	m2e
i have gotten far enough that the maven builder is running these tasks and filtering resources correctly
however when i choose run on server the war file does not look like it would if i built it in maven

maven	pom.xml
you can use this to locate child poms relative to the current parent pom.xml

boost	stl
the power of stl is in separating non-trivial algorithms from the data being operated on
boost s lambda library is definitely worth experimenting with to see how you get on with it
however even if you find the syntax satisfactory the awesome amount of machinery involved has disadvantages in terms of compile time and debug-ability

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
you should be checking for this before trying to use these values when declaring your arrays
also a quick note your for-loop is starting at 0.
in auotit the 0 index of an arrays holds the count of items in the arrays

profiling	instrumentation
use instrumentation to get concrete data about where the app is spending its time before you do anything
assuming it is the nibs andiih answer is the best for profiling but it sounds to me like you ve really got a design issue
it sounds like you need to break your big nib up into smaller nibs

2857283
cpu	hyperthreading
however one for cpu resources is a bad move - your cpu may have up to six cores plus hyperthreading in a retail cpu and most cpus will have two or more
in this case you should have as many threads as cpu cores plus a few more for scheduling mishaps
the whole cpu is not a single-threaded beast it may have many cores and need many threads for 100 utilization

2857614
ienumerable	ilist

2857614
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	ilist
you can only bind to an ilist or better

either way if fow is black and back buffer is cleared to black and you re not stacking various alpha-blended sprites on top of each other - see joel s answer that approach is no different to directly setting the alpha of the map sprite based on whether there is fow or not
i haven t looked too deeply into xna and can t set it up at the moment to check with the ctp of 4.0 but from reading the documentation it looks like you re doubling up
from my understanding blendstate.alphablend causes the spritebatch to alpha blend each sprite that is drawn

wav	riff
the header of a wav file is 44 bytes see note so you write out the header first using the code in the sample followed by the data
note not all wav files are canonical which means they don t all have a 44-byte header followed by the data
the wav format is actually a riff format which means they can contain all kinds of different data and the header isn t necessarily at the beginning

2858548
wav	riff
the wav format is actually a riff format which means they can contain all kinds of different data and the header isn t necessarily at the beginning
however none of this matters since you re just writing wav files
update if the voice recognition program is expecting a stream as opposed to a file path it s easy to create a memorystream like this or you can avoid file i o altogether and create your wav file as an in-memory byte array in the first place and create the memorystream from that

so node 2 has cost 2 3 has cost 3 .

jsf	stripes	jsf	stripes
additionally pretty urls are an annotation at the actionbean level in stripes 1.5 so you can do things like where view 5 would take you to the view event handler for your model object with the id pk of 5

while i only am vaguely familiar with the concept of conversation scope stripes has wizard form functionality but i haven t used it and am unable to really expand on that

2859737
struts	stripes
actionbeans are created per request and thrown away unless you do something like put it in session or wizard or whatever
this is nice because all the instance variables get mapped to the data from the form you use it then throw it away and don t have to deal with any synchronization issues like struts did
after you do your thing with the data stripes lets you send a forwardresolution ok status redirect or streaming json file etc

however in firefox and ie 7 the printed page shows the content as the full width and looks quite nice imo

2859771
webkit	gecko
important to make sure they re applying and safari chrome still won t print out the full width
here s the page i m referencing and here s an image of the difference between webkit first vs
gecko second webkit #39

button	checkbox
increase it hight then in the attributes check the following checkbox scrolling enabled bounce scroll always bounce vertically
edited forgot the most inportant thing in the size inspector set the button field under content to the size you wish 960 is twice the regular size

cos	sqrt
i did it like this d1 8 0 0 1 where 8 0 0 1 are the tf-idf scores of the terms t1 t2 t3 t4 d2 7 0 0 1 cos theta 56 + 0 + 0 + 1 sqrt 64 + 49 sqrt 1 +1 which comes out to be cos theta 5 now what do i evaluate from this value.
i don t get it what does cos theta 5 signify about the similarity between them.

mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseover is always fired even if the cursor is over a child element
the best way to see the difference is to have a look at the example of mouseleave
furthermore mouseover and mouseout are real javascript events whereas mouseenter and mouseleave are events provided by jquery afaik

2860191
firefox	safari
so i take it out and it works on safari chrome but not firefox 3.5.x but validates fine
is there something in the object tag i must add in order for firefox to display flash

put	get
core data and the fetched results controller are well beyond the scope of this answer but you can search stack overflow and google for more information about these topics
to keep things simple you can just put your data into an nsmutablearray and reload the table view or specific sections and rows when the array state changes but you would have to manage table view updates yourself
note that beyond the data model handling the view can get complicated quickly

2860323
content-length	content-type
here s what one of my iis servers says about a pdf file http 1.1 200 ok content-length 127791 content-type application pdf ... however anything that s not delivered directly by the web server a file served by php or asp.net for example won t work unless the script specifically handles head requests
some web servers may give you a content-length header in response to a head request
you could potentially use an xmlhttprequest to send the head request and see what you get

2860348
profiling	debugging
checking for nulls is almost never going to be the performance bottleneck in your application
and in the one in a million case where it is significant you ll find it with your profiling and remove that one case
often you can handle things better than that even if only to provide a better error report to the user and or yourself for debugging purposes

move	drag
so whenever one value changes i want the other value to also change
ex if someone types 1000 into the minimum value input field i want the lower slider handle to move to the 1000 mark
also if the user drag the lower slider handle to 1000 the input field should reflect that

vsto	add-in
i d appreciate anyone who s worked with vba and c# willing to make a comment on my question problem
this is the vba code for an excel template which i m trying to convert to c# in a vsto project i m working on
by the way it s a vsto add-in at this point i m stumped by the addedshapes not sure what this is all about

2860739
put	get
personally i d probably use something like this edit it s purely a micro-optimization that might make no difference at all but you might consider rearranging the computation to get something like of course there s a really good chance the compiler will already do this or something equivalent but it won t hurt to try it anyway though it s really only likely to help with optimization turned off
edit2 sbi as is usually the case is right you might gain a bit by initially reserving space then using an insert iterator to put the data into place as before we re into such microscopic optimization i m not at all sure i d really expect to see a difference at all
in particular since this is all done with templates there s a pretty good chance most if not all the code will be generated inline

2860754
maven	pom.xml
by aggregation i mean calling the plugin programmatically which means you will probably have to access the plexus container to wire up the plugin configuration
there are several ways to do this use maveninvoker to fork a new maven process
this has pros and cons especially since you re building the project twice but a common pattern is to modify the maven model write it out to the file system as a temporary pom.xml xml file point the invoker to this pom.xml

2860908
turing	decidable
if typed lambda calculi could construct a fixed point operator in what ever way it was quite possible for an expression to have no normal form
another famous theorem the halting problem implies that strongly normalizing languages are not turing complete it says that s impossible to decide different than prove of a turing complete language what subset of its programs will halt on what input
if a language is strongly normalizing it s decidable if it halts namely it always halts

hash	salt	hash	salt
then when a user wanted to log in i could take their submitted password add the random salt from their account information hash it and see if it equates to the stored hash password with their account information
i need to hash passwords for storage in a database
i was hoping to take the plain text password add a random salt then store the salt and the hashed password in the database

2860972
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
hash are not to be used for storing passwords as they are easily breakable
you should use another algorithm like bcrypt pbkdf2 and scrypt to store you passwords
see here

2860998
profiling	debugging
if the heap size remains fairly constant but private bytes is growing then you ve got a native code issue and you ll need to break out the c++ tools to debugging it
assuming the problem is with the .net heap you should run a profiling against the code like redgate s ant profiling or jetbrain s dottrace
this will tell you which objects are taking up the space and not being collected quickly

2861019
hash	salt	hash	salt
you need to store the salt in your database as you suggested
among all the standard hash schemes ldap ssha is the most secure one to use i would just follow the algorithms specified there and use messagedigest to do the hash
you need to store the salt in your database as you suggested

mergesort	in-place
edit unlike in-place sorts like quicksort and insertion sort mergesort requires auxiliary memory and is simplest to implement by copying rather than swapping
mergesort is straightforward simple efficient and stable split the list sort recursively and merge the results
to be more specific mergesort takes o n log n which is asymptotically optimal

2861311
quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place
to be more specific mergesort takes o n log n which is asymptotically optimal
also in practice with both algorithms modified to sort short sublists with a special-purpose sort mergesort can be a close competitor to the modified quicksort used in the c c++ standard libraries

uiview	subviews	uiview	uipangesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
any ideas on how to work around the issue with out having to implement an entirely new uigesturerecognizer
i have a uiview that has a uipangesturerecognizer attached to it the gesture is working fine except that the starting point is not where the pan first started it is usually off by 5 to 15 pixels in both the x and y coordinates.unfortunately the variance is not consistent and seems to be related to the speed at which the panning motion takes place
to validate that the touches are being sent correctly i have added a touchesbegan method to a subviews and it receives the correct starting point but the gesture does not provide the same point in it s begin phase

2861408
maven	pom.xml
doesn t have to be anything fancy just a bare-bones pom.xml file
that way you can include them without breaking the maven way
if you want maven to automatically generate one for you and install it to your local repo you can use this command

2861417
rdf	owl
i don t currently store these triples in a jena model but that is fairly straight forward to do its on my to do next list
the area i am struggling with though is to get jena to output correct rdf for the ontology i have
the ontology uses owl and rdfs definitions but when i pass some example triples into the model they don t appear correctly

2861805
mergesort	in-place
furthermore it doesn t exhibit the behavior you describe
the idea of the mergesort version you are trying to implement is to use a single auxiliary array source array of the same size as the input array destination array
this allows merging from one array into the other since there is no efficient in-place merging technique

2861867
httphandler	httpmodule
so i thought the best way of doing this was to point the mobile requests to a different file extension and have the httpmodule decide to process only if the request targets this new extension
i don t need a custom httphandler for the new extension
i want to program the services like a normal .asmx service just with a different extension

since it is graphics you can use tranforms to get the point

int	double
the syntax is default t1 ... tn and only one such declaration can be used per module
adding default int for example would change the default for integral in your code to int
the default default of integer double isn t just a ghc policy it s from the haskell 98 report

2862094
profiling	instrumentation
sorry this isn t easier
i m on the vs profiling team so feel free to ask any clarifying questions
if you want exact metrics execution time call counts then you should use instrumentation

2862094
profiling	instrumentation
sampling is lighter-weight than instrumentation and is often good as a first pass to figure out at a high level where your cpu is doing the most work
with sampling the profiling takes snapshots of the call stack at specified intervals this is similar to breaking into the debugger to see what s currently executing
it then aggregates the snapshots to create a call tree

2862153
super	abstract
this works fine in python3 and in 2.6 they both also work fine i get the expected exception if i derive super from object in addition to abcmeta

you could register a function with atexit that is called at program termination
note though that you can t tell the difference between calling exit and returning from main

2862440
put	get
on the deferredqueue side it s also possible to set limits on how many items are pending processing so you can avoid completely overloading your server for example if your image processors get stuck and stop completing tasks
if the code calling put handles the queue overflow exception you can use this as pressure to try to stop accepting new jobs perhaps shunting them to another server or alerting an administrator
doing similar things with deferredsemaphore is a bit trickier since there s no way to limit how many jobs are waiting to be able to acquire the semaphore

2862508
serializable	deserialization
shared objects will handle serialization deserialization for you transparently
there are some caveats not every object can really be serializable
for starters it has to have a parameterless constructor

2862658
int	double
the compiler can t decide if its better to convert the int to complex to use the first or to double and use the second
to avoid this you need to either define overloaded operator+ for all possible types you might want to add to a complex int float long unsigned... or not overload operator+ in the first place -- just define a single operator+ that adds two complex and let type conversions deal with all the other cases

for-loop	arrays
how it works your matrix construction gives you a rectangle like this where your a arrays is the set of rows 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 which means the diagonals are over this grid # # 0 1 2 3 # 4 5 6 7 # 8 9 10 11 # # now we re just looping over a skewed rectangle that would look like this normalised # # 0 1 2 3 # 4 5 6 7 # 8 9 10 11 # # now you ll notice that for each row you add you end up with an extra column starting with a # and that the first column is now skewed by this amount if you imagine holding the first row in place sliding the rows below to the left
so for our outer for-loop over the columns the first column is effectively the old first column 0 minus the number of rows m plus 1 which gives 0 - m + 1 or 1 - m
the last column effectively stays in place so we re still looping to n

subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
edit as for references to literature this one seems interesting and not too long and concerns quite wide audience with interesting scenarios
there are many rounding issues when recording financial data. first issue is ability to store and retrieve exact decimal numbers most databases offer decimal data type on which you can specify the number of digits before and after decimal point currencies vary in number of decimal digits too i ve dealt with currencies with 0 2 3 decimal digits when dealing with this data and you want to avoid any unexpected rounding errors on the application side you can use bcd as generic approach or you can use integers to represent any fixed decimal notation or mix your own if this first issue is sorted out then no addition or subtraction can introduce any rounding errors
same goes for multiplication by integer

haskell	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
probably 2 or 3 years ago ocaml led the field in practical functional languages but since then haskell has overtaken it with more libraries more features better performance and wider commercial use

superclass	subclassing
the reason behind this is that subclassa.somelist does not in any way replace or override superclass.somelist - it just shadows it so the subclassing methods see subclassa.somelist instead of superclass.somelist
however this has absolutely no effect in superclass
methods can be made virtual and in java they are by default but data members can t

disk	ram
another example a machine needs to grab large numbers of small files from a machine in an ad-hoc manner parse them and store the results in a database
in this case using sftp to move them from disk back to another disk to be immediately read and pushed into a db is just silly
there is no reason the smaller files wouldn t fit in ram until being parsed and pushed into the database and hence sftp probably isn t the best solution

post	get
hope it s more clear now and will help you
no possibility to do this directly from server as post data should be sent by the browser
but you can choose an alternative the prefilled form autommatically submited ini your example could work but as you wrote it s not really good practice and can leave users on a blank page receive get arguments and post them with curl or any decent http client to second site then transfer result to browser

2865557
post	get
application logic should need little adjustement on this part if domain 2 app expects to get post data in the same request as visitor is coming it won t do it
from domain 2 point of view the client doing post request will be server hosting domain 1 not the client browser it s important if client ip matters or other client checks are done on domain 2. if the post request serves to display client specific content you also had to do some server-side tracking to combine previously posted data with the visitor being redirected
hope it s more clear now and will help you

2865611
folder	directory
you can either place file in the same directory structure under src test resources - src test resources com mycompany whatever config.xml - or you can add a leading to the path - this makes getresourceasstream load the file from the base of the classpath - so if you change it to getresourceasstream config.xml you can just put the file in src test resources config.xml
place the config.xml file in src test resources and add src test resources as a source folder in eclipse
the other issue is how getresourceasstream config.xml works with packages

for-loop	loops
and your creating them in a loops like this now for the onclick listener you might attempt something like this but you ll find that this will have every link alert 3
because at the time of the click your onclick code is executed and the value of menuitem is evaluated to the last item since that was the value it was last assigned upon the last iteration of the for-loop
we re actually creating a function that accepts item and then immediately call that function passing menuitem

2866101
next	except
an operation like addition creates a new value after all so it has to be created somewhere
this is more efficient than it seems since the compiler is free to do return value optimization which means it can construct the value directly where it will next be used
the result is declared as a local variable and hence goes away with the function call - except if rvo see above is used in which case it was never actually created in the function but in the caller

2866133
mongodb	bson
looking at the php language center page at mongodb.org for example i see a few libraries that provide direct object mapping such as simplemongodb or mongodb-php-odm. they use their own api so maybe just writing a simple conversion function from an array to an object instance yourself is more suited for you
i see no mentioning of the mongodb php driver returning objects in either the api documentation or the tutorial
this is not really surprising as the official drivers stay close to the native bson document type used to represent documents

the simplest way that came to my mind to display the replies is to put a web browser control in the form generate a full html page in a string from the xml and throw it in that web browser control
and under it i can put the text box with the add reply button. everything is ok except that i have no idea of how i could implement the edit function on my own replies i mean i could add a link in there.
but link to what i would like to know if there is a way to get that edit event from the web browser control my guess is i can t or another maybe simple easy idea of displaying the replies in a winform using other controls

geocoding	geocode
i believe that the google geocode is a great tool for when you give it a full address in at least a street locality country format and it is also very reliable in other formats when it doesn t have to deal with any ambiguities geocoding london uk always worked for me
however in your case i would really consider pre-computing all the coordinates of each german locality and simply handle the geocoding yourself from within your database
i think this is quite feasible especially since your application is localized to just one country

a very small qty of people out there really corellate it with what it really is and why has it got it s name - an atomic-precise descriptive structured knowledge representation framework
if i say rss in non-it-pro crowd i ve got a very good chance to be instantly understood what i mean today but if i say atom - hardly anyone will get it any of that fast and clear
rss is de-facto a name for syndication feed

rss is de-facto a name for syndication feed
that s why think it can be a good idea to label it rss while technically giving 100 atom and only atom - software does not care oat s drawn on a button and end-users will get what they ve meant to get
imho

inherited	properties
then your code would look like this notice that this required making fe a properties since member fields cannot be declared virtual
the explanation for why you re not getting the behavior you want is that the new keyword only overrides an inherited member in the event that a variable is declared as the derived class at compile time
if it s declared as the base class at compile time as anaobject is in your blah method it goes with the base class version this is what differentiates new from override

2867732
pull	push
if nobody pulls from that branch i would have recommended to rebase your feature branch on top of dev instead of merging dev directly in feature
that can avoid a messy history if several features are developed on dev but aside that detail pushing it to the github repo is a viable workflow if nobody try to pull and merge that branch that is so a good naming convention is in order
if your github repo is a fork of a main project you definitively can push your own branch and delete it later

uiview	subviews	uiview	subviews
or more simply you could just add the uiactivityindicator as a subviews to the main window
you could either subclass a uiviewcontroller instead and set a table property adding a uitableview as a subclass to the uiview making it behave exactly like a uitableviewcontroller
or more simply you could just add the uiactivityindicator as a subviews to the main window

objectdataprovider	xmldataprovider
putting an xmldataprovider in the resources and then doing a d datacontext to reference it seemed like a good way to go but i can t make it work
i can t use any of my viewmodel classes for this like with a d designdata or using objectdataprovider because they don t expose setters for all properties
can t set those properties with design-time data if they re read-only

gridview	repeater	gridview	repeater
bind your datasource control to the repeater
also you can use templatecolumn with gridview and add your labels into this template column
but imo repeater is simpler to customize your view by templates

to finish it out you d need to parse the first result into a datetime compare it with now and use ftp.delete to get rid of the remote file if it s too old

run it and you ll get output something like this which should be a start towards what you re trying to achieve

2868411
downcasting	upcasting
thus if you have no rtti it can t do a dynamic cast when you re downcasting upcasting is safe because you can determine types at compile time and thus you can upcast with dynamic_cast to the base class
3 dynamic_cast downcasting is for polymorhpic types eg types with a virtual function in them and thus if the class isn t polymorphic its not going to work
so if cbase doesn t have a virtual function you can t use dynamic_cast with it

accessor	properties
warning code written in stackoverflow comment window so you will most likely need to tweak it a bit
this is actually pretty simple because of the kvo and kvc accessor that are available on nsset and nsarray
of course the properties name is up to you since i cannot see your data model but that gives you a general idea of where the code needs to go

2868767
inherited	properties
this way only the needed values pass through
that s because you edit array.prototype and thus any array created inherited the custom-made visible method indexof that the in command can see
for..in construct in javascript doesn t act like for example php s foreach - it doesn t just iterate all the items in the array but also iterates all the methods and properties the array object might have arrays in javascript are actually disguised objects

2868981
fread	strcpy	fread	strcpy
also initializing a pointer is not the same thing as allocating memory for it finally please get in the habit of using strncpy over strcpy its much safer
there are actually three segmentation faults here the first one is fread which is attempting to write to memory that does not yet exist as far as your process is concerned
the second one is strcpy expounding on the first you are attempting to copy to a pointer that points to nothing

2869070
for-loop	loops
it sees a reference to i at its current value instead of the value when you created the function
after the for-loop exits i will be 8 so all your anonymous functions will update
i think this might fix it i m not sure if declaring the var inside loops body will rebind it for every iteration

2869403
for-loop	loops
but there is some legitimate ones
the point is that you can use them anywhere you can provide an expression inside an if or a while conditional in a for-loop iteration block in function call parameters is using coma you must use parenthesis to avoid confusing with actual function parameters in macro parameter etc
the most usual use of comma is probably in loops control when you want to change two variables at once or store some value before performing loops test or loops iteration

2869462
google-chrome	firefox
elements defined inside the firefox extensions are part of the browser user interface google-chrome
since web pages run javascript with restricted privileges they cannot do a lot of things and among them they cannot reference or interact directly with the google-chrome elements
javascript code running in the extension can access elements defined in the web pages because it has high privilege

2869842
instances	transient
what you re describing is retry with constant backoff and chances are you ll eventually need it somewhere else be it talking to a web service an email server or any other complicated system susceptible to transient failures
for instances this simple method invokes the underlying method up to maxattempts times whenever an exception is thrown unless it is a subclass of a throwable listed in noretryfor
this advice could be applied to any bean you wish using spring s aspect support

2871482
comparator	icomparer
this allows you to sort strings differently under different circumstances which the interface simply cannot anticipate
but in addition to being able to re-define the way a comparison is performed sometimes providing an external comparator is the only way you can do it
for example the windows forms listview class allows you to specify an icomparer for its sort logic

2871482

for example the windows forms listview class allows you to specify an icomparer for its sort logic
but listviewitem does not implement comparator
so without a comparer strategy that knows how to do it listviewitem is not sortable because it has no default comparator implementation

inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
even subclassing don t see private methods

range	min	range	max
one is to provide min max functions in the class s interface
another might be to use external functionality and yes numeric_limits might just be the thing since a range is sometimes a type of numeric quantity
you could even provide a more generic interface that has a validate_input function in your class so that you can do any comparison that might be appropriate

2876631
folder	directory	folder	directory
right now if any of the files or sub directory are not readable then your program will crash
another option that isn t so reliant on try blocks is to check the permissions before trying to add the file folder to your tarball
there is a whole question about how to best do this and some pitfalls to avoid when using windows python - test directory permissions the basic pseudo code would be something like if folder has read permissions add folder to tarball else for each item in folder if item has read permission add item to tarball

2876649
ienumerable	iqueryable
as for which is preferred over the other it depends on what your underlying datasource is
returning an ienumerable will automatically force the runtime to use linq to objects to query your collection
returning an iqueryable which implements ienumerable by the way provides the extra functionality to translate your query into something that might perform better on the underlying source linq to sql linq to xml etc.

if someone need to provide an implementation for that list it must to implements the +20 methods every time

inherited	subclassing
each new-style class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclassing
this method returns a list of all those references still alive. so to answer your question the __subclasses__ functionality is not available because in your second example class foo pass the old-style class foo does not inherited from object so it s not a new-style class and there for does not inherited the __subclasses__ method
note if you don t understand why an old-style class does not have the __subclasses__ method you could always fire up a python interpreter and do some inspection with dir

sharepoint	spsite
this is true also for the spsite and spweb objects returned by spcontext.site spcontext.current.site spcontext.web and spcontext.current.web
when handling disposable object and sharepoint in particular it is simpler to use using however note that you should not dispose of elements that come from current context - they are shared and disposing of them may cause this error
this is a common mistake and in my opinion should have been handled better by the api

2877458
sharepoint	spsite
this is a common mistake and in my opinion should have been handled better by the api

they only have meaning in the old 16-bit segmented memory model commonly seen on early intel 80x86 s
in 32- and 64bit land everything since 1994 memory is just a big contiguous block so a pointer is just a pointer as far as a single application is concerned

sorting	filtering	disk	ram
i would urge you to do as much work on the back-end as possible and to limit your client to render the data in a manner that is appropriate for your users
while many may balk at this suggestion it s based on a number of observations from building many such systems in the past if you re going to filtering some of the data returned by your service you ve just wasted thousands of clock cycles shipping data that need never have left your server if you re going to sort your data your db could have done the sorting for you often using otherwise idle cpu ticks while waiting for the data to be read from its disk
your server most likely has more cpu and ram available than your clients and has a surprising amount of free time to use for sorting filtering running inline calculations etc. while its waiting for disk to read sectors etc

parallels	bootcamp
dual-booting into windows using bootcamp on osx is stil the recommended method of developing for the windows platform especially if you want to use hyper-v guest vm s
the winphone7 and winphone8 emulator is itself a vm and few if any general-purpose vm s will host another vm infrastructure which is why it crashes parallels etc
if you want to have the emulator run from within a different vm to the one ms provides then you re into the realm of extracting images toggling bits and trying to tack it into your vm of choice

cpu	processors
then a cpu has internalregisters for instance for pic processors instruction counters
more registers doesn t necessarily make things faster they make the cpu architecture more complicated as the registers have to be close to other components and many instructions work only on specific registers
but modern cpus have more than four registers from top of my head there are ax bx cx dx si di bp .

for example if your chromosome is encoded as a binary string of lenght 100 if you have 1 mutation probability it means that 1 out of your 100 bits on average picked at random will be flipped
crossover basically simulates sexual genetic recombination as in human reproduction and there are a number of ways it is usually implemented in gas
sometimes crossover is applied with moderation in gas as it breaks symmetry which is not always good and you could also go blind so we talk about crossover probability to indicate a ratio of how many couples will be picked for mating they are usually picked by following selection criteria - but that s another story

maven	pom.xml
any maven project follows a standard directory layout which dictates where you should put your data files in the resources directories
the conventional maven directory structure is as follows.
src src main java src main java app.java src main resources src main resources my.prod.data.or.cfg.or.whatever src test java src test java apptest.java src test resources src test resources my.test.data.or.cfg.or.whatever pom.xml the benefit of this is that all files which are contained in the main prod resources directories are available to your application at run-time from the classpath

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is far less accurate
firefox and google-chrome get their geolocation data from google s geolocation service as documented above
apple s safari gets its data from skyhook

handle the request because the functions list-posts review-post and review-archive don t return sensible xexpr encodings of html you ll have to view source to see them right

union	distinct
don t use union when union all will suffice
if you know that there can be no duplicates between two selects of a union there s no point letting the dbms try to remove them
similarly don t use select distinct on a table if you re retrieving all the primary key columns or all columns in a unique constraint

post	get	post	put
you can get its name as follows you need to move it to a permanent location using move_uploaded_file else it will get lost you can store the path in database the usual way
to upload a file you need at least a html post form with multipart form-data encoding
therein you put an field to browse the file and a submit button to submit the form

folder	directory
something like this is important since with php5.3 for example using the splclassloader it requires a namespace-to-directory mapping like this is where my conceptual misunderstanding is how to setup that 4th git repository to allow my directory mappings like above
let s say i have 3 git repositories each with a lib and tests folder in the root
all 3 repositories are part of what i want to be a single package however it is important to me to keep the repositories separate
