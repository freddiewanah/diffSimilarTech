to do this i would read up on lex and yacc or the gnu variants flex and bison to get a feel for how you can lexicalize input and then place it into some sort of hierarchical structure
either way i suggest you read the wikipedia entries on earley and cyk parsers i would link to them but the spam prevention won t allow me to post more than one link
it should shed some light on the basics of natural language parsing

that s totally your responsibility
the iphone will start all your asynchronous nsurlconnection s in parallel
the only thing that will stop it is your memory i recently implemented a connection pool my solution was based on nsoperationqueue just because of that

ant	maven
this is how i did it note that we re using ant in our legacy corporate project you probably should be using maven which should eliminate 50 of those steps below 1.download the most recent jax-ws distribution from the exact version i got was jaxws2.2-20091203.zip 2.place the jax-ws jars with the dependencies in a separate folder like lib webservices
3.create a patternset in ant to reference those jars 4.include the patternset in your war-related goal
this could look something like not the flatten true parameter - it s important as weblogic 9.x is by default not smart enough to access jars located in a different lcoation than web-inf lib inside your war file 5.in case of clashes weblogic uses its own jars by default

2881411
post	put
after some 3 days of frustration. and yes i know i should ve put 9 and 10 under a single bullet-point but the title 10 steps to deploy a jax-ws web service under web logic 9.2 using ant sounds just so much better
please edit this post and improve it if you find something missing

if you had asked how to get all the comments for multiple posts as efficiently as possible i d point you to my blog for a good technique but since you haven t i won t because that would just be blog-whoring
you should define on the post to give you easy access from post to comment
once you ve done that it s a simple backwards relationship note that this isn t really a question of efficiency

erlang	ocaml
haskell is a good choice for learning techniques and functional programming but isn t what i d call the most practical language to do real work in at this time
erlang is more practical but not quite as amenable to metaprogramming
ocaml is another possible choice but suffers a bit on the practicality front as well

2882325
haskell	ocaml
ocaml is another possible choice but suffers a bit on the practicality front as well
it is more accessible than haskell in many regards however
in the scripting language world ruby is a language in which metaprogramming is a popular technique

2882328
lisp	prolog
some prolog ai books start with implementing a meta-interpreter in prolog and then changing it by need
the second is as mentioned lisp and particularly clos common list object system which includes commands for meta-oop
finally python support a nice and not too obscure mechanism for run-time meta-programming which is it s meta-classes classes that create classes

versioning	upgrade
also on the size and location of the development team and of course organization
if you support several versioning of the database you might need even more environments
in real world i found the following approach rather satisfying single central database application for testing purposes gets all the changes by various developers periodically merged into it local copies for development so you are free to drop and reload the whole database upgrade scripts are maintained for any changes to schema auxiliary and sample data sets here are some further points if two developers two teams are working on changes that can affect each other then they should complete their tasks independently and then integrate merge and test

2882524
folder	directory
this works fine in a dev server the folder that has the flex app lives inside the web project and in the dev ennvironment makes calls hostname ie www.someurl.com in the actual live scenario this will be an intranet so not hostname to call the flex app seems to have trouble calling directory name it seems to totally miss the virtual directory name
im thinking moving the flex app folder out and hosting as a separate app might make it work

maven	pom.xml
i ll leave it to the community to decide whether this should be closed as a duplicate
as my maven project grows i m trying to stay on top of the project structure
so far i have a nested directory layout with 2-3 levels where there s a pom.xml on each level with module entries corresponding to the directories at that level

integer	fractions	subtract	add
for example on an x86 it translates almost directly to fyl2x y log 2 x and f2xm1 2 x -1 fyl2x fld st 0 frndint fsubr st 1 st fxch st 1 fchs f2xmi fld1 faddp st 1 st fscale fstp st 1 the code ends up a little longer than you might expect primarily because f2xm1 only works with numbers in the range -1.0..1.0
the fld st 0 frndint fsubr st 1 st piece subtract off the integer part so we re left with only the fractions
we apply f2xm1 to that add the 1 back on then use fscale to handle the integer part of the exponentiation

2882883
folder	directory
this will save you a lot of headaches with jars versioning
as a general rule you should avoid putting jar files in the tomcat lib folder
tomcat doesn t need jar files other than those originally to be found in its lib directory

2882883

if you need a jar file you should put it in web-inf lib folder of your application
this will save you a lot of headaches with jars versioning

2882886
base	fractions
once you have a good grasp on the algorithm for that reduced case you will find it fairly straightforward to extend it to handle fractions exponents
typically the implementation of the pow double double function in math libraries is based on the identity using this identity you only need to know how to raise a single number a to an arbitrary exponent and how to take a logarithm base a
you have effectively turned a complicated multi-variable function into a two functions of a single variable and a multiplication which is pretty easy to implement

2882977
serializable	deserialization
i think it s because you re using public fields instead of properties for name and userid
edit it appears it also has to do with the fact that you are using the serializable attribute instead of datacontract and datamember
check out this post for more detail c# automatic property deserialization of json

right now it seems to be working except that the exe build can t load any of my images cannot load image c path to build exe.win32-3.1 resources image.png file is not a windows bmp file googling has revealed that this happens when the sdl imaging library doesn t get included correctly
however sdl_image.dll and libpng12-0.dll are both put by cx_freeze into my build directory so it seems to me like everything should be fine

maven	pom.xml	maven-release-plugin	pom.xml
why is the sources jar still being built
i am trying to release a web project using maven 2.2.1 and the maven-release-plugin 2.0-beta-9 but it always fails when doing release perform on generating the sources jar for the ear project which makes sense since the ear project doesn t have any source
to try to disable the building of a sources jar for the ear project i added the following to the pom.xml for my ear project the version of the release plugin is set in a parent pom.xml upon running the release again after checking in this change i got the same error while generating the sources jar for the ear project even though this should have been disabled by the previous pom.xml snippet

2883320
serializable	deserialization
perhaps you need to think a little more about what you mean by simply serializing the object since that s the rub
if you re talking about the inbuilt java serializable then you wouldn t even need to retain the file extension
the serialized form has enough information such that the deserialization process will produce an identical object without any additional help

2883353
for-loop	loops
i am deciding on whether to do it i am already optimizing or whether it will be a waste of my time
will a compiler optimize tihs into somecondition is trivially constant within the for-loop
this may seem obvious and that i should do this myself but if you have more than one condition then you are dealing with permuatations of for loops so the code would get quite a bit longer

2883386
cpu	processors
on an old compaq 1ghz 1 processors machine i was able to create about 10 000 counters and monitor them remotely for about 20 cpu usage
these aren t custom counters just checking cpu or whatever
basically you can monitor all the counters on any decent newer machine with very little impact

2883608
post	get	post	get
it is a fairly common principal that an http get changing data on the server is a bad idea
changing the server s state should usually happen through a post
as a result each url which is used for both get and post should have specific actions that differ based on the type of request

2883866
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
in objective-c getters get the variable and are usually named the same thing as the variable so in the person example the getter would be - int age and setters set the variable it would be named - void setage int theage
if you use accessor you can freely change your implementation in the future even getting rid of the ivar completely if necessary without reliant classes breaking
in objective-c the combination of an ivar and accessor is often called a properties although there doesn t necessary have to be an ivar if the value is dynamically created

2883866
accessor	superclass
you should rarely if ever access ivars in superclass
if you re a purist you shouldn t even directly access ivars in the same class except in accessor init and dealloc and the latter two are subject to debate

2884279
memset	malloc
always memset-ing to 0 after malloc is a very good practice
i also use memset buffer 0 sizeof buffer
the risk of not using it is that there is no guarantee that the buffer you are using is completely empty there might be garbage which may lead to unpredictable behavior

2884311
memset	calloc
either is undesirable
however unless completely eschewing dynamically allocated memory most statically allocated buffers are typically rather small which makes memset relatively cheap
in fact much cheaper than most calls to calloc for dynamic blocks which tend to be bigger than 2k

2884327
division	multiplication
in particular the newton-raphson method when implemented carefully can ensure that the time performance of your division is within a constant factor of your arbitrary-precision multiplication
you should probably try something like long division but using computer words instead of digits
in a high-level language it will be most convenient to consider your digit to be half the size of your largest fixed-precision integer

2884765
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
afterall it is presumably anyway a problem with the input and not the algorithm used to construct the thing
argumentnullexception is an obvious choice for the first check
since it appears that a thing is derived from an input parameter i would throw an argumentexception to indicate that a thing cannot be constructed from the specified input

2884770
getter	setter
in that case you should always use the setter
accessing the field directly or using the getter usually doesn t make a big difference unless your getter performs some lazy initialization or other processing
so it depends on what the getter does but my rule of thumb is to always use the getter except in specific cases

2884802
nullreferenceexception	invalidoperationexception	nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
if some other thing is null you should probably throw an invalidoperationexception with a descriptive message
you should never explicitly throw a nullreferenceexception
if null was passed as a parameter you should throw an argumentnullexception with the name of the parameter

2884802
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception
if null was passed as a parameter you should throw an argumentnullexception with the name of the parameter
if some other thing is null you should probably throw an invalidoperationexception with a descriptive message

installation	upgrade
1b how do i know if that upgrade is compatible with 5.8.4 of perl i don t want to upgrade perl at this point 2 if not how do i apply that patch defined in that link
i am making a change to perl tk for an application that has its own resident perl and modules installation so we can drop the app in and go
i ve found a problem i am experiencing that i just stumbled on what seems to be the patch i need here bug confirmed

2884885
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
on the other hand it s odd to throw argumentexception after using the argument
invalidoperationexception isn t quite appropriate here but i might be tempted to use it as the closest thing to a contract failure.
edit you should also consider creating your own exception as per aaronaught s answer

2884903
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is a special case where it will stop copying at a null byte but still continue to pad the output with nulls up to the specified length
strcpy and other str methods stop when they encounter a null 0 byte
memcpy and related functions to not stop when they encounter a null byte

2885280
std	ostream
i would like to use the istream connection in a std ostream
something like this to accomplish this i ve implemented the following code yes the code compiles and seems to work but i ve not had the pleasure of implementing a std streambuf before
so i d just like to know if it s correct and complete

2885435
memcpy	strcpy
as opposed to strcpy which will blissfully copy forever until a 0 byte is found - even if said byte is well beyond your buffer
memcpy is used to copy from source to dest no matter what the source data contains
it also tends to be very hardware optimized and will often read system words int s long s at a time to speed up copying when alignment allows

2885781
subnet	packets
that is almost certainly a gateway s ip address
you will probably be able to guess the network address and subnet mask based on the ip address of the gateway but this might not be something you can trust
if you want to try to make this work on a network with a non-standard netmask you can try to do the following. make two ip address sized accumulator variables and then for each arp verified address in your table you do you could also use destination ip addresses that aren t multicast in packets that came from the gateway for this but you would have to know the gateway before you could flag them as such

for-loop	arrays
both arraylist and linkedlist implement contains in terms of indexof arraylist - indexof is a c-style for-loop on the backing arrays
linkedlist - indexof walks the linked list in a c-style for-loop
for 3 and 4 you have to distinguish between containskey and containsvalue

subtraction	multiplication
as is true in all multiplication variations of upper digits do not influence the lower digits of the multiplication result
robert jenkins 96 bit mix function robert jenkins has developed a hash function based on a sequence of subtraction exclusive-or and bit shift
all the sources in this article are written as java methods where the operator represents the concept of unsigned right shift

2886443
put	get
part of the proposal is the discussion of how current popular templating engines work
this is an easier question to answer the trend seems to be to put it into a script element with type text html
since most browsers don t know what to do with a script of that type the element goes ignored but is still part of the dom so you can get to it using a selector

2886530
system.xml	xmlnodelist
i ve got the full source code here if it helps i know the epubconstructor.parsedocument method is horribly messy i m just trying to get it working at the moment before i split it into classes
so i m currently working on an epub reader application and i ve been reading through a bunch of regular xml files just fine with system.xml and xmldocument however now i m trying to open the xhtml files that contain the actual book text and they re xhtml files
now i don t really know the difference between the two but i m getting the following error with this code in the same document using the same xmldocument and xmlnodelist variable xmldoc.load path.combine directory.getcurrentdirectory oebps part1.xhtml

2886627
for-loop	loops
if you literally have a tiny loops i j and k are fine and typical index counters
sometimes a more descriptive name can help illuminate intent but if the for-loop is set up like the following then a more descriptive name doesn t really matter
that said abbreviations should never be used unless they re used consistently

2886649
for-loop	loops
just confused if i need to create another loops for that or not
working on an rsync script and the portion below is in a for-loop
what i want to achieve is assign a variable to every arguement after 3

2886726
email	dkim
i would agree with him that the first 2 things you should address are reverse ptr record and dkim signing
also very important ip address of the box to send email not already being blacklisted
make sure postmaster emailsendingdomain.com is a valid email box if your server generated email needs to appear to come from somewhere else like a contact form needing to come from name email provided in a form follow these guidelines for email headers

2886983
strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strncpy	strlen	strcpy
depending on c function strings need or don t need an ending 0
functions like strlen and strcpy need to work on 0 terminated strings in order to know when to stop
functions like strncpy don t need the source string to be 0-terminated since one argument tells how many characters to copy

2886983
strlen	strncpy
functions like strncpy don t need the source string to be 0-terminated since one argument tells how many characters to copy
when you declare name as you do the contents of what name points to is stored in read-only memory and can not be modified however you can use name in c functions that do not modify the contents strlen name or when used as a source


2886986
persistent	transient
for example if you were using clojure you could use transient to some additional speed
if you structure your data in such a way that you can use a persistent data structure to model your neural network functional updates to the neural network will be cheap at least compared to copying the whole thing
if it is still not fast enough your language may allow other techniques such as careful use of mutation to speed it up

2887029
hash	md5
from simple things like your suggestion add squares of elements and computing xor the elements to complicated things like sort them print them to a string and compute md5 on them
but since collisions are still possible you have to verify any hash match by comparing the original lists if you keep them sorted this is easy


2887107
folder	dir
these are the steps i took created an empty dir root cloned all repos that i want to be subrepos inside this folder root sub1 root sub2 created and added the .hgsub file in the root repo root .hgsub and put all the mappings of the sub repos in it using tortoisehg right clicked on root and selected create repository here again with tortoise selected all the files inside root and added them to to the root repo commited the root repo pushed the local root repo into an empty repo i have set up on kiln then i pulled the root repo in eclipse using import- mercurial
now i see that all the subrepos appear as though they are unversioned no orange cylinder icon next to their corresponding folder in the eclipse file explorer
furthermore when i right click on one of the subrepos i don t get all the hg commands in the team menu as i usually get with root projects - no pull push etc

2887190
restrict	shared
more functionality for a given amount of implementation effort the existing primitives can be combined to solve a much larger range of tasks than what would be the case if the same effort went into implementing monolithic non-composable commands
as the linux command line example shows composability is not necessarily restrict to functional programming but the concept is the same have smallish pieces of code that do restrict tasks and build more complex functionality by routing the outputs and inputs appropriately
the point is that functional programming is well suited to this with immutable variables and restrictions on side effects you can compose more easily as you need not worry about what happens under the hood in the function being called - like updating a shared variable so the result will be invalid for certain sequences of operations or accessing a shared lock so certain call sequences will give a deadlock

2887422
move	drag
but you will need to write code to detect the drag remove the toolbar element from the visual tree and then add it as a root visual to your own window or hwndsource
you ll then need to detect when the window is over your drop zone to move the toolbar from the window to the main window s visual tree and close the other window


2887684
pull	push
but you cannot have the webservice push the changes to its clients the webservice cannot detect changes and then notify the clients
the clients have to come and ask the web service for the data pull model
if you need to be able to notify clients of changes you might be better off posting a message onto a message queue like msmq and have the clients who are interested in that data notification listen on that queue for new messages to show up

2887727
free	malloc
if you wish to allocate the strings dynamically you can make the elements pointers to char but then you must malloc memory for each string not forgetting the extra char for the trailing 0 that c strings have
and free all of them when you are done unless you just exit the program at that point


2887757
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties	superclass	subclassing
remember that assigning to a properties is a message and that your object is not fully initialized yet
sending a message to an incompletely-initialized or incompletely-deallocated object is asking for trouble particularly when subclassing are involved since they may override the accessor methods in ways the superclass doesn t expect
so in init only assign directly to the instance variables

2887907
gdk	cairo
to draw an ellipse you could use gdk_draw_arc
note that using gdk for drawing is quite outdated
you could use cairo and functions cairo_rectangle and cairo_arc for this

2888009
pseudo-class	visited
the link selector specifies the behavior of the link when it s not clicked nor activated for any reason in other words in its normal state
the active pseudo-class adds a style to an element that is activated
if you need to be more specific and for example want to highlight what you mouseover in other word only when the link is under your mouse put this in the head section of your html if you want to highlight what you already visited vs what not put this in the head section of your html then every clicked link would be highlighted when you come back to the page

2888145
ant	maven
at the end of the maven build we have a few jar and war files that we need to deploy onto our development testing environment
right now we re using a pretty hefty ant script that performs several tasks on both windows linux machines starts stops services copies deletes files builds some stuff and then executes it etc ant does the job well - but the script is quickly getting very large and to be honest it feels inadequate for the task at hand
i ve heard of gant but i m not sure that s the right way to go

2888423
implements	extends
e.g
if you don t want to use datainputstream.readfully there is ioutils.readfully from apache commons-io or you can implements the read loop explicitly
if you have more advanced needs such as reading from a segment in the middle of the file or larger amounts of data then extends inputstream and overriding the read byte int int as well as read will give you better performance than just overriding the read method

2888544
xslt	xquery	xslt	xquery
in xpath 2.x this also means xslt 2.x and xquery 1.x simply escape an apostrophe by entering two adjacent apostrophes escape a quote by entering two adjacent quotes as defined by the xpath 2.0 language
in xpath 1.0 you can use the built-in entities and in xslt 1.0 alternatively you can define your and variables put the content the literal or the literal character in the body of the xslt variable not in the select attribute
in xpath 2.x this also means xslt 2.x and xquery 1.x simply escape an apostrophe by entering two adjacent apostrophes escape a quote by entering two adjacent quotes as defined by the xpath 2.0 language

2888790
screens	hdpi
in terms of getting access to both devices i ve heard good things about device anywhere but have never personally tried their service
if all you want to do is check that your activity layout looks good on both screens i would say that testing on one of them is probably sufficient
they are both hdpi devices so android should use the same resources when drawing the screens

2888969
firefox	safari
the following works in recent webkit browsers including safari on iphone running os 3.0
it uses the non-standard but convenient intersectsnode method of range which exists in webkit but was removed from firefox in 3.0 so it doesn t work in recent versions of firefox but could be made to do so trivially
the following will surround each selected text node with a element with a class of someclass and also a unique class to allow easy undoing

2888985
versioning	upgrade
on that remote server the instance node is named sql2008 and is versioning 10
when i connect to the sql2008 remote instance from my local pc the connection is shown locally as being a sql server versioning 8.0 instance
i suspect that locally i am only being shown databases that are somehow in the remote 2008 instance but have not been upgrade

usually it would look something like this if it isn t null-terminated output will continue until a nul byte is found that s why it outputs values that are placed in the memory behind your array like the int bogus2 which is 0x00000718 in hex stored in little endian format 0x18 ctrl-x 0x07 ctrl-g 0x00 ends the output

mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
these are similar but mouseenter does not fire upon moving the mouse from a child element to the main element whereas mouseover will fire the event again
the same logic applies to mouseleave vs mouseout
however jquery provides a shortcut for this kind of usage the .hover method

simple example here
i m not sure it s possible to control the cursor but you can simply focus the element in google-chrome if your element with id editor has any content then the whole content will be selected
in firefox you don t see a cursor but if you type after loading the page it will appear in the element

client-side	server-side
this uses prototype but jquery closure and all the other libs can do much the same thing just with slightly different syntax server-side java in the jsp mdash
this is just like getting fields from a form that s been submitted client-side javascript using prototype s ajax.request if you prefer jquery for the client-side here s that prototype code rewritten for jquery s ajax function

when the user presses a key or clicks the mouse i wanna stop and do a specific action
the problem in my above code is that it doesnt stop whenever i do an action

but generally the limit is around 2 000 characters for the get method of a url
you can use a proxy page that does a post method if your api supports it and that has a larger limit of 5 000 characters
we are currently investigating using a proxy page with the google map api as we have crashed into the 2 000 character limit

2889520
hash	hmac
i believe this is because the security of an hmac is dependant on its secret key and a collision cannot be found until this key is obtained
actually it s essentially because being able to generate a collision for a hash does not necessarily help you generate a collision for the hash-of-a-hash combined with the xoring used by hmacs
no not if the hash has a preimage attack which allows you to prepend data to the input

if printletter is really just supposed to print a single chars you should change its argument to be a chars
the function is declared as which means it takes a pointer to an array of int

2889867
equals	tostring
from the api docs on abstractlist inherited by for instance arraylist linkedlist vector public boolean equals object o compares the specified object with this list for equality
returns true if and only if the specified object is also a list both lists have the same size and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two lists are equals
the same applies to for instance the tostring hashcode method and so on

2889867
equals	tostring
the same applies to for instance the tostring hashcode method and so on
as pascal mentions in the comments the list interface mentions the equals method and states the following in the documentation the list interface places additional stipulations beyond those specified in the collection interface on the contracts of the iterator add remove equals and hashcode methods

addition	multiplication
for the record i ve been known to revert attempted optimizations that did not have the balance of performance gains i wanted. binary operations are faster than normal operations
fwiw addition is a binary operation
so is multiplication

2889920
fcntl	posix
note that lseek adjusts the file position of the open file description associated with the file descriptor - so it affects other file descriptors duplicated from the original one
removing the error handling from your code to reduce it you have now both fd0_dup and fds 0 refer to the same open file description because of the dup so the fcntl operation affected both file descriptors
hence the observed behaviour here is required by posix

you might also consider running your string through a compression algorithm putting the compressed result into your c++ file by any of the above methods and decompressing after the program was loaded. i suspect you can get a decompression algorithm into a few thousand bytes
i suspect you are running into a design limit on the size of a character string. most people really think that a million characters is long enough - to avoid such design limits i d try not to put the whole thing into a single literal string
on the suspicion that #define macro bodies likewise have similar limits i t try not to put the entire thing in a single #define either

after you run these you should get a copy of ltmain.sh in the directory and you ll be all set to run the configure script mkdir sample cd sample echo int main void return 0
foo.c echo bin_programs foo makefile.am autoscan mv configure.scan configure.ac # edit configure.ac add am_init_automake foreign # and lt_init set project name and bug-report-address autoreconf -ivf note that in this example libtool really isn t necessary since the example is just building a simple app

there was much debate about requiring the option to be added at configure time when this feature was added and there is an easy workaround to make it unnecessary. note that with silent-rules enabled you can still get verbose output by running make v 1

you may be able to get what you want by changing your import to this that might delay the exception until you access the value property of the lazy

int	chars
there is no type binary number
well an int is already represented in binary form internally unless you re using a very strange computer but that s an implementation detail -- conceptually it is just an integral number
each time you print a number to the screen it must be converted to a string of chars

uibutton	uinavigationitem
add your uibutton as a left or right barbuttonitem to the uinavigationitem
note that you can create uibutton with any custom view you want
so you can create it with uisegmentedcontrol as well - it is what s likely used in your example

2892261
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
so you can create it with uisegmentedcontrol as well - it is what s likely used in your example
workflow should be something like create momentary momentary property set to yes uisegmentedcontrol with 2 segments assign an image to each of them using setimage forsegmentatindex method
then create uibutton initialized with this uisegmentedcontrol as a custom view using initwithcustomview method

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
these game elements themselves contain x and y coordinates similar to how they are stored in a two dimensional arrays
i was wondering if there was a way to access these vector elements similar to two dimensional arrays access currently i am implementing an for-loop to cycle the elements while comparing its coordinates
this kinda sucks when i need to refresh my display at every game cycle since the large number of comparisons and loops

2892532
maven	m2e
maven install don t help

you may find slimdx more to your liking
personally i found xna a little too game centric for my tastes
i was more interested in design architecture type uses

2892794
int	chars
since this is an integer and not a string it returns int not chars or
calling printf does not have anything to do with returning from the function older versions of c allow a default return type of int
however it s better to explicitly specify the return type

2892969
comparator	comparable
if the ordering of an object is an implementation detail of the object the comparable is more appropriate
if the ordering of the objects is controlled by the caller then comparator is more appropriate

bibtex	latex
you can generate a bibtex file the usual way until all the references are there then cut paste the .bbl file into place in your latex file and annotate and reformat away to your heart s content
so i think that bibtex makes sense as a standard repository of the basic facts about citations you might make again and again in particular you can get it error-free
my experience as a scientific editor is that most authors are sure that their bibliographies are error-free most have between 10 and 60 of entries having errors in them

2893271
bibtex	latex
also if there are errors in your bibtex file you will need to correct them in two places
why i don t like biblatex the bibtex prepresentation is a standard and is accepted by all kinds of other document processors
you shouldn t put special latex formatting into your bibliographic database that will reduce the utility of that database

2893321
for-loop	arrays
you could do something like this to use a foreach but you would still use i and j as index values for the arrays
readability would be better preserved if you just went for the garden variety for-loop instead

here is some source code in c# that you can try for yourself

2893379
srp	principles
there is nothing inherent to the mvc pattern or its variations which lead to a violation of the single responsibility principles
whether the implementation of a controller violates srp or not is based upon whether the encapsulated behavior has more than one reason to change just as any other class not because of any presupposed prescriptive use of the pattern
the example you set forth is a subset of a basic forms over data application where the controller is merely providing crud operations for a given model

2893513
arp	dhcp
that will give you mac and ip addresses for anyone that has recently for different values of recently... communicated with it
listening for arp requests is the canonical way to do this
independent of dhcp or not any connected computer that wishes to communicate with the outside world will have to make an arp request for the address of the default router

2893513
snmp	dhcp
if the other computer uses dhcp it will make an arp request for it s own address as part of duplicate address detection which is also a broadcast you can snoop on
this works more or less the same way for ipv6 except you need to look for neighbor discovery or router soliciation packets instead. like the answer alluded to if you have a switch to which you can telnet or use snmp on you can extract the mac table
that will give you a list of mac adresses on each port in the switch

2893560
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events.
i don t know about wpf but try the keydown event instead of the keypress event for winforms

this is done in a fifo fashion fifo

2893713
queue	fifo
this is done in a fifo fashion fifo
the algorithm of the creator is as follows if the array is not full then put a new number in it the numbers start at 1 and are incremented by one each time so the creator create queue number 1 2 3 etc. sleep for 1 to 10 seconds randomly repeat the algorithm of the remover is as follows if the array is not empty then remove its smallest queue number
sleep for 1 to 10 seconds randomly repeat you should use mutex locks to protect things that must be protected

accessor	properties
another advantage to getters setters is that you can always make properties simple public variables initially and refactor them into getters setters later if needed without changing external code
you don t have to preemptively build accessor for every variable
you can wait until you decide you need them

2894261
client-side	server-side
if you need separate field names you could always name the form fields with separate names and then merge them server-side with something like if this is strictly client-side i would just increment the needed fields and have a standard field name followed by _1 _2 etc
you could easily merge them client-side or server side as needed
i am not sure about json capabilities that would help here

hash	hmac
that s part of the magic of prf
therefore if we can find collisions for a hash function then we know that the internal compression function is not a prf
this does not turn the collisions into an attack on hmac

2894519
pow	math.h
as others have mentioned whenever you use anything out of math.h you need to link with -lm
the reason it may appear that the second parameter works as a constant but not as a variable is that gcc has a built-in implementation of pow
if the second parameter is a constant it might be using that where if it s a variable it s falling back on the glibc pow function

2894519
pow	math.h
if the second parameter is a constant it might be using that where if it s a variable it s falling back on the glibc pow function
see if you pass -fno-builtin to gcc you should see consistent behavior--in this case error messages no matter what you pass to pow
as others have mentioned whenever you use anything out of math.h you need to link with -lm

client-side	server-side
there already exist browser extensions that allow you to modify the dom and scripts on web pages but since it s only client-side they re the only ones that will know
where xss becomes a problem is when people a use it to bypass client-side validation or input filtering or b when people use it to manipulate input fields for example changing the values of option tags in an acl to grant them permissions they shouldn t have
the only way to prevent against these attacks is to sanitize and validate input on the server-side instead of or in addition to client-side validation

maven	pom.xml
if a pom.xml file is present it is using maven
maven is also a make like tool but enforces a much stricter build cycle
plus and this probably is its biggest advantage it automatically downloads supporting jars

2894987
typedef	struct
see here for the gory details but the consensus seems to be that will define a struct pcb incomplete type which is a distinct type from pcb and the structure you re currently defining
barring misspellings that error is almost invariably caused by a missing typedef
in other words the compiler doesn t know about either the pcb_pq or pcb type or both

2895106
queue	fifo
and well your buffer could be implemented as a simple fifo queue
this means that your yielding thread should prepare data to process and make a push call to your queue now the processing thread
it s behaviour should be described this way you should probably add some artificial delay like sleep x between calls to empty if

2895149
tiff	png
so pass jpeg files straight through without conversion
if a tiff container file contains a jpeg image then extract it to a standard jpeg format file
otherwise it s probably best to convert that tiff file to png

2895209
typedef	struct
this is the means i ve always used to construct types that point to themselves linked lists but i ve always thought you had to name the struct so you could use self-reference
in other words you couldn t use within the structure because the typedef is not yet complete at that point
but this particular sample does not name the structure and it still compiles

2895209
typedef	struct
but this particular sample does not name the structure and it still compiles
i thought originally there was some black magic going on in the compiler that automatically translated the above code because the structure and typedef names were the same
this seems a clear violation since there is no struct nothing_like_xyz type defined anywhere

2895332
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
more formally removes the element with the lowest index i such that if such an element exists
perhaps you were confusing this with treeset java.util.treeset note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

2895332
arraylist	treeset	comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal
unfortunately treeset.remove method itself doesn t have any explicit reminder of the above caveat but at least it s prominently placed at the top of the class documentation an illustrative example the following snippet illustrates the difference in behaviors between collections that use equals such as an arraylist and collections that use compare comparator such as a treeset

folder	directory
this unusual behavior was occuring because i had xml documentation file selected in the project build properties
unchecking xml document file stopped the empty bin folder from being created
still no idea why this was happening because the xml documentation file location was set to the same path as the assembly output path but no matter what i did as long as xml documentation file was checked i would always end up with an empty bin directory one level up from the actual bin folder

2895661
atomic	interlocked
if you are on windows you can take a look at interlocked functions variables and if you are of the boost persuasion then you can look at their implementation of atomic variables
if boost is too heavyweight putting atomic c++ into your favourite search engine will give you plenty of food for thought

as samuel suggests you could restrict them to only editing the css and publishing their own graphic content - but this can be rather restrictive
one approach to solving this problem is esi - but that required a high level of skill with the technology for anyone involved - and try to restrict peolpe from doing stuff they shouldn t is rather difficult
another approach is for you to provide a set of html fragments which should contain matched tags and no positional font info other than classes and have the customer provide an html page with a set of placeholder where you insert your content customer provides another approach would be to provide the customer with an online thru-the-web editor

folder	dir	folder	directory
t get any problem while creating .tar.gz file but when use creates .zip file this problem comes across
here is my code also if i use code below for dirpath dirnames filenames in os.walk source_dir myzip.write os.path.join dirpath filename os.path.basename filename myzip.close now the 2nd code taks all files even if it inside the folder subfolders creates a new .zip file and write to it without any directory strucure
it even does not take dir structure for main folder and simply write all files from main dir or subdir to that .zip file

i m struggling to do something which i thought should be straight forward basically i need to create an aspx page which i now realise must be put into a document library but the problem i have is it s only one page and when the page is displayed the breadcrumb has a link to the document library
we really don t want the users to be able to get to the library via the breadcrumb and just want to show the page

weblogic	resin
tomcat competes with jetty and resin but is not comparable with a java ee certified server
bea oracle weblogic server is a commercial java ee application server that implements the whole java ee specification
it is known to be a mature extremely stable secure performant application server and is used in many mission critical applications

int	double	int	boolean	int	boolean
anyval includes boolean so there are no numeric operations defined
here are you individual lists the computed least upper bound lub of double and int needed to capture the type of the new list that includes elements of both the arguments lists passed to is anyval
anyval includes boolean so there are no numeric operations defined

however this may not always be the case and if in any doubt you should contact the website administrators and ask them under what terms you may use their feed
there is no umbrella license attached to the rss technology it is solely at the discretion of the content provider
generally an rss feed that is not restricted behind a login page or similar mechanism is considered public content free to copy and redistribute

valgrind	glibc
if you have been swapping versions of valgrind and glibc there s a chance you found a match but incorrectly configured valgrind at build time
you probably want to ask about this on the valgrind user s mailing list which is extremely helpful
you can suppress output from certain calls however suppressing the noise is all you are doing

2897814
valgrind	glibc
you can suppress output from certain calls however suppressing the noise is all you are doing
the calls are still going through valgrind
to accomplish what you need you ideally match valgrind appropriately with glibc or use the macros in valgrind valgrind.h to work around them

2897814
valgrind	glibc
to accomplish what you need you ideally match valgrind appropriately with glibc or use the macros in valgrind valgrind.h to work around them
using those yes you can tell valgrind not to touch certain things
i m not sure what calls are borking everything however you can also selectively not run bits of code in your own program if its run under valgrind

2897814
valgrind	glibc
the other thing that comes to mind is to make sure that valgrind was compiled correctly to deal with threads
keep in mind that atomic operations under valgrind could cause your program to crash during racey operations where it otherwise might not if not properly configured
if you have been swapping versions of valgrind and glibc there s a chance you found a match but incorrectly configured valgrind at build time

inherited	properties	inherited	properties
looping through properties for..in if it s really a javascript object you can do this to find out what properties it has that will tell you the names of its enumerable properties and whether those are properties of the instance itself or its prototype object
for..in example the loop above would show alpha inherited beta own in no particular order. further information enumerable vs
non-enumerable properties note that not all properties are enumerable

2897921
folder	directory
how can i use it adding only the openssl path and not all the crypto subfolders i use
i am trying to test the crypto library that comes with openssl i downloaded openssl from and it contains a crypto folder with subfolders for each encryption type
i wanted to try bio_f_base64 so i created an empty console app and added the includes needed also added the paths to the bio and evp folders to c++ incl directory and also added the main openssl folder

2897931
libs	buildpath
either way eclipse will automatically place the necessary server-specific libs in the project s classpath buildpath
you should absolutely in no way extract and copy server-specific libs into web-inf lib or even worse the jre lib yourself to fix the compilation errors in eclipse
it would make your webapplication tied to a specific server and thus completely unportable

2897994
cpu	processors
the isr should do the following push any registers which it intends to alter or push all registers handle the interrupt reenable interrupts pop any registers which it pushed use the iret instructions which pops the cpu flags and instruction pointer value from the stack and thus returns to whatever was executing when the interrupt occured
when an interrupt occurs the cpu does the following push the current address contents of the instruction pointer onto the stack
also push the processors flags but not all the other processors registers jump to the address of the isr interrupt service routine which is specified in the interrupt descriptor table

int	boolean	int	boolean	int	chars
for boolean you should use if else as there are a very limited number of states
in java switch only works for byte short chars int and enum
for boolean you should use if else as there are a very limited number of states

2898153
cpu	processors
changing and retrieving performance counter values might help with accessing the existing processors counter via code but this isn t something i ve tried personally
this article from microsoft covers tuning .net application performance and highlights which counters to collect and compare to determine cpu and i o bound applications
you sound like you want to monitor this during execution and bypass your cache when things get intensive

2898300
ant	maven
you can also mention that ant together with ivy can handle dependencies quite similar to maven
and it s quite easy to write your own ant tasks in java


2898391
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strcpy
strcpy on the other hand will copy until it reads a nul aka 0 byte and then stop after that
the main difference is that memcpy always copies the exact number of bytes you specify
strcpy on the other hand will copy until it reads a nul aka 0 byte and then stop after that

2898508
subclass	superclass
the superclass constructor runs before the subclass constructor so the overriding method in the subclass will be invoked before the subclass constructor has run
if the overriding method depends on any initialization performed by the subclass constructor the method will not behave as expected
here s an example to illustrate here when base constructor calls overrideme child has not finished initializing the final int x and the method gets the wrong value

2898767
apache	nginx
then in your pages you can do things like nginx also supports server-side includes with it s ssi module html
if you re using apache you can use server-side includes
these basically provide include statements within html documents

it can package in a number of different ways jar war ear etc
if you choose a packaging that s not specific to web jar then you ll be able to build your app just fine


2899001
put	get
this is all you need to do to get ahah kick-started into a custom bit of js
as i said in my comment the ahah javascript has no error callback so put some breakpoints in ahah.js if things don t seem to be working as expected


2899067
puts	gets
i ve changed targetx y to 0 to see if it does indeed move to the specified point and it does
the problem is when i try and move the view back to where it was originally this puts the uiview about 3x as far as it should
so the view usually gets put off the right side of the screen depending on where it is

2899154
comparator	comparable
most of the framework sorting apis including linq will offer comparer support
there are a few subtle points here it doesn t just support - it also supports the older non-generic comparator as a fallback
this means that it can t be expressed just as for example a generic constraint it supports where t is comparable even though clearly isn t comparator or it prevents explosion of generic type constraints by not demanding them - for examle a can provide a sort even though it doesn t insist that all t are sortable

2899172
children	parent
if it is intended as a parameter to a table-valued function ensure that your database compatibility mode is set to 90
dbo.func_getrelatedacnts returns a table of related accounts all children from a given account
it goes up to the top level parent account of a given account and then selects all child accounts from there

2899183
put	get
for example say i have a list containing multiple items with the following structure fieldchar1 - character fieldchar2 - character fieldchar3 - character fieldnum1 - numeric fieldnum2 - numeric in a nutshell i want to be able to create a linq query that will sum fieldnum1 and fieldnum2 grouped by any one two or all three of the fieldchar fields that will be decided at runtime depending on the users requirements as well as selecting the fieldchar fields in the same query
i have the dynamic.cs in my project which icludes a groupbymany extension method but i have to admit i am really not sure how to put these to use
i am able to get the desired results if i use a query with hard-wired group by requests but not dynamically

2899255
hide	show
a map may be drawn as an association in some situations but some kind of extension stereotypes will be needed or you can define a template class
i don t like the template approach - it hide the associations btw the major players
the last resource is the associationclass a special uml class used to define nxn relations with attributes what i think suits your problem where the integer field is some kind of counter of searchers related to the indexmanager. remember also that by code you can t see the other side of the relationship while uml is designed to show both sides navigation issues and so forth

2899279
jruby	mri
this would be annoying even when using mri ruby however starting up jruby mongrel after every view edit is much slower and much more annoying
note that once it starts up it s quite fast the only issue is startup--the jvm has to load up every time i start jruby mongrel. i m running jruby 1.5.0 rails 2.3.5 and java 6


2899344
apache	nginx	apache	nginx
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache
i m not as familiar with apache internals but a quick grep shows it does use select and epoll -- probably when the server is listening to multiple ports interfaces or if it does simultaneous backend requests for a single client
incidentally i got started with this stuff trying to write a basic socket server and wanted to figure out how nginx was so freaking efficient

2899429
ssl	https
but if you go to the homepage landing page since i control that i m going to rewrite the login page link to be http
then i ll do a ssl handshake with the login page and send you the user the insecure version
so now you re the user doing all your sensitive transactions - and the server thinks it s https - and i m in the middle doing shenanigans

2899617
subtract	addition	subtraction	addition
the carry flag is set only if borrow was required
when doing subtraction you set the carry flag prior to doing the subtract and the new carry flag tells if you had to borrow
your example omitted the addition of 1 for the pre-set carry flag in bit 17 which will cause no carry in the result

2899704
rsa	aes
but this is not standard practice and you could run into security issues you haven t thought of whereas block ciphers such as aes have standard means for dealing with the issues you may come across look at block modes -- essentially there s a security issue for example encrypting the same data with the same key multiple times and block modes are a built in way to deal with this
i would really just stick to the standard practice of streaming with symmetric encryption and encrypting the symmetric key and essentially nothing else with rsa


2899842
cassini	iis
i m still targeting the 3.5 framework but now i m using msbuild 4.0 since that s what visual studio 2010 uses
everything still compiles correctly because it runs fine under cassini but when i deploy it to the same location same application pool identity etc it now behaves differently
i still have the extensionless handler in the web.config but now when i navigate to the root of the application it does directory browsing and any routes that it had previously handled now come back as 404 errors being handled by the staticfile handler in iis

xsl-fo	xslt
i found the xsl-fo designer from ecrion to be good for both programmers familiar with xslt and xsl-fo and old ladies that need to make changes to the templates we are deploying a desktop solution based on xsl-fo that replaces an older proprietary solution and the ladies can make small changes to the document templates
fop is indeed not maintained anymore but the commercial vendors are doing a great job at providing faster and quite affordable solutions and the set of features is growing with every release a 2.0 draft of the xsl-fo specifications is now in the works

if anything is bad he is informed and told to revisit the cc processing page to try again max of 3 times
edit i have received a lot of really good response on this question - majority seem to agree on the following taking post variables after validation is run encrypting ccnum and cvv not sure you are allowed to store cvv in db at all though storing in temporary db access db immediately after review page is ok d decrypt details from db send information to processor receive response terminate db i think this makes sense overall
i am programming in php and mysql db edit #2 i came across packet general which seems like an ideal solution but really don t want to pay for another software license to accomplish this goal. edit #3 - sample code i have now posted some example code i put together trying to make sense of the encryption decryption key and storage mentioned in this post

setw	ostringstream
i thought i could do this using just ostringstream and iomanip.setw like this the output here is field 00003000 vs input 3000 very nice
however if i try a bigger number setw lets the output grow beyond 8 characters output field 2000000000 vs input 2000000000 the desired output is 20000000
would the boost formatting do what i need in one step

2900514
put	get
at this point i have a webpage where someone can successfully upload a file which gets stored under files on my webserver
the python script also generates a unique random 5 letter code that gets stored in a database identifying the file i have another page called retrieve where a person should go put in the 5 letter code and it should pop up a filebox asking where to save the file
at this point my retrieve script takes the code gets the location of the file on my server but how do i get the brower to start downloading

free	malloc
in one of the callbacks there is a malloc and it creates a leak every time i render a new frame
i v tried to free vertex but then the polygons did not render
i also tried allocating on the heap then doing delete vertex but then the polygon rendered awkwardly

2900610
matplotlib	scipy
python offers you very good libraries for that such as numpy scipy and matplotlib
matplotlib has a very complete tutorial
if you are directing your studies to the more molecular side of biomedical research python will provide you of very powerful tools

2900675
x86	64bit	x86	64bit
but it helps if you tell us why you need it if you want your doubles to be ieee-754 64bit doubles the easiest way is to compile with -msse -mfpmath sse
try section 8.6 of gough s introduction to gcc which demonstrates the x86 fldcw instruction
but it helps if you tell us why you need it if you want your doubles to be ieee-754 64bit doubles the easiest way is to compile with -msse -mfpmath sse

jsf	wicket
my requirements are java i need to make use of existing java libraries to access the relevant data 2 screens one for static data view maybe some search parameters other for basic form entry no fancy ajax required ideally easy for a web designer to come in and tart it up as necessary without having to rewrite everything my first stop was going to be to checkout wicket as i ve heard good things about it
i don t have the time right now to dive into anything heavy which probably writes off jsf in my mind i played with jsf1 steep learning curve which i ve now slid back down
i m happy to treat the result as throwaway so if there s a framework which starts of well but then doesn t scale up to bigger projects that would be ok

you don t need an nsscanner for that
just use nsstring s -rangeofstring method

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
edit as tgr points out will let you read it back generically in firefox
and as bradley mountford points out in a comment below it looks like you can read from webkit using the component parts too although only google-chrome seems to like border-top-left-radius where as both google-chrome safari handle -webkit-border-top-left-radius .
so summarising you get the following based on your 5px setting in firefox in webkit tested in google-chrome safari

super	self	super	self
from the python online documentation class c b def method self arg super c self .method arg so your exception would be defined as follows
when you call super you need the subclass derived class as the first argument not the main base class

valgrind	glibc
things should just work and if they don t you have somebody to complain to
as noted by unwind valgrind has an elaborate mechanism for controlling which procedures are instrumented and how
but both valgrind and glibc are complicated beasts and you really really really don t want to do this

2901490
for-loop	loops
just tried the intel compiler and saw a 49 speed boost for this code
i have a very large nested for-loop in which some multiplications and additions are performed on floating point numbers

inherited	properties
use a singleton object instead of all static shared properties
here s an example in c# vb.net isn t too far off and just have the singleton class inherited from dependencyobject


2901771
filtering	grouping
if you really need to run a whole grouping of queries using the same evaluated value your best bet is to create view with the field defined but you wouldn t want to do that for a one-off query
as an alternative and in cases where performance is not much of an issue you could try something like though i don t believe that s supported by all sql dialects and again the optimizer is likely to do a much worse job which this kind of thing since it will run the select against the full users table and then filtering that result
still for some situations this sort of query is appropriate there s a name for this.

post	get
i m trying to post an image to a web service from the iphone
i ll post the code first then explain everything i ve tried first thing this code works fine for anything but an image
the web service is running on my local network and i can change the source code at will and if i change the imgin parameter to a string and pass a string in everything works fine i get a return value no problem

2901843
int	chars
i m getting kind of frustrated as i m a java newbie i ve mostly only used freepascal before this
i m trying to parse a simple text file in an int method and then output an int from such file so that other parts of the program can use it
for testing purposes it also displays the chars value 9 in this case

2901843
int	chars
for testing purposes it also displays the chars value 9 in this case
the int value for some reason is 57
i ve also tried it with another part of the text file which in that case should be 5 but is instead 53

2901850
int	chars
for instance you probably don t need to explicitly use chars at all
if you use a bufferedreader like parsed will be the int 9 as expected
or you may be able to use scanner and its nextint

2901919
nsstring	nsdata
if you re unlucky a soap library will make it 20000 larger
it fails because the format specifier takes an object and calls - nsstring description to turn it into a string
- nsdata description returns something like 31 32 33 65 66 67 for ascii 123abc hence you re submitting 31 32 33 65 66 67 which obviously isn t valid xml

2901973
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when debugging js i use firefox firebug.
google-chrome is using the webkit rendering engine similar to safari

implements	extends
you are not implements the keyreleased method
you re also not implements keytyped
if you want to keep your current class structure you can add empty methods if you put the listener in a separate possibly inner class you could extends keyadapter which provides these empty methods for you

2902324
opensuse	linux
you should consider distributions as systems of their own regardless of the fact they are all based on the linux kernel and compile binaries for each of those you want to support
the opensuse build factory may help you if your goal is to provide binary packages


2902332
disk	ram
but still it s the same machine
your nosql system might be disk based therefore all your data is stored on disk instead of loaded into memory like sql server
furthermore think about the architecture the disk is a cache for ram ram is caching for the cpu cache and the cpu cache is for the cpu registers

2902454
interpolation	splines
you may also want to look up nurbs a type of splines surface and bezier patches
triangulation is very fast if you need to do a lot of interpolation on a large data irregular dataset for example contouring a ground surface
the interpolation is linear and discrete based solely on the three points of the triangle in which you are interpolating

division	multiplication
double division in msvc 1 0.0 1.#inf000000000000 1 dbl_min 4.4942328371557898e+307
in my example below double b may end up being negative due to floating point rounding errors and because the laws of physics are slightly slightly fudged in the game. both division by 0.0 and min_dbl produce the same outcome in the game because 1 0.0 and 1 dbl_min are effectively infinity
like perhaps sqrt 0.0 1 0.0 and multiplication by 1.#inf000000000000 execute faster because they are special cases

2902511

implements	extends
my current solution is to have an account class shared by server and client and extends this with a databasebackedaccount overriding setter-methods and providing a commit method on the server side
i find this quite natural and nice however i ve had to implements all gory sql-details and orm myself


2902747
action-filter	onactionexecuting
the question is where to populate this information to avoid cluttering all your controller actions
a custom action-filter seems like a good place
in the onactionexecuting method you could get the view model returned by the controller action and populate the contextual part if it derives from the base type

2902747
put	get
in the onactionexecuted method you could get the view model returned by the controller action and populate the contextual part if it derives from the base type
another option is to put the contextual information into the viewdata strongly typed views can also use viewdata but personally i hate having magic strings and doing casting in my views this could be overcome by using html helpers that will handle this viewdata


2903076
post	get
if you just want to compose a get by yourself you can use jquery for that aswell so you only pass the parameters you really want which will give you 100 control of what is posted getted
you have a couple of options here disable viewstate use jquery to remove the fields you don t want to post before the are sent to the server you don t have to disable viewstate on all pages just the pages that you do not care for the state to be saved
but there is also the option to disable the viewstate completely if you never want to use it

2903152
free	malloc
you can set this from gdb by using the set environment malloc_check_ 2 command before running your program
the program should abort with the free call visible in the backtrace
see the man page for malloc for more information

2903188
put	get
in such cases you should put it in a datastore of some sorts as the others have indicated - be it a database text file or otherwise
keep in mind that if you put it in an enum or a static class or some other part of your actual application the end-user will not be able to change it easily
so if by some natural disaster or world war 3 some countries disappear merge separate get a new government type or name you need to be able to update your country list

integer	fractions
most programming languages and libraries follow this as well
in mathematics rounding means rounding to the nearest integer so rounding 3.4 results in 3 and rounding 3.6 results in 4
truncating on the other hand means removing the fractions part altogether so either 3.4 or 3.6 results in 3

2904168
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter	bufferedreader	printwriter
filterreader and filterwriter character streams correspond back to filterinputstream and filteroutputstream byte stream classes
however i noticed few changes as - bufferedinputstream extends filterinputstream but bufferedreader does not extend filterreader
bufferedoutputstream and printstream both extend filteroutputstream but bufferedwriter and printwriter does not extend filterwriter

2904283
processors	hyperthreading

i can already correctly detect the number of logical processors correctly on all three of these platforms
to be able to detect the number of physical processors cores correctly i ll have to detect if hyperthreading is supported and active or enabled if you prefer and if so divide the number of logical processors by 2 to determine the number of physical processors

barry if you would like to get credit for your comment please feel free to post it as an answer and i ll make sure to accept it
since i haven t gotten any more feedback on this issue i thought i d just share what ended up being my solution as suggested by barry in a comment to the original post manually renaming the ...bin debug projectname .exe to something else projectname 1.exe is one work-around i m however not allowed to delete the file myself and i must say i find that a bit weird as one would believe the same lock preventing deletion would also prevent renaming...
it s not a good solution but it s reasonable fast at least after you ve done it a couple of times it almost becomes a routine and at least way faster than restarting visual studio which is what i did in the beginning

2904341
try-catch	exception-handling
strange enough the application simply keeps on running but with the incorrect screen updates
at first we thought the problem was caused by a try-catch ... construction put there by an overactive ex-colleague but several hours later carefully inspecting the call stacks adding many breakpoints ... we found out that if there s an access violation in a paint event windows catches it and simply continues running the application
is it normal that windows catches exception-handling errors during a paint event

2904350
actionscript	mxml
so putting statements inside a tag in an mxml file is equivalent to putting code in a static block in a java class definition
following the advice of www.flextras.com s answer i kept the generated actionscript classes and had a look
the code inside tags is simply put in the class body as-is

i think that multi-core processors report that they are hyperthreading enabled even though each individual core can run only one thread
it also returns the number of logical processors per physical processors in bits 23-16 of ebx
i think that you d have to query each processors individually in order to hit all of the processors on your system

2905054
oledb	openrowset
imex 1 to read all fields as text - this could have to do with mixing values text
second option is try to install office data connectivity components from displaylang en - and work around oledb
then setup your openrowset as such good luck

2905082
cpu	affinity
on your app set the cpu affinity to run only on your shielded cpu
effectively this should prevent the os from ever suspending your app as it will always be the only runnable process for that cpu
never allow let your process willingly yield control to the os which is inherently non-deterministic for non realtime oses

2905225
int	chars
but you could also try records if you do not use array strings are also arrays of chars or object properties you can directly save and load a record to memory stream file etc
i use this in my asmprofiler to be able to read and write many small results very fast array of record with some int values can be saved and loaded with one move copymemory call


2905497
post	get	post	get
you need to make a get request by changing type post to type get
you re making a post to a static file which iis does not allow
you need to make a get request by changing type post to type get

2905512
puts	gets
the user gets a form with a browse button and then points to a excel file with a defined content format
after that the vba code reads the data and puts it into the access database


2905615
folder	directory
the dialog is only for one-at-a-time
you can however add them yourself via the .actionscriptproperties file located in your project s root folder you have to browse via explorer to see it
under the modules node add as many of the following elements as needed the destpath determines where the module will be located in the published directory structure

2905707
post	get	post	put
this might be not the nicest solution but it is also used by other frameworks i have encountered symfony for php
the documentation about .ajax s type attribute says the type of request to make post or get default is get
note other http request methods such as put and delete can also be used here but they are not supported by all browsers

2905707
post	put
use firebug or similar to find out which method is used
one idea to make it working send the data using post but add an additional field
on the server side your service has to recognize this and perform the put functionality

2905751
ready	each
both scripts contain sample code that demonstrates how to use the core script code
the solution i am posting is a couple production ready vbscripts that leverage whoami to find this information
one cool thing about them is that they work with xp for information that is available on xp if you place a copy of the resource kit version of whoami.exe next to the script or in the system32 folder of each machine

2906044
xna	slimdx
if it s just for learning purpose of the directx api but in c# i would say pick the windows api code pack or slimdx
xna xna is a game oriented framework that allow you to target multiple hardware easily windows the xbox 360 zune and now windows phone 7 with version 4 using .net languages like c#
note that there s not a 1-1 relation between xna and the directx sdk for instance it doesn t expose d3d10 or d3d11 or some interfaces that you can find in d3dx

2906080
cpu	processors
the main problem is generally to put your processors when in idle in a low-consumption state deep sleep
if you cannot reduce the cpu percentage used by much for example from 80 to 50 it won t make a big difference
depending on what operating systems you are running the options may vary

2906179
keydown	keyup
however on vista and windows 7 cmd + l causes problems regardless of low-level keyboard hooks win + l is always intercepted by windows and normally locks the workstation.
you can disable workstation locking with this registry hack but pressing win + l still can t be rebound in ahk pressing win + l leaves winkey in the keydown state until the next additional winkey up
simulating a keyup event doesn t seem to work either

2906303
createfile	deviceiocontrol
to perform reads or writes simply call readfile and writefile buffer must be aligned on sector size
more info can be found in physical disks and volumes section of the createfile api documentation
alternatively you can also you deviceiocontrol function which sends a control code directly to a specified device driver causing the corresponding device to perform the corresponding operation

2906480
folder	directory
i would put the test myclasstest in the same package com.example but in a separate folder test this is maven s standard directory layout
but you can compile the class files for tests and main classes to the same output folder target


2906620
scrollable	panels	scrollable	panels
if you really want to use a label you could put the label inside a scrollable panels control and set the label s autosize property to true
a read-only scrollable textbox control will be much easier to use

put	get
don t put all your eggs in one basket technique another technique off the top of my head is to create multiple windows in the background with the registration form and keep them all in sync when any the fields in any one changes
this is a classical technique and really puts the don t put all your eggs in one basket saying into real-life usage
another advantage of this awesome technique is even if the user closes one of the windows and later comes across an identical cloned window with all the fields they filled up-to-date populated they might get confused and think that they never closed the page

2906952
draggable	droppable
drag drop columns this could be trickier
i would start by applying the draggable behavior to elements
the described above inside the elements could have a droppable behavior

2907150
int	double
sql server s float type is an 8-byte floating-point value equivalent to c# s double
like this if you want fractionalpart to be an int you can multiply it by 10 n where n is the number of digits you want and cast to int
however beware of precision loss

2907169
folder	directory
now this makes it necessary to put the unmanaged dll somewhere into the system32 directory or any other directory in the path environment variable
now i want to change the wrapper native dll opensource so it loads the dlls also if they are only in the bin folder
the absolute path is determined at runtime not at compile-time.

2907463
post	get
as for whether to segment it by user id or by post id that depends on whether you will more often be looking for all posts viewed by a user segment by user_id to get them all in one query or all users who have viewed a post segment by post_id
nope you don t really have much choice other than to store your visit data in a table with columns for at a bare minimum user id post id and timestamp if you need to track the last time that each user visited each post
i question whether you need an id field in that table rather than using a composite key on user_id post_id but i d expect that to have a minor effect provided that you already have a unique index on user_id post_id

2907463
post	get
if you break it up by user or post id then you will still be able to determine whether a given user has previously viewed a given post and if so on what date with only a single query
if you segment it by date then that information will be spread across all tables and in the worst-case scenario of a user who has never previously viewed a post which i expect to be fairly common you ll need to separately query each and every table before having a definitive answer
as for whether to segment it by user id or by post id that depends on whether you will more often be looking for all posts viewed by a user segment by user_id to get them all in one query or all users who have viewed a post segment by post_id

2907814
equals	gethashcode
or you can have your class implement iequatable and override the default gethashcode and equals properties to make them equals if all the values are the same or whatever criteria is approproate
assuming searchresultitem is a class and not a struct then as a reference type it is only truly equals if it is a reference to the same type
but you have created a new object for each result

2907814
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
but you have created a new object for each result
all your values will be considered distinct unless you can pass in your own iequalitycomparer object
or you can have your class implement iequatable and override the default gethashcode and equals properties to make them equal if all the values are the same or whatever criteria is approproate

2907940
int	boolean
you can tell linkedlist is generic because the javadoc header shows -- the e is a generic type
the definition of get is public e get int index -- since its return type is e whatever you specified for the linkedlist s generic type will be the type returned by that method
similarly the add method s signature is public boolean add e o so it will only accept integers as arguments and will fail at compile time if you try to add the wrong type

2908134
affinity	processors
however that said in today s world of shared processors caches this won t be a prerequisite for good thread scheduling
you can influence a thread s affinity for a given core by calling the setprocessoraffinity method
however i tend to shy away from doing this because the os is generally pretty good at getting your threads right

2908211
pull	push	pull	push
tracking what has been pushed would be slightly tricky because you can push to multiple places
and you can pull from multiple places
so i could push to x then push to y then pull from z and my hg outgoing x output is difficult to predict local-only

2908351
g++	gcc	g++	gcc
with gcc in can be done in a single pass as a side effect of the compilation by adding -mmd flag to cxxflags and to the end of the makefile body and as guys mentioned already always have gnu make manual around it is very helpful
makefile part of the question this is pretty easy unless you don t need to generalize try something like the code below but replace space indentation with tabs near g++ automatic dependency graph generation a must feature for most make systems

2908669
put	get
it is a very simular question jquery and ajax post issue edited the problem is your ajax call is not registering your script tag
if you put the script on your main page and not the ascx then this will work
or you can get the script tag from the ajax response and then register it with the dom

2908675
overwrite	preserve
i haven t had a chance to try this on a mac or linux box but from reading around online the preserve flag is a normal stumbling block to come up against in a windows environment
simply overwrite and replace everything in destination with whatever is in source or can i skip a file with conflicts and just log it for resolution later


2908823
post	get
when i click the generate link i don t get the same output i get in the wp page as when i go directly to sample-ajax.php in my browser. i ve got my code 1 set up as follows mu-plugins sample.php mu-plugins sample sample-ajax.js.php mu-plugins sample sample-ajax.php 1 note the following tutorial got me this far but i m stumped at this point.
i m writing a wordpress mu plugin it includes a link with each post and i want to use ajax to call one of the plugin functions when the user clicks on this link and then dynamically update the link-text with output from that function
i m stuck with the ajax query

this extension is then called by the registerroutes method in global.asax like so.
after some more googling i reworded the question in this post
using the answer from that question i was able to put together a suitable routing extension method which i include below

2908864
post	get
i consider myself very good with math and about as logical as you can get but i have zero real-life programming knowledge
the sites we want to make are all pretty web 2.0 ish meaning user-generated content commenting on post pages that change on the fly etc
something that is a good indicator how most other languages work

2908877
decimal	ieee
ieee floats floating points in programming languages are confusing because they re different from the way we use them in math
instead the number operations should be viewed as expressions that are only converted to a decimal point format when needed printing to a screen
maple and mathematica did this right i think

2908932
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	nexus	artifactory
eclipse has m2e plugin and if you define locations of remote maven repositories in your pom.xml definition you can add dependencies in its pom.xml editor and it will automatically search the proper artifacts for you
what is really helpful is using repository manager like nexus artifactory where you gather the most important maven repositories and then you don t need to declare particular repository locations in your pom.xml definition for various artifacts but everything will be proxied via nexus


2908941
ienumerable	iqueryable
so instead of you can just write
i believe in the 2nd case the type of myquery is an rather than ienumerable
if you don t need anything specific to an iqueryable that you can t do with an ienumerable then they behave the same

2908952
implements	extends
i seem to have a fair idea of what is being done but i still have a few things to sort out
i have a interface and an class that implements the node interface
i then created a a node that can have 0 to n children and that is part of an n -ary tree class that extends and implements

2908961
put	get
in your openingfcn you would then add a line like you now have a choice to make
the canonically correct way to store data in your gui is to put it in the handles structure and then store it with guidata as in the boilerplate is necessary because despite its name handles does not subclass handle and is passed by value not reference
the guidata command sticks handles somewhere associated with the gui figure so you can get it in subsequent callbacks

2908961
put	get
the guidata command sticks handles somewhere associated with the gui figure so you can get it in subsequent callbacks
the problem with this approach is that when you put a large object in handles it makes the guidata command take forever
this is true even though matlab is not supposed to copy data when passing by value unless absolutely necessary and it is even true if your object is a handle which takes like 4 bytes to pass back and forth

2908964
maven	pom.xml
here is a copy of my pom.xml file which was generated using an archetype
my goal is to take a grails web application and build it into a web archive war file using maven and the key is that it must populate the plugins folder without live access to the internet
an out of the box grails webapp will already have the plugins folder populated with jar files but the maven build script should take care of populating it just like it does for any traditional war projects such as web-inf lib if it s empty this is an error when executing mvn grails run-app with grails 1.1 using maven 2.0.10 and org.grails grails-maven-plugin 1.0

this hibernate-1.1 plugin is needed to do gorm. the build machine does not have access to the internet and must use an internal enterprise repository so this error is just saying that maven can t find the required artifact anywhere
that dependency is already included with the stock grails software that s installed locally so i just need to figure out how to get my pom.xml file to unpackage that zip file into my webapp s plugins folder

my life felt ruined until i got this working for the sake of ipython
i found this thread looking for an answer for the same longbit error while installing python readline for 32bit python on 64bit centos

2909065
disk	ram
the memory journaling mode stores the rollback journal in volatile ram
this saves disk i o but at the expense of database safety and integrity
if the application using sqlite crashes in the middle of a transaction when the memory journaling mode is set then the database file will very likely go corrupt

2909087
vim	emacs
i do that even on my workstations where i do have full gnome environment
i simply like the way vim works in the same terminal window i do other things
when i tried emacs some time ago the first thing i changed was to disable its gui

2909133
folder	directory
i ve tried clearing the url redirects from the iis admin console in the web control panel from my hosting provider and i ve also tried removing the httpd.ini file from the site root directory to try and clear all re-directs but for some reason when i go to the site it still wants to redirect in an endless loop
the site is agrionline.biz before i did anything i had a subdirectory domain pointing set up which made actually use agrionline.biz site1 as the root folder. i wanted to change this so that instead of that i wanted my site to actually redirect to the site1 folder rather than use it as the root
so i went into the iis admin console on my hosting providers web control panel and tried to add a url redirect from to site1

2909464
int	double
any of the following would evaluate the way you expected 7.0 10 7 10.0 7.0 10.0 7 double 10
you ve used int in the expression 7 10 and int 7 divided by int 10 is zero
what you re expecting is floating point division

atoi	atof
likewise you can have atol for ascii to long atof for ascii to float etc
a google search for atoi ascii to integer confirms this on several pages
i m having trouble finding any official source on it.

2909798
helpers	actioncontroller
another way to get the url to the original referrer the back you re looking for is by using the request method
you are trying to use a view helpers method in your controller
the behavour you expect resides in actionview helpers urlhelper but the method you are calling is in actioncontroller base

2909862
move	drag

i have ismovetopointenabled on for my slider so when i click anywhere on the component the selector move to my mouse
the problem is if i have this option on and click and hold the mouse down to drag the selector the selector doesn t move

2909998
os.walk	pathlib
if you use the concrete path variant you can also do actual os calls through them like chanding into a directory deleting the path opening the file it points to and much more
use os.path.join to concatenate the directory and file name for path subdirs files in os.walk root for name in files print os.path.join path name note the usage of path and not root in the concatenation since using root would be incorrect
in python 3.4 the pathlib module was added for easier path manipulations

uiview	subviews
by doing so my app automatically will load with the uitabbarcontroller in the root view
how can i accomplish the following when my app loads a uiview will show 4 buttons clicking on a button will load a uitabbarcontroller not a uiview with a uitabbar that can display multiple views
this seems challenging to me because in order for me to use the uitabbarcontroller i need to add this to the window s subviews in my appdelegate

jar	manifest.mf	jar	manifest.mf
manifest.mf contents can be main-class com.mastergaurav.test.app.mainclass class-path lib one.jar lib two.jar folder contents to execute java -jar my-main.jar
you can create a folder say lib within the folder where you have the jar file

2910674
inline-functions	inlining
inlining improves performance only if the function to be inlined is simple accessors mutators no loops
ideally i would use inline-functions instead of using macros to eliminate function call overhead
however basing from your snippet the macros you have would call several nested functions

2910694
free	malloc
a pointer to memory that is no longer allocated is called a dangling pointer and accessing it will usually cause strange program behaviour and crashes since its contents are probably not what you expect -- that piece of memory may have since been reallocated for some other purpose
edit as stinky472 mentions another difference between delete and free is that only the former calls the object s destructor
remember that you must call delete on an object allocated with new and free for memory allocated with malloc -- they can t be mixed. in c++ it s always best to use static allocation if possible but if not then prefer new to malloc

boost	allocator
edit moved my answer comment in here for the code formatting to bind the destroy function classfactory should have a longer lifetime than the shared_ptr if the classfactory instance is deleted the this pointer passed to the shared_ptr instance will be invalid - and crash your app when the shared_ptr deletes the yourclass instance
here s the code to do what you want probably won t compile as i don t have boost on hand and i m writing it from memory i implemented this twice in two different projects
in both the create and destroy functions were synchronized you can add a boost mutex lock around the use of allocator and they were members of a factory class and the destroy s signature was modified to through the usage of boost bind

2911438
boost	allocator
in both the create and destroy functions were synchronized you can add a boost mutex lock around the use of allocator and they were members of a factory class and the destroy s signature was modified to through the usage of boost bind
you can also avoid writing two extra functions the destroy and create by binding dirrectly in the boost shared_ptr constructor
i m too lazy to write all that now

unfortunatelly i can t find any example code which shows how to perform h264 encoding and rtp muxing

sproutcore	cappuccino
kind regards swami
i recently found out about the sproutcore and capuccino frameworks for web app development as proper mvc approach to creating desktop-like applications
as far as i could understand the main difference between the two frameworks is that cappuccino abstracts away the html+css+javascript to objective-j - a new programming language developed be the creators of capuccino that adds oo capabilities to javascript whereas sproutcore uses html5 css javascript

after lots of pondering i thought it s probably best to go with technologies we know so i downloaded the sproutcore tools and did the tutorials and i have to say i was very impressed
just the kind of thing i was looking for for organizing a complex web app

ceil	sin
since your program must end with return expression it will be wrong or won t halt with probability 1
return ceil random works
if you allow only operators like + - sin you can prove that every expression built using random variables from u 0 1 and arithmetic operations using each random variable exactly once will represent an irrational number with probability 1

maven	pom.xml
the maven assembly plugin configuration the above samples enclosed by goes in the pom.xml not in the assembly descriptor

the same is true of perl. the popularity contest shows python to be installed somewhat more often than mono but both are widespread 21 python-minimal 1584305 182870 1381149 20211 75 matthias klose 577 mono-gac 1403534 25795 1323328 54159 252 debian mono group as for commercial potential it s difficult to say without any idea what sector you might be working in
if you are targeting servers especially running older versions of ubuntu mono will be less widespread
if you are selling simple consumer desktop apps.

2912577
apache	nginx
if you have a few hundred people visiting your website and you have keepalive enabled each of these browsers will keep an apache process or thread busy occupying memory on your server
you can work around this by disabling keepalive on your apache server but this slows down the performance of your website because browsers can t reuse connections
so instead you use nginx as a reverse proxy with keepalive enabled

2912577
apache	nginx	apache	nginx
because nginx is local to your apache server each request only occupies an apache child or thread for a few microseconds
that means you can serve thousands of people with only a tiny handful of apache processes
also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having it on the front end it gives you a lot of flexibility

i just can t have the device working at all the device scan well it has its usb 5v so it is happy beeping blinking something happened in the dmesg but no immediate screen display of the rfid tag code as expected and seen under win7 support is claiming it is ok under rhel or sled enterprises distros.

2912642
int	chars
also since it s variable might be 4 might be 20 chars it s harder to sql server to properly maintain a good index structure
a string primary key is a bad idea so changing it to an int will help performance
most databases uses the primary key index for lookups and comparisons choose a brief primary key one column if possible

2912917
int	chars
the extra in front of the d is because in java the is a special chars so it has to be escaped
try this you could try to parse the string into an int as well but usually people try to avoid throwing exceptions
what i have done is that i have defined a regular expression that defines a number d means a numeric digit

inherited	subclassing
in an attempt to rationalise my models i have created a directory structure like so app + models + card.rb + base_game + foo.rb + expansion + bar.rb and modified environment.rb to contain however when my app reads a card from the database rails throws the following exception activerecord subclassnotfound the single-table inherited mechanism failed to locate the subclassing foo
this error is raised because the column type is reserved for storing the class in case of inherited

ubuntu	linux
as fellow developers i would like to know if you ve been in a similar situation and how you ve resolved it
on a furthernote i can t just install ubuntu as my development machine and mirror the commands applications etc
from the linux machine because it s a cluster master machine and so therefore it has quite a special configuration

put	get
if two threads enter the next method at the same time they may both get the same value of the seed and both return the same value
what i would do is forget about wrapping the number in a nsnumber object and just put the code in next and setseed in synchronised blocks i can t comment on whether your algorithm is right or not
however your init method needs to call super init like so

2913590
post	get
the code is a bit rustic but works and will get you heading the right direction
if the resource requires a post then you must submit a post
this is a fairly simple task

2913746
google-chrome	firefox
i m sure that firebug has something similar for firefox
if you are using google-chrome chromium there is a built in profiler which includes rendering
this is what it looks like when run on this page press ctrl-shift-j to access the developer tools in google-chrome

2913876
children	parent
so with an entity mapped as above you can then do
a possible solution other than queries might be mapping children with in xml notation
this way you can fetch the parent with whatever query you need then call parent.getchildren .size without loading the whole collection only a select count type query is executed

console.readline	console.writeline
pause program execution to review results... console.writeline press enter to exit
console.readline


2914002
multibyte	substr
possibly performing slightly faster although you would likely not notice the difference is update binary email is needed to force case-sensitive matching
for the first question i would choose something like just for the sake of being thorough this is multibyte safe even though i ve used length
all that s needed is for the third argument of insert to be at least as large as the end of the substr

2914026
squash	branch	squash	merge
it dumps all the work done on that other branch into a merge commit destroying history
the history you describe though isn t a merge at all squash or otherwise
it s a rebase

2914264
put	get
i can get this to work no problem in a web app but im having trouble doing it in the website project
pagebase the above sample is what is in my web application and works fine but if i try and put this in the app_code it doesnt pick up the masterpage class so i cant access the property
hopefully its something easy i am over looking

2914485
filtering	grouping
thus to get a list of the birthdayless people we write every person whose birth date is missing value which does exactly what it says
the whose clause filtering the preceding list so that it only contains values matching the given predicate
we then add that list to the new grouping which we create inline

2914492
innodb	myisam
when i run causes myisam to finally correctly use 5-byte rows
when i run the same alter table statement for innodb the avg_row_length does not change


2914576
post	get
here is how i am trying to do it
i m writing a greasemonkey script and i wanted to change the text of a forum post on a phpbb2 forum by using xpath to select the body of the post that occurs after a certain username but the whole thing is a giant mess of tables
i need to get the postbody span that happens after the username in the b tag equals a certain name and then mess with the text

2914641
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and safari don t have this issue
given the following string if i split the string on the commas i normally get an array as expected trouble is that in google-chrome for mac it appends extra properties to the array
output from google-chrome s debugger arr array 0 one 1 two 2 three constructor function array index undefined input undefined length 3 so if i iterate over the array with a for in loop it iterates over the new properties

2914733
swt	swing
addendum gilbert le blanc raises an excellent point about the ease portability of swing
in contrast swt requires slightly more effort to deploy but some users prefer the greater fidelity of org.eclipse.swt.widgets.filedialog as shown here
addendum i notice that filedialog displays a more native-looking window as seen here

2914742
put	get
i have 2 classes the compile error is the type or namespace name class1 does not exist in the namespace my.app.foo in this situation i can t seem to get visual studio to recognize that foo.class1 refers to the first class
if i mouse-over foo it shows that its trying to resolve that to my.app.foo.class1 if i put the line using foo
at the top of the .cs file that contains class2 then it also resolves that to my.app.foo

2914984
inherited	properties
so the natural solution was to take all the settings properties and break them into a separate settings class which could be serialized deserialized
each car class could also inherited the settings class with one that sets the default values and can be serialized as the basis of user customization
sofar so good

2915123
postgresql	mysql
for example highscalability.com has good examples wikimedia architecture the master-slave category ... handling data in mega scale systems starting from slide 29 mysql scale-out approach for better performance and scalability as a key factor for wikipedia s growth chapter 24
high availability and load balancing in postgresql documentation chapter 16
i m not sure - i m eager to read answers from experts - but i think the schemas are identical in traditional replication scenari the tuning may be different though

2915147
scrollable	panels
update here is an example script that will reproduce the problem the problem i have is really two-fold for my application and both are demonstrated to not work in the above example i need the left side of the panels horizontally scrollable and right justified i need the paned window widget the parent of the two panels to be vertically scrollable both left and right panels together scroll together
i ve come across a bug i believe in perl tk 804.027 text widget using scrollable rotext . when i add a tag that selects all and apply the configuration change to justify to the right the scrollbars do not show up
if i comment out the tagconfigure where i justify to the right the scrollbars come back

2915289
dictionary	map
but anyway just give it a try as with all performance issues
if you re really concerned about performance you could cache the results of the nsclassfromstring and put them in a dictionary
on the other hand that s probably pretty much what nsclassfromstring really does a map lookup

2915303
hide	show
i m using a jquery datepicker for selecting from to dates in a report and would like to show the dates to the client as mm-dd-yyyy but when the form is submitted submit as yyyy-mm-dd
i ve come up with the following alternatives hide the text input for the from and to fields create dummy fields and make use of the following jquery date picker functions altfield and altformat to display the value to the client in their preferred way and deal only with the submitted values which are set through the alt functions
have an onsubmit javascript call to change the dates from mm-dd-yyyy to dd-mm-yyyy and also change the value to change the date to the client s preferred format

2915330
inherited	subclassing
see testify
i don t think the above pattern is terrible but multiple inherited is certainly not idea
i guess the reason you can t just have testheap be a subclassing of testcase is because it will automatically be picked up and run as test not knowing that it needs to be subclassing

2915383
put	get
if the top part of the stack trace is the same as the earlier trace the full set of frames is only shown for the outermost exception and the other traces get the ... treatment
put another way the chunk of a trace that isn t shown is a duplicate of a trace that appeared earlier in the exception cause chain
for example suppose i have code where the method main calls one which calls two and so on

2915477
springboard	backgrounding
urgent quit all backgrounding apps safari and ipod
critical and beyond the kernel will take over probably killing springboard or even reboot
killing the active app jetsam is not handled by springboard but launchd

2915573
metaclass	abc	metaclass	isinstance
classes that use the metaclass can use abstractmethod and abstractproperty to define abstract methods and properties
the metaclass will ensure that derived classes override the abstract methods and properties
also classes that implement the abc without actually inheriting from it can register as implementing the interface so that issubclass and isinstance will work

2915573
abc	isinstance
also classes that implement the abc without actually inheriting from it can register as implementing the interface so that issubclass and isinstance will work
for example the collections module defines the sequence abc
it also calls sequence.register tuple to register the built-in tuple type as a sequence even though tuple does not actually inherit from sequence

2915584
put	get	folder	directory
this makes it very easy to get previous versions out without having to have lots of tag branches that are uniquely named
if we did start using tag branches its been suggested then we d make a full path copy into the tags directory we d still merge onto a single tag branch and put a log comment marking the release number we just have too many modules to manage them as 1 tag folder per branch
and no we never make changes to historical revisions - if a customer needs new functionality they have to upgrade to the latest version which is never a problem until they change the base platform version we don t use branches either as we tend to work on the head version of each module if we do need a branch for a major set of changes we will branch at the base level so we d create a base v2 - performance branch and branch everything

2916009
overwrite	preserve
they are doing redim preserve datamatrix 7 i in both loops
also it seems like the second loop just overwrite the data in the first loop is that correct


2916139
post	get
would rather leak than crash until i get a better solution
the second post here had useful info but their answer didn t work for me
uiwebview in multithread viewcontroller it also seems that this may have been addressed in iphone os 4 but not sure

2916209
jar	manifest.mf
further investigation shows surefire generates its own jar file in a temporary directory private var folders tr trevj1wihyyacuy-xmc3uu+++ti -tmp- surefirebooter7448562488934426857.jar and then uses this jar to load the library class
this jar does not contain the resources i stuck under src main resources
so putting a meta-inf manifest.mf file also does not work

2916260
versioning	upgrade
if all else fails upgrade to 1.9.x i believe it is recommended for rails 3 anyway
you may have two different versioning of ruby installed
try gem env or sudo gem env and see which version of ruby it says you have

2916672
packets	pcap
just take the ethernet frames that you get from pcap and extract the ip packets from them reassembling any that were fragmented
then reorder the tcp segments from the ip packets according to the sequence numbers paying attention that you discard any duplicate data
then process the stream as an http stream

2916710
systemtap	perf	systemtap	lttng	perf	lttng
edit i missed one of the tracing frameworks there is also lttng if you re using busybox and can compile your own kernel perf is probably the most minimal way to go it s consists of turning on perf events in the kernel and compiling the perf tool that comes with the kernel source it s in tools perf
not in the way you describe however there are various profiling tools for linux like oprofile systemtap and perf events i m not sure how well they d fit into embedded development though
edit perf is probably best if you are running a recent enough kernel to use it since it s in the mainline so you just have to turn it on and it s really basic

2916937
snmp	mib	snmp	mib
in other words is there a tool or method that will convert a mib tree to java objects that can be traversed in a program to retrieve oid s names descriptions
i am programming a network management system and need to be able to print out meaningful names behind the oids that are received from snmp traps
due to the nature size of this system it would not be a good idea to manually map every oid to a meaningful name for every mib on every device that is being used

2916957
actualheight	actualwidth
none of them do
actualheight always gives 16.0 no matter what size font
actualwidth changes according to the text length but not the font size

2916958
fast-forward	merge
hooray
however if someone has pushed to origin before i do my commits are not fast-forward
thus a merge commit ensues

2917086
datamapper	activerecord
for example the activerecord orm solves composition using a composed_of method that will dynamically add the appropriate fields and properties to your class
i m not saying that this is the way it should be done for example datamapper which is another orm for ruby choose a more conservative approach and so resembles more like fluent nhibernate it s just an example of how things can be done differently
things like aop or di aren t a foreign concept for dynamic languages they are just usually done in an alternative way

2917109
cvs	svn
when i change a file in one of these and run meld it diffs it against the svn version
however for some of the other developers it diffs against cvs
everyone is using meld 1.3.0 edit ok i see now that there is an option on the address bar in the directory view to select however some of the machines don t have that bar

2917247
post	put
i try to write my own but googling around tells me that it s impossible to write an assignment operator for a class with const data members
one post i found said that if you made the data member const that means you don t want assignment to happen in the first place. this makes sense
i ve written a class with const data members and i never intended on using assignment on it but apparently i need assignment to put it in a vector

2917309
x86	64bit	x86	64bit
i thought at first it was just a matter of a busted dllimport and my call had an invalid type in the params or a missing marshalas or whatever but looking at other registry functions and their dllimport declarations for instance on pinvoke.net i don t see what else to try i ve had hkey returned as both int and intptr both worked on 32-bit os and fail on 64bit os i ve got it down to as simple a repro case as i can - it just tries to create a random subkey then write a value to it
it works fine on my win7 x86 box and fails on win7 x64 and 2008 r2 x64 even when it s still a 32-bit process even run from a 32-bit cmd prompt
edit it also fails in the same way if it s a 64bit process. edit it works fine if the file passed in is empty - the problem case is for the existing software registry hive

2917309
x86	64bit	x86	64bit
edit it also fails in the same way if it s a 64bit process. edit it works fine if the file passed in is empty - the problem case is for the existing software registry hive
i extracted bare software registry hive files from 2008 r2 x64 and whs v1 x86 iso s and both have the same problem
on win7 x86 info running as admin in 32-bit process on 32-bit os was able to create microsoft windows currentversion runonceex a95b1bbf-7a04-4707-bcca-6aee6afbfab7 and write a value under it on win7 x64 as 32-bit on win7 x64 as 64bit source

2917358
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
edit i love reading an answer thinking hey that s not right and then realizing i wrote it
if you bind to an object that just implements inotifycollectionchanged the count in the ui won t change if items are added or removed ot the collection
the object also has to implement inotifypropertychanged and raise propertychanged when the count property changes

in the joel s example ship date is what you want to estimate
in most such situations there are random factors that impact our estimates
when you have a random quantity you typically wants to know its mean and the standard deviation so that you can take appropriate actions

hope this is useful
a while back i found a great blog post on this topic at blog.atebits.com and have since started using loren brichter abtableviewcell class to do all of my uitableviewcells
you end up with a simple container uiview to put all of your widgets and scrolling is lightning fast

rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
the minimum you need to build an sdp packet are the codecs you re offering and the ip socket you re accepting the rtp on
for 2 once you get an ok response you will know the ip socket that the sip user agent server uas is listening on and the codecs it accepts and can start sending your rtp
at the same time you should start receiving rtp from the uas as it will start sending at the same time it sends the ok

2917917
free	calloc	free	malloc
in other words you have one block of dynamic memory and it contains a bunch of pointers to a bunch of dynamically allocated ncurses structures menu items
so to clean up once you re done you need to free each of the dynamically allocated ncurses structures and then you need to free the block of memory that held the pointers to those structures
in other words every calloc or malloc needs a free every new_item needs a free_item and so on

2918155
updatepanel	scriptmanager
this error comes from the javascript that is generated by the asp.net scriptmanager control error sys.invalidoperationexception could not find updatepanel with id ctl00_contentplaceholder1_updatepanel2
the javascript generated by the asp.net sciptmanager control seems to have a bug and cant handle hidden updatepanel
a javascript error is thrown when a control within one updated panel tries to make another update panel visible

mouse	keyboard
the description is enables or disables mouse and keyboard input to the specified window or control
when input is disabled the window does not receive input such as mouse clicks and key presses
when input is enabled the window receives all input

2918449
inline	inlining
so i m looking for alternative tools that are more standard and easier to install
i m looking a program to recursively inline all commands in a latex file
by recursively i mean doing the inlining iteratively until no command remains in the final latex file

2918513
subclass	inherited
and here are some more rules of thumb about inherited strategies single_table all the classes in a hierarchy are mapped to a single table this strategy provides good support polymorphic relationships between entities and queries that cover the entire class hierarchy
may contain null fields for some subclass data table_per_class each class in a hierarchy mapped to a separate table and hence provides poor support for polymorphic relationships requires sql union or separate sql queries for each subclass joined no null fields compact data this provides good support for polymorphic relationships but requires one or more join operations may result in poor performance in short if your subclasses declare relatively few properties prefer the single_table strategy
if not use a joined strategy unless you have a deep hierarchy in which case the cost of joins may become more expensive than unions and then table_per_class would be less worse

2918757
folder	directory
this plays very well with version control
you can use and all the files will be stored in the folder tmp pdf included
because this is not an optimal solution i made my own tool pydflatex that compiles the latex source by stashing away the auxilliary files using the trick above and brings the pdf back to the current directory so after compiling you only have file.tex and file.pdf in your directory

2918886
mri	rubinius	mri	rubinius
however in rubinius another ruby implementation almost all afaik of the core classes are implemented in pure ruby
in yarv mri most of the core classes are implemented in c see array.c bignum.c string.c and so on but some of the less-core classes are implemented in ruby e.g set vector and so on
however in rubinius another ruby implementation almost all afaik of the core classes are implemented in pure ruby

2918935
temporary	tablespace
because i didn t want to store the xmltype permanently i tried loading it into a pl sql variable session memory and a temporary table
loading it into a temporary table took five times as long as loading it into an xmltype variable 5 seconds compared to 1 second
the difference is because temporary tables are not memory structures they are written to disk specifically your nominated temporary tablespace

2919088
installation	upgrade
i ve created a virtual machine to test the upgrade process the upgrade was successful and all my files and workspaces exist in the new server too
the problem is the new tfs installation has a new instanceid
when i redirected on the clients to the new server the client seemed unable to match files and file states in the workspace with the ones on the new server

children	parent
here s some code i use openfaces treetable mbuserinstitutions
i ve got one problem with checkboxes in jsf. i want them to behave dependently on each other when i check a box which belongs to some object that has children then all checkboxes that belong to these children components must be checked either
and also when i uncheck one of child s checkbox the parent should be unchecked too

sproutcore	javascriptmvc
i know sproutcore is backed by apple and looks like it is getting more popular by the day and it has a nice green website whereas javascriptmvc looks less professional with less of a following and less momentum behind it
i ve done the tutorials for both and i was impressed by sproutcore more in the jmvc tutorial you don t really do anything substantial - but somewhere in the back of my mind i feel that jmvc might just be better because it doesn t try and do too much - it just gives you mvc functionality based on a couple of jquery plugins and you can use jquery for everything else so its flexible
whereas sproutcore seems to have more of its own api etc.

post	get

i m trying to write a free text search algorithm for finding specific post on a wall similar kind of wall as facebook uses

a user is suppose to be able to write some words in a search field and get hits on post that contain the words
with the best match on top and then other post in decreasing order according to match score
i m using the edit distance levenshtein e x y e to calculate the score for each post when compared to the query word x and post word y according to score x y 2 2 - e 1 - min e |x| |x| where |x| is the number of letters in the query word

scheme	common-lisp	lisp	scheme
as comments pointed out defun creates a global function binding flet and labels at local scope
first off the syntax is neither common lisp nor scheme the two main lisp dialects which are in common use
in common-lisp syntax this works as expected the are a few things which are a bit more verbose than required here

2919580
stderr	fflush
keep in mind this may severely affect your performance
actually stderr is unbuffered by default but i think that s only in terms of the c runtime
we ve solved this before with fflush stderr

2919580
stderr	fflush	stderr	fflush
we ve solved this before with fflush stderr
fsync fileno stderr
although we actually did it to stdout but the same rules apply - the actual fflush may not be necessary for stderr but it does no harm

curb	libcurl	curb	libcurl
i need libcurl for that
also could you help me with gem install curb
even curb seems to need libcurl looking forward for your help thank you gautam

2919641
fflush	gets
i.e custom reports could be written in the backend and the results of these stored in the cache under a key which then gets shared with anyone who would want to see the data of this report redundancy and scalability if we start sharing this data with a large amount of customers
the main disadvantages i can see of using something like memcache data is not persistent if machine is rebooted cache is fflush
the main advantages of using mysql persistent data

2919692
instances	transient
here you use transient one so you can do the following without fear of bugs
will create new instances on every call just like will
but if you are using containercontrolledlifetimemanager then anyway you ll have to use because unity offers no other way to do this

here s some code i use to add dynamic favicon support to opera firefox and google-chrome
i couldn t get ie or safari working though

2919795
google-chrome	safari
i couldn t get ie or safari working though
basically google-chrome allows dynamic favicons but it only updates them when the page s location or an iframe etc in it changes as far as i can tell to change favicons just go favicon.change icon url using the above
credits to for the code i based this on.

2919894
actionscript	mxml
but on the downside it will require some overhead learning how it works more so if you plan on using graniteds as well but once you get the hang of it i think it s a great tool
edit actionscript is very similar to javascript they re both based on ecma script so if you know that it won t be too hard to learn as
also the mxml part is somewhat similar to using html but a lot more powerful since you can define your own classes and use them directly as a tag in the mxml part

2920250
getter	setter
nested exception is org.hibernate.propertynotfoundexception could not find a setter for property reversedname in class item .
18 more it looks like hibernate is interpreting getreversedname as a getter for a property however in this case it is a derived field and hence should not be persisted
obviously in my actual code the business logic i m exposing is more complex but it isn t relevant to this question

2920267
profiling	instrumentation	profiling	instrumentation
the classes can be used to do runtime instrumentation for almost any managed method
there are profiling and debuggers that use these to collect information about a running process
you could use methodrental to instrumentation code for diagnostic purposes

2920267
profiling	instrumentation
you could use methodrental to instrumentation code for diagnostic purposes
some examples function enter exit would give you an execution trace that you could use to derive profiling data from
instrumenting synchronization primitives can help you diagnose race conditions

opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	vp8	ogg
or you could encode in h.264 and ogg to switch between them depending on the browser but your storage and processing requirements go up
to add to the confusion there is a third video codec for html5 called vp8 or webm recently acquired and open-sourced by google this will be supported in firefox opera google-chrome and ie9 but not safari
given the confusing landscape for html5 video at the moment you might be better off sticking with flash until things clear up unless you don t mind the extra effort or you need your videos to play on ipods pads

equals	gethashcode

i m needing to know the best way to compare two objects and to find out if there equals
i m overriding both gethashcode and equals

2920424
children	parent
the layoutdata tells the composite how to behave on the parent
the layout tells the composite how to arrange its children
in your case you are not setting a layout on currentcentercomposite therefor calling layout has no effect

2920457
hash	md5
ening up in a never ending story
you must exclude the hash sum from the calculation
then you have use it but you cant add the hash rum til the end of the file expecting it to be correct or if you calculate the run over new yu will always end ut with a new md5 hash

2920486
hash	md5
for all possible permutations of an md5 hash create the hash and compare the result with the original
consider any hash and imagine adding some random text to it
since there is an infinite amount of possible texts you could add but only a finite amount of possible hash values there must be possible texts which yield the hash

2920911
subscript	superscript
generally when you re using superscript to indicate exponentiation not indexing so the output you describe is definitely incorrect in some cases
and for subscript what if you really do mean not
a sequence of indices and of course if this crops up as part of a substitution you can probably figure out a way to fix it as part of the substitution.

2921115
equals	gethashcode
a basic version is to take the hash of whatever member variables you re using for equality multiply each one with a separate coprime number and xor them together
if you use dictionary or sortedlist and override equals you need to have a hash function else they will break
equals is also used all over the place in the bcl and if anyone else uses your objects they will expect gethashcode to behave sensibly

2921175
int	chars
cannot index. you d better revise the structure of your code
if it is an array of int s you should print it with a format of d not s
if array is an array of int if you use s the printf function will treat as a string therefore will dereference the value print out the chars there

2921377
jar	war
when you ll run ant in the project directory it will try to find dependencies and probably at first will complain that it cannot find ivy
ivy is a dependency manager that red5 project uses that can be found in the following url please notice that ant will tell you exactly where it searches for the required jar file just download the ivy zip unzip it and place the jar inside it in the requested directory
once ant will compile the project properly just by running the commant ant it will also create a war file under dist directory

2921427
bazaar	git
i believe git and hg both have sub-branches though
with bazaar if you create two branches in a shared repository any common history they have lives within the repository and not the branch itself - the branch merely references it
this saves disk space for repositories that have many branches of the same projects for different features as well as speeds up the creation of new branches you re not having to duplicate the files containing branch history

2921634
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
the html element doesn t have a specified name attribute and i doubt if a custom name attribute will work that way in ie with getelementsbytagname
first getelementsbytagname is broken in ie
rather use getelementsbytagname and or getelementbyid

2921673
post	get
for example gif files start with one of the following gif87a or gif89a many file formats have the same signature at the start of the file or have the same header format
this signature is refered to as a magic number as described by me on this post
a good place to get started is to go to www.wotsit.org

2921695
nunit	moq
it requires a shift in my thinking.
i had been looking to use nunit s assert to verify that the indexer setter in my someclass mock was being called with the correct value
it seems that with moq the supported way to do this is to use the verifyset function

your method 2 would be correct if -initwithnibname bundle is the designated initialiser of the super class -init is the designated initialiser of your class your example is a bit bizarre since you deliberately throw daway the nib name and bundle parameters -init was correctly coded not to throw away the return value from super initwithnibname bundle in your class you have to cover all of the super class init methods to ensure that your designated initialiser ultimately gets invoked
the apple documentation on designated initialisers has this to say on subclassing general principle the designated initializer in a class must through a message to super invoke the designated initializer in a superclass
also designated initializers are chained to each other through messages to super while other initialization methods are chained to designated initializers through messages to self

rss	feed	rss	feed
it provides a reusable object model for parsing and writing rss feed
it is fully compatible with rss versions 0.90 0.91 0.92 and 2.0.1 implementing all constructs
since standard syndication feed does not support other versions of rss

folder	directory
however althoug the files are created succesfully on the device i can browse them and open them using the device s file explorer - they are fine when i connect the device to a windows xp computer none of the directory or files i created appear and the size of their parent files suggest they do not exist
i have tried running over the adb checked logcat tried a signed release version and even written a second test application which just creates a folder this behaves the same ie it creates the folder but this is not visible in windows explorer - nothing anywhere gives me any suggestion as to what the problem might be
if anyone has heard of this before or has any ideas as to what else | could try to fix it please get in touch

2921853
int	chars
if implicit none is not used the fortran compiler makes assumptions as to what the variable type is by the first chars of the variable name
any variable that begins with an i j k l m or n is assumed to be int and all else is assumed real
so the first problem i see is idist - you are sending a single from vb and this probable causing the memory access violation you are seeing

2921868
put	get
that s not terribly accurate on converted projects you ll have to add the element yourself
put it in the propertygroup labeled globals the story is different when you use vs2012 and up the first version of vs that acquired the platform toolset setting in the general property page
you must then select v90 to get a proper build that targets 3.5

2921895
rdf	owl
i ve been working with rdf constantly for the last 3 years and now convert all rdf xml to turtle before dealing with any raw data although i do have a nice tool that writes everything in a useful order and automatically inserts backreference comments etc. good luck
you are missing the rdf type properties because you haven t loaded any ontology containing the required rdfs domain or rdfs range statements and i don t think you ve used any reasoner to make these inferences
you can load the domain or range statements along with the rest of the data or jena has a facility for automatically loading an ontology when it sees and owl imports statement

2921895
jena	reasoning
the jena rdfsinferencer documented here will do the reasoning you want
btw i ve found sesame to be a lot easier to use and more robust than jena for large scale stuff although for scraping a few triples either would be fine
bbtw turtle a subset of n3 is much easier to read and edit than rdf xml

2922126
integer	unsigned
2
in two s complement which pretty much everything uses an integer is negated by inverting all the bits then adding 1
hardware does this more efficiently than it sounds from the above description but that s the basic algorithm for subtraction even when values are unsigned

2922166
inherited	properties
i tried creating another model that had a boolean properties to represent being checked and a properties of the model and passing a list of that model type to the view and creating a actionresult on the controller that accepts a list of the new model checked properties but it comes back null
here s what i ve done for wrapping the models inside a collection for the view i inherited from for the controller i have this as the actionresult but when i break inside the actionresult the collection is null


2922354
temp	tmp
also i am using a sunos box
i have just installed hudson on a weblogic server and i am having issues with the nodes going off line due to the free temp space falling below the 1gig threshold
now i have checked my tmp folder thinking hudson uses that but it is sitting at 10gigs free

2922511
poisson	weibull
the sum of n iid random variables has a gamma distribution
the number of tasks ahead of the text return also has a dicrete distribution - let s say it s poisson
i don t have the time to derive the resulting distribution but simulating it using risk i get either a weibull or gamma distribution

2922551
folder	directory
i m trying to decide how much nesting we should do on the disk directory ec is the application name and common booktransfer or biztalk applications separated out for easier deploy undeploy
proposal #1 proposal #2 - a flatter approach current structure perhaps too many nested folder the main is in case we branch we would then have other branches with identical structure


2922724
equals	tostring
not a big deal just more time consuming then i expected
the customizations were named queries we added cascade types our own to string methods equals and hash code methods
i thought about creating classes that extended the entities to add in the tostring equals and hascode methods that way if we regenerated them they would not be lost

2922781
sum	coalesce
having said that yes you should also use coalesce or ifnull to turn null values to 0
i don t think the sum is the problem
i think it may be your group by c.author_id where you are grouping by the right side of a left outer join

2922783
folder	directory
thanks
i have a folder called notes naturally they will be categorized into folder and within those folder there will also be sub-folders for sub categories
now my problem is i have a function that walks through 3 levels of sub directory note that this is still very much a work in progress

2922846
daemons	systemd
how can i detect if a user currently working with the systemd so the daemons have not to put it in sleep-mode
i use the function iopmschedulepowerevent to schedule sleep or wake-events and registered my daemons with ioregisterforsystempower to receive power-state-changes
everything works fine

2923084
iboutlet	ibaction
you need to create two ibaction in your class ontouchdown and ontouchup
create an iboutlet for your button too
then go to interface builder and wire up the button to the iboutlet and wire up the action for touch down to ontouchdown and the actions for touch up inside and touch up outside to ontouchup. ontouchdown is where you ll set your highlighted font

2923231
git-rebase	undo
git branch -d a git push origin heads a git branch b a git push origin a a alternately you can use the following command to undo that last commit
git revert c4 which will make your timeline look like c1--c2--c3-- b c4-- c c4 -- a where c4 is a commit that undoes c4 i don t recommend using git-rebase or revert on a branch that has been pushed to a remote repo they can cause tons of trouble for you or anyone else using that repo

listview	gridview	gridview	listviewitem

i m using theexpression dark wpf theme with a listview view property set to a gridview to display some user data like the following the rows have white text with a dark background and white background when selected however the text color doesnt change when selected and it makes very difficult to read i would like the text to have a dark color when the row is selected
i have searched for a way to style the text color but with no success here is the control template for the listviewitem the trigger that changes the background color simply applies an animation to change the selectedrectangle opacity but i cant change the text color on the same trigger i tried using a setter for the foreground color on the listviewitem but with no success

2923249
int	boolean
what this means is that you can t safely perform boolean operations on boolean without null-checking or exception handling
same goes for doing math operations on an int
for a long time i was a fan of autoboxing in java1.5+ because i thought it got java closer to be truly object-oriented

2923319
int	boolean
that s why a boolean can refer to null
so can an int
so can a string etc

2923437
persistent	transient
if cat has an assigned identifier or a composite key the identifier should be assigned to the cat instance before calling save
you can also use persistent instead of save with the semantics defined in the ejb3 early draft
persistent makes a transient instance persistent

2923437
persistent	transient	instances	transient
persistent makes a transient instances persistent
however it does not guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to the persistent instances immediately the assignment might happen at flush time. persistent also guarantees that it will not execute an insert statement if it is called outside of transaction boundaries
this is useful in long-running conversations with an extended session persistence context

2923536
google-chrome	firefox
edit it seems to be working in firefox though jquery isn t returning undefined it is returning
so this is a google-chrome problem at the moment


2923600
hide	show
when you click the button it calls some javascript to show the
clicking away from the hide the list
what i really want is to make the appear fully expanded as if you had clicked on the down arrow but i can t get this working

2923710
google-chrome	firefox
the one below is a 3x3 bmp.
the following code displays correctly in google-chrome or ie the image is 200px wide
in firefox and opera the max-width style is ignored completely

2923712
implements	extends
you ve almost certainly got a core design problem here
i would suggest making a single abstract class called abstracta that implements the interface a but had null implementations for all of its methods
then have each of your implementing classes extends abstracta

2923712
implements	extends
then have each of your implementing classes extends abstracta
also i would wonder why you have a single interface with all these methods when they aren t intended all to be implements by each class that implements the interface
you ve almost certainly got a core design problem here

2923781
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
javascript html in firefox i get the video harness but the actual video doesn t load. in ie8 the video harness doesn t even appear
edit got this to work with artiom s fix. looks like this works fine with google-chrome and safari
i m using a codec firefox doesn t support so it doesn t work there

2924116
post	get
thanks
i have no idea how to handle this in coldfusion 9 i have a form being submitted post with element checkboxes called items
when i do a no-problem i get all the items shown with the proper names like eg however doing a results in an error

2924130
persistent	transient
from the all too brief description it sounds like your data is really transient data and a cache system or other nosql-like arrangement may be a better fit
if you do need to persistent the data eventually you could have a separate process that pulls the current data from the cache mechanism and loads it into your db
then you would be limited by how long it took to extract it vs

2924217
folder	directory
accidental damage to files such as removing the wrong ones or replacing with different versions is reduced since files are located in different directory
deletion of files in the person folder will not affect files in the shape folder
this is just my opinion your mileage may vary

2924327
ant	maven
setting the system parameters has always worked for me and had the advantage of being outside of the build file for example when i m working from home with no proxies
to configure no proxy options i don t know how to exclude local hosts using the ant proxy mechanism
all i can suggest is trying to configure the jre directly maven resolver for maven central dependencies you need a resolver that looks like this this will automatically go to the maven central url . according to the doco this resolver will use the module poms in maven to determine transient dependencies

2924394
unsigned	short
as long as a char object is large enough to store any member of the implementation s basic character set note that this explicitly forbids variable-length encodings then the implementation may even choose an encoding that represents basic latin in a way that is incompatible with any common encoding
it is confusing that the char signed char and unsigned char types share char in their names but it is important to keep in mind that char does not belong to the same family of fundamental types as signed char and unsigned char
signed char is in the family of signed integer types there are four signed integer types signed char short int int and long int. and unsigned char is in the family of unsigned integer types for each of the signed integer types there exists a corresponding but different unsigned integer type unsigned char unsigned short int unsigned int and unsigned long int .

2924394
unsigned	short
signed char is in the family of signed integer types there are four signed integer types signed char short int int and long int. and unsigned char is in the family of unsigned integer types for each of the signed integer types there exists a corresponding but different unsigned integer type unsigned char unsigned short int unsigned int and unsigned long int .
the one similarity between the char signed char and unsigned char types is that they occupy the same amount of storage and have the same alignment requirements
thus you can reinterpret_cast from to in order to determine the numeric value of a character in the execution character set

2924726
int	chars
for one your function is going to take in an inputstream and return an int
you have your function set up to take in an int called inputstream and return an int
inputstream has a function read which loads the next chars of the stream or -1 if there are no remaining chars

2924726
int	chars	int	chars
inputstream has a function read which loads the next chars of the stream or -1 if there are no remaining chars
you ll need to define an int counter and then call read as many times as it takes to get that response of -1
once you see a -1 you know that you re at the end of the stream and you can return the counter which will have a value equal to the number of chars

2924747
post	put
you ve now enabled the id you need to be passed to the client and back through the form you now just need to put it in when you create the form for display in the first place hopefully that doesn t lead you off on the wrong track - completely untested e oe ymmv etc etc
not sure if this ll be appropriate for your app or not but you could try making use of a form widget in particular the hiddeninput one to include the post id in the form
something like not sure that s entirely correct but see overriding-the-default-field-types-or-widgets for more

2924828
int	chars
of course if you re specifying a string literal where the chars aren t actually present in the database s default collation then you need it
it s like you can suffix a number with l in c et al to indicate it s a long literal instead of an int
writing n ibm is either being precise or a slave to habit depending on your point of view

2924959
width	height
table new my_table array style boarder solid thin gray
width 100px
table- height 200px

2925382
post	get
this is not what you want obviously but still the most common usage you display some data in formfields after receiving a get request
you post to an update action
if you have errors you want to redisplay the form with the values you entered still available

2925533
class-method	delegation
you cannot use this method to create a delegation from a function pointer to another managed delegation
the part about c++ is likely referring to function pointers for class-method
this should still work for global functions

2925681
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
in an applet you can consider to send the data compressed using gzipoutputstream
you ll only need to develop a specific servlet on the server side which listens on requests from the applet only and knows that it needs to decompress the httpservletrequest#getinputstream accordingly using gzipinputstream


2925828
integer	fractions
if it is defined as a number in the database that could include fractions eg 3.5
if you define it as number 10 0 then it will always be an integer
since you are trying to pull it out as a string .asstring there could be a conversion issue

2926152
folder	directory	folder	directory
regardless see this link regarding fileio with medium trust you likely need to add a section to your web.config to provide specific access to your appdir to override the setting from the parent site virtual directory
for some reason it would appear that by default your iis is not allowing access to your bin folder
this is probably inherited from the parent site above your virtual directory

2926157
stdout	fflush
this will work even if you have printed something without a newline
yes output to stdout in c using printf is normally line buffered
this means that printf will collect output until either the buffer is full or the output contains a n newline if you want to force the output of the buffer call fflush stdout

2926242
joptionpane	jdialog
that s the code in new envelope...
now my joptionpane opens new window with envelope overfiew but i can t change size of this window
that s because you re using joptionpane tray using jdialog or jframe instead also i wanted to have sender s data in upper left corner and receiver s data in bottom right

2926286
put	get
controlname is actually short-hand for me.controls controlname 1 it should not be suprising that you don t get any compile-time checks against mistyping the control name
put another way if the bang operator is bad and the dot operator is good then you might think me.controls controlname is better than me
controlname because the first version uses a dot but in this case the dot isn t any better at all since you are still accessing the control name via a parameter

2926432
versioning	upgrade
thanks
the eclipse and equinox teams have released a new versioning of equinox framework which is 3.5.2
i am currently using equinox 3.5.0 and considering to upgrade to equinox 3.5.2

2926676
installation	upgrade
i you only want to enable the dom xml extension in php4 read this manual page
if php is compiled without dom support you ll have to recompile php or find a precompiled binary which suits your needs. the manual clearly states that there are no installation needed in php5 and no configuration options
if you are for some reason running php 4 you should really upgrade to php 5

2926790
trie	tree
what i would like to do is be able to store the data as a trie
this way i can traverse the different branches of the trie and return the most relevant result
second how do i traverse the tree

2926794
folder	directory
the problem i have is that i have a production site where the site is in the root directory yet i have my development site in a localhost subdirectory
eg vs if i have for example an images folder i want to reference the images from the site root by using the initial slash in the href
eg using a relative href without the initial slash is not an option

2927184
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
the complement to serializable is deserialization which takes the serialized data and reconstitutes the original object representation
serializable which is not specific to .net is the process of converting an in-memory object into some form of bits and bytes that are suitable for transmission over the internet or storage on disk
the complement to serializable is deserialization which takes the serialized data and reconstitutes the original object representation

2927217
powerpc	i386
as for the architecture it only depends on the available architectures in the binaries of the sdk
for example with a 10.5 sdk you can target four architectures intel 32bits powerpc 32bits intel 64bits powerpc 64bits while with a 10.6 sdk you can only target three architecture intel 32bits powerpc 32bits intel 64bits
as you are using snow leopard you can either target i386 intel 32bits ppc powerpc 32bits or x86_64 intel 64bits very simply by passing an architecture option like this gcc -arch i386 or like this for configure-based projects

2927414
sorting	filtering
think that you may have much users opening the same page and this will load the whole data in memory for each user and the gc may not have time enough to free all that stuff
devexpress provides for this the linqservermodedatasource that does all the paging and sorting in the data server
if you cannot use that try to retrieve a smaller set of data by filtering it

2927453
put	get
note i needed a delay to get it to work
i think if you want put back then applescript is the way to go
i was able to do it without any sound by muting the volume moving the file then unmuting the volume

2927540
implements	extends
the processdatamotorferdsel class extends processdatacommon so imo it should work
i need help to generify and implements the visitor pattern. we are using tons of instanceof and it is a pain
i am sure it can be modified but i am not sure how to do it

2927579
maven	pom.xml
see when you perform a release with this tool the following steps are carried out check that there are no uncommitted changes in the sources check that there are no snapshot dependencies change the version in the poms from x-snapshot to a new version you will be prompted for the versions to use transform the scm information in the pom.xml to include the final destination of the tag run the project tests against the modified poms to confirm everything is in working order commit the modified poms tag the code in the scm with a version name this will be prompted for bump the version in the poms to a new value y-snapshot these values will also be prompted for commit the modified poms these steps are sufficient for most release processes
we manage release numbers in maven
we then use the maven release plugin to increment the version numbers when we need to release

2927816
exponent	modulo	exponent	modulo
the modulo is not secret in the rsa crypto-system so there should be no need to encrypt this
you are not attempting to encrypt the private exponent which is the actual secret part
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero

2927836
persistent	transient
so far i ve tried setting it to be transient but that just ends up with it being null all the time
i m just getting to grips with jpa in a simple java web app running on glassfish 3 persistent provider is eclipselink
so far i m really liking it bugs in netbeans glassfish interaction aside but there s a thing that i want to be able to do that i m not sure how to do

2927965
feedparser	beautifulsoup	rss	feed
if you have any problems with those post more specific questions
you can parse rss feed with feedparser and download files with urllib2
if you need to parse html use beautifulsoup
