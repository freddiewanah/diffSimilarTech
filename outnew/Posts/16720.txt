implements	modifiers
you might want to apply some modifiers to each value but lets go simple and say it s total reads age in minutes something read 200 times in 1 minute is hotter than something read 2000 times in 15 minutes
how you implements this is a different question
it s not something you can really do with a database without pulling all the data out so it might be better to keep statistics ie its primary key publishing time and total reads in a local quick-access store memcache et al so you can pull them out sort based on the data you need and cache that for 5-10 minutes

because of this you would need both a 32- and 64bit version of your native dll

the -vendor-x extension properties will never validate which is a shame but they are defined by css itself to be harmless so you can safely ignore those errors
border-radius will validate against css3 and will work in ie9 and opera 9.5+
to support rounded corners in gecko firefox and webkit safari google-chrome you would need the vendor extensions -moz-border-radius and -webkit-border-radius for now

rss	feed
after creating an action in your controller for hot_topics you simply order your posts by views
this is a simple way to present an rss with the most views
now if you re trying to build your own rss reader that reads popular posts from other websites or tries to determine popularity across different websites then you can either download the rss feed hot_topics from that specific site if it has any such as newsnow crawl different websites and compare which are popular on both and sort them to your reader i hope this helps

2930380
public	protected
a simple rule of thumb is to consider that the inheritance access specifier overrides the access specifiers of the base class if they are looser
since nothing is looser than public it does not change anything
protected means that the public section of the base becomes protected and private means that the public and protected sections become private

serializable	deserialization
set your deserialization up to look like this by specifying that second parameter in the xmlserializer you can avoid having to stub out that class
it lets the serializable know what the root element s name is
for this to work the name of the class that represents the array-element type must exactly match the xml name

samurai is also very nice it works like a tail -f and picks up thread dumps from your std stderr automatically it can also read -verbose gc logs and has been tested against vms from apple bea hp sun and ibm can also read ibm s javacore
for heap dumps i use visualvm for sun jdks or ibm heap dump analyzer only for ibm jdks or the Ã¼ber awesome eclipse mat depending on my needs
the later is able to work with hprof binary heap dumps produced by sun hp sap etc.

depending on what you are trying to accomplish you may need to get the actual sizes of the font
if you are trying to find out exactly how the font is put together take a look at obtaining font metrics the code on that page uses the .net libraries but it has a good explanation
if you want to get the text metrics in delphi you would use the gettextmetrics function

2931944
width	height	width	height
windows will then draw the text out at that height
in that case you don t need a specific letter or the width as you have in your prototype function
for a given font size each letter will have a different height and width

post	put
i solved the problem using your advices but i ve created another. i was thinking that as the reply form is in another page simply clicking on that reply link ain t gonna help me retain the post id anyhow because the blog page is gone after i push thet reply button
so in my view i ve created a function that holds the id of the blog post as a parameter
i mean until now my reply link was simply calling the function replies save_reply i had reply but now when i have the id as a parameter how can i put it in my a href what here

2932385
folder	directory
this would allow you to copy the multiple files into a single directory
you can then drag and drop the folder onto your executable
it would then run a command like c myapp.exe folder-with-files-in-it which should not run into the command line parameter limitation that you are experiencing now

2932490
subclass	superclass
you do need a pointer to a subclass to store the result of the dynamic cast
also if the concrete type of your object is personclass you can t downcast it to a subclass
dynamic casting can only work for you if you have a pointer to a superclass but you know that the object pointed to is actually an instance of a subclass

for-loop	loops
a cleaned-up version
your return is in your for-loop
be careful with indentation you want the line return count to be outside loops

2932539
for-loop	loops
but there s also a built-in way to do this if you weren t just doing this for an exercise danben gave this corrected version here are some other ways to do it hopefully they will teach you more about python
similar but shorter for-loop
exploits the fact that booleans can turn into 1 if true and 0 if false short for loops can generally be turned into list generator comprehensions

2932539
int	boolean	int	chars
exploits the fact that boolean can turn into 1 if true and 0 if false short for loops can generally be turned into list generator comprehensions
this creates a list of int corresponding to each letter with 0 if the letter doesn t match chars and 1 if it does and then sums them the next one filters out all the chars that don t match chars and counts how many are left


2932665
int	chars	printf	strlen
you can read about the various standard output functions here formatted output functions note that sprintf returns the number of chars that it stored into str so you can actually use this to check whether you need to add the 0 instead of using strlen at all like this
the second line is a problem printf outputs text to stdout and returns an int representing the number of chars that it output not the actual value that was printed
you should replace this line with a call to sprintf instead to load the output into str sprintf str x str

2932676
folder	directory
the variable session.gc_probability was set to 1 in the php.ini which means there is a 1 probability for the garbage collector to run and clean up the directory var lib php5 where the php sessions are stored
apparently this folder is not writable by www-data resulting in the mentioned error and throwing the zend exception
setting session.gc_probability to 0 solved the problem

2932734
client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
if you don t mind the extra javascript and http requests you could duplicate all of the server-side checking at the client-side but then you d have two separate programs written in different languages to maintain and keep synchronized
client-side validation is courteous to and convenient for the end user
server-side validation is an absolute necessity

2932805
profiler	vtune
keep an eye on changes or for things that look egregious -- even without familiarity with a given instruction set architecture you should be able to see some things fairly clearly
i sometimes check in a series of .s files with corresponding .cpp .c changes just to leverage the lovely tools from my scm to watch the code and corresponding asm change over time. get a profiler that can watch your cpu s performance counters or can at least guess at cache misses
amd codeanalyst cachegrind vtune etc. some other specific things understand strict aliasing

int	chars
each item has 2 logical fields 1 an int id and 2 some data whose size may vary let s say from 4 bytes up to 16kbytes
so my question is whether to use a data structure like struct item int field1
chars field2 max_len

2932954
int	chars	int	chars
chars field2 max_len
or rather to allocate field2 from the heap and require the caller to destroy when he s done struct item int field1

2933159
floating-point	integer
the calculation of can cause an integer overflow
to solve the first problem you can call fgets into a trash buffer until it returns null indicating an i o error or eof with no data read or the trash buffer contains a newline the second problem can be solved with tvanfosson s suggestion if floating-point arithmetic is not available but note that rand n is not a uniform discrete random variable even if rand is assumed to be one because the probability that can be as much as 1 rand_max higher than the desired probability 1 n
on my machine rand_max is 2147483647 so the difference is 4.66 10 -10 but the c standard only requires that rand_max be at least 32767 3.05 10 -5 difference

try changing your first loops to alert num instead of typeof num and you ll see that it spits out 0 1 and 2 which are the indicies and not the values of your arrays

arrays in javascript are really just objects with sequential numbers as property names

typedef	struct
use of struct enum and union allow for forwarding declarations when dependencies knows about is bidirectional
style use of typedef in c++ makes quite a bit of sense
it can almost be necessary when dealing with templates that require multiple and or variable parameters

2934163
typedef	struct
not so in the c programming language
the use of typedef most often serves no purpose but to obfuscate the data structure usage
since only struct 6 enum 4 union 5 number of keystrokes are used to declare a data type there is almost no use for the aliasing of the struct

2934165

the trouble is that i have a lot of internal code that needs to access these restricted methods without making those methods public

the wikipedia article gives a formula for calculating the n th digit that doesn t require iteration just exponentiation and rational-numbers
this will not suffer the same loss of precision as the iterative algorithm and you can compute any digit of pi as needed in constant time or at worst logarithmic type depending upon the implementation of exponentiation with modulus so computing n digits will take o n time possibly o n log n

in point of fact all modern processors employ just such a system in order to implement common alu circuitry for both addition and subtraction operations

with the exception of an additional carry sign xor-gated overflow flag both signed and unsigned addition and by implication subtraction are each implicit

because of that i show you how i define a generic repository but sometimes you do not want all of methods defined by generic repository interface
solution create an abstractrepository class which will implements a dummy repository

you should use malloc instead

as far as i have found so far there are two ways that a column can become an auto-incrementing type column in sqlalchemy it is the first sqlalchemy.types.integer column in the table that has and does not have set in its definition. with mssql this adds an index m n property to the column
with postgresql this causes the serial column type to be used
with mysql adds the auto_increment property to the column

is there a basic step in compiling that i don t understand where this makes sense
i ve been programming in ruby for a while now with just the standard mri implementation of ruby but i ve always been curious about the other implementations i hear so much about
i was reading about rubinius the other day a ruby interpreter written in ruby

opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	versioning	upgrade
however google is apparently ready to phase out support so perhaps the world s ie6 problems will go away sooner rather than later as consumers follow google s prompt to upgrade
according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any versioning of google-chrome
it trails ie8 #1 firefox 3.6 and ie7

many-to-many	one-to-many
for example deskunitname deskunitchannel iounitname iounitchannel a 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 b 1 a 1 b 1 a 2 this would connect three deskunitchannels to one iounitchannel a1 and two iounitchannels to one deskunits b1
a more normalized solution would look like deskunit deskunitid name numchannels deskunitchannel deskunitchannelid deskunitid channel iounit iounitid name numchannels iounitchannel iounitchannelid iounitid channel deskunitchannelid this approach has no many-to-many relations
but it has three one-to-many relations a desk unit has zero or more desk unit channels an io unit has zero or more io unit channels a desk unit channel can have zero or more io unit channels many-to-many relations tend to add a lot of complexity to an application

the easiest way to do that is to open the properties folder in the solution explorer and then doubleclick on the settings.settings file then you get a easy to use interface to create a config file value that you can later reference in your code without needing to write any code for reading the config file
put the connection string in the config file that way it can be updated without needing a recompile

objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
that is use one object input stream and read multiple objects from that
the error you get is because the objectoutputstream writes a header which is expected by objectiutputstream
as you are not writing multiple streams but simply multiple objects then the next objectinputstream created on the socket input fails to find a second header and throws an exception. to fix it create the objectinputstream when you accept the socket connection

memcpy	malloc	memcpy	malloc	memcpy	realloc	memcpy	realloc
using it is running off the end of the array and corrupting the data structures used by malloc realloc hence the error
your write_data should use memcpy instead like so you will also need to initialise runningsize to 0 not 1
you can initialise data to null - passing null to realloc is allowed and makes it behave just like malloc

please click on the arrow right to the style tab above header p on your snapshot and select display default css properties or sth like that and you ll see downward that html.css already styles p as beware do not modify system styles or you ll have to restart firefox reopening tabs won t be sufficient
btw this 1em margin is what you see in html without any style menu display page style no style in firefox or css menu of web developer toolbar your paragraphs have some vertical margin
so basically you erased a 1em bottom margin

folder	directory
create a folder on your server witch is not easy to guess like bigdump_d09sss or w.e download the importer file and add them to that directory after reading the instructions and filling out your config information
ftp the .sql file to that folder along side the bigdump script and go to your browser and navigate to that folder
selecting the file you uploaded will start importing the sql is split chunks and would be a much faster method

the substring begins at the specified beginindex and extends to the chars at index endindex - 1

2941254
subclass	abstract-class
probably the easiest way to manage this is by creating some sort of base class depending on your framework can be an abstract-class with methods that require an override that has your most basic crud methods find all - return a list find by primary key save my preference -- create or update
if object is flagged as new then it s a create otherwise update delete by object or primary key beyond that subclass for each specific object for stuff such as find by name delete by date etc
etc

ready	each

you should be able to define a tween animation and apply that animation to an imageview. the xml resource would be similar to the following named fade_animation.xml then you would load and apply this animation to your custom imageview when ready there are other options too
if you are using bitmaps and you don t want to do an animation then you can manually decrease the alpha value of each frame somewhat like this paint.setalpha 100

here are instructions the javascript as osa is interesting because it lets you afaik interact with scriptable os x apps as though you were in applescript without the terrible syntax i m surprised node.js doesn t come with a shell but i guess it s really more like an epoll selector-based callback event-oriented webserver so perhaps it doesn t need the full js feature set but i m not too familiar with its inner workings

when submission changes to the database the disconnected ce is dealt with as well causing a constraint violation and the exception

the moment you submit your changes the cart entry will be deleted properly and not cause the exception

create a memory dump of the currently running application and then download windbg and sos son of strike take a look at the memory profiling of the running application to see what is consuming the most memory where the performance issues are
if you have a .net 4 application you can load the memory dump in visual studio 2010 and get more of a visual look at what is consuming memory

basically the problem i have is that in safari google-chrome it is changing the width of my columns even though i have specified a a width on the table b table-layout fixed and c specific widths on my first row that when added with the padding and border values add up to the width of the table specified
in ie7 and firefox 3 the table is rendered the same

note epoll did not appear until linux 2.5 something so its best to get used to using both

other options include doing this either entirely in javascript or using an ajax partial postback
you ll have to send information about that control in the post
what happens in a postback is the the browser completely discards the current dom and loads a brand new one so to keep your place you ll have to tell your server where your place was and have javascript code that runs on page load to put things back

i have the following pipeline which is received on his instance input pipelinewrite.xpl then there is the pfc which catch the actions page-flow.xml then there is the success view which is very simple viewsuccess.xhtml all this process i launched by clicking on the save button in the viewmodify page viewmodify.xhtml the problem is that the post is done well the pfc catches the action well load the correct view but the view is loaded with no data the view doesn t find the data on his instance input

multiplying	add
for that you need to add a fourth element and represent your vectors in terms of homogenous coordinates
it is possible to use non-square matrices for certain purposes but if you want to be able to compose them in any order they should be square because you can only multiplying two matrices if the number of columns in the first is equal to the number of rows in the second
so for your purposes you should use 4x4 matrices and 4-element homogenous vectors adding a fourth w coordinate with value 1

2944829
multiplying	transpose
traditionally the vectors are represented as columns and the matrix goes on the left
you represent them above as rows and multiplying on the right
both are valid but the transformation matrix needs to be transpose between the two cases

2944829
multiplying	multiplication
after the vectors have been transformed you need to divide through by the w coordinate to scale x y and z back to conventional 3-space
in c-ish pseudocode using a row-vector convention a sequence of transformations can be composed by multiplying the matrices for each together in turn
note that matrix multiplication is not commutative so the order in which you multiply is important

2944829
multiplying	multiplication
note that matrix multiplication is not commutative so the order in which you multiply is important
in turn this means it is important whether you are multiplying row vectors on the left or columns on the right
if you multiply a x b x c then with column vectors that is the same as performing transformation c first then b then finally a

put	get
with current web servers there are many ways to get around not having a default page for each directory
you can set the custom 404 to redirect to a page that is available and some can put one in automatically for you
as far as security goes you can just turn off directory browsing to not allow people to see the contents

2944951
post	get	post	get
when you call response.redirect you instruct the client to make a new get request to the url you provide
so if you call this early in a request like a form postback that was actually a post request you lose the post
since most posts should themselves redirect once the action is complete it may be enough to just only apply the logic you have above to a get request

2944971
super	self
each class defines or inherits its own designated initializer. through messages to self other init.
methods in the same class directly or indirectly invoke the designated initializer and the designated initializer through a message to super invokes the designated initializer of its superclass
emp added in principle the designated initializer is the one init method that all other init methods call

put	get
later i want to generalize it to not always use a float but that will be after i get more working
so the problem is that i expected list.mapi to return a list not individual elements but in order to put the lists together i had to put around my use of mapi and i am curious why that is the case
this is more complicated than i expected i thought i should be able to just tell it to make a new list starting at a certain index but i can t find any function for that

2945424
maven	pom.xml
from a modularization point of view assuming you found a solution for the above part about repository it would certainly make sense to have it as a separate module especially if there is an opportunity someone can use projectc outside your project
so how do i set up the build for projecta such that someone can download projecta.jar and use it without needing to install jars for projectb and projectc assuming projecta is a jar you can create an executable jar that bundles the dependencies with the maven assembly plugin and the predefined jar-with-dependencies descriptor or with the maven shade plugin
you have to deploy the dependencies to a repository that can be read over http and to declare this repository in your pom.xml

2945818
int	chars
all the template parameters need to have values 14.8.2 and by using the rules defined in 14.8.2.1 we will find t and n by matching the array passed to the function with the functions parameter which is a reference to an array
for example if arr was t would be int and n would be 10. once we have those the function can be instantiated
once instantiated the return type of the function would be a reference to an array of n chars s

nstimer	nsoperation
also from apple threading programing guide
an nstimer will probably do what you are looking to do however calls from nstimer will normally block the main thread if the process is involved or you need to getting something from the internets to switch out the picture you will need to create a new thread to do this
for information on threading i highly recommend the cs193p lecture on performance they go into detail on nsthread nsoperation ect

post	get	post	put	put	get
the http standard describes the ways that the different requests get post put delete head are intended to be used
for example put is intended to add a resource delete is intended to remove one and post is intended to modify one
sure but following standards makes intent explicit

2946363
post	get	post	put
idempotence is also guaranteed for put which basically means update this resource with this data or create it at this uri if it s not there already and for delete which you can simply try again and again until you get a result deleting something that s not there is not a problem
post which usually means create a new resource can also be used to invoke arbitrary processing and thus is neither safe nor idempotent

so don t try to detect flash just put it in an object element and provide a meaningful alternative s
that will address both the 97 and 99 users both the remaining 3 and 1 ones as well as finally those with flash installed but who can only guess what unlabeled buttons in the swf can do or worse get trapped in the flash object while tabulating

pull	push
at one extreme which we call the push model the subject sends observers detailed information about the change whether they want it or not
at the other extreme is the pull model
the subject sends nothing but the most minimal notification and observers ask for details explicitly thereafter

2947018
pull	push
the push model might make observers less reusable because subject classes make assumptions about observer classes that might not always be true
on the other hand the pull model may be inefficient because observer classes must ascertain what changed without help from the subject.

websphere	ibm
for e.g refer to this link below 1 pk41617 performance of the aio library suffers under certain types of traffic flow please check if this is applicable to your environment
also try and skim through this link - 1 disabling aio asynchronous input output in websphere application server you can probably give this a try if this is not a production environment and see if disabling aio eliminates the spikes for you
even if it works well i would go through the formal ibm support process to find out exact reasons before doing the same for a production enviroment

this worked in mysql because the difference in dates would be positive or negative
in postgresql the equivalent functionality always returns a positive number regardless of their relative chronological order
any thoughts comments or questions

move	drag
we were hoping to use mdi application model but later the client asked for a requirement to drag and view viewer windows in multiple desktops using multiple monitors . this can not be done using mdi window model because we cannot move mdi window outside the main application window
only possible way is to use dock windows because they can be undocked from main application window and move into other desktops but dock windows primary used for tool-palettes or utility windows

postgresql	mysql
but you can pay that back with interest when you find yourself debugging problems including performance bottlenecks due to issues occurring below the abstraction levels that generators strive to provide
when i get a chance to use a good relational engine such as postgresql i believe i m overall more productive than i would be with any orm in between incuding sqlalchemy despite its many admirable qualities
however i have to admit that the case is different when the relational engine is not all that good i ve never liked mysql or when porting to non-relational deployments is an important consideration

x86	64bit
it currently references some third party .net dlls which i don t have the source for and i m not sure if they were built for x86 x64 or anycpu
my understanding at the moment is to target x86 if at least one third party .net dll is built for x86 or use p invoke to interface with win32 dlls
application will run in 32 bit mode on both 32 bit and 64bit oses

2947341
post	get
i can t get this thought out of my head that it isn t good for real programming tasks beyond automation and macros
anyway the general idea i got from about two hundred forum threads and blog post is that for general non-professional-level progs scripts and apps and as long as it s a single programmer you writing it a given program can be written quicker and more efficiently with python than it could be with pretty much any other language
but once its big enough to require multiple programmers or more complex than a regular person read non-professional would have any business making it pretty much becomes instantly inferior to a million other languages

update to get the raw response body you can do the following when extends zend_test_phpunit_controllertestcase
there are no assertion methods specific to json implements in zend_test_phpunit
however the first test you would might want to do is check that the json is valid thus convert it to its original type array object

if you are trying to convert characters from one character set to another then you can use the iconv library
there is the ord function which returns the ascii value of a character
there is also its converse chr which takes an ascii number and returns the character

2948383
short	base
update the full implementation of asynccall is too big to post here
in short what happens is that the asynccall template function instantiates a template class holding the lambda function
this class is derived from a base class that contains a virtual execute function and upon an asynccall call the function call class is put on a call queue

2948425
children	parent
the code in the parent class can iterate over this container and do some routine work on all the elements
if there is a reasonable default behaviour of the function that can be relied on in a majority of children it can be implemented as a normal one
otherwise no default behaviour and or most children have to override it it s better to declare it as abstract

2948425
children	parent
the other opportunity is the use of containers for example arrays for the data that are specific to the child classes but still are subject for general checks or other processing that can be done in the common ancestor
this way you define a variable that holds the data but the data itself is filled in the children
the code in the parent class can iterate over this container and do some routine work on all the elements

edit shout out to jandy for the point about mouseleave edited the above to use it
mousedown doesn t have an automatic repeat but you could create one via setinterval and then turn it off on mouseup via clearinterval

debian-based	linux	free	malloc
however you might be able to make some headway with careful use of the ld_preload mechanism if your platform supports it linux you write a shared library with the same symbol names as those in the c library which are called instead of the intended libc functions
for example electric fence is built as a shared library on debian-based systems and intercepts calls to malloc free et al. i suspect you could use this mechanism to trap or argument-check calls to any libc functions you don t like and perhaps to note those which you consider unconditionally safe
it might then be reasonable to scan the compiled executable for the code corresponding to int 80 to trap out any attempts to make raw syscalls 0xcd 0x80 - though beware of false positives

2949018
mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
if you provide 1 function to .hover it runs on both events if you provide 2 functions the first is the mouseenter handler the second is the mouseleave handler
however this may not be what you re after...since mouseenter doesn t fire when entering a child that s actually specifically why it exists mouseout will fire when entering a child
you can see that s there s no difference in a demo here hover from top to bottom comment and uncomment out the .stoppropagation it makes no difference...because the event doesn t bubble to the parent

even if you just want to use it through its automation interface or as an agent-driven test robot for a loadrunner scenario

post	get
also they use the viewstate to store their value when the control itself is invisible or otherwise not successful and its value will not get sent back by the browser
ipostbackdatahandler is used by input controls mostly to access the post data they generate
controls such as labels don t generate any post data keys of their own so they don t use it

2949260
setinterval	settimeout	setinterval	document.write
the alternative is to add the script using the dom
best not to use a string but an anonymous function instead using strings in settimeout and setinterval is closely related to eval and should only be used in rare cases
see it might also be worth noting that document.write will not work correctly on an already parsed document

2949527
fortran	chapel
if i were betting on it being replaced i d be looking at chapel x10 or most likely fortran 2008
what you should be looking at depends on your requirements but if they include high-performance number-crunching for scientific and engineering codes fortran or c c++ with mpi should be in your sights
i ve never heard of datasynapse gridserver a quick google suggests to me that it s aimed at a completely different class of computational problems

2949560
keystore	jks
for this case using a standard jks or pkcs#12 keystore file could be suited to store encryption keys but i could also define a smaller structure encryption-transformation key data checksum that could be attached to each storage store using addition files with the same name and special extension for plain files or embedded inside other types of objects such as rms record stores
and when it comes to using a standard keystore with multiple-key generation given this is your preference would it be better to use a record-store per storage object or just a global keystore keeping all keys using the url identifier of abstract storage object as alias
the use of a master key seems obvious

2949589
post	get
if you change the value on the client side via javascript the viewstate isn t changed and this is why on postback you get the original empty value
html controls like labels spans divs don t post their values to the server - while inputs do
asp.net maintains changes in controls by using viewstate

regarding security i have no opinion it is complex anyway
i agree weblogic is currently and in my mind superior to websphere but there is no proof of it
java ee technology is moving and the answer really depends on your application architecture and the pros cons features you re potentially using on each server and the global environment is it for use in a complete ibm information system with bunch of ibm products such mq was portal etc... based on my experience regarding developper usability and deployer usability i prefer weblogic since i get less troubles with jaxws web services on wl and by the way jboss than in was troubles with ejb 2.1 on websphere ejb stubs not required on wl and jboss btw several instance of was on the same host having ejbs not working with default configuration etc.

a do while loops will always execute the code in the block first and then evaluate the condition

so if you try this is a string .split you will get back the string s join function will join a list of tokens together using the string itself as a delimiter

int	boolean
c did this and caused a huge amount of confusion and a lot of programmer error
there is no good reason why a zero int value always means true or false and a lot of good reasons why you might want to leave the decision to the programmer
for these reasons implicit conversion to boolean has been abandoned by most modern languages

2951905

the null indicator is stored separately so a nullable bit actually required two bits
and strictly speaking null isn t a third value

2954764
division	exponent
this is why is the proper answer
division per se isn t so bad
however standard ieee 754 fp types allow for a greater negative negative range of exponent than positive due to denormalized numbers

2954823
public	protected
if you re interested also read up on protected access
it s a common pet-peeve of many programmers - java code with private fields and public accessors and mutators
the effect is as you say those fields might as well been public

2954840
post	get
your first operation is a get but it is not a safe operation as it is creating a new transaction id
i would suggest post is a more appropriate verb to use
you mention that you are concerned about performance issues that would be perceived by the user caused by two round trips

2954876
public	protected
if you need direct access from package members make it protected
only make those things public which are required by your users
exposing variables means that you are contracting forever to have that variable and allow users to modify it

2954902
request-uri	url	post	put
rfc 2616 specifies the semantic of the operations for post and put
paragraph 9.5 post method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the request-uri in the request-line paragraph 9.6 put method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied request-uri
there are subtle details of that behavior for example put can be used to create new resource at the specified url if one does not already exist

2954902
put	get
thus your rest api becomes to get all persons - get persons to get single person - to create new person - post persons with the body containing the data for the new record to update existing person or create new person with well-known id - with the body containing the data for the updated record
to delete existing person - note i personally prefer not using put for creating records for two reasons unless i need to create a sub record that has the same id as an already existing record from a different data set also known as the poor man s foreign key -
update you are right that post is not idempotent and that is as per http spec

2954951
submit	submission
for example if you wanted to trigger a focus event but not actually focus the object you just want code you bound with .focus fn to run this would do that whereas .trigger would do that as well as actually focus the element and bubble up
here is a real world example this would run any submit handlers for example the jquery validation plugin then try to submit the
however if you just wanted to validate since it s hooked up via a submit event handler but not submit the afterwards you could use .triggerhandler submit like this the plugin prevents the handler from submission the form by bombing out if the validation check doesn t pass but with this method we don t care what it does

2954951
submit	submission
however if you just wanted to validate since it s hooked up via a submit event handler but not submit the afterwards you could use .triggerhandler submit like this the plugin prevents the handler from submission the form by bombing out if the validation check doesn t pass but with this method we don t care what it does
whether it aborted or not we re not trying to submit the form we just wanted to trigger it to re-validate and do nothing else
disclaimer this is a superfluous example since there s a .validate method in the plugin but it s a decent illustration of intent

2954987
put	get
i can read the 8 byte group ok but how can i present it to my asp jscript code such i can get the real number back again
or to put it another way say a file was produced by a windows delphi program inspection of the file will show it contains 8 bytes being 94 0e 4c ca c2 97 ad 53 which is the real number in ieee format

int	boolean
this way your project will be - managable - ordered - easy to plan - easy to implement - easy to modify - easily understood by other people i hope this helps regards
i ve solved this problem a few times before and i have solved it in this way 1. select inherited from vector it s storing all the rows with standard classes depending on the language you are working in structure id and id useful to identify your select all the elements of the select which is a child of your vector class are rows rownumber int columnnumber int usedfilter string usedgroupby string usedhavingcaluse string usedorderby string tablename string getid getrownumber int getcolumnnumber int getusedfilter string getusedgroupby string getusedhavingclause string getusedorderby string gettablename string select tablename string filter string groupby string havingcaluse string orderby string columns vector 2. i had a class for direct communication with the database let s call it dataaccesslayer
let s see the structure of this class dataaccesslayer connect ... boolean disconnect ... boolean use databasename string boolean selecteddata vector in fact this is a set of select s createselect tablename string filter string groupby string havingcaluse string orderby string columns vector boolean to determine if it s successful deleteselect id boolean insert tablename string columns vector values vector boolean update tablename string columnstoset vector values vector filter string boolean delete tablename string filter string int how many rows were deleted -1 if exception occured or just simply throw the exception to a higher level creating dropping tables views databases constraints can be implemented too i m just lazy to do that because i m sure you already understand the idea dataaccesslayer after the first two steps occured you can handle any database query with two classes in fact the functionality of select can be put into dataaccesslayer too making one class of the two but it s more elegant this way but you might want to handle some extra things for a few tables

2955007
implements	extends
so the relations will be select 1 - n dataaccesslayer classinheritedfromdataaccesslayer extends dataaccesslayer frontend uses classinheritedfromdataaccesslayer1 ... classinheritedfromdataaccesslayern dataaccesslayer

database management systems ramakrishn cgherke alt text
database products rdms such as oracle mysql builds their own indexing system they give some control to the database administrators however nobody exactly knows what happens on the background except people makes research in that area so why indexing put simply database indexes help speed up retrieval of data
the other great benefit of indexes is that your server doesn t have to work as hard to get the data

2955252
disk	ram
most are disk backed providing the very same consistency as a normal rdbms - only catch the entire dataset must fit into ram
the core idea is disk backed storage has huge random access penalties which does not apply to dram
data can be index organized in a random access optimized way not feasible using traditional rdbms data caching schemes

i want to change all the page inside the product folder as clean url

persistent	transient
storing of transient runtime state
there are application that need to store their state in some kind of database but do not need to persistent that over application restart
think of some kind of process manager it needs to keep track of sub-processes running but that data is only valid as long as the application and the sub-processes run

another important point that is often forgotten bit in sql server is not a boolean or logic data type
it s a numeric int data type
an int data type that can take a value of 1 0 or null

2955884
google-chrome	firefox
so google-chrome firefox ie8 and even ie6 all work flawlessly but ie7 has some nasties. update ie8 compatibility mode also introduces the exact same behavior
i thought i d done quite well my site passed xhtml1.0 strict validation and worked flawlessly in ie6 as well as looking fine in ie8 google-chrome
i glibly thought that it it worked in ie6 8 ie7 was bound to be ok

i m trying to send some data to php using httpservice post but for some reason it s not working
the same example works with get but not with post and here s the php code this is the error i m getting error #2032 stream error

2956138
next	except
this would be a lot faster except that s what we re moving away from because it is actually a lot slower in this case
the reason for this is that the database is on one server and the webapp is on another server and the webapp is particularly chatty at points there are pages it could end up doing 2k round trips - i have no control over reducing this number before that s suggested so moving the logic closer to the db is the next best way of making it more performant


2956215
temp	tmp
file_get_contents or to copy them locally copy tmp local.txt
whichever way you do it the contents are going to have to be transferred to a local temp folder or memory before you can do anything with them


2956390
post	get
a version of this approach is detailed here other methods to do this would include using a flash-based solution like or a wrapper like - these will prevent you having to roll your own solution and will also provide some extra functionality - upload progress feedback for example
normally when you submit a form it does a post request to the server causing a refresh
ajax requests get round this by using javascript to send the post data through to the server and that doesn t need a page refresh

2956726
multiplying	multiplication
for example a multiplication of two doubles is a single machine instruction
multiplying two bigdecimals is probably a minimum of 50 machine instructions and has complexity of where m and n are the number of bytes used to represent the two numbers
however if your application requires the calculation to be decimally correct then you need to accept the overhead

check the manual page on htmlspecialchars string htmlspecialchars string string int quote_style ent_compat string charset bool double_encode true the option should be what you are looking for

another question if i want queries like
i m using mod_rewrite in a managedfusion settings file similar to .htaccess and i want to forward all incoming requests to another port on the server except for a few folder
so far i have this with the folder ui forms clientsystem and widgets being ignored this works fine as long as those exception directory don t exist however when they are created the rewriteengine will simply trigger again and in that case it will match the rule thereby forwarding me to the other port after all

that doesn t mean you can t run them locally you might also want to look at nant or msbuild to script your build and unit-tests you ll have to do this with cc.net and teamcity anyway and then periodically run it from a powershell script
most build servers like cruisecontrol.net or teamcity are built to run on a separate machine

put	get
but you actually want to nest another h datatable inside a new row subsequently
there s then no other way to create a single column and put a h panelgrid in it to represent the main row and a nested h datatable to represent the detail row
you also need a good shot of css to get it all nicely aligned and some smart piece of javascript to show hide the detail row

put	get
for example to handle all links to twitter.com you d put this inside your in your androidmanifest.xml then when the user clicks on a link to twitter in the browser they will be asked what application to use in order to complete the action the browser or your application
of course if you want to provide tight integration between your website and your app you can define your own scheme then in your web app you can put links like and when the user clicks it your app will be launched automatically because it will probably be the only one that can handle my.special.scheme type of uris
the only downside to this is that if the user doesn t have the app installed they ll get a nasty error

a forum is should be quite dynamic so indeed it generates a pretty good load on the database but this is what database are made for storing and retrieving data

int	double	int	chars
in order to use memcpy for multi-byte types is that the underlying representation must be the same same layout
you can safely copy float to float int to int and double to double
you are destined for undefined behavior when the source type does not match the destination type such as copying from long to chars or float to double

messagebox	spy++
a good tool for looking at all this is spy++ which can help you see some information you can get hold of about a running process
use findwindow to find the app the use enumchildwindows to enumerate all it s childwindows until you find the messagebox if the messagebox isn t a direct child of the main window of the app you might have to have recursive calls i think
you might be able to skip the findwindow call and instead use the mainwindowhandle property of the process but i haven t checked if that works

2960398
accessor	properties
from the documentation if you do not specify nonatomic then in a reference counted environment a synthesized get accessor for an object properties uses a lock and retains and autoreleases the returned value the implementation will be similar to the following if you specify nonatomic then a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly
nonatomic accessor are faster because they don t have to lock
that s about all there is to it

2960435
expander	togglebutton
this solution is simpler but inferior in that if you switch to a different system theme the required margin may change and your expander may no longer look good
i see that you want to actually move the expander button into your headertemplate not just restyle it
this is easily done with findancestor first add a togglebutton and bind its ischecked property using findancestor along these lines this adds an expand button inside the header template but does not hide the original button provided by the expander

2960435
expander	togglebutton	expander	togglebutton
this is easily done with findancestor first add a togglebutton and bind its ischecked property using findancestor along these lines this adds an expand button inside the header template but does not hide the original button provided by the expander
to do this i recommend you replace the expander s controltemplate
here is a complete copy of expander s controltemplate with the togglebutton replaced with a simple contentpresenter it might be used as follows a simpler alternative would be to just set a negative margin in yourheadertemplate to cover the expander button

you can send the html file as a hta file wich can write and read from data from the hard disk. check for more information
an hta file is basically a local html file with some extra tags in the header and is run interpreted locally without security restrictions like any exe file. i don t know how to show the complete html code here markdown is not for me so if you want an example 1 - create a file test.hta with the standard html head body and script tags 2 - inside head tag insert 3 - inside body tab put a button with onclick writetext
4 - inside the script tag insert 5 - save it doubleclick it click on the button and you will get a nice c testhta.txt file with text file written in it

equals	compareto
first it gets the hash code of the object you want to add
then it finds the corresponding bucket for that hash code and iterates through each object in that bucket using the equals method to see if any identical objects already exist in the set
your debugger is not breaking on compareto because it is never used with hashset

2961510

using post and get for the right things is not a matter of security

2961764
disk	ram
only you know if this will be an issue
as you ve found out just replacing a couple of instructions with sse is not going to work because you need to shuffle the data around in memory in order to load the sse registers correctly and this moving data around in memory the bit that constructs the arrays is going to kill your performance as memory is very slow hard disk aside memory is invariably the bottleneck these days
also there is no way to move data between the sse and the fpu alu without using a write to ram followed by a read

client-side	server-side
the biggest difference would be that someone wouldn t see that the data they entered happened to be invalid til the form was submitted
client-side validation and ajax won t work including async postbacks and any control that requires javascript in order to work
server-side validation which should always happen anyway and full postbacks and such should always work and i think a fileupload control will as well

2962227
serializable	deserialization
it has only one method for serializable and assumes a specific constructor for deserialization as constructor cannot part of an interface
you mention the serializable attribute so i assume that you are talking about binary serializable
in this case have your databutton implement iserializable and you will take complete control of serializable

2962383
subclass	inherited	subclass	superclass
when using a joined subclass strategy the pk of the subclass is the the pk of the base class and is used to perform the join between the tables
from the jpa specification 2.1.10.3 joined subclass strategy in the joined subclass strategy the root of the class hierarchy is represented by a single table
each subclass is represented by a separate table that contains those fields that are specific to the subclass not inherited from its superclass as well as the column s that represent its primary key

2962448
equals	compareto
in either case the item to be sorted should implement the comparable interface with a proper compareto method
odds are excellent that means you ll have to override equals and hashcode too as only some of the primary key objects are likely to have proper default implementations
if you want to sort based on some non-natural sort order then also implement a few extra comparators

2962500
equals	compareto
keep in mind that if two objects are equal then their hash codes must also be equal and compareto must return 0
you must override equals and object.hashcode and also implement the comparable interface
this will make your class fully compliant when doing any kind of sorting or hashing including using collections.sort any map class or any set class

2962844
r5rs	r6rs
but the #lang r5rs and #lang r6rs don t do the same -- so these toplevel expressions are evaluated but never displayed
the reason you did see some output with the r5rs language is that you didn t use it as a module as in #lang r5rs but instead used the specific r5rs language level
this language level is more compatible to the r5rs but for various subtle reasons this is not a good idea in general

lastly use the newest memcache client libraries - they use the consistent hashing algorithms now and it ll help adding removing individual servers
use a config file - whether its from parse_ini_file or some other config parsing scheme
if you are worried about parsing time you could put those configs in the php ini load path - this pre-parses all of the vars you need but you ll need to restart apache to load any changes

once the files are read enough as long as you dont have too much thrashing on your machine the config file will be in memory mapped cache anyway so it ll be really fast

lastly use the newest memcached client libraries - they use the consistent hashing algorithms now and it ll help adding removing individual servers

rational-numbers	integer
any comments on the complexity of this problem
consider the 0 1 knapsack problem . the standard dynamic programming algorithm applies only when the capacity as well as the weights to fill the knapsack with are integers rational-numbers
the issue is that we can t memoize like we do for integer weights because we may need potentially infinite decimal places for irrational weights - leading to an infinitely large number of columns for the dynamic programming table

mouseover	mousedown
turn the hover state into a .hover class you can edit the css rule by clicking on the source file in firebug s style tab then of course you d add and remove the .hover class from your element
there is no perfect solution mouseover hover-simulation effect in firebug
however there are a couple ways to edit your hover state in firebug add an active state along with your hover if you mousedown on your element drag off and release it remains active

folder	directory
other web apps and users will will not be able to access the file via http get requests
when you create a dynamic web app project in eclipse the content that will go into the root of the war file gets packaged from the webcontent folder
it sounds like you want to access a file from the directory web-inf templates at runtime for your web app

kerberos	ntlm
this is because the backend system only supports kerberos iwa but the delegation for some reason - even though the incoming request is kerberos authenticated - converts the authentication to ntlm before forwaring to the backend system
i ve tried the following but it doesn t seem to work i ve also tried to set kerberos where it now says negotiate but it doesn t seem to do much

getter	setter	ivar	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
you need to write explicit accessors in the subclassing and access the protected ivar via the self- myivar syntax
synthesized properties not only synthesize the getter and setter they also synthesize the ivar if one is not declared
you need to write explicit accessors in the subclassing and access the protected ivar via the self- myivar syntax

2963894
ivar	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
if a subclassing needs to customize access do so with care by overriding the getter setter and preferably calling the super to actually get set the value
joanna s answers are both correct though ivar synthesis doesn t kick in on 32 bit mac os x
the reason though is because allowing a subclassing to synthesize access to a superclass s internal state would quite explicitly break encapsulation

2963894
subclass	superclass	getter	setter
if a superclass provides storage for something it should provide the access control and encapsulate the management of said memory
if a subclass needs to customize access do so with care by overriding the getter setter and preferably calling the super to actually get set the value


2963911
stdout	fflush
such a variable will have an unpredictable but generally repeatable value that depends on the environment in which the function was invoked -- mostly on what previously called functions have left on the stack which might well depend on nohup as you re seeing
there are a number of effects of running with nohup but the main one is stdin and stdout will be redirected to dev null
in most cases this means that stdout will be fully buffered instead of line buffered its only line buffered if stdout is a terminal so stuff that is output generally won t actually be output until you do an explicit fflush

2964157
linkbutton	selectedindexchanged
you will be able to catch the selectedindexchanged but only when the next postback happens
linkbutton don t work because they render out a javascript target
if you use gridview controls with buttoncolumns then these won t work as the buttons are javascript too

2964256
internationalization	translation
at the top of a file that features this kind of syntax you should see or if not you should have something like from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ see the docs here for more details
the leading underscore is the commonly used function alias for the one of the ugettext functions used by the internationalization i18n mechanics
it means that when you have i18n running the choicefield labels will be translation into the appropriate end-user language if a translation is available

2964378
postgresql	mysql
speaking from personal experience only we moved from mysql solely because our production system heroku is running postgresql
we had custom-built-for-mysql queries which were breaking on postgresql
so i guess the morale of the story here is to run on the same dbms over everything otherwise you may run into problems

2964525
getter	setter
properties are syntactic sugar otherwise you d just use fields
the point of getter properties is encapsulation - the user does not know whether it s simply a field something you compute every time or a random value
this means that for me every class in java that is not a data structure has getter and setter for its fields that need to be accessible

2964529
post	get
if you still want to have people manually review post or if you want to get a large number of post manually rated in order to have a sufficiently large labeled dataset for training your machine learning algorithm you might be interested in mechanical turk which allows you to leverage a very large number of people really really cheaply
my suggestion do away with manually checking the post

dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
note that i think you may want to only call messagedigest.getinstance once and then clone from then on iirc the cloning is a lot faster
do something like this dataoutputstream lets you write primitives and strings and have them output as bytes
wrapping a bytearrayoutputstream in it will let you write to a byte array which integrates nicely with messagedigest

hide	show
your best bet is to just show hide the fields themselves that are inside the row

postgresql	mysql
while postgresql lacks a few things of mysql insert ignore replace upsert stuff and load data infile for me mainly the features it does have more than make up
its stored procedures are so much more powerful and it s far easier to write complex functions and aggregates in postgresql
performance-wise if you re comparing to innodb which is only fair because of mvcc then it feels at least as fast possibly faster - we weren t able to do some real measurements here due to some constraints but there certainly hasn t been a performance issue

versioning	upgrade

then look at the versioning of system.data you are referencing in your project i am guessing you are on 2.0.5
if you upgrade to v6r1 or higher you should be able to cast

2966295
hash	salt
as for storing securely on the server once you ve receive the user s password the first time you should use a one-way hash like sha256 with a salt
you can pass this value wherever store it and to validate compare the has of a potential password to the hash you have stored
treat a user s password like toxic waste - throw it away as quickly as possible

2966302
installation	upgrade
the api supports database versioning so you can apply schema changes during upgrade or in your case
installation
there are some examples in the documentation in that example they call preparedatabase which opens a connection to the database but if the version is 1.0 or non-existent it calls that closure which executes the create table statement

goto	break
i m sure that browsing the goto tag will get you even more answers

goto	break
if you need to release resources before returning it s nice to do instead of trying to break out of multiple layers of for while loops
some would argue that it isn t necessary in well designed code -- when you reach a point where using goto is attractive you should be breaking the function up into multiple sub-functions
maybe that s true in some cases but if you have to pass multiple variables in or pass pointers to variables so a sub-function can update those values i feel like you ve added unnecessary complications

another module take responsibilities to package these modules into a war file

post	get
if there is a way to just get the timing data while keeping the interactive environment from writing out the matrix i would be very appreciative
i m working with f# interactive and i m computing some large lists and arrays and i d rather not have the interactive window post all of that information
specifically i m developing single threaded and multithreaded algorithms and evaluating at what point does it become more efficient to change from a single threaded function to a multithreaded one

strlen	strdup
so that would be still if you want to duplicate the contents of insides you can use strdup
note that strings are zero-terminated 0 and strlen doesn t count it
by definition sizeof char is 1 byte so it s not required

implements	extends
extends an interface simply adds operations and cannot compromise the integrity of the implementation because the interface is stateless on its own
interfaces are 100 abstract and the only way to create an instance of an interface is to instantiate a class that implements it
allowing interfaces to be final is completely pointless

maven	pom.xml
i m considering writing such script that will help to migrate my old scala maven projects to sbt but want to know first if this functionality already exists
as you know sbt is compatible with maven in some way -- sbt recognizes simple maven poms and can use dependencies and repositories specified in them
however sbt wiki says that if inline dependency is specified in sbt project definition pom.xml will be ignored so using both in this case is impossible maven and ivy configurations pom.xml and ivy.xml are ignored when inline dependency declarations are present

jflex	cup
your best option is to use some parser generator and parse the string into an abstract syntax tree ast for short
have a look at jflex javacup for instance
as it turns out the cup manual actually has an example covering your situation

2972555
xlib	xdotool
update another option could be to use the built-in automator tool
one option is to use x11 s xtest extension and other xlib functions
defaults write org.x.x11 enable_test_extensions -boolean true here is a tool already built using this technology called xdotool

2972657
mouseevent	mouselistener
if you decide to do so the implementation is pretty trivial just add another check for if event.iscontroldown returns true
it s the same as detecting a right-click on windows or linux you call your given mouseevent s getbutton method to check if button3 was clicked
for example take a look at the following snippet of an example mouselistener however this only detects right-clicks if the user actually has a two-button mouse

bids	ssis
the suggested workaround is option 1
with precompiled true open save and close the package in bids after the build is complete
this will recompile the reference and generate the embedded 64 bit binary in the ssis package and will cause the above mentioned error to go away

namedtuple	dictionary

namedtuple are a great feature they are perfect container for data
when you have to store data you would use tuples or dictionary like or the dictionary approach is overwhelming since dictionary are mutable and slower than tuples

2972944
post	get
once you get past a certain level of complexity there s far too much state to manage
the prg pattern solves some basic usability issues for which the overhead is minimal remember your post response will have no body content
if you re reusing your http connections persistent http keep-alive then there s very little to worry about

2973037
gdi	direct2d
with 3d apis texture size would probably be an issue since most standards limit to something like 4096x4096
i think it s unlikely you ll find something that performs faster than gdi on windows since it has kernel-level support which is something open source solutions will not have
you might want to also look into opengl or direct2d direct3d since these too have direct access to the frame buffer

2973097
prepare	execute
the best way is to have the command text and parameters constructed once use parameters.add to add the parameters change their values in the loop and execute the command
that way the statement will be prepare only once
you should also open the connection before you start the loop and close it after it

inherited	properties
i boiled it down to a simple test application winforms 2.0 with only one form some fixed size controls and the following properties under 96dpi windows xp the form looks correctly like this 96 dpi example under 120 dpi windows xp the the windows forms autoscaling feature produces this 120 dpi example as you can see groupboxes buttons list or tree views are scaled correctly multiline text boxes get too big in the vertical axis and a fixed size label does not scale correctly in both vertical and horizontal direction
edit some hints the font change is only applied to the containing form the controls inherited their font from the form
i would like to keep it this way if possible

any suggestions for books on this topic unit testing for iphone
i finished my project on an iphone dev at uni without doing useful unit testing did some simple ones just to put on my report
i was looking at the apple s unit testing suits logic and application tests but ended up using iphoneunittesting from google-toolbox-for-mac which i found more documented and easy to get started with java s unit testing knowledge

symfony	kohana
if the app is small then frameworks like codeigniter or kohana are ideal
if you are building a bigger app that needs to scale the symfony or possiby zend are the ones to look at
if you were to start your app in symfony you would instanly get url rewriting using routes a form framework for handling everything to do with your web forms internationalisation and localisation emailing caching admin area generator to help you add data quickly unit testing framework plus the whole framework is extendable and custmisable to suit your needs

kerberos	ntlm
other notes our server tc server and client browser are on different virtual machines and in same domain
we are having trouble getting spring security kerberos ad to work for our web app
our diagnosis is that our ad server sending an ntlm token we can tell as it starts with tlrmtvnt..... to ie and ie is then sending this to our application and it s failing

2973355
kerberos	ntlm
our diagnosis is that our ad server sending an ntlm token we can tell as it starts with tlrmtvnt..... to ie and ie is then sending this to our application and it s failing
our ad server should be sending a kerberos spnego token to ie
the moving parts are as follows spring security 3.0 patched microsoft windows server enterprise 2003 sp1 active directory ie 8 tomcat tc server 6.0 java 1.6 we have set everything up as detailed in the instructions here this involved creating a normal user as the service principal the same as the machine name where our application resides

kerberos	ntlm
when we did so we got the following errors in the browser 500 internal server error. and in the tc server log file it seems from what we can make out that the ad server sending an ntlm token we can tell as it starts with tlrmtvnt..... to ie and ie is then sending this to our application and it s failing

post	get	post	get
i solved this problem not with using the post array because i don t know how and where to debug this script but with generating a querystring after this you will get a querystring like this this works with guarantee under every browser
i know its an old post but maybe it will help to solve the problem for some people because i had the same problem today

affinity	processors	affinity	processors
as for affinity you can set affinity masks per-thread or per-process which supersedes all process threads settings but the os enforces least one logical processors affiliated per thread you never end up with a zero mask
a process default affinity mask is inherited from its parent process which allows you to create single-core loaders for problematic legacy executables and threads inherit the mask from the process they belong to
you may not set a threads affinity to a processors outside the process affinity but you can further limit it

2973820
post	get
i can post a form from a remote site to the json api without any problem and get back json data
the problem only arises with jquery post
i imagine that this is some sort of protection against cross-site scripting that i don t completely understand

2973889
post	get
the thing to note here though is that you can t do a post with a element as its requested through get
the same-origin policy kicks in when you attempt to post through javascript obvious reasons behind this include posting potentially sensitive information without the user knowing via ajax
jquery does support jsonp this technique allows sending data to a site outside of your domain and it does so by creating a element dynamically on your page which wraps the response in a function call

lisp	scheme
imho
i am pretty sure that the first decision tree was written in lisp
still many such algorithm is still written in lisp. you can find many documentation if you decide to choose lisp. scheme is also a good language for that purpose and it is simpler smaller than lisp

nettcpbinding	net.tcp
in the enabled protocols part just add net.tcp and voila
you need to add the nettcpbinding to the binding of the application in iis
right click the virtual directory application in iis - manage application - advanced settings

put	get
so i need to know how to get the listitem programmatically
if anyother alternate way such as through web services help me put step by step pls..

folder	directory
i then move any observers i create into this folder
to make sure this folder is loaded at startup i add the following to environment.rb simple
if you decide to use this along with the previous tip on loading the observers automatically then you ll have to change the name of the directory you re looking in from models to observers remember to reboot your app after creating a new observer or making any changes to environment.rb

2974524
folder	directory
when i build it using tfs it puts all binary files in the binaries folder
it also creates a _publishedwebsites folder where it puts the web applications ready for deployment
what i would like is for a few of the projects to have their ouput in a separate directory in the binaries folder

2974524
folder	directory
what i would like is for a few of the projects to have their ouput in a separate directory in the binaries folder
i want the files that i would normally find in the bin release folder to be there
i looked long and hard and could only find scarce documentation on how to achieve that and only for tfs 2008

2974614
google-chrome	firefox
jquery abstracts this difference for you by providing an event object parameter in all browsers
in ie and google-chrome event is resolving to window.event
firefox doesn t have this property and instead provides an event to an event handler function by passing it as a parameter

many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-many	one-to-many
your stateorgprogram now actually needs to be mapped as an entity in its own right with each object having a one-to-many relationship to it
it s not a many-to-many any more

i am using visual studio 2008 sp1 with the appropriate wdps installed on 64bit windows 7 pro
i have a need to build a website and several dlls that it references in an x86 configuration
to date we have been using web deployment projects to create zip files of the resultant site and all it s required files

draggable	droppable
in the callback this represents the droppable the draggable is dropped on
ui.draggable represents the draggable
so

2975148
int	chars	int	chars
if your problem is caused by tab chars preceding the int run the code through expand to turn tabs into spaces then your original expression will work
s int b int32_t b g should match those beginning of the line cases assuming by beginning of the line you mean the very first thing on the line
if your problem is caused by tab chars preceding the int run the code through expand to turn tabs into spaces then your original expression will work

versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade my gems and now have versioning 0.3.7 and 0.4.0 of i18n installed
rails of course wants to load and use the latest versioning which is causing errors in my project
i tried setting the gem versioning to 0.3.7 which gets around the errors in the web app

2975583
hex	binary
there are many tutorials on bitwise operators so i won t go into detail here
hex is just a representation of a number
whether you interpret the number as binary decimal hex octal etc is up to you

2975583
hex	binary	hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex	octal	decimal
whether you interpret the number as binary decimal hex octal etc is up to you
in c++ you have support for decimal hex and octal representations but they are all stored in the same way
example likely the file format wants you to store the files in normal binary format

2975583
hex	binary
example likely the file format wants you to store the files in normal binary format
i don t think the file format wants the hex numbers as a readable text string
if it does though then you could use std hex to do the conversion for you

2975583
hex	binary
don t confuse this though with actually storing binary digits as strings
likewise they will sometimes give a shortcut for this by specifying in hex how it should look
again most of the time they don t actually mean text strings

2975782
next	except
however whenever i try to access the request.session hash it s always empty except for immediately after setting the session
the above code will always show before session_id session_id f8db970260cb969156304a421036a8fb meaning that the session id is set whenever anything is added into the session hash but somehow gets reset before the next request
i don t see anything anywhere that should reset the session

2975784
equals	gethashcode
unless you override it equals uses reference equality - which means it only returns true if two objects are actually the same instance
you may override how equals works but then you must ensure that two objects that are equals also produce the same hash code
from a performance standpoint you may also want to provide an implementation of gethashcode that generates a good spread of values to reduce the frequency of hashcode collision

2975843
put	get
example or for a terminal-like look with black background
compile it by make and put it where ever you want
it would be great to get feedback
