of course make sure that you are store the result of the division in a double or float
it doesn t do you any good if you store the result in another int
regarding chad s comment don t pass a double or float to setintvalue when you have setdoublevalue etc

if this is for production code do not reinvent the wheel and find an existing library otherwise you risk spending 1000 lines of code to add 2+2
as many answers have already stated the issue is that you need a recursive parser with associativity rules because you can end up with expressions like and your parser needs to know that the parenthetic expressions are evaluated from the inside out the division takes precedence over multiplication you first divide then multiplying the result the multiplication takes precedence over addition subtraction as you can imagine writing a good parser is an art
the good thing is that there are several tools called parser generators which allow you to easily define the grammar of your language and the parsing rules

superobject	intraweb
to serve other client-types and support binary protocols you will need to look to external offerings
message data can be exchanged in json format which is supported by javascript and also available for delphi as open source implementations like superobject or lkjson
ajax ajax based rich internet applications for delphi can be built using intraweb or extpascal

super	extends
by extends the class you don t have to duplicate anything
in the method s you want to customize just add your customized code and then call parent method_name to execute the same method of the super class
you get all the benefits of both

versioning	upgrade
i was experiencing long delays with eclipse on a large php project before i upgrade to a dual core processor
first thing make sure that you have the latest versioning of eclipse
second you can turn off things like automatic building reporting problems as you type content assist and you can turn off the link with editor on the outline view to boost performance

however the memory shouldn t continue to grow if you re not adding to the code

post	get
for example i don t know how you are getting your pageurl variable but depending on how the user typed the url in their browser you may get different casings which could cause your regex to not find a match
i won t post a regex as others have good ones going but one thing that may be an issue is character case
regexs are by default case-sensitive

2976944
int	chars
this is only an example
you will need to build in some checks to ensure that you have one and only one where clause you must ensure that the int values are converted to string values correctly
you must also check that the parameters don t have any special chars that could break the dynamic sql - like an apostrophe using dynamic sql can be painful and very difficult to get right

dictionary	map
another thing you could do is process the string in c++ and do string substitution before you eval the code..
by providing the locals and globals dictionary you are providing the environment in which the evaled code is executed
that effectively provides you with an interface to map names to objects defined in the c++ app

2977440
for-loop	loops
on second thought maybe you put that do loops in there to cover the elements skipped the previous time around as mentioned in my third point
you have when it should be because your for-loop will change x to count and then exit without iterating at that value
there s no need to keep iterating the same inner listbox looking for duplicates is there

hex	binary
accessed and modified times though would be unsettable from within the notes domino environment since the changes you make would be overwritten by the process of saving the changes
if you have a flair for adventure and a need to run with scissors you could make the changes in the database file itself either programmatically from an external application or manually with a hex editor
editing the binary will work -- folks have been using hex editors to clear the hide design flag safely for years

2977745
cdr	cons
i can think of at least one implementation of lisp i was learning in which nil lisp s null was not 0 nor was it an invalid address but a real object
the reason was very clever - the standard required that car nil nil and cdr nil nil note car l returns pointer to the head first element of a list where cdr l returns ptr to the tail rest of the list.
so instead of adding if-checks in car and cdr whether the pointer is nil - which will slow every call - they just allocated a cons think list and assigned its head and tail to point to itself

2977770
hex	binary
blobproperty should be used to store binary data str objects while textproperty should be used to store any textual data unicode or str objects
note that if you store a str in a textproperty it must only contain ascii bytes less than hex 80 or decimal 128 unlike blobproperty
both of these properties are derived from unindexedproperty as you can see in the source

factors	mean
having a model which could be any template image you can measure the correlation of the template with any section of the frame
the result is a probability factors which determine the correlation of the samples with the template one
it is especially applicable to 2d cases. it has the advantage to be independent from the sample absolute value since the result is dependent on the covariance related with the mean of the samples

2978033
factors	mean
it is especially applicable to 2d cases. it has the advantage to be independent from the sample absolute value since the result is dependent on the covariance related with the mean of the samples
once you detect an high probability you can track the successive frames in the neightboor of the original position and select the best correlation factors
however the size and the rotation of the template matter but this is not the case as i can understand

folder	directory
even if i do a direct_to_template on two-column-base.html which extends base.html i get that error
the extranet pages all work perfectly but those templates all live inside the extranet folder and inherit from extranet base.html
possible issues i ve checked file permissions on the server are fine the template directory is correct on the live box i m using os.path.dirname os.path.realpath __file__ to make things work across machines files exist and the templates directory exactly match my local copy removing the extends block from the top of any broken template causes the templates to render without a problem manually starting a shell session and calling get_template on any of the files works but trying to render it blows up with the same exception on any of the extended templates

put	get
if the initial size was 4k that would allow up to 64 files
once you put more than 64 files into the directory it would have to be expanded
as for your comment the reason why it may not get smaller when you delete all the files in it is because there s usually no real advantage

2980103
put	get
as for your comment the reason why it may not get smaller when you delete all the files in it is because there s usually no real advantage
it s just left at the same size so that it doesn t have to be expanded again next time you put a bucketload of files in there it tends to assume that past behaviour is an indicator of future behaviour
if you want to reduce the space taken there s an old trick for doing that

2980313
put	get
assuming that you select images by the database key as identifier use this in your html create a servlet class which is mapped in web.xml on an url-pattern of and implement its doget method as follows. in the imagedao#find you can use resultset#getbinarystream to get the image as an inputstream from the database
for best performance and efficiency don t put the entire content in
each byte eats yes one byte from java s memory

2980486
int	chars
if the string contains only chars which do exist in ascii then there is nothing you need to do because the string is already in the ascii encoding utf-8 was specifically designed to be backwards-compatible with ascii in such a way that any chars which is in ascii has the exact same encoding in utf-8 as it has in ascii and that any chars which is not in ascii can never have an encoding which is valid ascii will always have an encoding which is illegal in ascii specifically any non-ascii chars will be encoded as a sequence of 2 ndash
4 octets all of which have their most significant bit set have an int value 127
instead of simply trying to convert the string you could try to transliterate the string

2980487
qtableview	qtabwidget
i assume it is breaking a list of items into separate pages
normally this is done by using one of the view classes qlistview or qtableview to take care of much of the legwork it s called a scrollbar not to mention the collapsing folders concept from file managers
another method is splitting the information across several tab pages qtabwidget where each page displays a view of some sort perhaps qtextview or one of the m v or item view classes

2980752
post	get	post	put
if you re already writing java i d put a servlet in between
it can handle get and post requests but there are other benefits as well you can have some measure of security because the servlet can ask for credentials and only allow authenticated users to access the database
you can even add role based security to allow authorized users to do certain things only admins write to the database

stringbuilder	stringwriter	stringbuilder	printwriter
i mean i know how to use them but i ve always used stringbuilder
the stringbuilder method seems much more natural to me but is it just style
this is the idiom i ve seen and used many many times string assembly by stringbuilder and this is the new idiom string assembly by stringwriter and printwriter edit it appears that there is no concrete reason to prefer one over the other so i ve accepted the answer which best matches my understanding and +1ed all the other answers

2980852
stringbuilder	stringwriter
for a start a stringwriter uses a stringbuilder stringbuffer under the hood to hold the characters written to the stream
stylistically the stringbuilder approach is cleaner
it is fewer lines of code and is using a class that was specifically designed for the purpose of building strings

2980852
stringbuilder	stringwriter
the best way to answer that would be to benchmark the two alternatives
but there are some clear pointers that stringbuilder should be faster

scrapy has its own libxml2 bindings i haven t looked at them to test them though skimming the scrapy documentation didn t leave me very impressed i ve done lots of scraping just using these parsers and manual coding
with any of these you get a truly superior html parser querying via xpath and with lxml.html and pyquery also built on lxml you get css selectors
if you are doing a small job scraping a forum i d skip a scraping framework and just do it by hand -- it s easy and parallelizing etc is not really needed

if there s not an out-of-the-box provider that does what you need you can extends one without having to start from scratch so it would be pretty exception circumstances indeed that prevent you from using it

tabcontrol	tabitem
now i have that complex wpf control that i want to use as a part of one of those datatemplates
if i use usual textbox i can simply bind to its text property but i can t do the same with text property of that custom control simply because its text property is not a dependency property. in this scenario i have no direct access to the control itself nor to its events no code behind file that i can use to do that kind of thing i can see however a dirty solution - in the window class i would have to subscribe to collectionchanged event of the collection that is bound to the tabcontrol
whenever an item is added to that collection use itemcontainergenerator to obtain a copy of i suppose tabitem and use it to find the right copy of complex control regiter items handlers to complex controls events to do the job this is wrong because this is agains mvvm - i have to play with tab control to do the job instead of doing it in the viewmodel class this couples in an unwanted way the view and viewmodel

when you write 1 in c c++ it -automatically- be translated to the corresponding ascii 49 that is how 1 is actually represented in c c++

1 is a chars whose ascii equals 49 which means is false

uiview	subviews	uiview	subviews
instead the piece should be a subclass of uiview which adds the image as a subviews to itself when it is init ed with a frame you add it as a subviews to self because self inherits from uiview
thus self is a uiview
then just add the piece as a subviews of your controller s view

2983004
disk	ram
that means that the slowest part of the process is reading the csv file from the disk and writing the mysql database back to the disk
disk access is much slower than pretty much anything else that goes on inside the computer so your cpu probably only needs a few percent usage to keep up with it
also mysql is copying the data in a piece at a time not all at once so it only needs to store a little bit at a time in ram

2983059
x86	64bit
found this very helpful for 64bit assembly
on x86 osx the stack needs to be 16 byte aligned for function calls see abi doc here
so the explanation is push stack pointer #1 -4 strange increment #3 -20 push argument #4 -4 call pushes return address #5 -4 total -32 to check change line #3 from 20 to 4 which also works

2983133
free	malloc
or 3 return a pointer to a dynamically allocated instance of a packnode allocated with malloc
this then requires that the caller of recursivefind call free on the returned pointer at some later point when it s no longer needed
likewise this code is also wrong you need to allocate l_clone and r_clone on the heap not on the stack because again as soon as this function returns those node pointers will no longer be valid

innodb	myisam
this means that typical update statements look something like these ...this is very efficient and works even if another client has changed the values in the pay_back column

this railscast explains more
you can add a counter cache to the comment model and a couple of named scopes to the post model

accessor	properties
once you change the properties s type from nsmutablearray to nsarray the above code should give a warning since only nsmutablearrays respond to setarray
the code will still work presuming the subconditions accessor returns the mutable array and not an autoreleased copy but the compiler will give a warning about it. with mutating the array off the table the problem becomes how to enable the condition class to supply a copy of a condition instance with a copied array of copied sub-conditions while not allowing other classes to do it
one solution is to simply store the new array directly into the copy s instance variable

this might not solve your problem completely but hopefully it should get you started

versioning	upgrade
you may want to try increasing your versioning number to force an upgrade
if the database itself exists then the oncreate method won t be called - increasing the versioning will force onupgrade to be called and your implementation drops the table and recreates it
this should either fix your error or give you a new error to work with

2986804
ubuntu	centos
to modify apparmor to allow mysql to access data do the follow sudo gedit etc apparmor.d usr.sbin.mysqld add this line anywhere in the list of directories data rw then do a sudo etc init.d apparmor restart another option is to disable apparmor for mysql altogether this is not recommended sudo mv etc apparmor.d usr.sbin.mysqld etc apparmor.d disable don t forget to restart apparmor sudo etc init.d apparmor restart
ubuntu uses apparmor and that is whats preventing you from accessing data
fedora uses selinux and that would prevent this on a rhel fedora centos machine

2986822
filesystems	hfs+
there really is no reason to have foo.c and foo.c being different things
stop using a case insensitive filesystems
you can format hfs+ volumes to be case-insensitive on mac os x although adobe creative suite and world of warcraft will moan about it

2986822
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you can format hfs+ volumes to be case-insensitive on mac os x although adobe creative suite and world of warcraft will moan about it
check it out onto a dmg file formatted with case-sensitive hfs+
create it in disk utility or with a command like this hdiutil create -size 100m -fs case-sensitive hfs+ -volname casesensitive casesensitive.dmg a slightly hare-brained idea use git svn and write some hooks that d automatically translate the file names where the case sensitivity is an issue into a modified filename that follows a particular standard when you check-out and then checks them back in again with the right filename

2986861
inject	interceptor
i do not know how to use this kind of funcionality
seam inject the identity object from the sessioncontext of the servlet that invokes the ejb and removes it after the call
yes but do not forget you must enable ejb seam interceptor see here how to .

2986966
submit	submission
1 idea could be getting rails to pass back the authenticity token after authentication but i do not know how to access it from the controller 1 not logined user sees form 2 not logined user types in message and submit 3 facebox asking for authentication 4 after authentication submit form automatically without refreshing 5 but authenticity token is needed for form submission which is not there yet
i wish to authenticate a user without having the page reloaded and having the user submit a given form
however the problem that i immediately run into here is that the authenticity token typically gets set when the page is reloaded

2986981
inherited	properties
there are two completely different types of inheritance inheritance of interface
it is when you do implement in java or other languages that have interfaces as standalone entities it is also happens when you publically inherited from an empty abstract class in c++
here you don t care about code at all but want to tell your compiler and everyone using you base derived classes that this derived class is a special kind of you base class it has all the properties of base class it behaves exactly as base class does to the extent visible by the user of it and can be used instead of the base class in any algorithms

2986981

inherited of the code
you have a piece of code in base class that you want to reuse in your derived class

2987092
hide	show
i found the conflict
when presenting the modal i also hide the navigation bar
the navigation bar natively animates the table view up and down as it show and hides

2987136
put	get
you can get that file in stream and manipulate it any which way you like - but not artibitrarily
it will not be recognized as valid docx if you put things in the wrong places not just xml elements but also files in the folders inside the zip file
but if you re just talking artibitrary meaning customxmlpart then that s okay

2987322
jar	war
basically the annotation scanner only consults the war s web-inf classes .class files for annotations assuming you have a faces-config.xml in web-inf
if you keep your code in separate jar files and want your .class files you have in web-inf lib .jar files to be scanned for annotations you must have a faces-config.xml in that jar s meta-inf folder
the faces-config.xml you plop into your jar can be empty it just needs to be there or else the annotation scanner will passover your jar like it was leftover meatloaf

2987339
firefox	safari
in webkit browsers i tested both chrome and safari the overflow hidden cuts the text outside the border
firefox just renders text outside the border
i also tried this without overflow hidden

2987555
testdriven.net	xunit.net
resharper gives you the run unit tests context menu in the solution explorer you are referring to
an alternative for visualstudio integration is testdriven.net also providing a context menu
for nunit you can also use the runners that come with nunit itself there is a gui-runner and a commandline runner . for mstest you can use the native visualstudio integration for running tests however i find that one a bit clumsy . xunit.net also comes with its runners however i am not familiar with them

2987788
interpolation	splines
it will require some more maths but the above idea can still be applied
here is some java-ish pseudocode giving a solution using linear interpolation between points
you might also want to consider splines interpolation which could be more accurate

2987792
google-chrome	firefox
we have one laptop on which ie8 loads the page like firefox google-chrome and we ve been searching for a setting on ie8 to indicate that it doesn t have to wait until all javascript is executed before showing the page or part of it
we checked that the google-chrome frame for internet explorer is not installed
update for more clarification as thariama points out in the comments i also thought that ie8 always waits to render the entire page but seeing this laptop render it i am pretty sure that it loads the firefox-way

2987945
listview	gridview
also the listview control is a very good alternative to the gridview as it provides many of the databinding selection paging sorting modifying features of the gridview see here but gives full control over the output template
here is a good series of articles on the listview although i am a strong advocate of using asp.net mvc there is a considerable learning curve required to do this and the change in mindset required to work properly in the mvc way should not be underestimated


2987947
multiplying	division
but the compiler still optimises the division to a sequence of shifts and additions
the most obvious difference though is that this pair don t do the same thing - shifting by four is equivalent to multiplying by sixteen not eight
you probably would not get a bug from this if you let the compiler sweat the small optimisations for you

2987978
nsdata	nserror
you can use the synchronous method or the asynchronous ones
these are harder to setup as you have to append all the bits of data you get into the 1 nsdata but the end result is the same
regardless of if you use the synchronous or asynchronous methods if you get a nserror object then there was a comms error

2988108
post	get
then all properties of the object get invalidated
see my post here


2988111
installation	upgrade
interestingly they call this an amnesty - almost implying we are criminals for not upgrading cf oed
i have received an e-mail from flexera containing the following statement we understand that many of our customers still using installshield 12 maybe having difficulties sending installation to windows 7 desktops 64 bit servers or r2 2008
therefore we would like to provide this opportunity for you to erase these potential current problems and upgrade despite installshield 12 being end of life d some time ago. we have not had any problems ourselves

2988473
equals	charat
public static boolean samepattern string s1 string s2 it returns true if strings are of the same pattern. it must be recursive not use any loops static or global variables
also it s prohibited to use the method equals in the string class
can use local variables and method overloading. can use only these methods charat i substring i substring i j length

2988536
maven	m2e
or b on the command line run mvn eclipse eclipse from inside the project directory and then just import the project as an existing eclipse project i prefer m2e because it makes eclipse maven-savvy but many others prefer to just tell eclipse where stuff is from the outside using the command line
first you need to install maven
download it put it somewhere and set the environment variables java_home and maven_home

2988747
nsstring	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
is there a hidden place in the documentation that indeed lists nsdata for binary stuff
the documentation says that core data properties can only store nsstring nsnumber and nsdate types
however a lot of core data users claim core data could also store an nsdata type

2988947
put	get
however i dont know if it populates stockitem.prices with a single object correctly as as soon as i reference that property nhibernate performs a lazy load of all the office s prices
also even if it does work it feels really crufty having to access the price by using what i would really like is to have a price field on the stockitem object and have the price of the item put into that field by nhibernate
i ve tried adding .createcriteria price stockitemprice.price and the same with createalias but i get the error nhibernate.queryexception could not resolve property price of stockitem which makes sense i guess as price isn t a mapped property

2989008
sorting	filtering
what i would like to do is get all the offers and their latest status
for each status there s a table field named added which can be used for sorting
i know this can be easily done with two queries but i need to make it with only one because i also have to apply some filtering later in the project

2989144
equals	tostring
as tom hawtin suggests you could implement the methods yourself returns the same values as the other approach for the methods declared in parameterizedtype
the result of the first approach even equals this type
however this approach does not override tostring equals and so on so depending on your needs the first approach might still be better.

2989149
put	get
data access in order to get ingredients components of a recipe just do
i think you got the right answer with a through table model you can put unit of quantity gram kilo tablespoon etc on ingredient level but i think it is better on ingredients level for example you can have 1 recipe with 10 cl of milk but one other with 1l .
so different units for a same ingredient

2989245
prepare	execute

filtering	grouping	filtering	grouping
total.value alternatively it might be more efficient to rewrite the report to use a single table grouping by reportview with footers containing sums of total at both grouping footer and table footer level
if you have a table-level filtering on each table the simplest approach might be to add a third table with no table-level filtering with a table footer row only containing just sum fields
total.value alternatively it might be more efficient to rewrite the report to use a single table grouping by reportview with footers containing sums of total at both grouping footer and table footer level

2989428
filesystems	hfs+
it is possible to use case sensitive file systems on mac os x including a case sensitive variant of hfs+
from here on i will assume a case insensitive filesystems
the mv command on mac os x can handle case-change-only renames in a single step

to make this work with firefox you should use the ogg format

2989697
client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
you should have all your validation logic on the server-side in php

what you can t do is have multiple people committing directly from a shared working directory
however push pull and clone are safe to use to a shared folder from a user s personal repository
all changes end up effectively atomic and no aborted work should cause anyone any problems

post	get
you can get all media for a post using get_children like so
when a user is writing a post and proceeds to upload media that media is automatically attached to the current post
however unless the user chooses to insert gallery the media will not appear within the post but it is still associated with the post

installation	upgrade	installation	upgrade
if you have time to evaluate whether the upgrade it worth your while i d suggest starting with the release notes search for installshield 20xx release notes with xx as 08 09 and 10 so far
don t get me wrong there are several other improvements to consider since is12 but especially if you are creating .msi installation you can probably continue to use is12
in fact if you are creating patches you should continue to use the same version of is that the base used until you can hop a major upgrade

queue	fifo
you say you want contiguous memory - i assume then that you want to grab a chunk of memory and work entirely within that memory rather than allocating more fragments over time
now simplest case withing that is a queue implemented over ring-buffer within your memory chunk
i assume that you want something better as you don t have fifo happening here

converter	multibinding
convert has the following signature
if you want your value converter to be able to access the datacontext you may want to use converterparameter instead the datacontext will then be passed on to your value converter as a parameter to your implementation of ivalueconverter.convert
you may be able to pass bindable parameters to your valueconverter if you implement imultivalueconverter and bind the parameters using the multibinding class in xaml the binding elements of the element are passed to the convert method of imultivalueconverter as the values parameter

filesystems	fat
you will have to write a pc application that takes data messages from the rabbit possibly over the serial interface other interfaces may be available and interpret these as instructions to display some text or formatting on the pc screen

pop-up	dialog
both controls are placed inside an updatepanel and the updatepanel is displayed as a pop-up dialog using a javascript library ext.basicdialog
the pop-up is a div on the page not a separate window. the problem is that when the user scrolls inside the pop-up the autocompleteextender shows its menu in the wrong place
it looks like it is taking the visible distance from the top of the popup and positioning the menu from the top of the inner html of the popup which is not visible we are using version 1.0.20229.20821 of the ajaxcontroltoolkit and we are targetting asp.net framework vewrsion 2.0

versioning	upgrade
if you need to run the code in onupgrade just increase your db_version variable
you should not have to manually check for the db versioning sqlite does this for you if done correctly
in your sqliteopenhelper inherited class in the constructor you should pass the db_version something like this then in your oncreate execute the create table and onupgrade do whatever you need to do to upgrade without checking the versioning this method will only get called when sqlite has already checked this for you

guice is a dependency injection framework others that could be used instead are spring or picocontainer

2993607
postgresql	mysql
but that would be a really bad idea what you need to understand is that times and dates are not stupid unformated numbers they are their own type with their own set of functions and operators so the mysql time essentially lets you treat now as a dumber type or it overrides + to make a presumption that i can t find in the mysql docs
eitherway you probably want to look at the date and interval types in postgresql

that s why the dynamic language runtime don t allow you to access properties from another assembly

an srpm would be somewhat useless to debian for instance
as for why you d use a package repository over building everything yourself well i don t know about you but i ve much rather just run i m using ubuntu so i have apt-get instead of yum # apt-get install firefox than trying to figure out all the dependencies as well as all the dependencies dependencies make sure i have the correct versions of everything download build install any that i don t have or are out of date if updating existing dependencies make sure the newer versions don t break any existing software that i have and make sure i don t end up with 15 different versions of the same thing and only after all that then download configure build install firefox
then realise i ll also want open office or mysql and start all over again

2994171
inherited	subclassing
this problem still exists with a builder object but at least your application can create a subclassing instantiate it and pass this object to anything that needs to create objects
but dependency injection is a better approach in this case. also there is no need for the repositories you build to inherited from anything they just need a tag indicating that they are repositories. and that s what our repository role does
you will want to add the api code here and any methods that should be reused

i m testing my gitignore filters as i go by running git status
however i have a larger number of untracked other files in a different subdirectory so git status shows all of those too which makes it very hard to see what the gitignore rules are doing
if the files were tracked then i could just do git status . and it would restrict the git-status output to only those files in the current directory but because the current directory and all its contents are untracked git status . returns error pathspec

swt	swing
i have always been a fan of the sheer amount of customization offered
swt is nice and is more native but you give up some power and control with that as well
in addition it seems simpler to use which can be a plus since swing can be overly complex due to its flexibility

post	get
one way around that would be to make a postinfo class with those fields then you can just set the favoritecount in the second query
when you delete the favoritecount in the earlier query the anonymous type that gets assigned to post doesn t have that field anymore
then in the second query you re creating another anonymous type that only has a favoritecount in it - so when you try to re-assign that to post you get an incompatible types error

if you just want a editor komodoedit is fine
i installed ipython console in gedit and do most of my simple scripting in it but gedit is a very simple editor so it ll not have some advance feature like an ide but if you want code exploring or auto completion i recommend a real ide like eclipse

ssl	https
in many corporate environments you ll have to authenticate with the proxy - this is almost always http basic authentication which is pretty easy - again see the rfcs
if your software can make an ssl connection on port 443 then you are 99 of the way there
typically http proxies are set up to proxy ssl-on-443 for the purposes of https

min	max

t k c k you should minimize sigma
n k 1 min s middot
t k c k max s middot

2995713
minimum	max
the ratio is zero if t k is 0 for all k min 0 c k max 0 c k 0 c k 0 it also approaches zero if s approaches zero similarly as above only it is the limit that is equal 0 s approaches infinity min c k max c k c k 0 the above equalities should have used limit notation... t k approaches infinity for all k each condition is enough on its own and represents the solution when combining them don t let s approach 0 while t k approach infinity or vice versa
in such case it matters which one approaches it faster edit4 actual solution well basically all of the above is giving answer to a wrong question because i was looking for maximum of the original goal function not the minimum
as for minimum it is a bit more interesting the minimum is reached if each term min s middot

i don t think even glib does this correctly i think only pango has something like that and of course boost.locale does this and correctly
and if you need to do this for european languages only just search for space or punctuation marks so std string find is more then fine
3 character or now code point counting looking at utfcpp thx characters are not code points for example a hebrew words shalom -- ש לו ם consists of 4 characters and 6 unicode points where two code points are used for vowels

for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
part of the arrays access can be move outside of loops it is possible that the server jit performs a similar code invariant movement the only way to find out is change and profile it
on the client jit this should improve performance no matter what. another thing you can try is to precalculate the for-loop exit conditions like this again the jit may already do this for you so profile if it helps
other things that could potentially improve speed at cost of readability inline sigmoid function manually the jit has a very tight limit for inlining and the function might be larger . it can be slightly faster to run a loops backwards where it doesnt change the outcome of course since testing loops index against zero is a little cheaper than checking against a local variable the innermost loops is a potentical candidate again but dont expect the output to be 100 identical in all cases since adding floats a + b + c is potentially not the same as a + c + b

filtering	grouping
i m guessing an effective grouping by method would do the trick postgres db backend but i can t seem to find any django functionality that supports it
i tried getting individual years from the database but i struggled to find a way of filtering datetime fields by just the year value
finally i tried adding the note_year property but because it s derived i can t filter those values

cobertura	emma
can t help you with emma though
i did similar thing with cobertura and jboss
you should just instrument all necessary classes after that it doesn t matter how many modules you have deployed

width	height
but now that i want to change my layout and have the gridview grow on its width instead of height as it grows bigger i am lost
i have tried to simply change the column width each time an item is added to the gridview
but no vertical scroll appears even though the items are added correctly

2997826
agile	sprint
you should first start doing retrospectives at the end of each iteration sprint if you use iterations - if not that should be step 0 - on the retrospective you look through what is going well not so well and what can should be improved
then pick the most pressing issue and think about how it can be improved - primarily using scrum but you may have a look at other agile or not solutions too if you feel the need to
the aim is to work out your own process which may be strict scrum or a hybrid - whatever works best for you in your specific situation

jtable	jeditorpane	jtable	jlabel	jtable	jtextpane
this is a nice feature of html
there are situations when the mighty jtable is too much
if you just want a jlabel jtextarea like component with some columns use a html-table in a jtextpane or in a jeditorpane there are some tweaks and tricks in this example which demonstrate how evil html really is

2997868
jlabel	jeditorpane	jlabel	jtextpane
if you just want a jlabel jtextarea like component with some columns use a html-table in a jtextpane or in a jeditorpane there are some tweaks and tricks in this example which demonstrate how evil html really is
- the trimming of spaces is utilized the second column is growing shrinking with the jdialog size because of the omitted width in its td-tag css margins have been thrown in for no special reason for a consistent appearance the font of the jlabel has to be fetched from the uimanager and set via css if you reduce the width of the jdialog the text in the second column is nicely word-wrapped ooh wait
this is a nice feature of html

2997996
qstring	qbytearray
this returns a qbytearray of which the number of bytes can be queried using size
i guess it is because qstring size returns the number of characters
if your text file is in utf16 and say x bytes long this will correspond with x 2 characters

2997996
qfile	qbytearray
if your text file is in utf16 and say x bytes long this will correspond with x 2 characters
edit if you want to know the exact size of a read line you can just use qfile readline
this returns a qbytearray of which the number of bytes can be queried using size

2998156
imperative	declarative	imperative	declarative
other stricter definitions entail that there may be no side-effects at all these languages are some times called purely declarative
the same result in an imperative style would be in this example we expressed no timeless static logical relationship between the input and the output we changed memory addresses manually until one of them held the desired result
it should be evident that all languages allow declarative semantics to some extend but not all allow imperative some purely declarative languages permit side effects and mutation altogether

2998156
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme
another approach is nondeterministic programming that really just specifies what conditions a result much meet before your implementation just goes to exhaust all paths on trial and error until it succeeds
purely declarative languages include haskell and pure prolog
a sliding scale from one and to the other would be pure prolog haskell ocaml scheme lisp python javascript c-- perl php c++ pascall c fortran assembly

2998296
sorting	grouping
use parallel.for if you can use net4
good question because this comes down to fastest way to sort an array of 9 elements and most comparisons between and analysis of sorting methods are about large n
i assume the grouping are clearly defined and don t play a real role here

2998497
packed-decimal	comp-3	packed-decimal	comp-3
this is equivalent to binary computational-3 or comp-3
this is equivalent to packed-decimal comp binary data items are generally the most efficient way to perform calculations on data items that represent integer values
comp-3 packed-decimal data items are used in cobol because they maintain a fixed number of decimal points

2998544
cpython	ironpython
they re all python implementations of the python language just like many superficially different book objects can all be bibles copies of the bible
if you re interested in cpython specifically it compiles the source files into a python-specific lower-level form known as bytecode does so automatically when needed when there is no bytecode file corresponding to a source file or the bytecode file is older than the source or compiled by a different python version usually saves the bytecode files to disk to avoid recompiling them in the future
otoh ironpython will typically compile to clr codes saving them to disk or not depending and jython to jvm codes saving them to disk or not -- it will use the .class extension if it does save them

2998544
cpython	ironpython
otoh ironpython will typically compile to clr codes saving them to disk or not depending and jython to jvm codes saving them to disk or not -- it will use the .class extension if it does save them
these lower level forms are then executed by appropriate virtual machines also known as interpreters -- the cpython vm the .net runtime the java vm aka jvm as appropriate
so in this sense what do typical implementations do python is an interpreted language if and only if c# and java are all of them have a typical implementation strategy of producing bytecode first then executing it via a vm interpreter

2998546
margin	height
from memory what you want would look like this it s not clear in your question if you want the line to span the text area or the whole paper height
depending on the case you have to replace topmargin and textheight by the correct values either 0pt or whatever your top margin is or by paperheight
see the geometry package if you don t already use it for how to control those dimensions

2998550
punctuation	words
a words character is a member of any of the unicode categories listed in the following table
ll letter lowercase lu letter uppercase lt letter titlecase lo letter other lm letter modifier nd number decimal digit pc punctuation connector this category includes ten characters the most commonly used of which is the lowline character _ u+005f

here is the problem my htaccess when i try to access the page advantix so address was www.mywebsite.com advantix i m being redirected to looking at the access log i have a suspicious 301 in the middle there is one important detail advantix is a directory
so if i comment that rule advantix goes to the folder and list the files
i don t want to reach the folder i want to reach with a call to advantix

128bit	64bit
to fix this i can use a big number library no problem
my method where sha256 is a secure hash function and randbigint is defined below as a non-crypto prng im giving it a 128bit seed so brute force shouldn t be a problem
and importantly does taking the 2 64 mod guarantee 100 i have a 64bit number

postgresql	mysql
start doing learn from it and then your questions become much more specific and a lot of things will make more sense
scribe thrift casandra unix linux shell perl python scripting postgresql mongodb non-relational nosql datastores jvm nginx those i would search on wikipedia for to get a quick overview
facebook is written in php mysql

i ended up using the swfobject setting wmode transparent which works fine in all browsers chrome safari ie except firefox
in firefox i can t click the flash buttons i tried to remove wmode transparent and of course i can click any button i need all browsers .
but this way i can t put my html content on top.

2998750
cpython	pypy
pypy compiles to pypy bytecode which then gets interpreted by the pypy vm until it identifies the hot code paths which it then compiles into native code jvml bytecode or cil bytecode depending on which platform you are running on
cpython compiles to cpython bytecode which it then interprets
stackless python compiles to cpython bytecode which it then interprets

2998952
std	ostream
instead when it flushes to the output device it restarts at the beginning so every flush wipes out all my accumulated output
converting to a more standard logging function is not desirable as there are over 1600 usages of std cout scattered throughout almost 60 files
i have considered overriding ostream s operator function but i m not sure if that will cover me since there are global operator functions that can t be overridden

post	get
so in short youll need to find a way to manage the threads yourself if there is a possibility of timing out and you want the thread to end
i think this post talks about it very well from the post you can t terminate an executing async delegate if it s not your thread but you can if it is
if you use the common begininvoke type methods you get a thread pool thread managed by the framework

inherited	subclassing

your desire to use static methods is getting in the way of using inherited properly
the base class in your example knows how to implement the functionality of the two subclassing

2999058
nfa	dfa
but note that every time we match an a we also enter the right half of the graph where we are in anti-accept states until we match any followed by a b
this is not a traditional nfa because traditional nfas don t have anti-accept states
however we can use the traditional nfa- dfa algorithm to convert this into a traditional dfa

maven	pom.xml
can i not provide all jars required by my sample project on local drive
i am novice to maven as well as to hibernate but want to learn both

2999228
salt	md5
best come up with your own one weave the salt and password to create a new string then hash as md5 password + salt is vulnerable to dictionary attack still
dynamically changing the salt is a lot more secure than having a one off static salt
also make the salts unique per user and not one global salt

2999261
cout	ofstream
for your teeing stream buffer you can get an inspiration from this page
you could write a custom stream buffer and attach it to cout with cout.rdbuf
your custom stream buffer would then tee the data to cout s original stream buffer and to a stream buffer stolen from an appropriate ofstream

ready	each
for example let s say that developer1 has been working on a project for the last 3 months and he s ready to merge all of his code into qa
however developer2 has been working on a different project for the last 2 months which is not ready to be merged
developer1 and developer2 s changes are not in any way dependent on each other but they are not separated into different folder structures and they each regularly do a get latest

2999613
integer	unsigned
this means that all one bits in an unsigned number is the maximum that data type int in your case can hold
the operation flips all bits from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 flipping a zero integer which has all zero bits effectively gives you uint_max
so he basically the previous coded opted to computer uint_max instead of using the system defined copy located in

textblock	itemscontrol
i have an application that renders an observablecollection of question objects
each question is rendered as a stackpanel that contains a textblock for the question verbiage and a textbox for the user to enter in an answer
the questions are rendered using an itemscontrol and i have initially set the style of the questions s stackpanel using a staticresource key called incorrectquestion defined in usercontrol.resources section of the page

2999640
folder	directory
however it extracted from the root c and not from the given in parameter folder
edit #2 it seems that batch script doesn t handle folder and file names containing a space character adequately
edit #3 i need it to be fully recursive since i don t know the directory structure against which this will be used

2999944
put	get
for example if i wanted to execute the logic in b.main i would have to first get an instance of b which is impossible
put another way why does c# allow an abstract class with only concrete members

post	get
i used edittext fields for the input a spinner widget for the service select and the button widget for the login
i know how to make the onclick and item select handlers for the button and spinner respectively but i can t figure out how to send that data via post in an intent that would then launch a browser
i can do an intent with the action url but can t get the post data to feed into it

qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
the problem is that all access to these objects is via a base qgraphicsitem pointer so the serialization code i have is horrible this is not good code imho
so instead i could create an abc class like this i can then add rect objects using qgraphicsscene additem new rect

post	put
in any case i hope this post proves helpful to someone else
ok i figured out what was happening and thought i d post it here in case anyone else experiences this kind of issue
using fiddler was the tool that put me on the right track

3000031
post	get
the only thing i still find odd is that if this setting was not high enough i would get a challenge response box asking for a login name for the first couple of attempts then the service would just come back with an unknown status code
in any case i hope this post proves helpful to someone else

pop-up	dialog
i want to pop-up a dialog box when a user checks the checkbox
however if they uncheck the box nothing should pop-up
also i need to use jquery live or livequery as the checkbox is not displayed on page load

3000555
readonly	temporary
one of the easiest ways to do this although you can t rely on it trying to copy and delete a temporary file to d e f g.
until you get an error this gives you the first readonly drive which often is the cd-rom drive
you should also think about asking the user for the drive letter or at least give him the possibility to define cdrom

3000665
client-side	server-side
a start would be to at least check that file or http are at the beginning of the url not as it is now anywhere within it
this is also only client-side validation meant to give the user instant feedback on the validation
you should have at least the same rules possible even stricter on the server-side as well

3000686
jboss	weblogic
it s not clear who is going to run the application and you can maybe make recommendations but the runtime is actually not your business also note that you may not benefit from support if you don t use the default provider if this matters
i know within jboss the provider is hibernate so it probably doesn t matter
however i think the provider within weblogic is eclipselink

3000686
glassfish	weblogic
however i think the provider within weblogic is eclipselink
i have no idea what the provider websphere or glassfish use but i have seen detailed instructions on how to use hibernate as the provider within those application servers
first of all keep in mind that jpa 2.0 is part of java ee 6 and that glassfish v3 is the only one java ee 6 container at this time

3000789
wmv	ogg
update i haven t used this but i think you need an encoder but i couldn t find one for ogg vorbis
i think you could try encoding to the wmv format as well update 2 sorry my knowledge level of streaming is pretty low
if i were doing something like what you re doing i would create an uncompressed avi file from the audio and the still images using avifil32.dll methods via pinvoke first then compress it to mpeg or whatever format is standard - youtube has a page where they talk about their preferred formats and it s probably good to use one of these

3000835
inherited	properties
is there a way for it to work in both situations
i have a class mycontroller that inherited from controller so all my controllers inherited from mycontroller
i have a properties in mycontroller if i set this properties in mycontroller s onexecuting method my htmlhelper extension method works fine it doesn t work if i set someproperty in my controllers action method

3000907
stdout	stderr	stdout	stderr
the code looks something like this when i run that wget command directly from the command-line and redirect stderr to a file something sane happens - the stdout will be the downloaded page the stderr will contain the info about opening the given page
when i run wget via open3 i m getting both the page and the info mixed together in stdout
what i expect is the loaded page in one stream and stderr from wget in another

3001091
qobject	qtreewidgetitem
see if qtreewidgetitem can be linked to a parent widget which seems so reading qt docs items are usually constructed with a parent that is either a qtreewidget for top-level items or a qtreewidgetitem for items on lower levels of the tree
many qt class instances can be constructed with a parent qobject
this parent controls the life time of the constructed child

3001207
int	chars
if you do something like and enter a chars the streams error state is set and any subsequent try to read from the stream will fail unless you reset the error state first
you should read a string instead and convert the strings contents to int


3001262
post	get
what i would like to happen is the iframe to load the result of that request
so i would effectively like to post a form and render the result inside the iframe without touching the parent apart from putting the iframe up for display in the first place
i am using the code from this answer javascript post request like a form submit but i can t get it to not reload the parent

3001262
post	get
i am using the code from this answer javascript post request like a form submit but i can t get it to not reload the parent
i post the form and instead of the iframe refreshing the entire parent refreshes
i don t know why that is since the url it s posting to is different and would at least redirect there

g++	gcc
this works not problem g++ test.cpp
# works this does not work because of missing symbols g++ -c test.cpp ld -o test crti.o crtbegin.o test.o crtend.o crtn.o -lgcc -lc -lstdc++
also if there is a better way to make configuring ld to using the default gcc linking

3001311
put	get
the asp.net framework serialisation is correctly serialising the string response
put another way if your function was you would not be surprised if the output was it just happens that response has double quotes that need to be escaped
you obviously just want to get at the object

3001414
inherited	subclassing
this is what the documentation has to say about it field names that start with an underscore character are made private to the class and are not visible to subclassing
inherited fields can be overridden but will generate a warning if used together with the -w switch
this is not consistent with its actual behavior according to my test below

strncpy	strtok
typically you d use something like note that you did have pretty much the right idea using memcpy though
strncpy for an obvious example is not really the right thing to use for this or almost any other purpose
on the list of standard library functions to avoid strncpy comes second on the list behind only gets though in fairness i have to point out that strtok is a close third

3001607
versioning	upgrade
from sql you can export the initial schema
from here you will need a mechanism to track changes using a nice tool like sql compare and then track the schema changes and match to an update in versioning number in the target database
we keep each delta in a separate folder beneath the upgrade utility we built

3001612
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strcpy
if you don t want to handle 0 manually use strcpy or strncpy instead
if you want to use memcpy to copy strings you must set the character 0 manually after the last character of the string
if you don t want to handle 0 manually use strcpy or strncpy instead

agile	sprint
tuesday and thursday were spent removing the functionality
i would suggest you start adopting practices from agile
scheduling a short sprint period could help with changing priorites

3001995
int	boolean
its basically a boolean expression that involves the sign of both operands as well as the result in java its simpler to apply the expression in the if to the entire 32 bits and check the result using 0 this will effectively test the sign bit
the principle works exactly the same for all int primitive types changing all declarations in above method to long makes it work for long
first some logical thinking reveals that an overflow can only occur if the signs of both arguments are the same

3001995
range	infinity
now if both arguments are negative their sum can never be closer to zero than any of the arguments the sum must be closer to minus infinity
the most extreme value we can produce is min_value + min_value which again for byte example shows that for any in range value -1 to -128 the sign bit is set while any possible overflowing value -129 to -256 has the sign bit cleared
so the sign of the result again reveals the overflow condition

3002007
post	get
and you ll need to set the responseformat to json as tomasr already pointed out
if you want to use the post verb as in you will need to markup your method with

google-chrome	firefox
if i set the response s content type to text plain all browsers but google-chrome will accept it and pass it to my js with no problem
however google-chrome will wrap the response in before passing it to my javascript
if i set the response s content type to the proper application json all browsers but firefox will accept it and pass it to my js with no problem

fflush	gets	fflush	gets
if autoflush is true i think it gets flushed on close anyway but it might be worth a shot
you can try to fflush the stream before closing

subtraction	add
for a detailed description of what s going on when you add subtract pointers see
the line does pointer subtraction giving the number of char s separating s2 from s1
this result is then converted to a bool by converting to false if and only if the result is 0 otherwise converting to true

it may help to draw the tree 6 4 8 1 5 9 then write out the three traversals now put down the computer get out a pen paper and think about the problem imagine this call stack the new root is printed on the left good luck
here s a few hints the last element in the postorder subarray is your new preorder root
the inorder array can be split in two on either side of the new preorder root

range	min
24 hrs day 60 min hr 60 sec min 86400 sec day
there are two main concepts you need to be aware of how to format the dates and how to convert the dates into numbers for the axis range and data values
core plot provides a cptimeformatter class that takes care of the formatting

3002805
inherited	subclassing
this is based roughly on the scala implementation of these lists in particular the idea of using inherited and a nillist subclassing rather than using null pointers
one could create a list of cons-cells using temporaries const references and inherited
but you d have to be very careful not to keep any references to it beyond its lifetime

3003014
post	get
and make sure you add the list method to routes ex map.resources post collection list get map.resources events collection list get map.resources comments collection list get this is a one way i can think of hope this helps cheers sameera
you can do something like this first create 3 methods to display events post and comments
you might create an action like list and pass the number of days to select ex will return a list of comments for last 10 days and in your home page you can render them as components render_component controller post action list id 10 like wise.

3003198
width	height
next previous i would suggest adding the following tags somewhere outside of your list styled any way you d like then you can easily bind a handler to the click event of each to find the link corresponding with the new tab to display and in turn trigger its click event
width of anchor anchors are by default displayed as inline elements
an inline element will only be given the minimum amount of height and width necessary to display its contents

3003284
inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
your first example of course works because mymixin is not derived from list ...but it is derived from object like every modern-style python class so the second example cannot work quite independently from mymixin having a custom metaclass
it s not a custom-metaclass problem though it s diagnosed at metaclass stage and the problem s just the same as this one can t multiply inherited from a base class followed by a derived class -- it s impossible to define a consistent mro that satisfies the usual mro constraints guarantees
fortunately you don t want to do that -- the subclassing presumably overrides some method of the base class that s what normal subclassing do

the this reference in the context of an animal will thus always refer to a dog or a cat or whatever but in all cases it refers to some animal
- as the example below illustrates the this reference makes sense even in an abstract-class prints constructing an animal constructing a dog bark
my name is woffy update the this reference refers to the same object in the superclass as in the sub class

django	web2py
as stated in the book an url of the form maps to application folder a controller file c.py function f and the additional arguments must be unpacked from the request object as furthermore web2py specifically detects valid controller functions as those functions that have no arguments
afaicr this is opposite to django which detects valid controller functions as those that have at least one argument

i get this error usually when an application running under tomcat is missing the log4j.xml or log4j.properties or alternatively missing a required jar
if you are deploying an application make sure that there is at least a log4j.properties file the web applications web-inf classes folder or log4j.xml if you are using xml config
make sure that the log4j.jar file and perhaps commons-logging.jar file are in web-inf lib directory

my code goes like this the errors come up wherever such an elevated code is used and more often when there are more users who use these functionalities so i guess perhaps the elevated spsite is getting cached and reused

some alternative options create a general project in eclipse and instead of using default location explicitly specify one

opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and internet explorer have no plans to support websql they want to implement indexeddb for firefox 4 and ie9
google-chrome is busy implementing it to i m sure opera and safari will follow suit
currently all html5 capable browsers and some ie versions support localstorage which is a simple key value database that can only store strings so if you need more structured storage capabilities you ll have to wait until the end of this year approx for broad indexeddb support

from the manual to use php s curl support you must also compile php --with-curl dir where dir is the location of the directory containing the lib and include directory
in the include directory there should be a folder named curl which should contain the easy.h and curl.h files
there should be a file named libcurl.a located in the lib directory

children	parent
all these 5 entities are mapped to stored procedures for performing insert update and delete
before mapping the stored procedures the order of insert queries issued by entity framework was correct - first main table s insert query is issued then the insert query for first level children is issued and finally the insert query for second level child is issued
but after mapping the stored procedures entity framework is sending the execute stored procedure statements in wrong order - first main table s insert stored procedure followed by insert stored procedures for 2 first level children which are not parent of second level child then second level child stored procedure s for multiple records and finally the insert stored procedure of remaining first level child which is parent of second level child

mouseleave	mouseenter
i think a combination of two techniques might work put the control on a panel docked to fill and use the mouseenter of the panel to turn on your behavior -- this will include the control s scrollbar
you can use the mouseleave event of the panel as well but you ll have to check the cursor s position to ensure it hasn t moved into the contained control
this method is mostly reliable but moving the mouse quickly can confuse it

your understanding of access modifiers is correct
public members are visible outside of the class while private members are not
protected members are visible to classes deriving from that class

3008065
maven	pom.xml
the documentation for the pom.xml 1 has resources listed under elements in the pom.xml that are merged
some experimentation on my local poms against maven 2.2.1 don t appear to exhibit that behavior
what i see is it looks like is inherited by child projects in a multi-module build but that if any of those projects have their own block it replaces the parent not merged

3008335

second the http-builder module also depends on about 19 other packages including the org.apache.http.client.methods.httprequestbase that is referenced in the error message

uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
update in order to assign the uisegmentedcontrol 1 as a right button you have to wrap it inside a uibutton sample code taken from the navbar sample application
you can use a uisegmentedcontrol with two buttons and configure it with the momentary property set to yes
this is what is used in the mail application to go to next previous message

3008578
children	parent	children	parent
the rows need to be updated in order from the deepest child up to the root parent
this is because tablea.cola must contain an up-to-date concatenation of its own current value with the values of its children i realize this query only concats with one child but that is for the sake of simplicity - the purpose of the example in this question does not necessitate any more verbosity therefore the query must update from the bottom up
the solution suggested in the question i noted above is as follows the reason that i don t think i can use this solution is because i am referencing column values from the parent table inside my subquery see and i don t think two sibling subqueries would have access to each others data

implements	extends
you are therefore allowed to do multiple unions
when you eventually get to a class that implements one or more interfaces the semantics here are merely that the class must provide implementations for all the methods in the set
a class implementing multiple interfaces could be rewritten as a class implementing a single interface that extends all the above interfaces

3008801
width	height
you also could restrict the resize process so that in all cases scale by width is done
then to change the size of the image the user always has to change its width
the height will always be adjusted automatically

post	get
if all you get is one row s worth of data then you ll have to debug your form because that s where the problem is
well here s some things to fix with your script 1 you do a query to check if there s anything to post but do it by fetching all the matching rows then throwing away the results
even though you have a limit 1 on the initial query you still force mysql to process the entire result set with the order by directive

i m using jquery.ajax to make a put request to a rest web service but seeing some really strange serialization behavior

margin	height
the easiest is to remove the absolute positioning from the #content-container
that will allow the margin 0 auto to center the div
in order to fix the issue with the vertical movement when you hover over the menu which i suspect is why you made it absolute positioned just set the height of the menu div 100px seems like enough but you can play with it

hash	salt
in order make such an attack more difficult you should use static and dynamic salt
when you hash a password multiple times you actually increase the chance of hash collisions so best practice is to hash only once
it also has nothing to do with how easy it will be to perform a brute-force attack

3010340
ready	each
if i remember correctly that ldapsearch command will give you the full ldif entry for each uid in the testgroup cn
if that s the case then you ll need to clean it up a bit before it s ready for the als part
though it s definitely not the most elegant solution a quick and dirty method is to use backticks and run the command s output through a grep

hash	salt	hash	md5
he must calculate the hash of each word with each of 2 32 4 294 967 296 possible salt appended until a match is found. the total number of possible inputs can be obtained by multiplying the number of words in the dictionary with the number of possible salt
first not encryption creating message digest using the hash functions
your question but can t you just encrypt hash your password using say md5 and then say sha-1 or any other doesn t matter. if the hash function does not provide any of these properties it does not matter how many times you hashed also the attacker can hash n times to get the collisions

you can test this at in the search bar of the live store on the page type some text then highlight it all and don t let up on the mouse until you are outside the store
i finally hacked some junk together so i can tell if the mouse goes off the stage using some code like i d like to just make the textinput stop thinking it should be highlighting text so that even if the user scrolls out of the applet and mouses up that the text input still overwrites what is in the search bar and functions as normal
i can t seem to find any events or ways to tell the flex textfield to stop thinking that the mouse is down and that the user is done selecting text

use server-side validation to prevent invalid values from being set on your properties or handle the conversion errors appropriately

however using django s modelforms and templates - it is easy to create your own crud application - if you can t do what you need in the admin interface
as far as python frameworks go i personally prefer django over turbogears or pylons which i believe also have admin interfaces because it seems much simpler to get installed setup and running

3011368

the latter extends the former and that s why it can generate an iterator as well but it s perfectly reasonably for an iterable not to be a collection
in fact there are even a few java classes which implements iterable but not collection

subsequent merge or rebases will not have to revisit these decisions - at which point recollection may not be as accurate

the kernel program ihex2fw called from makefile in kernel_source lib firmware on .hex files converts these hex files to an arbitrary-designed binary format that the linux kernel then picks up with request_ihex_firmware because they thought reading text files in the kernel was silly it would slow things down

i fixed it like this last but not least using objectdataprovider never worked as well only through x static this was driving me totally crazy for a few days as it s not so hard to bind data

folder	directory
permissions were wrong on the web directory where the extension was stored fixed this and it installed manually and automatically
everytime i rebuild the extension and save to my web serving folder i have to set the permissions
2nd edit if you want to look at an existing extension download it or get it from your safari extensions folder then change the .safariextz to .xar then open extract with pacifist to view the code and if you want add it to the extension builder app

spweb	spsite
you should pass the site id and web url to the new thread and recreate the spweb object there
sputility.sendemail uses an spweb parameter which is not thread-safe
spsite spweb objects are actually thread-specific so you shouldn t pass them from one thread to another

fortunately the same techniques work to get multiple lines.
now you have an array with if you then want to output it all separated by spaces you can do of course if that s really the ultimate goal you could also just replace commas with spaces edit your original post didn t have your intended output in a code block so i thought you were after spaces

of course it s hard for me to give a good solution since i don t know the drivers behind the decision to use crystal reports but if you are looking to display the data in a web page adobe has a pdf to html converter here that you may be able to start off with
you put the url to the pdf form and it converts it to html or text
i tried it and thought it did work it wasn t really close in the look and feel of the original pdf form so you can use it to get you part of the way and then you can wire up the data portion to display your data

template-haskell	type-families
ghci s info doesn t seem to work as nicely with type-families and data-families as it does with plain types one can always look for the instance in the source code but sometimes it could be hard to find it and it may be hidden in template-haskell generated code etc
code example what s going on in the code example above is that template-haskell is generating code for us here
all the extensions above except for quasiquotes are required because the generated code uses them

inherited	subclassing
however in f# it is usually recomended to use subclassing inherited only when there is a really good reason for that you need to implement some virtual class and pass it to a .net library
if i was implementing your example i would probably prefer function returning idisposable using a simple object expression to some point this is just a personal preference but i think it is a preferred option because it is simpler than using inherited although i don t have any document to link here -
also the compiled code may be a bit simpler because handling as this may require some runtime checks

note that changing the client defaults will change the client behavior for access to all svn repositories so it s a good idea to only put in sane choices which probably would apply to every repository you intend to use
--- original post follows --- the svn mime-type is a property
for existing entries you can edit it with svn propedit to change the mime-type s default on the client side you can edit the svn config file to include a directive in the section of the config file

3015992
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp also handles some core capabilities differently than codeigniter
for example routing functionality is handled via a dedicated class rather than per controller as in codeigniter via _remap
i have never seen a tool that helps to automate such a conversion as it s rarely if ever done

serializable	deserialization
there s no reason for all the array fiddling when you only need one item

hide	show
from an api perspective it is important to only show users of your project the classes that they can use
use the internal keyword to hide things they shouldn t see
if your big_important_class for project a is intended for use outside your project then you should not mark it internal

note though that even in this case someone can disassemble the binary obviously and get to the code
if you put the private functions in a dll and make them externally callable by normal means callable by a process that loads the library then they will be public for others as well
it is possible to obfuscate the names and things like that but that is probably not a good solution

abusing inherited in such a fashion is frowned upon in some circles however
you normally can t do this as array objects are default constructed but one quick hack is you can create a subclass whose default constructor passes on the parameter s you want to the base class

maven	m2e
this is the preferred approach nowadays
the maven eclipse plugin does not support nested projects so you can t import the root-project and the nested modules unless you move to a flat layout
the alternative is to use m2e and you won t have any problems with a maven-typical nested tree

see bc has some defined functions and extended presision which are available with the -l option bc -l example echo sqrt .977 | bc -l

hide	show
it is easier if you have a component that has an onmousedown event like the tpanel show in this sample and you just pop up a second form which contains the controls you wanted to pop up that handles the form showing itself and positioning itself to look like a popup. the second form hiding itself is easy too procedure tform4.formdeactivate sender tobject

intersect	contains
imagine two rectangles like this +--+ +--+--+--+ | | | | +--+--+--+ +--+ vertices would be at 1 2 1 3 4 2 4 3 and 2 1 3 1 2 4 3 4 -- no vertex lies inside any polygon but the polygons do in fact intersect
to test for this kind of intersection it is necessary to determine whether any of the polygons edges intersect
for your purposes if edges intersect but one polygon is not contains within the other then you know they overlap in a non-permitted fashion

3018039
intersect	contains	intersect	contains
depending on what the shamos-hoey algorithm returns a polygon p i contains polygon p j if any vertex from p j is inside p i which is done in o n for two polygons

hash	salt
obviously the attacker of the client will now be able to access your server - they have after all got the password
an attacker having access to the double-hashed value on the server won t buy them anything since they can t reverse that to get the single hash the password
of course if the attacker is in a position to read your security database then i suspect they have other attack vectors available also as another poster said make sure you are using a salt on both hashes

3018292
hash	salt	hash	salt
of course if the attacker is in a position to read your security database then i suspect they have other attack vectors available also as another poster said make sure you are using a salt on both hash

3018477
quicksort	insertion-sort	quicksort	median-of-medians
anyways as the size is just 10 you could use insertion-sort worst case o n 2 but works good with small arrays and then get the three first last elements edit - tree structures are an overkill for just ten elements and in general involves a time space tradeoff you need a lot of pointers - quickselect has an o n 2 worst case scenario but median-of-medians achieves the same result in a worst case o n
i think in the general case you should use you use the quickselect algorithm which is based on quicksort and in time o n modifies your array inline and quasi-sort it
and that is the same as saying which number is the third bigger in this particular array

3018536
getter	setter
right now i have things divided into about six classes with getter setter
i m guessing that i m at least calling 360k getter per frame which i think is a lot of overhead
each class contains either and-or 1d or 2d arrays containing custom enumerations int color or vector2d bytes

3018624
submit	submission	submit	submission
i use on request success i want to either proceed with form submission or user callback
therefore if the user callback is undefined i will submit the form on form validation success from my validate function
the ajax success callback will call config.successcallback and if it was never overridden by the user it would proceed to normal form submission

i m curious what the cpu ordering is in linux
say i bind a thread to cpu0 and another to cpu1 on a hyperthreading system are they both going to be on the same physical core

3019141
nsstring	nsdata
it uses the key object s hash value to determine where to order it internally
if the object mutated while it was in the dictionary it would throw the ordering off and the dictionary wouldn t work so that s why the dictionary makes a copy although as an optimisation when immutable objects such as nsstring are asked for a copy it could simply increase the retain count and return itself but this is an implementation detail
since keys must conform to the nscopying protocol it means you can use a number of objects as keys to a dictionary including nsarray nsdata etc

3019244
opera	firefox	opera	firefox
also note that this mechanism kicks in even when you run code from the firebug console stop script on firefox i think this feature alone should provide a pretty safe environment for these loopy experiments
all modern browsers except opera should interrupt your script if it runs for more than 5-10 seconds source
in firefox you can even lower this threshold if 10 seconds mean a too big punishment

processors	hyperthreading
the physical core is listed as core id
a processors entry due to hypherthreading will get its own processors but share core id and physical id with another
note that each physical cpu physical id can have multiple cores core id which can further be broken up into additional logical cpus by hyperthreading

it uses private apis but it might help you understand how to respond to user input and apply transforms appropriately
you cannot achieve what you re trying to do with the preset uiview animations because the animation is one-time and cannot be intercepted

nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
on illegalargumentexception vs nullpointerexception while your original code throws illegalargumentexception on null arguments guava s preconditions.checknotnull throws nullpointerexception instead
this is in accordance with the guideline set by the api nullpointerexception applications should throw instances of this class to indicate other illegal uses of the null object
additionally here s a quote from effective java 2nd edition item 60 favor the use of standard exceptions arguably all erroneous method invocations boil down to an illegal argument or illegal state but other exceptions are standardly used for certain kinds of illegal arguments and states

i realize that if i were to use car i would get 1 2 and cdr i d get 3 4 becaue cdr always returns the rest but i don t understand why the list isn t made of two lists

maven	pom.xml
according to non-maven projects sonar light mode you ll have to declare the source and output directory in a minimal pom.xml and build your project prior to running sonar
maven doesn t compile anything and is building an empty jar here no sources to compile no tests to run jar will be empty - no content was marked for inclusion
so while sonar is processing it there is actually nothing to analyze

3022603
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
so while sonar is processing it there is actually nothing to analyze

otherwise i think you need to loop through the server-side collection and enable them plus call their validate method explicitly

if you disable by setting enabled false from the server you may have issues even using the client-side api altogether

3022625
accessor	properties

the documentation is pretty confusing on this one the implementation of accessor methods you write for subclasses of nsmanagedobject is typically different from those you write for other classes
if you do not provide custom instance variables you retrieve properties values from and save values into the internal store using primitive accessor methods

3022625
accessor	properties	accessor	properties
if you do not provide custom instance variables you retrieve properties values from and save values into the internal store using primitive accessor methods
you must ensure that you invoke the relevant access and change notification methods willaccessvalueforkey didaccessvalueforkey willchangevalueforkey didchangevalueforkey willchangevalueforkey withsetmutation usingobjects and didchangevalueforkey withsetmutation usingobjects . nsmanagedobject disables automatic key-value observing kvo see key-value observing programming guide change notifications and the primitive accessor methods do not invoke the access and change notification methods

ideally you can reuse the same classes on both client and server-side
validation can be done client-side in order to save the round-trip to the server
but the server should also perform the same validation

put	get
there is an if statement in the real script that checks for and exits if it is already set. so i know i can take this out and get to print fine but the constraints of the problem include keeping the typeset -i -r
in the example script i put an unset in first to ensure _typeset_var isn t already defined
by the way i do know that it is not possible to unset a typeset -r variable according to ksh93 s man page for ksh

maven	m2e
from my experiments maven-eclipse-plugin can t generate wtp 3 above compatible settings
many ides supports to import maven projects directly but maven has a maven-eclipse-plugin when you run mvn eclipse eclipse it will generate eclipse project settings then you can import as generic eclipse project
i prefer importing directly using m2e as my ide is spring source suite eclipse 3.5 shiped with wtp 3.1 and m2e

junit	cactus	junit	cactus	junit	jsfunit	jsfunit	cactus	jsfunit	cactus
this is due to a limitation in cactus that is scheduled to be fixed in cactus 2.0. that doesn t explain the testsuiteloader issue you re experiencing but it does clarify that annotations cannot be used for now
the jsfunit faq says currently you can use the junit 4 jar but annotations such as test will not work

maven	m2e
i ve used the m2e plugin but i had a couple of issues with it in regards to recognizing projects that were already created and it also fills my context menu in eclipse with a lot more items
i prefer to keep my ide with as few plugins as possible and prefer to work with maven from the command line
this also helps as on my team we don t have a standard ide so we don t put ide generated artifacts in source control
