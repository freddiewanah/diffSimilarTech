put	get
in short you will make it easy for users to use the column as a notes surname column
you want the cap to imped the users that try to put something other than a surname into that column
if you have a column that calls for a specific length a us tax identifier is nine characters but the column is varchar 255 other developers will wonder what is going on and you likely get crap data as well

boost	stl
this means that the c++ stl and c++ boost likely will never be accessible from d
admittedly i ll probably never need std vector while coding in d but i d love to use qt or boost
so what s the deal

the problem was that once the activity was destroyed on screen orientation change listadapter wasn t fully or at all populated due to the asynchronous nature of the refresh before filtering would commence
i thought i d make this self-reply post in case other programmers who are new to android development like i am become stumped by this
well most devs who read documentation skim through it on the account of the fact that there s a lot to read and they just want to get to implementing something cool

3024405
stateless	stateful
i suppose you could write a stateful encoding class but it would be a really bad idea
as far as i m aware all of the built-in encoding implementations are stateless and thread-safe
for example the encoding.utf8 encoding.ascii etc properties are singletons

3024633
disk	ram
if the process crashed anywhere when the database started it would would check the log to ascertain the state of the database and either finish or roll back open transactions
all of this implies that work is written to disk at all steps of the process
if flush interval was the time to write from the log to the database then everything makes sense but if the transaction is held in ram not a log then the database cannot be acid compliant

installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you do not do 3rd step correctly installer will still install and keep the old file your file versioning of every file must be new if you have changed your content
this is tricky you have to do following steps set remove previous installation as true set detect new versioning as true your c# program s versioning must increase with every deployment you should change versioning of your installer to one higher versioning and it will ask you to change product code select yes
do not change your upgrade code let it be same

move	drag
basically you can just drag from one set in whatever order you need for the second set and solve the puzzle with plenty of move left
what i am looking to do is after i finish building the puzzle calculate the minimum number of move required to solve the puzzle
again this is almost always less than the number of swaps used to create the puzzle especially as the number of swaps approaches the number of tiles in each set

serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
the guts of the deserialization mechanism don t have any understanding of generic parameters
i think you re going to be stuck with the unsafe cast warnings here - serializable can only deal with characteristics of the objects that end up in the actual bytecode and as i understand it generics are stripped out by the compiler
the guts of the deserialization mechanism don t have any understanding of generic parameters

sometimes a small and harmless change in a java class ensues strange errors at runtime
these errors only happen if both conditions below are true 1 the application is run on google-chrome and 2 the gwt javascript compiler output style is set to obf

jboss	glassfish
i m using jboss for all of the projects i work on and although i generally like it there are points about it that i totally hate - that being the chaotic documentation the constant critical regressions and lack of emphasis on backward compatibility
other than that - jboss especially 5.x is an excellent application server
glassfish has better administration console and documentation support for java ee 6 in glassfish 3 and better documentation

3025706
jboss	glassfish
glassfish has better administration console and documentation support for java ee 6 in glassfish 3 and better documentation
it lacks however the vast community that s gathered around jboss and this is it s single biggest drawback
in the end of the day i d go again with jboss but this is always subjective.

3025897
width	height
when i followed their links using ie 8 the version on the staging server looked as expected but the layout is hosed on the version from the production server
specifically it seems like a div that is supposed to flow to the right of a div that is float left is displaying below the floated div at full width as though it was clear left which it is not
it also has the wrong height

3026180
free	malloc
i think a few minutes with the nsdata documentation will serve you well
you want one of the -datawithbytes length or its variants which copies the bytes and you can then free data
to save a copy assuming data is allocated using malloc use you should not call free on your buffer in this case as the nsdata instance will free it for you

3026340
switching	screens
if i remember correctly kirby s adventure always tries to put the color-glitched columns on the side of the screens that is scrolling off to make it less noticeable

disclaimer it s been like five years since i wrote any nes code

3026808
floating-point	integer
if you want to see if your options are having an effect download or create a simple benchmark that does a bunch of operations with double-precision floating point values and time how long it takes to execute before and after
the -mfloat-abi softp argument determines how floating-point values are passed between functions
softfp means they re always passed in integer registers or on the stack

3026851
hash	md5
theoretically it s better to xor the two halves together but even truncated sha256 is stronger than md5
you should still consider the result a 128 bit hash rather than a 256 bit hash though
my particular recommendation in this particular case is to store and reference using hash + uniquifier where uniquifier is the count of how many distinct files you ve seen with this hash before

3026922
oncreate	setcontentview

it could look something like this in your preferenceactivity add these two lines to your oncreate addpreferencesfromresource r.xml.preferences
setcontentview r.layout.main

3026959
comparator	comparable
i suspect your ideal solution would be a custom class with a natural order implementing comparable to hold all of a particular person s information then adding its objects to a sortedset such as treeset
use collections.sort list comparator and supply a custom comparator edit as the other editors pointed out you re likely misusing hashmap
i ll leave it here for prosperity

no node will have only one child -- it s either none or two

the int cast converts the double to an int by rounding towards zero
in other words will be a int in the range
finally you add 1 giving an int in the range

it implicitly converts an int to a double gets the double form of largest integer that is less or equal to that double and converts that back to an int

it doesn t go very deeply into algorithms but in a few pages it should tell you enough about design and testing that when you practice you will find fix and learn from many of your mistakes and get into the habit of writing programs that other people can look at without grimacing
the job of laying out a course of study in algorithms - and the other things you need to know to put them to use - especially one that leads to a career in computers is the job of laying out the syllabus of a university course in computer science
indeed i suspect that some universities provide little value except to lay out the syllabus and assess the students - the students do pretty much everything else for themselves

boost	stl
hopefully sealed containers will obviate any need to link with stl containers even for tight applications that can t afford garbage collection
fwiw qt has an actively developed binding for d i think many components in boost are too highly tied to c++ to be portable meaningfully to other languages
using std vector is possible if you spend the time on writing regular namespace-level functions that forward to the appropriate member functions

filtering	grouping
you would then use the stylesheet_link_tag helper or link the stylesheet manually if you really need to use sass within haml here is the answer
you can not nest filtering in haml

the aim of a utc time is that it will be universal - but both computers would have to have synchronized clocks for it to be appropriate to just compare the ticks

moq	typemock
the external resource or dependency could be supplied via the object s constructor a property or method or even as a method parameter. and you re right a common practice is to use an ioc to manage the possible dependencies and supply them to their clients
moq like other mocking frameworks or isolation frameworks is a tool that can be used to generate fake or stub or mock objects that can be used as dependencies for the class you re testing
most mocking frameworks including moq i think but i don t use it myself do not dictate how the fakes are passed to the class under test typemock isolator is an exception here in that it has magic that can inject the dependencies into the class under test

the invocation of the other constructor with call will just make that all the properties assignments made to the this value inside the called function are actually made on the new object from the first constructor that doesn t really affect the prototype chain for example edit to clarify more when you invoke person.call this ...

getter	setter
using annotations on the instance variables of your entity or using annotations on the getter methods of your entity when using the annotations on getter methods hibernate assumes that every getxxx and isxxx for boolean types represents definition of a persistent property
and this holds even if that particular getter does not contain any annotations as happens in your case
hibernate also expects to find a matching setter method for each persistent property

3031590
instances	transient
you can solve this problem by declaring your custom getter as transient that says this getter does not represent a persistent property
another way would be to convert the entity to use annotations on the instances variables
the latter would be my personal choice

if you only have a few classes say less than 20 it might be more logical just to keep them all in one folder
based on the kinds of classes above and how detailed you want to be i d go ahead and use directory so that later on you don t look at it and say gosh i wish i had used directory

put	get
though the library is referenced in that project i can not access any of the classes in it
if i put a public class under system.collections.generic namespace in my class library and refer that library in a project and use a statement like using system.collections.generic still why i can t access my class there
ps last time i asked similar question but put it wrongly so people got misunderstood and i didn t get my answer

free	memcpy	free	malloc
same for the following code since i m not quite sure which one would be the correct usage not even sure if memcpy is what i need here.
also i ve tried allocating memory by doing something like only to get malloc error for object 0x100108e98 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being freed. as far as i understand this error memory has already been allocated for this object but i don t see where this happened
any help would be greatly appreciated

int	double
you can t assign a double value to a float without an explicit narrowing conversion
you therefore have two options for literals use the suffix f or f to denote a float value for non-literals use an explicit cast float an example of the latter is on widening conversions the reason why this compiles is because the widening conversion from int to float can be done implicitly in the context of an assignment
jls 5.2 assignment conversion assignment conversion occurs when the value of an expression is assigned to a variable the type of the expression must be converted to the type of the variable

3033212
integer	unsigned
b 0 solution with the bmask is clearer and i doubt the asm solution is too much faster if speed is a so big concern the table idea could be the faster
shifting 1 64 in a 64 bit integer yields 0 so no need to compute anything for n 63
shifting should be enough fast but if you are trying this way to know the max value a n bit unsigned integer can have you change 0 into the known value treating n 64 as a special case and you are not able to give a result for n 64 on hardware with 64bit integer unless you use a multiprecision bignumber library

jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius
also not all ruby implementations do have a ruby representation for their compiled methods
and even if they did their compiled methods are vastly different rubinius s compiled methods are rubinius bytecode yarv s compiled methods are yarv bytecode jruby s compiled methods are jvm bytecode ironruby s compiled methods are dlr trees
and of course the most widely used implementation mri doesn t even have a compiler

submit	submission
input elements don t have a submit event or a comment property
probably you want to put this on the surrounding element whilst it is possible to put it on the submit button you d have to use to navigate up to the form and down to the other input
it s not generally a good idea to tie form submission code to a particular button

the real problem seems to be that javascript doesn t know what to do when it gets to this line in my real code it also seems to choke anytime i put box.style.background-color so the question i need answered now is how do i set a value to style variables in javascript that have a - in the name

integer	unsigned
it s 2 31-1 3600 ie the biggest number of seconds you can store in an unsigned 32-bit integer
calling where x is an integer is an undocumented shortcut for . normal values for x then would be -12 to +12 but it happily adds or subtracts from utc all the way up to half a million if you tell it to. why it suddenly freaks out at 596 524 i don t know. but i guess one reasonable answer is just don t do that

smalltalk - seaside is fun to use
common lisp - uncommonweb is a great continuation style web framework
erlang - this language is fantastic for its integral hot reloading and high availability features

uiview	subviews
so you probably would like to use removefromsuperview addsubview instead of exchanging two subviews if you were using a predefined transition
i ll quote apple again here if you want to change the appearance of a view during a transition for example flip from one view to another then use a container view an instance of uiview as follows begin an animation block
set the transition on the container view

any inputs will be greatly appreciated

testcase	fixture
this runner is fairly simple and to use it i simply added a setting i dropped the aforementioned approach creating the documents in the setup for performance and readability reasons to test the database i needed a decent amount of documents with some text a paragraph or two so i ended up creating a fixture for that i used a management command that created the documents in the real database serialized them -writing them to a file- and then deleted em . so in the end i didn t read from the live db at all and instead used test fixtures created with a somewhat hacky script and a custom runner and it wasn t that hard
reading the test cases for djapian i found something really interesting what those guys do is use the setup method for the testcase class they create an object and then use the update method for the indexer so they effectively have a document to search for and a way to write controlled query tests
for the curious the method looks something like this i think this would do but we have to remember i m testing a little search engine here so this solution might be the easy way out

spaces	delimiter
it can omit trailing empty strings only
also note that replaceall may trim spaces excessively
you can make the regex more complicated so that it only trims around the delimiter but the splitter solution is definitely more readable and simpler to use

3035384
serializable	deserialization
if it is false that means that the frame is not connected to a native screen resource which i believe pack should take care of but i m uncertain of this in a deserialization scenario
another problem may be incompatibility between the jvm which serializable the frame and the one which is deserializing it if the frame includes swing components
there are warnings in the javadocs for swing components about switching jvm versions when using serialization for them

3035413
folder	directory
but because it also has information in memory none of those files is necessarily consistent with each other at any point in time
if the database was shut down when you took the copy of the whole oraclexe folder then copying the whole folder back and opening up the database should work as there would be sufficient consistency for the database to be recovered
if it was running then you d probably have to look into an incomplete recovery which may or may not be successful depending on how long the directory copy took

ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerable	ienumerator
a basic example of an ienumerator class taken from here
in a nutshell ienumerable exposes an enumerator which allows support of a simple iteration over a non-generic collection
it basically allows foreach loops over a collection the only method you need implement to use ienumable in your own class is getenumerator which returns ienumerator

equals	gethashcode	equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode appropriately and it should work fine
presumably because reportreceipt doesn t override equals - so it s comparing just the references and they re unequal
override equals and gethashcode appropriately and it should work fine

3035474
equals	gethashcode	equals	gethashcode
if you haven t overloaded the equals and gethashcode in your class the fallback object equality check will fail since the sequences contain two different objects
sequenceequal determines whether two sequences are equals by comparing the elements by using the default equality comparer for their type
if you haven t overloaded the equals and gethashcode in your class the fallback object equality check will fail since the sequences contain two different objects

folder	directory	pull	push
now in one working directory i added the line the code is 123 committed
and in the other folder i did an hg pull and hg update now i go back to the first folder and change 123 to 123abc and then do an hg commit and then i go to the other folder and edit 123 to 123xyz over there and do an hg commit and when hg push it says it can t
so i try to use any visual tool to see how the conflict is like but .

slider	jcarousel

i want to create a image strip slider using jquery
i have used jcarousel plugin for my image gallery and light box plugin to get preview of selected image

3035588
pull	push
same as svn or cvs you need to fetch changes into the second repository before you can commit back to the first and it s this that creates the conflict
in the second repository you need to hg pull to fetch the 123abc change from your first repository
this ll be created in repoistory 2 as a new branch hg merge to merge the changes - now there s a conflict that you need to resolve hg commit to commit the resolution of the conflict and now you can hg push

google-chrome	firefox
jquery is used in this code example if you put the script in a function the result is the same

profiler	visualvm	profiler	yourkit

3036292
subclass	inherited
for example the collaboration below extends the core model with simple expression formatting functionality this short example demonstrates various features of virtual classes there is no need to repeat inherited relationships between virtual classes if they are already defined in the supercollaboration
for example exprmodel defines constant as subclass of expr
it means that constant is implicitly assumed as subclass of expr in exprformat as well

3036651
subclass	inherited
1 in this case it might be better to abstract these properties in a super class.
i mean that you could have an event class that defines a user field and all your other event classes would subclass this
then you would be able to do the following event.objects.order_by date #returns both reply vote and event check-out for info on model inherited

3036902
int	chars	int	chars
since there an implicit cast from a unsigned chars to an int if the number is more than 0xff it is going to use bytes max 3 next to the variable in the stack and corrupt their values
the issue with hhd is that depending of the size of an int not necessarily 4 bytes it might not be 1 byte
it does not seem sscanf support storage of numbers into a chars i suggest you use an int instead

3036956
qstring	qobject
for that reason i created a qobject derived class as my model
it provides slots and signals to access it like setfilename qstring or filenamechanged qstring
i got a little into using signal drag and drop in qtdesigner and found it quite va-smalltalk-like nice

3036965
return-value-optimization	nrvo
also don t write return std move message because the compiler knows already that message is a temporary value an rvalue so there is no need to recast it with std move
and actually writing return std move something can prevent optimization at least on msvc10 it seems to disable return-value-optimization
so the correct and most efficient way is good old c++03 because nrvo kicks in and there is no copy no move only one construction

3036997
junit	jbehave
which is perfectly fine
try using other tools that are built on top of junit and provide you with mechanisms for testing behavior rather than small units of code
one of tools that i ve been successfully using for some time is jbehave

3037120
public	protected
another possible way of doing this is fetching the spring proxy of the class in the class itself and call methods on it rather than this
from the spring reference 2.5 when using proxies the transactional annotation should only be applied to methods with public visibility
if you do annotate protected private or package-visible methods with the transactional annotation no error will be raised but the annotated method will not exhibit the configured transactional settings

implements	extends
suppose i have an interface myinterface which i want to extends - i define my extension methods in a myextension static class and pair it with another interface call it myextensionoverrider
myextension methods are defined according to this pattern the override interface mirrors all of the methods defined in myextension except without the this or attemptcast parameters now any class can implements the interface and get the default extension functionality anyone that wants to override it with specific implementations can additionally implements the override interface and there we go extension methods provided on an interface with the option of complete extensibility if needed
fully general too the interface itself doesn t need to know about the extension override and multiple extension override pairs can be implemented without interfering with each other

installation	upgrade
once the cf 9 upgrade was complete we noticed that during busy times when many flex clients were connecting we appeared to have a hard limit of 25 flash remoting requests running despite having much higher limits in fact 150 set in cf admin
initially we thought that this was an issue with the fact that blaze ds was now bundled with cf 9 rather than a separate install so we decided to roll-back the cf 9 installation
this unfortunately didn t work and we were still stuck with out hard limit of 25 flash remoting requests

width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
enjoy
there is a new property in css3 that you can use to change the way the box model calculates width height it s called box-sizing
by setting this property with the value border-box it makes whichever element you apply it to not stretch when you add a padding or border

3037901
width	border-box	width	border-box
by setting this property with the value border-box it makes whichever element you apply it to not stretch when you add a padding or border
if you define something with 100px width and 10px padding it will still be 100px wide
box-sizing border-box

3038117
floating-point	integer
excepting of course for the fact that we have different instructions to operate on integer values vs
floating-point values but that is not really the point of this discussion. so the short answer is that type is completely a compile-time construct and is stored in a symbol table inside the compiler program itself mapping identifiers to types
in the program being compiled types do not exist

3038182
hash	salt	hash	md5
note examples are written in php then salt the password store the and in the database
when the user enters a password compare it to the hash never store passwords in a reversible format
also i would advise against using md5 as a hash

3038265
auto-generate	edmx
this works for ef 1.0 i m not sure if in ef4 all these issues are already fixed
this happens because despite the auto-generate value of the column was created in the database the ef never knew about it
so in order to inform ef that the db will handle the generated value you have to to open your edmx file i always use the xml editor of vs to do this and in the store schema definition language ssdl area add the attribute storegeneratedpattern identity to the column that needs the generated pattern

3038269
prng	random	prng	random
the part of the guid that isn t based on the timestamp can be thought of as random
most guid algorithms base these digits on a prng
thus the likelihood of a collision between these other 10 bytes or so is on the same order as if you used two separate random number generators and watched for collisions

3038310
put	get
now i know i could do this like this but i would like to do it this way when i try it this way if _get id isn t set i get a warning of undefined index id.
it s like as soon as i put my _get id within my function call it sends a warning.
even though my function will check if that var is set or not.

3038375
int	chars
so when my processor runs a syscall instruction such as open file my c++ operating system emulator receives a pointer to the beginning of the filename in my data memory
so keep in mind that data memory is full of int strings globals locals all sorts of stuff
when i m told where the filename starts i do the following convert the whole decimal integer element that is being pointed to to its ascii chars representation and then search from left to right to see if the string terminates if not then just load each chars consecutively into a filename string

3038450
ddms	adb
1 if ddms is running close it it seems to interfere with debugging sometimes
2 start the emulator try connecting with ddms then disconnect then go back to eclipse and start the debuggerer
3 kill the emulator kill the adb process in task manager restart eclipse then try debugging letting eclipse launch the emulator sometimes the first load of the emulator times out so when it s fully started up start debugging again

3038569

classname	inherited
to figure out what s this i shall study the code more find where varname was instantiated find its type
so if varname proves to be an instance of classname class i would knew that methodname is a method of classname
sometimes varname self and methodname is a method of this class or a method inherited from some other class if the current class is subclassing some other classes

free	malloc	free	malloc
the problem is that i now need to be thread-safe so i m trying to malloc an object which is reference counted to prevent excess copying but which also contains a mutex pointer
that way if you re about to delete the last copy you first need to lock the pointer then free the object and lastly unlock free the mutex
however using malloc to create a boost mutex appears impossible because i can t initialize the private object as calling the constructor directly ist verboten

serializable	deserialization
either way their job is really to run some logic and return a byte stream
how you get your data is up to you then ultimately the job is to populate the dto types generated from .proto in many cases but not strictly necessary and run it through the serializable api writing the result to the stream the client same in reverse
generate your dtos from the .proto and run it through the deserialization api the various protobuf implementations c++ c# etc are listed here

src	attr
then you can include the stylesheet
note that all paths like this link relative to the src folder
if your stylesheet is in folder src assets css then the source attr should be assets css my.css another way would be to add another source path folder to your project via same eclipse menu path as above to flex build path but on the first tab can t remember name

3040689
folder	dir
sometimes you even can share some of the view parts inside your app between the front- and backend
i would suggest you to use a bootstrap.php that manages all the routings so you never run into issues like i wish i could nest one folder more into my admin module
i also wouldnt use modules and keep the default controllers right inside the controller dir and the admin controllers inside the controller admin dir

3040874
inherited	base-class
just as a quick example of usage alternatively you could instantiate an instance of v1
the whole point of class inherited is that it allows you to override selected base class behavior
you can use the base keyword from within v2 to call into base-class code from v1 but you cannot do that outside of the class

submit	submission
on form submission you can first validate this on client side and return an error if time has passed even before actually sending the form
if successful submit the form and make sure you validate the token upon processing on the server


3040923
128bit	64bit
to see that this is valid an uint64_t is guaranteed to have a width of exactly 64bit the bit negation of that zero of type uint64_t has thus exactly 64 one bits right shift of an unsigned value is guaranteed to be a logical shift so everything is filled with zeros from the left shift with a value equal or greater to the width is undefined so yes you have to do at least one conditional to be sure of your result an inline function or alternatively a cast to uint64_t if you prefer makes this type safe
an unsigned long long may well be an 128bit wide value in the future a static inline function should be seamlessly inlined in the caller without any overhead

runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
an unchecked-exception does not require your code to handle it and is therefore a good candidate to make all the way down the call stack
you can choose runtimeexception for example or even something like assertionerror if you want to minimize the chances that some part of the code catches the exception and handles it before it reaches your handler

you want i.size with these changes your loops would be
your for-loop is incorrect for two reasons
first you would want a less-than or less-than-or-equal comparison in your loops

3041765
folder	directory
so i would rather not use this method
because mercurial or git won t let us push a single file or a single folder to another repository so i am thinking 1 how about we just look at the commit we did and hg backout the ones we don t want to push
this is because i got the following advice 1 don t commit that file if you don t want it to be pushed but sometimes even just for experimentation i do want to keep the intermediate revisions -- maybe i can hg commit and hg backout right away to prevent it from being pushed. 2 some people told me just to hg clone tmp from that repository i want to push to and then copy the local file over to this tmp working directory hg commit to this tmp repository and then do a push

lisp	scheme
which of the two would be easier
i ve got a little experience with python enough to where i can do if else elif and some random number generation but i ve always had a weird fascination with the lisp languages
i downloaded some scheme source code to look at the syntax but it was pretty much gibberish to me

3041832
lisp	scheme
it can be taught poorly and it does have some high level concepts especially if you re coming from the imperative classic programming world
but today may of the modern languages have aspects very similar to what lisp offers so there is likely not much new in lisp compared to other languages especially python
my hurdle with lisp and scheme was simply lambda

3041832
lisp	scheme
if you want to learn common lisp i would start with common lisp and skip scheme
you can look to practical common lisp to get you in to writing lisp without having to learn it so to speak

bmp	png	bmp	png
the image files can be either bmp jpeg or png
here is the code each of the three save methods work but i get unexpected results with bmp and jpeg
png is the only format that produces an exact reproduction of what i see if i show the bitmapsource on screen using a wpf image control

3041978
post	get
i found this image quite informative alt text image credit darren johnstone if you want more data about the local file on the client s machine before uploading then you ll probably have to go with a flash solution or some other browser plug-in solution
your post made me curious so i did some research
from an application perspective if i understand rfc 1867 correctly - i just scanned through it to find the vital information you ll get form field name filename path content type then your application server will add the file file size set the modified accessed date to the current date time when the file was received

3042045
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
that s because the way most languages encourage you to think about programming is a handicap to learning lisp
being experienced with a more conventional language will probably help in some ways but not with the qualities that make lisp unique
scheme --- the lisp with which i m most familiar --- is probably about as easy as python to learn especially if you choose plt scheme now renamed racket which offers you a lot of helpful extensions

3042045
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
scheme --- the lisp with which i m most familiar --- is probably about as easy as python to learn especially if you choose plt scheme now renamed racket which offers you a lot of helpful extensions
common lisp is probably about the same difficulty though i find it less instinctive for reasons which are probably not universal
i have found c much more difficult than either for the reasons norman ramsey suggests

3042045
lisp	scheme
if you want a big friendly diffuse language of immense power but not as visibly internally consistent as scheme choose common lisp
steel bank common lisp is a good implementation

uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
btw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .
i was struggling with this same problem - i was trying to do a interface with a lot of cards uiview subclasses on a cork board and have the cork board area scrollable but still able to drag-and-drop the cards
i was doing the hittest solution above but one of the apple engineers asked me why i was doing it that way

3042133
bmp	png
the png formats always work whether it s system.drawing or the wpf encoders
the jpg and bmp encoders do not work
they show a solid blue rectangle

3042289
octal	decimal	octal	decimal
so one way to interpret your question is that you want to convert an octal representation into a decimal one etc -- that would be note the quoted indicating strings representations
int s 8 converts the string s into an integer as an octal representation or raises an exception if the conversion can t work
str n produces the string form of number n which as i mentioned is by default a decimal representation

3042395
cakephp	kohana
try a modern framework like kohana or maybe something more engineered-oo like zend framework
cakephp tries to be rails-like but is stuck in the past of php4
avoid it

3042640
hash	salt
their sole use is to make brute-force attacks on hash much more expensive
something called a rainbow table which is a fancy name for a database where someone hash a whole bunch of possible passwords in advance and lets you look up passwords if you know the hash makes it possible to take unsalted password hash and turn them into passwords in a fraction of a second in many cases
a moderately sized salt can increase the complexity of a precomputed brute-force attack exponentially

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here is the jquery function i used jquery html css
i have used a scrolltop function in jquery for navigating to top but strangely the smooth animated scroll stopped working in safari and google-chrome scrolling without smooth animation after i made some changes
but it is still working smoothly in firefox

3042655
x86	64bit
here s how put your data model ef data model into its own assembly let s call it datamodel create a new class library project call it mydataservicehost add a few references your datamodel assembly with the data layer system.servicemodel system.servicemodel.web system.data.services.client system.data.services - you cannot pick this from the usual add reference dialog under the .net category - you need to browse for the assembly file
find the directory c program files reference assemblies microsoft framework .netframework v4.0 or c program files x86 .
on a 64bit machine and pick the system.data.services.dll inside it add a new class to that class library and call it yourdataservice.cs - it will look something like this you can name the class anything you like and it has to derive from where t is the name of your data model

3042683
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as you can see in my other answer intercepting ctrl + v and ctrl + c comes with many side effects and it still doesn t prevent users from pasting using the firefox edit menu etc
safari still has some minor problems with this method it clears the clipboard in place of cut copy when preventing default but that bug appears to have been fixed in google-chrome now
see also and the associated test page for more information

serializable	deserialization
more about this
serializable is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes
deserialization is the opposite process of creating an object from a stream of bytes

3043025
ilmerge	reflector
however i can imagine that this bank wants to be able to inspect your application code without having to inspect any external assemblies by using .net reflector
in that scenario even using ilmerge won t do the trick because this doesn t make the security problem go away
it will just hide those external assemblies inside your application assemblies and make everything even harder to inspect

3043174
put	get
but i suggest you read the chapter on optimization in the mysql reference manual to get a basic idea on how to analyze queries and tables and optimize them if necessary
personally though i would always try to put indexed fields before non-indexed fields and order them according to the number of rows that they should return most restrictive conditions first least restrictive last

it s more highlevel than php. python is used for linux dekstop applications
for example the most of ubuntu configurations utilites are pythonic

post	get
the value of the first is posted to another url and the returned value should be used to fill the second field
here s the code the post works fine and the correct data is returned from hander which i confirmed by making a test and filling it using #testdiv .html update_rid
so it seems like the problem is in the way i m trying to update the value but i can t get past that

3043297
firefox	safari
edit2 same problem in safari
recently i found that some searches in firefox are redirected to bing
instead of my primary search engine google. i am not sure but it seems that it is not bound to search but rather a hostname resolving

i need a little help to figure out why the following code does not work on google-chrome 5 windows xp
it works well on all other browsers ie firefox safri opera etc

implements	extends
we ended up creating iactivable interface and extends ninject kernel it also removed nicely code level dependencies to ninject allthough attributes still remain
we have a concrete singleton service which implements ninject.iinitializable and 2 interfaces
problem is that services initialize-methdod is called 2 times when only one is desired

i found it
we should create the header with and post to

addeventlistener	preventdefault
there is a different technique to achieve this for each of three different scenarios 1
an event handler added using addeventlistener non-ie browsers
in this case use the preventdefault method of the event object

3043990
gridview	rowdatabound
thanks nat
i have a gridview populated by a web service search function
some of the columns in the grid are templatefields because the values coming back from the search in a datatable are ids - i then use these ids to lookup the values when the rowdatabound event is triggered and populate a label or some such. this means that my sorting function for these id lookup columns sorts by the ids rather than the textual value that i have looked up and actually populated the grid with although i do put the ids in the grids datakeys

3043990
gridview	rowdatabound
as that approach seems like a bit of a bodge. although i guess it does remove having to do the looking up in the rowdatabound event..
my sorting function works by sticking the datatable in the session and on each bind grabbing the sort column and binding the gridview to a dataview with the sort attribute set to the column - and the direction
thanks nat

qmenubar	qwidget
there is no direct api to do this but you can probably pull that out byt manipulating the internal actions of qwidget qmenu addmenu just calls
in theory you can manipulate qmenubar actions but i never did it
when i had to do handle this problem i just reconstructed the menu from another dataset look in your favorite search engine for qmdilib and you will see my solution

portrait	landscape

i created a uiviewcontroller view from xib with modalpresentationstyle set to uimodalpresentationformsheet and everything works great in portrait mode
when i switch to landscape the view gets moved upperleft it s not centered as it should be and most part of it is clipped

post	get
my design team have no problems with ui themes css
see this post to find out why it is a good idea to use google to host jquery for you
basically you get decreased latency increased parallelism and better caching see this post to find out how to link to the jquery ui themes using cdn i have used this technique and have not found any issues

3044408
spaces	delimiter
it s not clear what your exact requirements are but here s an example that should be illustrative if you give this input 123 a b c x y z the output is so what happens here is that the scanner uses as delimiter which is the regex for zero or more whitespace characters
this skips spaces etc in the input so you only get non-whitespace characters one at a time


3044646
bufferedreader	urlconnection
in a nut your code can be rewritten as in java 7 there will be automatic resource handling which would made your code as concise as see also java io tutorial c# using keyword in java how to use urlconnection
i mean i close the bufferedreader in the last line but i do not close the inputstreamreader
apart from the fact that it should be done in the finally so that the close is ensured even in case of an exception it s fine

versioning	upgrade
issue 3 relates to building vs2008 workflow projects in msbuild 4 when they target framework 3.5
microsoft in their infinite wisdom have apparently chosen to not address this issue link to connect site and there are several ideas to fix it referencing specific versioning of the framework changing the build workflow to use msbuild 3.5 none of which work
so our upgrade to 2010 is on hold it would seem until either the products for which we build the 3.5 workflows crm 4.0 and sharepoint 2007 2010 support framework 4 or until microsoft fix the issue

3044834
move	drag
it sounds good so far but here is the problem if i move usercontrol1 the dragged and placed item is going to move with usercontrol1
that means even though i move an item before out of usercontrol1 it is still connected to that usercontrol
i would like to drag an item from usercontrol1 and place it in usercontrol2

ienumerable	iqueryable
however there s no linq iqueryable provider and all queries are written or generated as dynamic sql and run as ado.net queries
all database interaction is interfaced to the application as method calls for specific operations and ienumerable of entity classes returned as results
performance is within 10 of straight ado.net coding but that level of performance was a requirement from the start of the project

3045146
pull	push
for this reason i always prefer to push to a published location and have people pull from there rather than have them pull directly from my working repository so that i know when rollback is safe and when it isn t for the few times when i need it
hg pull is not a full sync
all hg pull remote does is copy every changeset in remote that is not in the local repository to the local repository

3045180
filtering	grouping
i believe you should then be able to use the following code in your template this makes use of the regroup template tag grouping the items by day creating a list of objects per day
the date itself is output by using the date template filtering to reformat the created_on field of the first item in that date s list
note i have not tested this

3045226
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
you can also provide arrays initializers in the declaration although that probably doesn t apply to your actual code so much as your sample code
in vb.net you can declare the variable as part of the for-loop syntax

vorbis	webm
the pros for this in your case are the video file can be in any format mpg avi wmv mov and the web setup will take care of conversion
in terms of flash plugins downloads and compatablity mark pilgrim dive into html5 has talked about the following video workflow to ensure maximum compatablity across browsers make one version that uses theora video and vorbis audio in an ogg container
make another version that uses webm vp8 + vorbis

3046194
mouseevent	mouselistener
check out the global event listeners for an example of using the awteventlistener
the mouse state only changes when a mouseevent is generated so you need to listen for mouseevents
i guess you could add a global mouselistener to track the state yourself based on the last mouseevent generated

3046305
int	double
cython seems to be the way to go but i can t really find an example of how exactly this is done
my c function looks like this all i want to do is to specify the first three parameters a string and two int and recover 8 numpy arrays or python lists
all the double arrays have n elements

inherited	properties	inherited	properties
if there is a class category with a translatable properties title the model translation will store module.somewhere.category as package class title as translation key and for german the translation value kategorie and the language key de . my aim is to ease the access to this properties
so all this model classes inherited from a plain class called translatable
it has a method for resolving the module path and name of the class for the later storing within the translation database table and a _propertize method that takes the name of the properties

uiview	subviews

basically i got a uiimageview in the lower part of another uiview

put	get
it is possible to package most of this up into a single bundle
on mac os x for instance all this can easily be put into a an .app bundle and on windows and linux i believe there are packaging and installation tools that can help you do this easily
even though you will only need to write the user interface code for your application once you will not magically get the ability to ship an application on all three primary platforms at once without doing at least the building of the installer or packaging separately for each platform

3046785
inline	inlining
the aggressive and abundant inlining common in c++ programs can make a single line of code have seemingly endless steps
things like shared_ptr can be particularly annoying because every access to the pointer expands inline to the template internals
you never really get to used it

3046864
nsdocument	nsapplication

if it s an nsdocument application you need to implement one of the file reading methods such as readfromdata oftype error
in an ordinary nsapplication your app delegate should handle it in application openfile

3046867
int	chars
hashes take bytes - not chars strings - and return bytes and converting between int and bytes is of course simple
here s an example python function that works on 32 bit int and outputs a 32 bit int it can of course be easily adapted to work with different length inputs and outputs

post	get	post	get
in python you would therefore just need to get the value you got via the fieldstorage class indeed using fieldstorage.getfirst method
post request includes all the elements of the form you submit

eventlet	gevent
so there s stackless and as you can see from my gallentean avatar i m well aware of the tremendous success in it s use for ccp s flagship eve online game first hand

3048077
xstream	jibx
i recommend using something better designed for this task such as jaxb built into javase6 or jibx

cpu	processors

the jvm will not by itself take advantage of special cpu features when executing code which happens to be an aes encryption recognizing some code as being an implementation of aes is beyond the abilities of the jit compiler
to use special hardware the padlock on via processors or the aes-ni instructions on the newer intel processors you must go at some point through native code

ada	pascal
intel used to produce a very simple language called pl m programming language for microcomputers for various intel processors from the 4004 to the 803286 but it is no longer available or supported and has no benefits over c
ada is widely used especially in military aviation and safety critical applications
embedded pascal is available for some targets

next	except
then in order for the ball to stay on at the top the centripetal force condition has to be satisfied so so the minimum initial velocity is determined by this is similar to what pete said except that he forgot the centripetal force condition to stay on at the top
next the acceleration tangential to the track is given by but where alpha is the rotational acceleration
thus we get however i don t know of an analytical solution to this differential equation and mathematica was stumbling with finding one too

3048774
ienumerable	ienumerator
if you want to do this with a custom data structure or want to put more logic when moving to the next element lazy loading streaming data you can implement the ienumerator interface yourself
example references - ienumerable interface


3048824
width	height
additionally remove height 100 from the same class
adding width 100 to the ov-image class in your css fixes this
i guess the other browsers honor display block even for image scaling but on ie you have to declare the width for it to scale

3048897
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
however in this case that alternate view would not be pushed onto the uinavigationcontroller
it would be visually akin to flipping the current uiviewcontroller s table view over and revealing the other view then being able to flip back
in other words it s intended to take up a single spot in the uinavigationcontroller hierarchy

3048897
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in other words it s intended to take up a single spot in the uinavigationcontroller hierarchy
moreover whatever selection you ultimately make from within either view will push a common uiviewcontroller onto the uinavigationcontroller stack
still more info we don t want to use a separate uinavigationcontroller just to handle this pair of views and we don t want to split these apart via a uitabbarcontroller either

hash	salt	hash	md5
that s why it s so important to use salt hashes instead of storing the hash directly.
it doesn t decode an md5 hash
it uses what s called a rainbow table .

3049207
post	get
the query string could possibly be used to further qualify requests without a body get
the common way to do it would be to send a post to with the content for simple urlencoded data would be different for multipart encoded data
the format of the post request body is arbitrary and outside of the scope of rest recommendations it could even be arbitrary encrypted data as others have suggested

3049336
arp	tcp
the network card driver will wrap the tcp ip packet in an ethernet frame packet
if the ip address is on the local network the network card driver will try to determine what s the target machine mac address in the arp table
if it succeeds then it will send the ethernet frame packet over the network wire directly addressed to the mac address of that machine

3049388
int	double
double and float can signal the error condition through their values
int cannot
therefore you need to be able to turn on some signalling mechanism for integer errors if you want to detect overflows

3049492
pop-up	dialog
that can be corrected by altering one line to add a null check
the above worked great for me with one exception if i return null as my string i don t want any message to pop-up
it works for all browsers except ie which brings up a dialog box that says null

3049574
typedef	struct
but as there is no way to forward-declare a function then there is no way use the construct you wrote in your question
i am no compiler lawyer but i believe this circular dependency is created only because of typedef notation not because of c c++ limitation
after all function pointers i m talking about functions here not object methods all have the same size in the same way struct or class pointers all have the same size

3049580
hide	show
it pulls the value letter a letter from the url string and displays only paragraphs that start with that letter
it hide all others and also consolidates the list so that there are no duplicates showing
for example if a paragraph starts with the amazing i would like it to show up on the a page not the t page like it currently is

3049616

you can also override that method on your uiwindow object if you want

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
fix it seems like you need to use your own subclassed uiviewcontroller within the navigation controller and add shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation
presumably the default uiviewcontroller isn t returning the correct orientation so the wrong animation is used

background i checked all the differences between my code and apple s and i found out that my navigation controller was a subclass of uinavigationcontroller where i perform all the work
by default ib had added a uiviewcontroller inside this and i left it alone
i noticed that the navbar sample code had its own class set mainviewcontroller

this way the height is still available
you could also position the hidden div off the screen with a negative margin rather than using display none much like a the text indent image replacement technique

cvs	svn
if set a newly scheduled build waits for this many seconds before actually being built
this is useful for collapsing multiple cvs change notification e-mails into one some cvs changelog e-mail generation scripts generate multiple e-mails in quick succession when a commit spans across directories
if your coding style is such that you commit one logical change in a few cvs svn operations then setting a longer quiet period would prevent hudson from building it prematurely and reporting a failure

put	get
i don t really want all this extra stuff floating around in my page source i d much rather get it off into a script tag and then i can minify it and all sorts
if i call it as a php file this should work in theory i just end the js file extension with php instead and in the header i put the following header content-type application x-javascript
but.

setinterval	clearinterval
i ve tried as best to make sure clearinterval is working and it seems to not run any code below it
the setinterval is used to preload the next image and then display it in the gallery
when the interval detects we are at the last image it is meant to clear that interval and start over with a new property

versioning	upgrade
that means python 3.1 which is in the repositories
sudo apt-get install python3 different python versioning in the ubuntu repositories can coexist with one another just fine
if you re on a version of ubuntu older than lucid you ll have to upgrade your os or enable the universe repository in order for python3 to show up in your package manager

qscrollarea	qtextedit
the form itself sits inside a qscrollarea that is the central widget for a window
my intent is that any necessary scrolling will take place in the main qscrollarea rather than inside any widgets and any widgets inside will automatically resize their height to hold their contents
i have tried to implement the automatic resizing of height with a qtextedit but have run into an odd issue

in my uitabbarcontroller i am using more than 5 items so i automatically get the more item. i ve managed to add a saving procedure so the order of those items will be kept in case somebody changes the order etc
with more active i get the more navigation controller with the edit item positioned under my uinavigationcontroller
both navigation controller are visible

3051087
subclass	inherited
maybe its more about prefer composition about inherited and problems which can occur if your classes methods are not final im talking mostly java here but not really designed for reuse
there are many things which can go really wrong maybe you use virtual methods in your constructor - once theyre overridden your base class calls the overridden method which may use ressources initialized in the subclass constructor - which runs later npe rises
imagine an add and an addall method in a list class

3051191
typedef	struct
but here you explicitly wish not to use polymorphism so i find myself wondering why using inheritance at all since it s its sole interesting use imo
instead in c++ you can use composition for code reuse free functions defined in their own namespace using typedef etc.
to bring objects from outside the class your example seems constrained here but i too wrap my enums into struct to prevent namespace pollution by a thousand symbols and because struct can be used as template parameters wheres namespaces cannot

if i remember right its width x height x bits per pixel 8 mem usage so for a full screen image 1024x768x 16 8 1 572 864 so around 1.5 mb of ram while on disk it may only be a couple hundred kb
remember that 40mb of image files on disk is far more when put in memory
on disk they are compressed but once you load it into memory you use just as much memory as a uncompressed image

you cannot submit the form without javascript enabled but the server side script received a form field value that the javascript validation will not allow
i suspect that a form bot managed to submit the form without running the javascript but i m not entirely sure this is the problem because a real user had a similar problem

hash	md5
hashes are useful for a many applications - this is definitely one of them
the first solution you ve provided could be sped up significantly if you also hash the data and store the hash of the 4096-byte segment in your database then compare to that
comparing to a string that s 4096 bytes long would take forever but this would be significantly faster for each 4096-byte segment in the file hash the segment into something short even md5 is fine and it s quick look up the hash in your database if it exists segment may have already been found compare the actual segment to see if there s a match if it doesn t exist it s a new segment - save it to your database hashing the segment isn t free but it s pretty cheap and the comparisons between hashes will be orders of magnitude cheaper than comparing the full byte segments to each other repeatedly

you should try calling fflush on them to force them to write their data
it looks like python s stdout is buffered independently from c s stdout

3054286
for-loop	loops
backtick notation -- num coerces a variable to a string and is the same as str num
x for x in y is called a list comprehension and is basically an one-liner for-loop that returns a list as its result
so all together your code s semantically equivalent to the following but faster because list comprehensions and xrange are faster than for loops and range

what you really get back in the browser is in the layout
therefore you can put your view s output into the layout by in default.ctp
of course you can also have different layouts. in addition the layout can be enhanced with elements

move	drag
do you drag drop the menus or do you write the code
i began with mainmenu but when i move to vs2005 only menustrip appeared in the toolbox so i assumed it was new and better
however the merge replace action seems to require a lot more time and effort and leave one open to maintenance problems

remember that using checkbox in places where you should be using radio boxes will be confusing your end-users as they wonder why that checkbox is suddenly de-activated while when using radio buttons the confusion factor is non-existant
you might want to use a radio button with possibly a separator between the groups as this also signifies to the end-user that those fields are mutually exclusive
a radio button by definition is mutually exclusive within a group

hash	md5
i am pretty sure that my design is the best i can come up with lets don t get off my question and into cross checking my design logic if we can help it
background i have a complex search form that stores the query and it s hash in a cache
once the cache is set i redirect to something like searchresults e6c86fadc7e4b7a2d068932efc9cc358 where that big long string on the end is the md5 hash of my query

hash	md5
once the cache is set i redirect to something like searchresults e6c86fadc7e4b7a2d068932efc9cc358 where that big long string on the end is the md5 hash of my query
i need to make a new argument for views to know what the hash is good for
the reason for all this hastle is because my original search form is way to complex and has way to many arguments to consider putting them all into the path and expecting to do the filtering with the normal views arguments

imperative	declarative
in general programming languages are evolving towards a more declarative style telling the computer what you want done rather than how you want it done
when you program in an imperative language like assembly or c you specify in extreme detail how you want the problem solved
this gives the compiler little room to make optimization decisions on your behalf

3056765
cpu	processors
first of all as zildjohn01 noted they re often slower than other instructions with current processors
more importantly it rarely makes much difference anyway -- if you re scanning much text at all the bottleneck will usually be the bandwidth from the memory to the cpu so essentially nothing you do with changing instructions is likely to make a significant difference in any case
that said especially if the token you re looking for is long a better algorithm may be useful

3056968
children	parent
now knowing these facts the last node in a row must be an end node children are always to the right and on the same row or lower of their parent node
all non-end nodes must have exactly two children therefore all non-end nodes have children that are the first to the right of their column the first child being on the same row the second child being n rows below them where n is the number of nodes on the right side of it
we can see that given any valid grid there is one unambiguous way to connect the dots so to speak

put	get
that s why it is even harder to do a query to get the results you want
in your examples with search term and result classes it is hard to tell when you want to search by tag word in class name or by tag name of tutor i suggest to use the following tables if in tags you only have the words in the name of webclasses you could search in that table with like and drop tables tags and all_tag_relations . searching by tags i put because if you add conditions for tutors tag_count will be 0 when all the tags are not in class name
otherwise tag_count is always greater than 0

3057797
udp	tcp
you may have read somewhere on the net that binding in a client is lame but that advice only applies to tcp connections
with udp you have to bind the socket in the client because udp is connectionless so there is no other way for the stack to know which program to deliver datagrams to for a particular port
if you could recvfrom without bind you d essentially be asking the stack to give your program all udp datagrams sent to that computer

3057815
union	distinct
right now i m getting errors like invalid namespace module type or union case name discriminated union cases and exception labels must be uppercase identifiers i suppose i could somehow override tostring for these goofy cases and replace the symbols with some alphanumeric equivalent
i m trying to create a discriminated union for part of speech tags and other labels returned by a natural language parser
it s common to use either strings or enums for these in c# java but discriminated unions seem more appropriate in f# because these are distinct read-only values

3057877
put	get
we can substitute as the suffix for endpoints. for each row for each column if cell contains a node or endpoint print fixed prefix print label print depth print fill spaces max label length - current label length print appropriate suffix if node is an endpoint skip to next row if cell is empty print fill spaces to width of column if cell contains a vertical print some chosen prefix number of spaces a bar and fill with spaces if cell contains a junction print some chosen prefix number of spaces a backslash and fill with hyphens if cell contains a horizontal print full column width of hyphens converting this to print diagonals might be easiest if you generate the straight version first and then do some substitutions in the character array -- otherwise you can get cases where you re rendering a long vertical branch in a different column than the one in which it originated
at some point i may try to put this into code but it probably won t be today -- stuff to do

3058048
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
without using any heap allocation i would think your only option is to fix the size of foo.pstr in odp or allocate the arrays on the heap as part of the odp initialisation better still use std wstring since you are using c++ and let it do the memory allocation and management for you
a - you allocate an arrays of size 1 to the stack b - you assign foo.pstr to point to the arrays on the stack c - you assign base i to the first element of the arrays which is on the stack after the for-loop exits its current cycle the variable loopstr is no longer in scope and its content is undefined
the next loops iteration will most likley re-use the same memory address hence why you get the same value when you print at the end

3058129
lisp	smalltalk
unlike those many answers above which use compiled languages which only allow you to create and link in new code at run-time here you can honest-to-goodness modify the code of a currently-running program
ruby and lisp as indicated by other answerers also allow you to do this
probably smalltalk too

3058398
puts	gets
we don t need to use it with nptr because it is already a pointer to someplace in the memory neither with s because an array gets downgrade to a pointer when it s passed to a function

for option 2 if you can t inherited as an example assuming you only care about one method in the class we ll call it method1 you create a matching interface for it then create an implementation of it that takes the concrete class as a dependency injected by your container as normal that just calls the concrete class

multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add
on the other hand doing x 200 100 will not be the same as doubling the number since the first multiplication may overflow so this cannot be optimized safely to doubling the number
with any modern compiler left shift by 1 or multiplying by 2 will generate the same code
it s probably going to be an add instruction adding the number to itself but it depends on your target

multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition	multiplying	add	addition	multiplication
to multiplying them together multiplying the mantissas and add the exponents the computer does this using the binary equivalents
repeated addition would be a very inefficient way to multiplying numbers imagine multiplying 1298654825 by 85324154
much quicker to just use long multiplication using binary

uitableview	reloaddata
it works like a charm
this answer doesn t seem to be working anymore due to some changes made to uitableview implementation since the answer was written
i ve been playing with this problem for a couple of days and think that subclassing uitableview s reloaddata is the best approach reloaddata doesn t end before the table has finish reload its data

hash	md5
using sha1 or md5 might be a good idea but this requires going through the whole file to create that hash
if this hash is something that could be stored and used later then it s a different story probably but yeah.

one small question regarding test files i have a directory with some demo txt images dirs.
these are used during tests so up until now the path was hardcoded to a folder on my computer
now i need to change this of course the tfs need access to the files too

so to summarize eof is not character but constant returned by the os. edit well you need to know more about filesystem look at this
hi to your second question once again you should look better into filesystems
fat is very nice example becouse you can find many articles about it and its principles are very similiar to ntfs

public	protected
if access is permitted then the accessed entity is said to be accessible

int	chars
integral promotion is applied to both arguments to most binary expressions involving int types
this means that anything of int type that is narrower than an int is promoted to an int or possibly unsigned int before the operation is performed
this means that is performed as an int calculation but because the result is stored back into a which is a chars the result has to undergo a narrowing conversion hence the warning

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
first if you re using any sort of view hierarchy tab bar uinavigationcontroller or something you ve rolled on your own the message is going to propagate upward
that means one handler for memory messages in your root-level uiviewcontroller subclass can handle memory events for the whole app which is very handy
second you want to go after the low-hanging fruit

a few examples where ecj is preferred over javac is apache tomcat uses ecj to compile jsps intellij idea has support for ecj as of gnu compiler for java gcj 4.3 gcj integrates with ecj liferay builds with ecj
eclipse has implemented its own compiler called as eclipse compiler for java ecj
it is different from the javac the compiler that is shipped with sun jdk

jikes	javac
it is not a wrapper around sun s javac
jikes has existed for a long time it used to be a lot faster than the standard jdk java compiler but i don t know if that s still true
as to why ibm wanted to write their own java compiler maybe because of licensing reasons they also have their own java implementation

int	chars
the string is not a value type
the c# language specification states that for value types the default value is the same as the one assigned by the default constructor and for reference types it is null so the value types default constructor values are for all simple-types the default value is the value produced by a bit pattern of all zeros for sbyte byte short ushort int uint long and ulong the default value is 0
for chars the default value is x0000

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
from the delegate a uitabbarcontroller is made programmatically my newsfeednavigationcontroller is just a subclassed uitableviewcontroller and the subclass is not interfering with viewwillappear as it s never called in newsfeednavigationcontroller

the problem is that whenever views are popped off the stack viewwillappear is never called in newsfeednavigationcontroller and the items in the list remain highlighted

superclass	subclassing
edit the function needs to know the internal types in use so unless there is a way to access template types at compile time i think there is no solution
i have a superclass which is defined in terms of a few internal types it uses
subclassing is performed as so but when i want to write a function that takes a pointer to the superclass this happens the user really shouldn t know anything about the inside classes and should really just concern himself with the use of the function

hash	salt	hash	md5
in md5 these two passwords always generate to password 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 john 527bd5b5d689e2c32ae974c6229ff785 so if you just md5 your passwords and someone s naive enough to make that their password it would probably be compromised if a hacker controlled your database and ran it against a rainbow table
however if you add some sort of gibberish to every pre-hashed value like password12345 and johnxyz then you get 2 entirely different hash that would not be the same as those above
this is called a salt value and it prevents rainbow tables from being as effective

union	distinct
what would be quicker is to use union all if it will work
union looks for duplicated records and removes them from the final result
if you know the records by design such as each table is for a differnt clinet or each table has a differnt date range cannot be duplicated union all not try to distinct the resultset and thus runs much faster

3064229
accessor	properties	accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
also you re mixing together properties access via self.list and direct use of list in the same method
this is not invalid but it s bad practice because it means whatever other stuff the accessor methods do is being randomly bypassed
it s common for properties like this to do everything through self except in the accessors themselves or in dealloc and possibly in init opinions seem to differ on this where you would access the ivar directly

share the exceptions you see and hopefully we ll get to the bottom of it soon
i guess that you could put the controller classes in app_code and be done with it. you will need to map a special extension for monorail urls. if you do not use soap webservices .asmx then map this extension to monorail s httphandlerfactory
an interesting culprit could be that the actual assembly containing the app_code files does not have a nice name i think and monorail does need to know the assembly from which to locate controller classes

os might not allow you to write settings files in your app folder and users don t like to be asked where on disk they want to save settings and you don t want to implement your custom logic for every platform your data is saved for each os user separately a way to keep user data even if your application is uninstalled or during an upgrade don t need database or access to file system also i don t like serialization and don t recommend it for this
serialization means you have to take care when changing your classes in new versioning of your application

try-catch	exception-handling

in the -200 to 200 example you d divide by 200
this is essentially two steps center the range on 0 so for example a range from 400 to 800 moves so it s from -200 to 200
do this by subtracting the center average of the min and max of the range divide by the absolute value of the range extremes to convert from a -n to n range to a -1 to 1 range

here is a break down - a post request tries to modify data on the server if the server fails it sends a 500 error to indicate failure if the server succeeds it sends a 302 redirect response the browser then sends a fresh get request to the server if this fails you get a 500 error otherwise you get a 200 so your use case of saved data but can t retrieve it immediately translates to a 302 redirect for the initial post followed by a 500 for the subsequent get

for possible rules see wikipedia - filename for an overview of the rules used by different file systems naming files paths and namespaces for windows specific rules
a 100 accurate checking of a path s string format is quite difficult since it will depend on the filesystems on which it is used and network protocols if its not on the same computer
even within windows or even ntfs its not simple since it still depends on the api .net is using in the background to communicate with the kernel

3067600
filesystems	ntfs
even within windows or even ntfs its not simple since it still depends on the api .net is using in the background to communicate with the kernel

what i d do is to make some basic checks only and then handle exceptions properly once the path is used

unix	solaris
evaluation versions should be possible though
unfortunately i can t speak for the windows world but i know there are some tools in the unix world that does this for you in runtime the idea is to implement the memory allocation functions together with some extra checks
the library can the be told to abort the process when a problem is found and you can find the problem by looking at the stack trace. libumem on solaris is one example of this

versioning	upgrade	ncover	nant
previously we used nunit 2.4.3.0 and ncover 1.5.8.0 within our nant scripts but nunit 2.4.3.0 doesn t like .net 4.0 projects
so we upgrade to a newer versioning of the nunit framework within the test project itself but then found that ncover 1.5.8.0 doesn t support this versioning of nunit
we get errors in the code saying words to the effect of the assembly was built using a newer versioning of the .net framework than is currently in use as it s using .net framework 2.0 to run the tools

mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
we get errors in the code saying words to the effect of the assembly was built using a newer version of the .net framework than is currently in use as it s using .net framework 2.0 to run the tools
we then tried using gallio s icarus test runner gui but found that this and mbunit only support up to version 3.5 of the .net frameword and the result is the tests will be ignored
in terms of the coverage side of things for reporting into cruisecontrol.net we have found that partcover is a good candidate for substituting-out ncover as the newer version of ncover is quite dear and partcover is free but this is a few steps down the line yet as we can t get the test runners to work first

because uint doesn t allow for negative numbers it has a range of 0 to 4 294 967 295 compared to the range of -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647 for an int if you have a scenario where you cannot have negative integers or it doesn t make sense to have a negative value then unsigned integers can be a good choice

as someone already suggested maybe you should start a little easier or better yet get a good book i recommend accelerated c++ and programming p p using c++ for c++ beginners
i don t really know what you are asking here but there are several misconceptions in your post
first inline functions are a specific optimization you do not need to care about quite yet

width	margin
see here for details
here s a diagram demonstrating how the overall dimensions of a box are calculated essentially the dimensions of a box are width + padding + border
the margin is not added to the width although it may affect the box s positioning

stateless	stateful
first you probably need to distinguish between stateless and stateful ejbs
stateless ejb are well stateless and should not contain data
the app

stateless	stateful
you hold a reference to one specific instance which is created when the bean is looked up
callback methods can be specified with postconstruct or predestroy these callbacks also exist for stateless ejbs but make less sense
that said if you need to perform something before a method is called i suggest you use an interceptor using interceptor works for stateless and stateful ejbs

inherited	subclassing
an object in c# can clearly have multiple supertypes parent + as many interfaces as you want subclassing means that a type inherits implementation from some other type
in c# this happens when you have a parent class but not when you re implementing an interface because you don t inherited any implementation from the interface
so c# allows you to have only a single superclass parent class

short	base
unless you mean null pointer in which case you re looking for intptr.zero
i m assuming you mean in managed code as your question is rather short to do anything but assume
i think you re either looking for intptr or simply any object reference which is the base type and the basic equivalent of a null pointer - a reference to something

integer	unsigned
what are the different types of constructors overloads and other functions that you would write
you need a set of constructors like a default one copy constructor construction from native integer types
the last part is the tricky part actually in c++ mixing signed unsigned arithmetic in c++ is not so-simple as it looks like

equals	compareto
hash codes memory addresses ... i have to declare a and override the method int compareto t o1 to2
ok i can return 0 for instances which are considered equals
is the approach of using sortedmap or sortedset on equatable but by concept not comparable types good anyway

public	protected
make a class with a protected constructor
then you can create public static final fakeenum instances in your class
and then you can extend it and add some more things to it like so

put	get	getter	setter
i m not totally certain what you are asking but when tracing over someone else s code you should always assume that the property is doing something other than just getting and setting a value
although it s accepted practice to not put large amounts of code in getter and setter you can t just assume that since it s a property it will behave quickly
i always use properties to get and set methods where possible

udp	rtp	gst-launch	mpeg

try exporting the rtp file stream into a dump file in wireshark right-click an rtp packet follow udp stream save as and then send the file via gst-launch to be demuxed
you ll need to play around with this a bit but this should be the right idea the above is assuming the rtp is an mpeg ts stream

width	margin
i ve tried every margin trick i know but nothing
i have something as follows the parent div grows to the appropriate width to fit the largest child which is what i want
however the vertical scrollbar causes the inner width to be smaller which causes the largest child to wrap

submit	submission
i have a hibernate entity annotated like this i ve turned on mvc annotation support in my applicationcontext.xml file and i have a method in my controller that responds to a form submission when my app loads in the server i can see in the server log file that it loads a validator the problem i m having is that the validator doesn t seem to kick in
i turned on the debugger and when i get into the controller method the bindingresult contains 0 errors after i submit an empty form
the bindingresult does show that it contains the client object as a target. it then proceeds to insert a record without an id and throws an exception

pull	push
keeping a copy of a bare repo on your small laptop assumed authoritative will give you the flexibility to push to it using the file protocol when you re not at home
when you return home and have the small laptop on your lan simply do a git pull using the ssh protocol

and if your target users all have sl4 it might look very stylish
however many people who don t have sl will be put off and many many picky technical people will be dismayed or refuse to go there
if you had a site for skateboarders or graphic designers then it would be something you could probably get away with.

take the voice modem waveout device id set the voice output to that device id

this is all working fine if i compile the code as a windows console or forms application but as soon as i compile and run it as a windows service step 5 never occurs - voice modem calls but stays silent

this would output int param value is 12 string param value is viva int param value is 12 int param value is 12 int param value is 12 string param value is viva string param value is viva int param value is 12 string param value is viva string param value is viva for a new supported type you create a new class that supports the type and extends
implements foo bar and baz for that new type
create a new g method just one that has another parameter

onmousemove	onmouseover
in case someone wants to explain to me the strange mousemove behavior this is my test ps you do not need to lecture me about the use of innerhtml and onload this is quick and dirty on purpose
right now i use onmousemove but that sometimes only fires when the mouse is actually moved
same with onmouseover

inherited	properties	inherited	properties
let s say i have the following 2 interfaces and implementing classes or in vb.net public interface iskuitem properties sku as string end interface public interface icartitem inherits iskuitem properties quantity as integer properties isdiscountable as boolean end interface public class cartitem implements icartitem implemented properties end class interfaces are important in com interop for exposing properties and methods to intellisense in the vb6 ide per this article
however because icartitem is inherited from iskuitem sku is not explicitly defined in icartitem and thus is not visible in intellisense in vb6 and even throws a compiler error when trying to write to objcartitem.sku
i ve tried using shadows and overloads on the sku properties in iskuitem but then the compiler wants me to explicitly implement sku for both iskuitem and icartitem within the cartitem class

cheers pete
i have a class which uses a hashset and i want the class implements iterable i do not however want the class iterator to support the remove method
the default iterator of hashset is hashset.keyiterator which is a private class within the hashset class so i cannot simply extends it and override the remove method

the default iterator of hashset is hashset.keyiterator which is a private class within the hashset class so i cannot simply extends it and override the remove method
ideally i would like to avoid writing a wrapper class for keyiterator but i am at a loss as to how else i could easily and simply implements my own iterator in any other way
