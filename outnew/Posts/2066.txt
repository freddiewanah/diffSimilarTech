put	get
with binaries most other image formats the best you can get is a version history
we too just put the binaries in source control
we use git but it would apply just as well to subversion

mbunit	mstest
also lack of rowtest facilities in mstest
i suggest just running mbunit as a dependency inside the build process its easy enough to just float it with your bin and reference no installation required

apache	lighttpd
what you do is that you start your django fastcgi server in a separate process and then configures apache via rewrites to call this process when needed
or you can serve django without using apache but with another server that supports fastcgi natively the documentation mentions that you can do this if you don t have any apache specific needs
i guess the reason must be to save memory. lighttpd this is the server that runs youtube
