subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends
in this way i am saying that foouser subclass is not an account but does act like an editable object
likewise baraccount extends from account but is not a user subclass but implements editable listable and also versionable
adding all of these apis for editable listable and versionable into the abstract-class itself would not only be cluttered and ugly but would either duplicate the common interfaces in account and user or force my user object to implement versionable probably just to throw an exception
