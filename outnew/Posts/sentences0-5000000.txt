maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
we commit the pom.xml to the scs and the maven repository contains all our dependencies. for me that seems like a nice way to do it
maven helps quite a lot with this problem when i m coding java
we commit the pom.xml to the scs and the maven repository contains all our dependencies. for me that seems like a nice way to do it

int	chars
Pattern(s): 
meaning if you made a new integer you could call some method on i whereas with an int you cannot call any methods on it because it is simply a primitive
so would produce an error because int is not an object
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others
568
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others
i m not 100 sure but i m thinking that the int object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property like the tostring method for example
so int is a fancy way to work with an int just as perhaps string is a fancy way to work with a group of chars
669
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
with incremental crackers the time depends on how fast you can make the password hash function run
the better you can optimize your password hash function the faster your password hash function gets the weaker your scheme is
md5 and sha1 even conventional block ciphers like des are designed to be fast

robocopy	xcopy
Pattern(s): 
so start getting used to robocopy
use robocopy robust file copy
you get note xcopy is now deprecated please use robocopy
1331
robocopy	xcopy
Pattern(s): 
you get note xcopy is now deprecated please use robocopy
so start getting used to robocopy

1517
macvim	atom-editor	macvim	textmate	textmate	atom-editor
Pattern(s): 
in addition to the latest stable release there are also pre-release test builds and nightly builds and atom-editor feeds are provided for tracking all three release types
macvim works well and certainly looks more mature than vim-cocoa moreover there is a cocoa plugin architecture in the pipeline for macvim and someone is already working on a textmate style file browser tray plugin which is a huge ++ imho
there was also a carbon version of vim but this didn t offer a great deal over the terminal version
1517
emacs	aquamacs
Pattern(s): 
aquamacs is very usable and looks pretty good
supports both traditional mac os style keyboard shortcuts command-o command-s and the control meta shortcuts for those raised on traditional emacs
it is definitely more mac-like than carbon emacs
1517
emacs	atom-editor	emacs	aquamacs
Pattern(s): 
aquamacs has a more irregular schedule but it s seen some pretty major updates over the last year
gnu emacs for osx can be found at emacsformacosx.com
in addition to the latest stable release there are also pre-release test builds and nightly builds and atom-editor feeds are provided for tracking all three release types
1718
phpunit	simpletest
Pattern(s): 
the framework will run all the tests against your code and then report back success or failure of each test
phpunit is run from the linux command line by default though there are http interfaces available for it
simpletest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running imo
1718
phpunit	simpletest
Pattern(s): 
simpletest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running imo
in combination with xdebug phpunit can give you automated statistics for code coverage which some people find very useful
some teams write hooks from their subversion repository so that unit tests are run automatically whenever you commit changes
1821
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
crazy good i guess
for the conservative types me nunit is still available and still more than capable
for the microsoft-types mstest is adequate but slow and clunky compared to nunit
2068
mvp	presenter
Pattern(s): 
mvc pattern controller are based on behaviors and can be shared across views can be responsible for determining which view to display it is the best explanation on the web i could find
i blogged about this a while back quoting on todd snyder s excellent post on the difference between the two here are the key differences between the patterns mvp pattern view is more loosely coupled to the model
the presenter is responsible for binding the model to the view
2905
emacs	gedit
Pattern(s): 
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for
emacs is a wonderful text editor
it has huge power once you become a power user
2905
vim	emacs	vim	emacs	vim	gedit
Pattern(s): 
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
it is daunting at first as i m sure vim is too but the question was about text editors on linux besides vi.
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for
3806
robocopy	xcopy
Pattern(s): 
i ve been using it for years it s 2 thumbs up
besides the already mentioned robocopy xxcopy has a free version
its syntax is backwards compatible with xcopy but has tons of additional options xxcopy help x create a 42kb file with all the options available
3979
mbunit	nunit
Pattern(s): 
nunit does have a litter bit better tool support though
i am using resharper to run mbunit tests
i ve had problems with testdriven.net running my setup methods for mbunit
5108
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 
or ubuntu has some nice gui things that make it easy to control apache mysql php
this article has some of the best ways to lock things down some highlights make sure no one can browse the directories make sure only root has write privileges to everything and only root has read privileges to certain config files run mod_security the article also takes some pointers from this book apache securiy o reilly press as far as distros i ve run debain and ubuntu but it just depends on how much you want to do
i ran debian with no x and just ssh d into it whenever i needed anything
6713
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 
we didn t want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know testng because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests
also junit is pretty much the de-facto standard in the java world
there s no decent tool that doesn t support it from the box you can find a lot of help on the web and they added a lot of new features in the past year which shows it s alive
8381
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
i use it daily and it s great although not without it s share of bugs
for the rails side of things though i d actually suggest a virtual machine running linux. ubuntu works well the only caveat is that you have to install rubygems manually as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology - i suggest this because if you want to do advanced things such as installing imagemagick rmagick or memcached or a number of other plugins which require native c libraries it becomes very painful very quickly if you re on windows
a second reason is that unless you are very atypical your production server will likely be running linux too
9788
subtraction	addition	atomic	interlocked	atomic	interlocked
Pattern(s): 
you can use the methods on the interlocked class to protect these
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten
the interlocked class allows you to protect these using the compareexchange and increment methods
10062
erlang	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
so you might want to learn haskell ocaml or another functional language
the erlang provides an easy-to-use style of concurrent programming
you may never actually use erlang but the concepts are transportable to other languages
11663
post	get
Pattern(s): 
in general the things ms focuses on for each vary because the two languages are targeted at very different audiences
this blog post has a good summary of the target audiences
it is probably a good idea to determine which audience you are in because it will determine what kind of tools you ll get from microsoft
13618
gtk	fltk
Pattern(s): 
jari komppa has a good tutorial about them but you could use a more object-oriented approach with c++ than the c code he presents
i wouldn t use opengl for the gui unless you are planning for hardware accelerated and or 3d effects that you don t think you would get with a more traditional gui toolkit e.g qt wxwidgets gtk etc
if you just need a quick simple gui for hosting your opengl graphics then fltk is a nice choice
13942
imperative	declarative	imperative	declarative
Pattern(s): 
another debate implied in this argument though is declarative programming vs
imperative
declarative is usually better for anything where you really don t need the fine-grained control over how something is done
14179
emacs	jedit
Pattern(s): 
i replace notepad with notepad2 on every one of my windows machines
gnu emacs is my preferred text editor and it works well on windows copy paste actually works as expected it s also available on all major platforms so you can reuse your knowledge if you jump around oses like i tend to do
i really like jedit as well
17249
anjuta	kdevelop	anjuta	gnome	anjuta	kde
Pattern(s): 
kdevelop is a kde project but run on gnome
anjuta is an equivalent project on gnome but i find it unusable for real work
for the rest of the stack gcc make valgrind ddd a gdb ide and python for scripting my code
19056
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
code settings bindings references settingsbindableattribute inotifypropertychanged
i finally came up with a form subclass that solves this once and for all
to use it inherited from restorableform instead of form
20503
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
the only thing you can t extends is a final class
i can t remember if php is different in this respect but in java you can implements multiple interfaces but you can t inherit multiple abstract classes
i d assume php works the same way
20713
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
rss is not an official internet standards track protocol
however rss has enough adoption that you can reasonably expect it to be consumable by a variety of clients
as there are quite a few deprecated versions of rss you might conceivably have to support rss feed that vary quite a bit in their formatting details
20713
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
as there are quite a few deprecated versions of rss you might conceivably have to support rss feed that vary quite a bit in their formatting details
rss does not have a registered media content type
however enough publishers use the same unregistered content type that it is almost a defacto mime type
21277
int	double
Pattern(s): 
a similar technique can be used for double
the trick is to convert the floats so that they re ordered as if int and then just see how different they are
i have no idea why this damn thing is screwing up my underscores
21326
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
any function can be declared inline and putting the function body in the class definition is one way of doing that
you could also have done however it s up to the compiler if it actually does inline the function
vc++ pretty much ignores your requests for inlining
24174
anjuta	kdevelop	anjuta	gnome
Pattern(s): 
code blocks is also very promising and i like that one best
i hear anjuta is pretty slick for gnome users
i played a bit with kdevelop and it s nice but sort of lacking featurewise
24285
ftgl	freetype
Pattern(s): 
it allows for using any true type font via the freetype font library
you should also check out the ftgl library
ftgl is a free cross-platform open source c++ library that uses freetype2 to simplify rendering fonts in opengl applications
24308
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
you can t really argue against those properties - there is no trade-off made and it is always a cleaner way to modulize things
other aspects of oop including inherited and polymorphism are important too but as others have alluded to those are commonly over used
ie sometimes people use inherited and or polymorphism because they can not because they should have
26031
activator	dynamicmethod
Pattern(s): 
either way the difference is huge when you start getting into tight loops or multiple calls
if this is for something that will be called a lot in an application instance it s a lot faster to compile and cache dynamic code instead of using the activator or constructorinfo.invoke
two easy options for dynamic compilation are compiled linq expressions or some simple il opcodes and dynamicmethod
27256
jquery	scriptaculous
Pattern(s): 
to put some names out there prototype scriptaculous jquery dojo yui ...those all seem to have active users and contributers so they are probably worth reading up on to see if they meet your needs
jquery is good but with a little extra effort maybe you ll find that something else works better for you
good luck
27440
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql is much more commonly provided by web hosts
postgresql is a much more mature product
there s this discussion addressing your better question apparently according to this web page mysql is fast when concurrent access levels are low and when there are many more reads than writes
27993
centos	linux	redhat	fedora
Pattern(s): 
if you are running one of these linux flavours you might want to recompile perl from original source not rpm source
i realized that anyone running perl code with the distribution perl interpretter on redhat 5.2 centos 5.2 or fedora 9 is likely a victim
yes even if your code doesn t use the fancy bless overload idiom many cpan modules do
29923
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
Pattern(s): 
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it
most of the people were reluctant to move over as they have to type in two commands to commit and push bazaar ci + bazaar push
also it was difficult for them to understand the concept of branches and merging no one uses branches or merges them in svn
29972
teamcity	nant	nant	cruisecontrol
Pattern(s): 
here is an article i wrote about using ci with cruisecontrol.net it has a nant build script in the comments that can be re-used across projects continuous integration with cruisecontrol
i use teamcity with an nant build script
teamcity makes it easy to setup the ci server part and nant build script makes it easy to do a number of tasks as far as report generation is concerned
29972
cruisecontrol	teamcity	nant	cruisecontrol
Pattern(s): 
teamcity makes it easy to setup the ci server part and nant build script makes it easy to do a number of tasks as far as report generation is concerned
here is an article i wrote about using ci with cruisecontrol.net it has a nant build script in the comments that can be re-used across projects continuous integration with cruisecontrol

30197
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
here s the relevant documentation for gears workerpool api whatwg has a draft recommendation for worker threads web workers and there s also mozilla s dom worker threads update june 2009 current state of browser support for javascript threads firefox 3.5 has web workers
some demos of web workers if you want to see them in action simulated annealing try it link space invaders link at end of post moonbat javascript benchmark first link the gears plugin can also be installed in firefox
safari 4 and the webkit nightlies have worker threads javascript ray tracer chrome has gears baked in so it can do threads although it requires a confirmation prompt from the user and it uses a different api to web workers although it will work in any browser with the gears plugin installed google gears workerpool demo not a good example as it runs too fast to test in chrome and firefox although ie runs it slow enough to see it blocking interaction ie8 and ie9 can only do threads with the gears plugin installed
30598
subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
in this way i am saying that foouser subclass is not an account but does act like an editable object
likewise baraccount extends from account but is not a user subclass but implements editable listable and also versionable
adding all of these apis for editable listable and versionable into the abstract-class itself would not only be cluttered and ugly but would either duplicate the common interfaces in account and user or force my user object to implement versionable probably just to throw an exception
31574
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 
also don t forget that the order of attributes can be reversed and that other attributes can appear in the tag
note single quotes even no quotes if the value doesn t contain a spaces is valid according to the w3c html spec
quote by default sgml requires that all attribute values be delimiter using either double quotation marks ascii decimal 34 or single quotation marks ascii decimal 39 .
32521
prng	random	prng	random
Pattern(s): 
personally i do think there are places where constant random data is useful in testing - after you think you ve done all your carefully-thought-out corners using stimuli from a prng can sometimes find other things
there is a half-way house here which has some use which is to seed your prng with a constant
that allows you to generate random data which is repeatable
34338
phpunit	simpletest
Pattern(s): 
simpletest also ships with a very simple html gui which is quite easy to extend if you want to
as far as i know phpunit does not include a html gui but there are gui s available to download such as cool

34681
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
sha-1 and md5 also suffer from message extension attacks which can fatally weaken your application if you re not careful
a more modern hash such as whirpool is a better choice
it does not suffer from these message extension attacks and uses the same mathematics as aes uses to prove security against a variety of attacks
36867
wordpress	expressionengine
Pattern(s): 
for simple cms sites we use expressionengine which uses html-like tags for inserting logic into templates
if you decide to continue using functions you can get some inspiration from wordpress
you can probably reduce the program to a minimum by making templates more granular
37368
single-sign-on	siteminder
Pattern(s): 
crowd may be better but is again not free
you could consider some kind of single-sign-on software
i am unaware of any that are free and i ve only ever used siteminder which is neither free nor good
37408
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd	daemons	launchd
Pattern(s): 
the use of a unix-domain socket means that the erlang daemons could be launchd on-demand by launchd and the cocoa front-end could find the path to the socket to use via an environment variable
that makes the rendezvous between the app and the daemons trivial and it also makes it straightforward to develop multiple front-ends or possibly a framework that wraps communication with the daemons
the mac os x launchd systemd is really cool this way
37660
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
i use postgresql and my answer works correctly there i tried it
see the postgresql update docs under parameters expression where it mentions that expressions on the right hand side of set clauses explicitly use the old values of columns
i see that the corresponding mysql update docs contain the statement single-table update assignments are generally evaluated from left to right which implies the behaviour you describe
37716
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
random bit strings are obtained by taking a md5 hash of the contents of this pool
the one-way hash function distills the true random bits from pool data and hides the state of the pool from adversaries
the dev random routine maintains an estimate of true randomness in the pool and decreases it every time random strings are requested for use
37854
ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql	ingres	postgresql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
if you trace microsoft sql server back to its roots i think you ll find ingres - one of the very first relational databases written in the 70s
and postgresql was originally written by some of the same people in the 80s as a successor to ingres
oracle goes way back and i m not sure where mysql came in
39105
direct3d	directx
Pattern(s): 
having said that opengl will be easier to start programming with
as direct3d is based heavily in com it has a steep learning curve
if it were me i would be choosing directx over opengl
40699
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
you might find a more conclusive answer on the development site dev.chromium.org and some of the developers might be on irc on #chromium on freenode
google-chrome does support the netscape plugin api but that is for displaying certain kinds of content
you seem to be after a extention api really firefox is the only major browser to encourage and support third party extentions to browsing capability that aren t simply new toolbars nothing in the developer documentation points to a browser enhancing api - google seem to want to keep a tight reign on the look and feel of the application
41521
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
one is the usual click button and the other is a toggle button that acts similar to a checkbox
the default property of the commandbutton is actually the value property that indicates whether a button is toggled
by setting the property the click event is generated
44576
profiling	debugging	profiling	debugging
Pattern(s): 
they may be useful as a debugging aid however
i choose to log deliberately as i go as this means the log data is meaningful depending on logging framework you can add level severity category information so that the log data can be filtered you can make sure that the right level of information is present not too much not too little you know when writing the code which the most important things are and can therefore ensure they are logged using some form of code injection profiling or tracing tool to generate logs would most likely generate verbose less useful logs that would be harder to dive into
they may be useful as a debugging aid however
45421
ogre	irrlicht
Pattern(s): 
recently irrlicht has acquired official .net bindings allowing users to develop in .net languages such as vb.net c# and boo
there is also ogre 3d and also axiom engine

47909
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
also the tcp header contains a lot of overhead intended for different signals and message delivery detection
for a message exchange udp will probably suffice if a small chance of failure is acceptable
if receipt must be verified tcp is your best option
48001
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
another wrinkle in subclassing naming is multiple-level hierarchies
... rather than blindly prepend the modifiers to the immediate superclass think about the name from the reader s perspective
use that superclass as the basis for the subclassing name. interface two styles of naming interfaces depend on how you are thinking of the interfaces
49821
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
always always store the uploaded files in a directory somewhere outside the document root and access them via some accessing-script which does additional sanitizing and at least explicitly sets a image whatever mime type
also i would recommend not to let the users upload into a folder that s accessible from the web
even the best mime type detection may fail and you absolutely don t want users to upload say an executable disguised as a jpeg in a case where your mime sniffing fails but the one in iis works correctly
51511
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
this should only be a big problem if you have a very popular application
both database and filesystem session stores are usually backed by disk so you can have a lot of sessions cheaply because disk are cheap but requests will often have to wait for the data to be read because disk are slow
memcached sessions use ram so will cost more to support the same number of concurrent sessions because ram is expensive but may be faster because ram is fast
52633
width	margin
Pattern(s): 
your problem is that the 100 width does not include any padding or margin values
these values are added on top of the 100 width thus the overflow

52896
width	margin	width	margin
Pattern(s): 
the correct box model states that the width applies only to the content and padding and margin add on to it
so therefore your are getting 100 plus a 20px right and left padding equaling 100 +40px as the total width
the original ie box model also known as quirks mode includes padding and margin in the width
53056
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring
Pattern(s): 
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for trivia the worst performance i have ever seen was when someone by mistake returned a constant from gethashcode easy to spot with a debugger though especially if you do lots of lookups in your hashtable
whether you want a perfect hashfunction different value for each object that evaluates to equals or just a pretty good one is always a performance tradeoff it takes normally time to compute a good hashfunction and if your dataset is smallish you re better of with a fast function
the most important as your second post points out is correctness and to achieve that all you need is to return the length of the array
53056
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring
Pattern(s): 
if it isn t say all your arrays are equally long you can go with something cheap like looking at the first and last value and xoring their values and then add more complexity as you see fit for your data
a quick way to see how your hashfunction performs on your data is to add all the data to a hashtable and count the number of times the equals function gets called if it is too often you have more work to do on the function
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for trivia the worst performance i have ever seen was when someone by mistake returned a constant from gethashcode easy to spot with a debugger though especially if you do lots of lookups in your hashtable
54968
prepare	execute
Pattern(s): 
edit i think i found your bug here
from the documentation a prepare statement is a server-side object that can be used to optimize performance
when the prepare statement is execute the specifie statement is parsed rewritten and planned
55904
pbkdf2	salt
Pattern(s): 
ensuring that the attacker doesn t have a pre-computed dictionary corresponding to that particular salt is sufficient
key generation i would recommend using a recognized algorithm such as pbkdf2 defined in pkcs #5 version 2.0 to generate a key from your password
it s similar to the algorithm you outline but is capable of generating longer symmetric keys for use with aes
57668
goto	break
Pattern(s): 
thus continue not nearly as harmful
goto can be used as a continue but not the reverse
you can goto anywhere thus break flow control arbitrarily
57806
goto	break	goto	break
Pattern(s): 
but continue and break are enforced by the compiler and have their own associated rules
goto has no such limitations though the net effect might almost be the same in some circumstances
i do not consider continue or break to be harmful per se though i m sure either can be used poorly in a way that would make any sane programmer gag
58091
post	put
Pattern(s): 
i guess i wouldn t say this is a procedural approach necessarily -- it s just a misleading name you would assume in the modern oo world that a post object would be stateful and provide methods to manipulate and manage a set of post objects
if every method is just a static call straight to the data source then the post class is really a factory
you could certainly put the static methods in post into the post class this is how csla works but they are still factory methods
58363
memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 
both are in-memory caching solutions with dead-simple apis and lots of libraries
the trouble with those 2 is you need to install them on your web server or another server if it s memcached
apc pros simple fast speeds up php execution also cons doesn t work for distributed systems each machine stores its cache locally memcached pros fast ish can be installed on a separate server for all web servers to use highly tested developed at livejournal used by all the big guys facebook yahoo mozilla cons slower than apc possible network latency slightly more configuration i wouldn t recommend writing your own there are plenty out there
58587
nunit	mspec
Pattern(s): 
if however you just mean the style of bdd that relates to unit testing xspec though you can get away with adding a framework though things like specunit do add some synctactic sugar but you might want to look at mspec is also interesting
nunit and rhino suit well and the auto-mocking container might be of interest
if you re looking at bdd too then nbehave is probably a good choice
58785
robocopy	xcopy
Pattern(s): 
the command is robocopy .
robocopy robocopy or robust file copy is a command-line directory and or file replication command
robocopy functionally replaces xcopy with more options
59054
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
it s often better not to keep the data at all but to keep the hashed version so bad guys can t easily use it
as your co-worker suggests this can be trivially defeated by running the same hash algorithm against a dictionary and using rainbow tables to pull the info out
the usual solution is to use a secret salt plus additional user information to make the hashed results unique- something like as long as your salt is secret or your attacker doesn t know the precise creation date of the user s record a dictionary attack will fail- even in the event that they are able to pull down the password field
60077
children	parent	children	parent
Pattern(s): 
for example the unix fork call returns the child pid in the parent process and 0 in the child process createprocess on windows returns iirc the pid of the new process created
as far as i know a process doesn t have an explicit list of its children s pids but it can easily be built since a process should know which child processes it spawns
for example the unix fork call returns the child pid in the parent process and 0 in the child process createprocess on windows returns iirc the pid of the new process created
60119
cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 
at this point you will be able to run your localhost over https
cassini does not support https
however you can use iis to do this if your using iis 5.1 download the ms iis toolpack for iis 6.0 it comes with a tool to create self signed ssl certificates
60315
internationalization	translation
Pattern(s): 
when i tried to find a reasonably priced replacement i did not find one
in my experience internationalization requires a little more than translating strings
many strings when translation require more space on a dialog
60531
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
finally you can do as vadim suggests and put cd c dir_a in your .emacs file to make that directory the default no matter how you start emacs
the default folder is actually the same as the current working folder for the buffer it can be different for every file you work with
say that the file you are working with is located in c dir_a then the working directory for that buffer will by default be c dir_a
60759
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
if your hash algorithm includes the username replacing the password hash with another one will not work
unix stores hash in a a text file etc shadow which is accessible only to privileged users
passwords are encrypted with a salt
60879
ready	each
Pattern(s): 
see how to convince a company to switch their source control then apply known-good practices check in often pick up others changes often to simplify merging use fast unit tests to make sure each change meets a minimum bar require that that the checked-in code always builds and always passes tests
now you won t be production ready at this point you will still need a couple weeks to test fix before you can deploy
getting that time down is awesome for you and awesome for your customer so invest in high quality automated acceptance tests
61138
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
in terms of memory management unlike everything else i ve listed it s not garbage collected though that s now an option on mac os x 10.5 but it does have a reference counting scheme which makes life significantly simpler than managing memory by hand
lisp - i ve never learnt it myself beyond what i needed for minor emacs hacking
as i understand it the libraries were nice in their day but though the language remains supremely elegant they ve fallen a little behind the times
61232
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
when p is -1 which is then converted from a signed chars to a signed int it is still -1 which has a representation of 0xffffffff which is not equal to 0xff
int literals have signed int type
since 0xff is a signed int the compiler converts p to a signed int and then does the comparison
62848
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 
but i m pretty sure g++ v4 is the standard development c++ compiler if you install the c++ development environment at all
g++ v3 is usually just available as a special install
for opensuse 11 gcc 4.3 is the current package installed when you pick the base development pattern
64422
cpu	processors	cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
in my example you can see cpu0 through cpu3 for a total of 4 processors
from now on you can ignore cpu0..cpu3 and focus only on the cpu line
next you need to know that the fourth number in these lines is a measure of idle time and thus the fourth number on the cpu line is the total idle time for all processors since boot time
64604
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
there is also boost while not a gui library boost is a really great complement to c++ s stl
in fact some of the boost libraires will be added in the next c++ standard

65415
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
javascript uses prototype-based object orientation and provides the ability to extends types at runtime an object delegates all access to attributes that it doesn t contain itself to its prototype another object
this can be used to implements inheritance but is actually more powerful even if more cumbersome

65603
ndepend	fxcop
Pattern(s): 
however fxcop does not detect all methods without upstream callers as it is meant to check in the case that your code is part of a library so public members are left out
you can use ndepend to do a search for public members with no upstream callers which i detail here in this other stackoverflow answer
edit added information about gendarme which actually does what the questioner asked
66678
decimal	ieee
Pattern(s): 
floats were according to ieee 754 always binary only the new standard ieee 754r defined decimal formats
many of the fractional binary parts can never equal the exact decimal representation
any binary number can be written as m 2 n m n positive integers any decimal number as
66956
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
if you need to navigate up the tree then the node class needs a link to its parent node
build an addchild method that takes care of all the minutia of these two points and any other business logic that must be implemented child limits sorting the children etc.

67611
effort	xunit.net
Pattern(s): 
what would have traditionally taken days of qa and boat loads of stress was instead a short and enjoyable experience
prep up front a little bit of extra effort and it pays 10-fold later on when you have to start dicking around with core features functionality
i bought this book - it s a bible of xunit.net testing knowledge - tis probably one of the most referenced books on my shelf and i consult it daily link text
69040
actionscript	mxml
Pattern(s): 
mxmlc an actionscript and mxml compiler to output the final swf file for deployment to flash player. 2
compc a static library compiler for actionscript that outputs swc files. 3
asdoc a documentation generator built on the compiler technology
69641
plpgsql	plpython
Pattern(s): 
of course if speed is a serious concern c is the way to go
i write pretty much everything in plpgsql but i m also a database guy first and foremost so it generally suits me better than any other language
but there s plenty of things that it doesn t do very well in which case another language such as plperl or plpython is a good bet
70083
magento	oscommerce
Pattern(s): 
compared to something like oscommerce though it wins hands down
magento is pretty good and really powerful but getting to grips with how to go about extending replacing things is pretty tricky
the codebase is massively flexible and just about anything can be replaced or extended but there s very little documentation on how to go about doing it
70423
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average
quicksort is the fastest sorting algorithm in practice but has a number of pathological cases that can make it perform as badly as o n2
heapsort is guaranteed to run in o n ln n and requires only finite additional storage
70427
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
i m a bigger fan of mergesort than i am of quicksort for these reasons
quicksort has a better average case complexity but in some applications it is the wrong choice
quicksort is vulnerable to denial of service attacks
70428
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort	mergesort	in-place	heapsort	in-place
Pattern(s): 
note that when operating on linked lists mergesort only requires a small constant amount of auxiliary storage.
from the wikipedia entry on quicksort quicksort also competes with mergesort another recursive sort algorithm but with the benefit of worst-case θ nlogn running time. mergesort is a stable sort unlike quicksort and heapsort and can be easily adapted to operate on linked lists and very large lists stored on slow-to-access media such as disk storage or network attached storage. although quicksort can be written to operate on linked lists it will often suffer from poor pivot choices without random access
the main disadvantage of mergesort is that when operating on arrays it requires θ n auxiliary space in the best case whereas the variant of quicksort with in-place partitioning and tail recursion uses only θ logn space
70428
mergesort	in-place
Pattern(s): 
the main disadvantage of mergesort is that when operating on arrays it requires θ n auxiliary space in the best case whereas the variant of quicksort with in-place partitioning and tail recursion uses only θ logn space
note that when operating on linked lists mergesort only requires a small constant amount of auxiliary storage.

70430
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
in the worst case they are the same amount of algorithmic time but mergesort requires more storage
wikipedia s explanation is typically quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other θ nlogn algorithms because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures and in most real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the probability of requiring quadratic time
quicksort mergesort i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is ω n that quicksort implementations don t have
70631
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 
it achieves this by limiting the recursion depth and switching to a different algorithm heapsort once it exceeds log n
quicksort has o n 2 worst-case runtime and o n log n average case runtime
however it s superior to merge sort in many scenarios because many factors influence an algorithm s runtime and when taking them all together quicksort wins out
70741
subtract	addition
Pattern(s): 
in the first loop you can use plain addition since you are only ever oring with single bits and you can narrow the scope of by iterating over indices
in the second loop you can subtract 1 from the index instead of producing an unnecessary 0th output list element that needs to be shift ed off and where you unnecessarily iterate m n times where m is the number of output lists and n is the number of unique elements iterating over the unique elements would reduce the iterations to just n which is a significant win in typical use cases where m is much larger than n and would simplify the code
note also that once thought of in this way the result gathering process can be written very concisely with the aid of the list part module but note that list_compare is a terrible name
70848
openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd
Pattern(s): 
edit whether popen produces unidirectional or bidirectional pipes depends on the implementation
in linux and openbsd popen produces unidirectional pipes which are read-only or write-only
on os x freebsd and netbsd popen produces bidirectional pipes
71105
rtl	hdl	rtl	verilog
Pattern(s): 
here is one that runs on windows supposedly
the verification of logical systems in the ic design arena is known as design verification which is the process of ensuring that the system you design in hardware rtl implements the desired functionality
ladder logic can be transformed to one of the modern hdl s like verilog
71642
textmate	notepad++	textmate	jedit
Pattern(s): 
other editors in the past i did take a look at notepad++ but that was a while ago and it didn t have a nice way to define your own syntax highlighting which is important for me
i also paid for textmate and ultraedit at different times both very good but in the end jedit comes out on top for me
i also used eclipse for a year or so
72219
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
example md5 x y z is unique and you can store only the resulting string
the hash is not a performant idea but you get the concept
find any methematic unique transformation and you have it
73863
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
these commands will make a good guess and then possibly set a binary svn mime-type property on the file being added. if subversion guesses wrong the user can always remove or hand-edit the property. hand editing would be done by svn propset svn mime-type some type filename.extension
from page 367 of the subversion book in the most general sense subversion handles binary files more gracefully than cvs does. because cvs uses rcs it can only store successive full copies of a changing binary file. subversion however expresses differences between files using a binary differencing algorithm regardless of whether they contain textual or binary data
that means all files are stored differentially compressed in the repository
73946
post	get
Pattern(s): 
obtaining a range allows you to get set all of the data you want in one call which can have huge performance benefits but it requires you to use explicit details rather than iterating through each entry
this msdn forum post shows a vb.net developer asking a question about getting the results of a range as an array

75638
lua	scheme
Pattern(s): 
the guys behind lua have repeatedly listed scheme and lisp as major influences on lua and lua has even been described as scheme without the parentheses
lua
it s used as a scripting extension language for a number of games like world of worcraft and applications snort nmap wireshark etc
75638
lua	scheme
Pattern(s): 
it s used as a scripting extension language for a number of games like world of worcraft and applications snort nmap wireshark etc
in fact according to an adobe developer adobe s lightroom is over 40 lua
the guys behind lua have repeatedly listed scheme and lisp as major influences on lua and lua has even been described as scheme without the parentheses
75883
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
in almost all compiler for all platform an unsigned chars is simply a byte
an unsigned int of usually 8 bits
that can be treated as a small int or a pack of bits
76012
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
i believe scheme has the same facility but i m not as familiar with it -- see the scheme sources for the arc programming language
as a simple example let s suppose you want lisp to use curly braces rather than parentheses
this requires something like the following reader definitions you re telling lisp that the is like a and that the is like a
76040
xna	slimdx
Pattern(s): 
i m personally using it for my hobby game projects and it has treated me very well
xna isn t the only alternative though
there is also slimdx which is under constant development as a means of providing a lean wrapper of directx in a similar fashion as managed directx which was i believe discontinued by microsoft in favor of xna
77328
textmate	textwrangler	textmate	bbedit
Pattern(s): 
some more obscure languages are not as well-supported in it but for most purposes it s fantastic
the only devs i know who like textmate are ruby fans
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more
77777
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
at least with sqlite you get atomicity so you are assured that your application will start with the same state as when the last database write was made
i wouldn t use xml for storing rss items
a feed reader makes constant updates as it receives data
77794
bazaar	git	bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
it is very easy to lose a commit or ruin a repository especially if you do not understand the inner workings of git
mercurial and bazaar resemble themselves very much on the surface
they both provide basic distributed version control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git
77794
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
git well is not for the uninitiated
it is much faster than both mercurial and bazaar and was written to manage the linux kernel
it is the fastest of the three and it is also the most powerful of the three by quite a margin
77943
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
Pattern(s): 
git is fastest but all three are fast enough
bazaar is the most flexible it has transparent read-write support for svn repositories and cares a lot about the user experience
mercurial is somewhere in the middle
77945
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
with o n 2 worst case that rarely happens quicksort is potentially far slower than the o nlogn of the merge sort
quicksort has less overhead so with small n and slow computers it is better
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases
78383
atomic	compare-and-swap
Pattern(s): 
oh version 2.0 of that processor didn t do the cache-coherency snooping at the right time it s fixed in version 2.0.1 but on 2.0 you need to insert a nop . just slapping a volatile keyword on a variable in c is almost always insufficient
on mac os x that means you need to use the functions listed in atomic 3 to perform truly atomic-across-all-cpus operations on 32-bit 64-bit and pointer-sized quantities
use the latter for any atomic operations on pointers so you re 32 64-bit compatible automatically. that goes whether you want to do things like atomic compare-and-swap increment decrement spin locking or stack queue management
78446
matplotlib	chaco
Pattern(s): 
the main advantages of chaco are its speed relative to matplotlib and its integration with enthought s traits api for interactive applications
for interactive work matplotlib is the mature standard
it provides an oo-style api as well as a matlab-style interactive api
79118
asterisk	pbx
Pattern(s): 
and also classical telephony t1 e1 fxo fxs etc with the help of interface cards from digium and other suppliers sangoma rhino etc . you can find more info about asterisk at asterisk is an open source software pbx that runs primarily on linux
lumenvox speech engine is a commercial speech recognition solution digium sangoma and rhino are telephony card manufacturers that are compatiible with asterisk

79771
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 
for example 0.72 is represented as the integer 72
addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as 0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiply followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44
80740
sbrk	setrlimit
Pattern(s): 
the stack grows automatically when accessed up to a size set by the kernel which can be adjusted with setrlimit rlimit_stack ...
the heap grows when the memory allocator invokes the brk or sbrk system call mapping more pages of physical memory into the process s virtual address space
in systems without virtual memory such as some embedded systems the same basic layout often applies except the stack and heap are fixed in size
80805
rtos	qnx
Pattern(s): 
most embedded operating systems will provide similar functionality
another way to define real-time is by evaluating the capabilities of the many rtos s real-time operating systems
e.g qnx s definition is here
83316
redmine	trac
Pattern(s): 
trac is also popular but it lacks suport for aggregation of data across projects
i like redmine for this
the only thing it s missing from your criteria is voting but there might even be a plugin for this
84763
activeperl	perldoc
Pattern(s): 
so if perldoc uses a different pager this might not work
activeperl comes with html documentation you can open perlvar in your browser hit ctrl+f and type env then hit enter

85803
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
we still have few problems with the postgresql one
we did a move from a mysql3 to postgresql 8.2 then 8.3
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok
85846
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
the mod_rewrite solution is also very nifty i ve used it to secure a lot of applications on my own website
use to tell if it is ssl and redirect to the right place if not
and remember the page that displays the form does not need to be fed via https it s the post back url that needs it most
86173
jython	pypy
Pattern(s): 
pypy is an experimental interpreter compiler that may one day supplant cpython but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas
jython and ironpython are useful if you have an overriding need to interface with existing libraries written in a different platform like if you have 100 000 lines of java and you just want to write a 20-line python script
not particularly useful for anything else in my opinion because they are perpetually a few versions behind cpython due to community inertia
86590
ferret	sphinx
Pattern(s): 
this was one of the big selling points for me
when you do have to mass index your data ferret is definitely slower than acts_as_sphinx by a factor of 3
i ended up writing my own method to re-index models which works as fast as sphinx -- it basically preloads all the data from the db instead of going record by record to create the new index
86590
ferret	sphinx	ferret	sphinx
Pattern(s): 
i ended up writing my own method to re-index models which works as fast as sphinx -- it basically preloads all the data from the db instead of going record by record to create the new index
the ferret documentation is good for the basics but it s a bit sparse once you get into more complex searches sorts and using a drb server to host a remote index
that being said it feels a much more mature product than acts_as_sphinx although i have limited experience with sphinx
87006
accurev	svn	accurev	cvs
Pattern(s): 
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths
you can use accurev distributed solution accureplica for that - which mean you have one single master server and as many as you want replicas on remote sites so those with the slow link won t suffer much above all accurev brings a unique approach - a truly new concept design implementation of stream-based scm tool
not in the bad way clearcase-ucm did that because clearcase streams were eventually branches but in slick modern way
87861
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
you didn t specify the memory layout of the inputs and outputs so it s impossible to write sample code
since you re on x86 you need 4 mull instructions
split the 64bit quantities into two 32bit words and multiply the low words to the lowest and 2nd lowest word of the result then both pairs of low and high word from different numbers they go to the 2nd and 3rd lowest word of the result and finally both high words into the 2 highest words of the result
88049
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
a http response is started such as as a webservice user fetches get ticket number for user account
username donkey key 99754106633f94d350db34d548d6091a server checks if his calculated hash is the same as the one submitted
advantages of this method -server never knows password only salt hash
88049
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
advantages of this method -server never knows password only salt hash
-even the hash is never transmitted through the wire - no replay attacks

89299
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
this means you can just check out the full thing or if you already have the full thing then cut paste the www directory out to somewhere else and it will remain linked to the correct cvs location
cvs is tied to the repository by files in the .cvs folder
each folder is tied individually
89530
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
here s an example nginx configuration for running a wordpress blog through php fastcgi note i ve also put in the nginx equivalent of the wordpress .htaccess so you will also have fancy urls already working with this config here s the fastcgi.conf file i m including in the above config i put it in a separate file so all of my virtual host config files can include it in the right place but you don t have to do this i also happen to do what the nginx wiki suggests and use spawn-fcgi from lighttpd as my cgi-spawner lighttpd is a pretty fast compile w o weird dependencies so a quick and easy thing to install but you can also use a short shell perl script for that
actually since you re using nginx you re already in great shape and don t need apache
you can run php through fastcgi there are examples of how to do this in the nginx wiki and use a url-matching pattern in your nginx configuration to direct some urls to rails and others to php
89677
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
example tcp 192.168.1.21 sql2k5 1443
if you re connecting to a named instance and udp is not available when connecting to it then you may need to specify the protocol as well
example tcp 192.168.1.21 sql2k5 1443
90040
put	get
Pattern(s): 
you could not get a 100 but still have tested all your 80 freq used code-paths
having tests that test every throw exceptiontypex or similar defensive programming guard you ve put in is a nice to have not a must have so trust yourself or your developers to be thorough and cover every path through their code
be pragmatic and don t chase the magical 100 coverage
91848
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
the 2005 versioning only installs into visual studio 2005
to download the 2008 versioning see the following link note that if you have previously applied sp1 of visual studio 2008 then you will need to run it again once installing team explorer
for what it is worth i would encourage you to upgrade to tfs 2008 on the server side as soon as you can
93822
move	drag
Pattern(s): 
drag or momentum can just be encoded as a basic resistance to motion and amount to throttling the movements
it can be applied differentially things can move slower based on how far they ve gone where they are in space how many other nodes are close etc.
hope this helps
94119
junit	easymock	junit	easymock
Pattern(s): 
also if you don t have an interface but you want to mock a concrete class easymock has a class extension
if you are using junit to test use mocks instead of stubs
read martin fowler s seminal article mocks aren t stubs i recommend the easymock framework it works like a charm automatically mocking your interface using reflection
94447
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
suppose this method is changed in the parent class to this change will not cause any compile time errors or warnings - but it completely changes the intended behavior of the subclassing
to answer your question you should use the override annotation if the lack of a method with the same signature in a superclass is indicative of a bug

95586
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
the url was aydsman s answer is correct more info here i can t think of any use-case for an exception with non-serializable members but if you avoid attempting to serialize deserialize them in getobjectdata and the deserialization constructor you should be ok
also mark them with the nonserialized attribute more as documentation than anything else since you are implementing the serializable yourself

97431
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
it is not real ie it s mainly only its rendering engine html+css+js plus web client http and some more protocols control itself has no menu bookmarks etc
google-chrome is full featured browser
so you should be asking for webkit rendering engine google-chrome use developed by safari s guys control
98367
copying	overwrite
Pattern(s): 
if you want to try it out use when in vim
i d actually suggest just copying the contents to your .vimrc as it s well commented and a good place to start learning how to use vim
you can do this by this will overwrite your current .vimrc but if all you have in there is the indent settings davr suggested i wouldn t sweat it as the example vimrc will take care of that for you as well
98589
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
so for genuine portability issues which mostly are implementation-dependent rather than unspecified or undefined but i think that falls into the spirit of the question chars is not necessarily un signed
int can be any size from 16 bits
floats are not necessarily ieee-formatted or conformant
99194
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
the while loops is appropriate for polling or where the number of loops to meet exit condition will change based on activity inside loops
i would agree that the for-loop is clearer and more appropriate when iterating
the while loops is appropriate for polling or where the number of loops to meet exit condition will change based on activity inside loops
99221
x86	mips
Pattern(s): 
weather learning mips assembly is useful to you depends on what career you plan to follow
personally i think x86 x64 popular in pcs directly applicable if you write c++ or c# on pc ppc gaining popularity used in game consoles and also exposes you to risc or arm used in a lot of embedded devices such as mobile phones might be better choices to learn

99235
x86	mips	x86	mips
Pattern(s): 
most compilers will dump assembly code for you on request instead of going on to machine code and linking. that said mips asm is probably useless because almost nobody uses mips now
sgi used to but now their machines are all on x86 ia-64 chips. if you find assembly language appealing and want to work in assembly further learn the arm instruction set
arm is only a little more complex than mips and virtually all mobile phones smart phones and pdas now use arm chips made by dozens of manufacturers
100146
metaclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
to create your own metaclass in python you really just want to subclassing type
a metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory
like you create an instance of the class by calling the class python creates a new class when it executes the class statement by calling the metaclass
102717
extjs	gxt
Pattern(s): 
there is a difference extjs gwt is the one that is actually produced by the company that wrote extjs the javascript library
gwt extjs is a gwt wrapper around the extjs library
gxt is native gwt
102717
extjs	gxt	extjs	gxt
Pattern(s): 
however the future is with gxt as it s native gwt and actually developed by the company that made extjs
gwt extjs is somewhat crippled as the license changed on the extjs library thus slowing the development of gwt extjs
overall i think gwt gxt is a good solution for developing a web application
103227
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
you re now completely immune to rainbow table attack
comparing hash is a good solution
make sure that you don t just salt all the credit card numbers with the same constant salt though
104095
cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 
cassini is not ment to be a replacement
cassini is ment to be a light waight test webserver
the idea is that a developer does not need to have iis installed and configured to test his application
105570
maven	m2e	maven	cargo
Pattern(s): 
anyway if you re planning to read in your spare time here s a free book pdf format maven the definitive guide hope it helps
maven would be just fine for what you want to do
unlike most build tools maven uses conventions wisely well better than many others at least and it has plugins for every area you mentioned unit tests maven surefire plugin eclipse integration m2e deploying war file war plugin and deploy plugin maven can also help you in integration tests on tomcat if you have some since you can start stop or deploy a war using the cargo plugin

106334
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
in your example you would want something like this select o.id o.address o.otherdetails group_concat concat e.firstname e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql - edit postgresql 9.0 is equally simple now that string_agg expression delimiter is built-in
here it is with comma-space between elements select o.id o.address o.otherdetails string_agg e.firstname || || e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql before 9.0 allows you to define your own aggregate functions with create aggregate
slightly more work than mysql but much more flexible
107415
post	put
Pattern(s): 
an http put is supposed to accept the body of the request and then store that at the resource identified by the uri
an http post is more general
it is supposed to initiate an action on the server
107883
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 
if instead we want to say that a function grows exactly as quickly as some other function we use theta to make that point i ll write t f n to mean theta of f n in markdown
t g n is short hand for being bounded from above and below by g n again up to a scaling factors and asymptotically
that is f n t g n f n o g n and g n o f n
108030
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
if you want to get reliability out of udp then you re basically going to be re-implementing some of tcp s features on top of udp which will probably make things slower than just using tcp in the first place
there are various standard reliable udp protocols out there what experiences do you have with them
i think you really need to prove to yourself that tcp is in fact too slow for your needs if you need reliability in your protocol
108451
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
tcp is generally as fast as it gets for reliable streaming of data from one host to another
however if your application does a lot of small bursts of traffic and waiting for responses udp may be more appropriate to minimize latency
there is an easy middle ground
109038
cairngorm	puremvc	cairngorm	flex
Pattern(s): 
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t
cairngorm is full of anti-patterns like heavy use of global variables puremvc hides the worst parts of itself
puremvc is anti-flex cairngorm just doesn t use many of the good parts of flex
110037
jxtable	jtable
Pattern(s): 
it s freely available from jdnc swinglabs
look into jxtable
jxtable is an extension of jtable that supports multi-column sorting as well as other functions that jtable doesn t provide
110162
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql is a pretty popular database lots of tools are available and lots of books
sqlite and postgresql are also quite popular and also free open-source

110296
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
if you want to apply the properties in the first set of brackets to .d as well it will need to be specified in the selector list
you also need to separate the selectors with commas so they become a list not an inherited
example
110621
accessor	properties	accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
an easier way is to use anonymous methods this will work in .net 2.0 or later let s use a slightly modified version of your code example for a properties named foo of type int that is part of a class someclass
you can use reflection you can get a methodinfo object for the get set accessor and call it s invoke method
the code example assumes you have both a get and set accessor and you really have to add error handling if you want to use this in production code for example to get the value of properties foo of object obj you can write to set it so you can pass obj.gettype .getproperty foo .getaccessors 0 to your method and execute it s invoke method
112465
short	base	short	base
Pattern(s): 
i ve noticed my self included people tend to use interfaces to group classes together when really that should be handled by a base class
in short yes it is possible to over interface a project
take into account when the situation really calls for an abstract base class and an interface while they both are similar there are distinct advantages to using both see here
112505
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
Pattern(s): 
there is no generally accepted canvas class for gtk+
you can use qgraphicsview in pyqt
each state is a new qgraphicsitem which is either a bitmap or a path object
113048
width	margin
Pattern(s): 
there s been plenty of other questions on here about when to use and when not to use tables which may help explain when and where to uses divs and tables
you ll need to make sure that all your cells float either left or right depending on their internal ordering and they also need a fix width
also make sure that their row has a fixed width which is equal to the sum of the cell widths + margin + padding
113420
try-catch	exception-handling	try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
of course if there wasn t an exception-handling then the test case should be considered a fail
i think you can just do an explicit try-catch in your test code instead of relying on the expectedexception attribute to do it for you
then you can come up with some helper method that will read the resource file and compare the error message to the one that comes with the exception-handling that was caught
114544
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
these databases are very different - mysql is speed and simplicity postgresql is robustness and concurrency
it will be easier for you to learn postgresql it is not that hard

115063
wtl	atl
Pattern(s): 
it is light-weight but still supports all the modern features of the os
windows template library windows template library wtl is a c++ library for developing windows applications and ui components
it extends atl active template library and provides a set of classes for controls dialogs frame windows gdi objects and more
115944
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
therefore if there is no business logic for example when a getter simply returns a value or a setter sets it then there is no point in writing a test
if however there is some logic getter changes the data in some way before returning it then yes you should have a unit test. as a general rule i believe one should not write tests for beans that do not contain any business logic

116106
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
however instead of setting svn ignore to . on the cache directory you may want to include cache in the parent directory s svn ignore property in case the cache directory is not always present
i do this on a number of throwaway folder

116114
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
backticks use minimal syntax for what can be a heavy command
one reason users might be temped to use backticks instead of system is to hide stdout from the user
this is more easily and flexibly accomplished by redirecting the stdout stream further getting rid of stderr is easily accomplished in situations where it makes sense to use backticks i prefer to use the qx in order to emphasize that there is a heavy-weight command occurring
116753
hash	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement
add a unique salt to the hash password value store the salt value in the db
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement
118049
post	get
Pattern(s): 
since you are calling this multiple times you may get better performance copying the list once and destructively deleting from it
alternatively looking back over your original post it is a little confusing.
you say you remove all elements bigger than x but your code looks like it is attempting to remove all elements x is bigger than
118689
rss	feed	rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
you should not be putting style attributes on your feed
the point of rss is to be display agnostic
you should not be putting style attributes on your feed
118965
width	margin
Pattern(s): 
say you have a main pane on which all your page s content lies
you want it to be centered in the window always and 80 of the width of the window
simply do this #centerpane margin auto
122063
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
Pattern(s): 
also by grouping like display functionality into a panel it creates more readable code
i ve found that for any non-trivial gui i use multiple layouts with nested sub-panels where the main panel may have a gridbaglayout and each sub-panel typically without a border or indication that it is a panel uses a simpler layout where possible
typically i ll use borderlayout flowlayout and boxlayout for smaller simpler sub-panels
122300
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 
i d also have to wonder why so many people have the root passwd
sudo is there specifically to avoid giving people the root password.

123156
temporary	tablespace	temporary	tablespace
Pattern(s): 
these can be materialised as a data segment in a temporary tablespace either automatically by oracle when they exceed a certain memory usage or manually by using the materialize optimizer hint
the global temporary table is simply the logical definition of a table structure name column names column data types etc
when a session references it by inserting data a data segment is created in a temporary tablespace to hold only that session s data
123307
lxml	elementtree	lxml	celementtree
Pattern(s): 
it s pythonic comes in the box with python 2.5 including the c version celementtree xml.etree.celementtree which is 20 times faster than the pure python version and is very easy to use
lxml has some perfomance advantages but they are uneven and you should check the benchmarks first for your use case
as i understand it elementtree code can easily be ported to lxml
123432
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
Pattern(s): 
i ll try to play with fiddler although there is a slight issue as the xaml control is not embedded into a web page its using the inbuilt testpage renderer
here is a few pointers that iv found that need to be checked adding a clientaccesspolicy.xml as a shown my question
adding a crossdomain.xml to the host route ensure binding is basichttp as this is the only one supported by silverlight currently the service needs this attribute useful reads
124042
internationalization	globalization	internationalization	translation
Pattern(s): 
but because you said open source i think the globalization support in open source projects is generally outstanding
linux sucks are pretty much everything but internationalization is something they get right
gettext is still one of the few translation systems that has a i know half baked but working pluralization system
124384
downcasting	upcasting
Pattern(s): 
but you can t have an object of base class referenced by a reference of a derived class type
downcasting makes sense if you have an object of derived class but it s referenced by a reference of base class type and for some reason you want it back to be referenced by a derived class type reference
in other words you can downcast to reverse the effect of previous upcasting
125553
matlab	simulink
Pattern(s): 
-adam
you might be surprised at the number of people that use matlab for this and as it could be considered a programming language and certainly manages its own memory with support for huge data sets etc then it should seriously be considered as a solution here
so once you arrive at an algorithm you want to package up you can have it generate the c code to perform the work you originally had in your m script or simulink model
126773
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming
in fact common lisp features the most powerful class-based object system that i know of incorporating stuff like aspect-oriented programming out of the box
lisp seems to me to actually be the language family that most encourages experiments in new directions and most easily incorporates programming paradigms that aren t supported from the get-go
132632
swt	nebula
Pattern(s): 
nebula grid fits in well with the widget + viewer paradigm
i was able to migrate from normal swt table to this in a matter of minutes

132787
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket
Pattern(s): 
struts tiles is the classic example in the java world but it is really getting old and crufty compared to more modern framworks in java and other languages
tapestry and wicket are two more modern ones haven t used them though
for only 3 pages applying a whole web framework is probably overkill though but if your site grows.
133155
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
the second for-loop is pretty obscure it s basically splitting the arrays into a head the first element and a tail all other elements
haskell does it with the notation x xs but batch files do it with a for-loop called with the f switch
why not
134346
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hashed value as clear text
simply hash the entered password and then compare it with the stored hash

135226
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
john resig has a good explanation
here s the full version breakdown ie 6-7 support jscript 5 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 ie 8 supports jscript 6 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 - more bug fixes over jscript 5 firefox 1.0 supports javascript 1.5 ecmascript 3 equivalent firefox 1.5 supports javascript 1.6 1.5 + array extras + e4x + misc. firefox 2.0 supports javascript 1.7 1.6 + generator + iterators + let + misc. firefox 3.0 supports javascript 1.8 1.7 + generator expressions + expression closures + misc. the next version of firefox will support javascript 1.9 1.8 + to be determined opera supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc
safari supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc
135367
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
so use stl algorithms write your own functors and then translate them into inline expressions using boost lambda
from a professional standpoint i believe the best way to get started with boost lambda is to get usage of boost bind understood and accepted
use of placeholders in a boost bind expression looks much less magical than naked boost lambda placeholders and finds easier acceptance during code reviews
137344
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
editors are logical subclassing of viewers but since all viewers are subclassing - textviewer imageviewer etc. editor does not derive from viewer thus allowing the final texteditor imageeditor classes to avoid the diamond
in cases where the diamond is not avoidable using virtual inherited
the biggest caveat however with virtual bases is that the constructor for the virtual base must be called by the most derived class meaning that a class that derives virtually has no control over the constructor parameters
139276
gridview	repeater
Pattern(s): 
since you re building the layout by hand listview and repeater require more code
gridview is an updated datagrid so there is hardly any reason to use datagrid
gridview works really well when hooked up to standard asp.net datasources but restricts you to a tabular layout with lots of layout rules
140719
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
otherwise practically no language has native threading as they re all a feature of the os
boost thread is great i m not sure whether you can say its part of the language though
it depends if you consider the crt stl boost to be part of c++ or an optional add-on library
141668
centos	linux
Pattern(s): 
most linux stuff is shipped for rhel redhat enterprise linux so you are usually best off using that
centos is a free distribution based on rhel in fact it s almost identical so a given vendor s stuff usually works the same there
it also depends on hardware support
142778
.htaccess	httpd.conf
Pattern(s): 
lastly you can enable a rewrite log using commands like the following in your httpd.conf rewritelog logs rewritelog rewriteloglevel 7 the log file thus generated will give you the gory detail of which rewrite rules matched and how they were handled
a restart is not required for changes to .htaccess
something else is wrong
142778
.htaccess	httpd.conf
Pattern(s): 
also check that .htaccess is readable by the httpd process
check the error_log - it will tell you of any errors in .htaccess if it s being used. putting an intentional syntax error in .htaccess is a good check to make sure the file is being used -- you should get a 500 error on any page in the same directory
lastly you can enable a rewrite log using commands like the following in your httpd.conf rewritelog logs rewritelog rewriteloglevel 7 the log file thus generated will give you the gory detail of which rewrite rules matched and how they were handled
143221
bitarray	bitvector	bitarray	bitvector
Pattern(s): 
it s a c extension so much faster than bitvector which is pure python and stores its data in an actual bitfield so it s eight times more memory efficient than a numpy boolean array which appears to use a byte per element.
bitarray was the best answer i found when i recently had a similar need
it s a c extension so much faster than bitvector which is pure python and stores its data in an actual bitfield so it s eight times more memory efficient than a numpy boolean array which appears to use a byte per element.
143846
bmp	tga	bmp	ppm	bmp	ppm
Pattern(s): 
render your font using whatever arrange the characters in a grid and save the image in a simple uncompressed format like ppm bmp or tga
if you want antialiasing make sure to use a format that supports transparency bmp and tga do
ppm does not
144141
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
you can read a bit more at the atoi documentation on msdn -
the user input is treated as a string that needs to be converted to an int using atoi or another conversion function
atoi will return 0 if the string cannot be interptreted as a number because it contains letters or other non-numeric chars
144303
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
tkint64 get setint64prop tkinteger get setordprop get setordprop functions can also be used for chars and widechar properties which i guess is why the name isn t 100 obvious
margins.xyzzy are all int properties not int64 properties so you need to use getordprop setordprop to read and modify them
setint64prop assumes it s a 64-bit property and tries calling the property setter function with a 64-bit parameter
144890
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
note that the bit-flipping trick can be used regardless of what sorting algorithm you actually use.
all things being equal i d expect most people to use whatever is most conveniently available and that tends to be quicksort 3
other than that quicksort is known to be very fast on arrays just like mergesort is the common choice for lists
144997
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
most c++ compilers are smart enough now to inline functions for you
the inline keyword is just a hint to the compiler
some will even do inlining across translation units where they decide it s helpful
145200
ironruby	ironpython
Pattern(s): 
i suspect ironpython has a similar story
currently ironruby is pretty slow in most regards
it s definitely slower than mri matz ruby implementation overall though in some places they re faster
145200
ironruby	ironpython
Pattern(s): 
i suspect the team will go for language-completeness rather than performance first
this will allow you to run ironruby run most ruby programs when 1.0 ships then they can improve perf as they go
i suspect ironpython has a similar story
145996
gtk	motif
Pattern(s): 
a typical way would be to put it in a lib folder
look feels that are available by default in the jdk are com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.gtklookandfeel com.sun.java.swing.plaf.motif.motiflookandfeel com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.windowslookandfeel quioting the link above the gtk l f will only run on unix or linux systems with gtk 2.2 or later installed while the windows l f runs only on windows systems
like the java metal l f the motif l f will run on any platform
146374
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
but if instances of a class are supposed to be immutable then making it final is one good way of making sure they really are all immutable that there aren t mutable instances of subclassing kicking around which can be used anywhere that the parent class is called for
i don t think the article you referenced should be taken as an instruction that all immutable classes must be final especially if you have a positive reason to design your immutable class for inherited
what it was saying is that protecting immutability is a valid reason for final where imaginary performance concerns which is what it s really talking about at that point are not valid
149437
range	max
Pattern(s): 
how will you display the values
know your range of data
a float is only good for 6 to 7 digits of precision so that means a max of about +-9999.99 without rounding
149442
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
much like the safari browser does
at first i believed it was a built-in feature of the wysiwym markdown editor but shog9 is correct it s not baked-in at all but is courtesy of the jquery plugin textarearesizer i was lead astray by the browser was using to check on the editor demo because google-chrome itself adds the expandable functionality on textareas mdash
much like the safari browser does
149471
nstimer	nsrunloop
Pattern(s): 
that are the very basics how objective-c actually works
as i wrote below a nstimer object is created that gets a pointer to the target object and a pointer to a c string containing the method name and when the timer fires it finds the right c method to call by using the string table hence it needs the string name of the method of the target object hence it needs a reference to it
not exactly the implementation but pretty close to it every thread in cocoa has a nsrunloop it s always there you never need to create on for a thread
150009
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 

i believe that compiler takes a hint to disable padding when you use the unsigned int wwindow 16 syntax
also note that a short is not guaranteed to be 16 bits
150148
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 
filtering and binding are done on another class dataview dotnet datagrid hides this a little
extract method is the nearest a datatable provides in termes of filtering it returns an array of pointers to datarows
grouping is not so powerful as in tclientdataset as also indexing is poorer
150584
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
eg for 2 unsigned shorts followed by a signed 32 bit value going by your code you are looking for in order a 3 chars string 2 single byte values major and minor version a 1 byte flags variable a 32 bit length quantity the format string for this would be
if you have a string with 2 bytes that you wish to interpret as a 16 bit int you can do so by note that the is for big-endian the largest part of the int comes first
this is the format id3 tags use
150835
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
filesystems such as transactional ntfs can overcome this limitation
please note however that using the default filesystems under both win32 and nix there is no way to guarantee the atomicity of the operation if you check for the existence of files a b and c some other process or thread might have deleted file a after you passed it and while you were looking for b and c
filesystems such as transactional ntfs can overcome this limitation
150988
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 
this also requires multiple-precision integer arithmetic see also david m gay s correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions for algorithms going both ways
the standard algorithm for converting a decimal number to the best floating-point approximation is william clinger s how to read floating point numbers accurately downloadable from here
note that doing this correctly requires multiple-precision integers at least a certain percentage of the time in order to handle corner cases
151244
suppressfinalize	finalizer
Pattern(s): 
the suppressfinalize optimization is not trivial as your objects can live a long time waiting on the finalizer queue
don t be tempted to call suppressfinalize on other objects mind you
that s a serious defect waiting to happen
151336
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
the versioning property you mention is used by msi engine internally for upgrade uninstalls etc and is never displayed
as far as i know msi file will never show versioning
simple reason is that msi files are not pe files they are sort-of database
151336
installation	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
simple reason is that msi files are not pe files they are sort-of database
msiexec.exe then interprets this database to do the actual installation
the version property you mention is used by msi engine internally for upgrade uninstalls etc and is never displayed
152132
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
it uses more disk space but disk is cheap
doing it this way we can stay with versioning 1 of a project until upgrading to versioning 1.5 is absolutely necessary
you still have the job with adding dll s when deciding to upgrade to a other versioning of the dll though
152425
put	get
Pattern(s): 
but don t just take my word for it in access-ordered linked hash maps merely querying the map with get is a structural modification the linked hash map s javadoc if you are absolutely sure that there are no caches no collection statistics no optimizations no funny stuff at all - you don t need to sync
in that case i would have put a type constraint on the collection don t declare the collection as a map which would allow linkedhashmap but as hashmap for the purists a final subclass of hashmap but that might be taking it too far...

152830
gdi	stretchblt
Pattern(s): 
however when it is scaled it will be stretched using stretchblt
a metafile is a file which records a sequence of gdi operations
it is scalable because the original sequence of operations that generated the picture are captured and therefore the co-ordinates that were recorded can be scaled
153015
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
since ip has become the dominant protocol a port in networking terms has become synonomous with either a udp or tcp port number - which is a portion of the socket address
udp is connection-less - meaning no virtual circuit between the 2 endpoints is ever created
however we still refer to udp sockets as the endpoint
156321
stdio	fflush
Pattern(s): 
reference
this doesn t mean that manually adjusting the stdio buffering is a good idea though
you may wish to utilise std endl or std fflush from which may help you
157010
typedef	typename	typedef	typename
Pattern(s): 
by the way it is considered good practice to also expose a few other types if you want your class to behave as a container and if needed by your class you ll find the meaning of all these typedef s here stl documentation on vectors edit added the typename as suggested in the comments
i am unsure about what you mean by not exposing std vector publicly but indeed you can just define your typedef like that you will be able to change these typedef later without the user noticing anything .
by the way it is considered good practice to also expose a few other types if you want your class to behave as a container and if needed by your class you ll find the meaning of all these typedef s here stl documentation on vectors edit added the typename as suggested in the comments
157456
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
but the svn clients are better especially the eclipse plugin
perforce is more expensive
these are merely opinions so perhaps this is a poor answer if i was already using one or the other i d be very hard pressed to switch since neither seems to offer really significant benefits over the other but the disruption in switching could be large
157625
perforce	svn	perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
either is a great alternative to svn when working with a large team
it has features analogous to those available in perforce but is free foss
either is a great alternative to svn when working with a large team
157949
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
a form should always have server-side validation
client-side validation is only there as a convenience
a malicious user could easily post data to your form bypassing any client-side validation that you have in place
158824
pdfbox	itextsharp	pdfbox	itext
Pattern(s): 
if you re looking for something a little more diy there s the itextsharp library - a port of java s itext - and pdfbox yes it says java - but they have a .net version by way of ikvm.net
here s some codeproject articles on using itextsharp and pdfbox from c#
and if you re really a masochist you could call into adobe s pdf ifilter with com interop
159454
width	height	width	height
Pattern(s): 
you need to listen for width changes on the content composite mparent compute the minimum height again given the new content width and call setminheight on the scrolled composite with new height
in listening for size changes note that we ignore any resize events where the width stays the same
this is because changes in the height of the content do not affect the minimum height of the content as long as the width is the same
160892
x86	mips
Pattern(s): 
in my opinion mips is actually a little bit more of a clean and elegant architecture than sparc but they re both great
in addition to complete system emulation qemu can also emulate sparc at the user-space level so that you can write a program in sparc assembly and use standard linux system calls and it will call the standard x86 kernel versions.
works pretty well
161983
struts	stripes
Pattern(s): 
i don t want to start some kind of flame development platform war but in my opinion stripes is a far superior and easier to use framework than struts we migrated from struts a year ago and have never looked back
that said yes you can integrate gwt with struts without too many hassles in fact if you do your entire ui in gwt you don t even need struts you can just rpc straight to your java back end
if you just want to make small components then gwt will work well for that too and i guess you could shudder pass it your struts forms if you wanted to
164368
profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler	yourkit	jprofiler
Pattern(s): 
that being said i ve never used jprofiler so i can t give a direct comparison
i ve used yourkit and it is a very nice profiler the best i ve ever used in java i ve used a variety of others over the years
that being said i ve never used jprofiler so i can t give a direct comparison
164437
yourkit	jprofiler
Pattern(s): 
it s so much less invasive than jprofile in that i ll happy run production servers with the yourkit agent installed which i would never do with jprofiler
also the analysis tool that comes with yourkit is more intuitive in my opinion making it easier to get the root cause of problems

164595
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
of course if you re writing both the producer and consumer of the rss and your goal is that the feed always contains the full set of assigned tasks just updating the pubdate will work just fine
changing the pubdate does indicate that the entry changed but there is no requirement that a given rss reader do anything about it
strictly speaking there is no requirement than an rss reader do anything but let s remain reasonable. some reader do mark updated entries as changed
165622
yourkit	jprofiler
Pattern(s): 
it is priced also very reasonably about about 1100 for 5 licenses i think
i have used yourkit
i have not used jprofiler
165921
qpushbutton	qwidget
Pattern(s): 
having your own class allows you to add modifiy the signals slots available as you want
it is not possible to do it because it means you would add a slot to an existing qt class like qpushbutton which is not really the way to go
you should create your own qwidget eventually by subclassing an existing one
166098
subclass	getattr
Pattern(s): 
you either have to reimplement everything that touches this double-underscore attribute directly or you have to guess at the class name and mangle the name manually
the problem gets worse when this double-underscore attribute is actually a method overriding the method or calling the method in a subclass means doing the name-mangling manually or reimplementing all the code that calls the method to not use the double-underscore name
not to mention accessing the attribute dynamically with getattr you will have to manually mangle there too
167341
valgrind	memcheck	valgrind	memcheck
Pattern(s): 
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full . a.out
valgrind is your new best friend
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full . a.out
167536
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
moreover simply making all your properties atomic does not make your application thread-safe
also note of course that if you don t specify nonatomic and implement your own accessor methods rather than synthesising them you must implement them in an atomic fashion

168129
scheme	racket	scheme	racket
Pattern(s): 
update plt scheme is now called racket
plt scheme features a built-in continuation-based web server

onclick	onsubmit	submit	submission	submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
unlike your form this is a plain old postback - it s not using anything client-side to trigger the form submission no client-side validation etc
if i attach an onclick handler to the submit button i can see that the button is being clicked - but if i attach an onsubmit handler to the form i get nothing
if i make the button onclick handler submit the form through javascript it works fine - it s just the direct submission that s not working

free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
a pwsz frequently has different semantics for those
2 a bstr must be allocated and free with the sysalloc family of functions
a pwsz can be an automatic-storage buffer from the stack or allocated with malloc new localalloc or any other memory allocator
171669
apache	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
of these alternatives lighttpd is probably the most popular
most here will use apache but there are other options
ibm posted a nice long article on the subject
172603
j2ssh	jsch	j2ssh	jsch
Pattern(s): 
i don t know how it compares to jsch though
i am using j2ssh works pretty well
i don t know how it compares to jsch though

wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 
you can check out that site at chhobi.net
if you don t have many complex requirements i think wordpress is not a bad idea
if you need to expand the site later on and add different functionality like forums gallery polls etc. you better go for a proper cms solution like joomla drupal and likewise
173007
g++	gcc	g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 
gcc gnu c compiler g++ gnu c++ compiler the main differences gcc will compile .c .cpp files as c and c++ respectively
g++ will compile .c .cpp files but they will all be treated as c++ files
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this
173406
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
currently i believe that safari is the only shipping browser to support any of these and i believe it only supports the client side databases and local storage parts
edit olliej correction firefox 3 supports the application cache but alas not the client side db

176144
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 
my support list in order of priority currently looks like this unless a client expresses a need to expand it safari 3 firefox 2 firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 beta public-facing functionality works looks correct in ie 6 google-chrome the reason i take this approach is that first it s best to work in a standards-compliant browser before tweaking to broken engines
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around
176144
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
also a side effect of targeting safari first ie is likely to be less painful as the webkit team has gone to great lengths to comply with existing practices wherever possible
google-chrome comes last because it s so likely to just work if safari is good to go
edit firefox 2 comes before firefox 3 because its support set is more restricted
176345
maven	cargo	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
here s the pom.xml from that functional test module - make of it what you will
the cargo maven plugin is a good way to go if you re doing servlet development and want to deploy the resulting war for integration testing
when i do this myself i often set up a multi-module project although that s not strictly nessecarily and encapsulate all the integration testing into that one module
176869
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
sometimes because of class inherited you ll be stumped as to how to get the object mapped to a database row
or are all of the layers flattened down to columns in each subclass table
and your domain entities
177557
qdialog	qobject
Pattern(s): 
this is easily fixed by simply running qmake again
your dialog derives from more than one class and qdialog is not the first class that it derives from
for qmake to work correctly the qobject derived base class needs to be the first class that is inherited from
178555
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl	verilog	hdl
Pattern(s): 
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously
finally once you ve learned the hdl you have a hardware verification language hvl in systemverilog with strict-superset syntax saving you a good bit of the learning curve
179813
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
Pattern(s): 
for hdl choice verilog is to c as vhdl is to ada
so verilog is easier to get started with but you can make mistakes more easily
check your simulation and compilation warnings to avoid those problems
180634
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
i don t think the chained super super suggestion is a good idea- if you re doing that you re probably tied in very hard to a particular hierarchy and changing it will likely break stuff badly
i ve always used inherited rather than super
probably due to a delphi background and i always make it private to avoid the problem when the inherited is erroneously omitted from a class but a subclassing tries to use it
181372
matlab	simulink
Pattern(s): 
however if one really needs speed than he can choose to implement the tested logic in c c++ etc
for further comparison with python i can say that matlab provides a full package for you to do your work without the need of looking around for external libraries and implementing extra functions
one last point about matlab which i see is not mentioned in the answers here is that it has a very powerful visual modeling simulation environment called simulink
182092
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
a sql parameter can only be a single value so you d have to do where buildingid in buildingid1 buildingid2 buildingid3... which of course requires you to know how many building ids there are or to dynamically construct the query
as a workaround i ve done the following which will replace the text of the statement with the numbers ending up as something like where buildingid in 1 2 3 4 note that this is getting close to a sql injection vulnerability but since it s an int array is safe
arbitrary strings are not safe but there s no way to embed sql statements in an integer or datetime boolean etc
185365
terminate	timeout
Pattern(s): 
the timeout has to be big enough to delays in delivering the initial data from the client in the tls ssl handshake so it ll make establishing ssh connections slower
if the http proxy in your company is smart it ll actually eavesdrop on the expected tls ssl handshake when you connect to port 443 and when it detects that it s not an tls ssl handshake it might terminate the ssh connection attempt
to address that you could wrap the ssh daemon into an tls ssl tunnel stunnel but they you ll need to differentiate requests based on the tls ssl version in your client request to determine whether to route the tls ssl connection to the web server or to the tls ssl-tunneled ssh daemon
186279
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
adding a properties to the prototype of a function object will make it available to the constructed object as well as to all of the objects which inherit from it
advantages there may not be a hard and fast rule as to why prototypal inherited is an advantageous form of code-reuse
code reuse itself is advantageous and prototypal inherited is a sensible way of going about it
186668
firefox	safari	folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
on mac there is a directory for browser plugins
no matter if you use safari or firefox or possibly another browser it is standard or mac that browsers search their plugins in that folder
it is named library internet plug-ins and as always on mac this directory exists twice
188279
ordinals	difference	ordinals	difference
Pattern(s): 
you d have to be doing a lot of comparisons to notice the difference of course
stringcomparer.ordinalignorecase is slightly faster than invariantcultureignorecase fwiw an ordinals comparison is fast but culture-insensitive according to msdn
you d have to be doing a lot of comparisons to notice the difference of course
190149
prng	random
Pattern(s): 
on a computer your options are pretty limited to pseudo random number generators prngs and given your constraint that they never repeat then a prng is your best option - real random data will occasionally duplicate a number
in your case i d consider using a large prng 32 bit or larger to shuffle your 10 000 numbers and then send the numbers out in the shuffled order
once they re used up you can shuffle again - since the prng is so large you ll be able to go through the 10k numbers many times before duplicating a sequence
190745
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
applications differ in how they scale depending on a large number of variables including types of problem solving approach to solution and other factors
100 concurrent users consuming 10 cpu does not mean 500 concurrent at 50 it could be 20 or it could be 100
your bottleneck could be processors or memory or network bandwidth
190962
prepare	execute
Pattern(s): 
you can do prepare statements which is similar but different
here is an example the prepare statements are often used to see an execution plan for a given query
since they are execute with the execute command and the sql can be assigned to a variable you can approximate the some of the same behavior as dynamic sql
193952
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
callvirt is for calling virtual methods so that if this is a subclassing that overrides the method the subclassing version is called instead
call is for calling non-virtual static or superclass methods the target of the call is not subject to overriding
callvirt is for calling virtual methods so that if this is a subclassing that overrides the method the subclassing version is called instead
194456
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
hope that helps - sorry to not have any sample code but i suspect it s quite involved and i m not really a javascript developer
edit i ll leave this answer here as a sort of theoretical reference point but it sounds like the autocompleter answer is likely to be more useful to you disclaimer although i work for google which clearly has suggest elements in various uis i haven t looked at any of the code around this area nor even spoken to anyone about the client-side aspect
the server-side language is probably irrelevant here
195398
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
postgresql does comply better with standards so it can be easier to replace later
in the end the choice has so many variables that no matter which way you go you ll find some important issue that makes it the right choice
196580
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 
from a raw performance perspective nginx is faster but not so much faster that i would include that as a determining factor
apache has the advantage in the area of modules available and the fact that it is pretty much standard
any web host you go with will have it installed and most techs are going to be very familiar with it
197420
pthreads	fork
Pattern(s): 
having said this i would not use this code - i would either be inclined to fork mklink or look at the native library from jruby jpython sorry i cant look it up atm as my network connection is flakey
i seem to recall that jruby has written a library that wraps up various pthreads apis into java thinks like chown that are required for ruby compliance but are not cross platform
this library is being used by the jpython folks who seem very pleased with it
197429
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
however the stl proposes std for_each but its syntax is a lot less intuitive
here is its prototype it takes two iterators defining a valid range and applies the unary function or functor f to each object in this range. you can rewrite your example using std for_each like this however if you want to stay close to the classical syntax of the for each construct and if you re ok about using boost you can use boost.foreach which will let you write

197437
hash	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
thus suppose you wanted a coupon for user 23 worth 200 you might build up a string like 23_200 and calculate an md5 hash with a secret salt of billthelizard to get 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 thus the complete code you give the customer is 200_23_2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 now when you received the code you break it apart and check that md5 200_23 +secret 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 to verify the value edit if an 32 character hash is too long you could always truncate it chopping it down to 8 chars would still give you 4294967296 different hash values
i m guessing from way you ve phrased the question you don t want to store the codes in a database if you did you could simply verify each code against the database so what you could do is take all the pertinent information about what is in the coupon then hash it together with a secret salt to prevent tampering
thus suppose you wanted a coupon for user 23 worth 200 you might build up a string like 23_200 and calculate an md5 hash with a secret salt of billthelizard to get 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 thus the complete code you give the customer is 200_23_2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 now when you received the code you break it apart and check that md5 200_23 +secret 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 to verify the value edit if an 32 character hash is too long you could always truncate it chopping it down to 8 chars would still give you 4294967296 different hash values
198473
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
get or query string posts are really good for information required for either bookmarking a particular item or for assisting in search engine optimization and indexing items
post is good for standard forms used to submit one time data
i wouldn t use get for posting actual forms unless maybe in a search form where you want to allow the user to save the query in a bookmark or something along those lines
198607
xna	slimdx
Pattern(s): 
if you re missing some constants with float precisions just create them yourself don t have the cast to be done every time just at startup
xna provides several math constants including 3d specialists like pi 2 etc. and some advanced math functions with float precision though not the trigonometric functions
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big
200341
jar	war
Pattern(s): 
heck you can store content directly in a war file which is basically a jar file with a few extra bits
yes you may need to write a custom resolver to use classloader.getresourceasstream but basically as you re given the ability to generate the content however you like fetching it from a jar file seems perfectly reasonable
you ll probably want to make sure it only fetches a very specific set of extensions though
200715
xslt	xquery
Pattern(s): 
this helps keep xslt programs stylesheets pure and reusable but you need to add some sort of imperative framework to use them as part of a general-purpose processing system
xslt is an example of a functional programming language for doing transformations of data or documents represented as xml -- admittedly a very verbose and very limited one
if i remember correctly xquery is also purely functional
201298
configobj	configparser
Pattern(s): 
the downside here if the file will be hand-edited by a user errors could be hard to catch and debug
ini format i ve been using configobj for this with quite a bit of success
configobj is essentially a replacement for configparser with support for nested sections and much more
202192
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 
if it turns out you are forced to perform a copy where the first line is replaced and the rest of the data shall be copied as-is i suggest using a and
first use bufferedreader s readline to read the first line
modify it and write it to the bufferedwriter
203444
prng	random
Pattern(s): 
so that s a viable option but seems like a bad policy for programming
normally seeding a new state takes quite while for a serious prng and making new ones each time won t really help much. the only case i can think of where you might want more than one prng is for different systems say in a casino game you have one generator for shuffling cards and a separate one to generate comments done by the computer control characters this way really dedicated users can t guess outcomes based on character behaviors
a nice solution for seeding is to use this random.org they supply random numbers generated from the atmospheric noise for free
203931
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
if you believe that you have already upgrade check your path environment variable to confirm that c program files microsoft sql server 90 tools binn adjusted for your installation appears before c program files microsoft sql server 80 tools binn otherwise the sql 2000 command line tools will be used in preference to the sql 2005
i tested this out several different ways on sql 2005 sp2 target databases in both compatibility modes 80 and 90 and it works ok for me using the sql 2005 versioning of bcp
however i also tested it with the sql 2000 versioning of bcp and that failed with which i guess is what you re getting
204777
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 
selectmany - for each element of source selector is invoked and a sequence of values is returned
union - when the object returned by this method is enumerated union enumerates first and second in that order and yields each element that has not already been yielded
edit i ve moved distinct to preserving order based on this implementation
206345
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
a boolean is about truth and falseness
an int is about whole numbers
those are very distinct concepts truth and falseness is about deciding stuff
206964
soappy	suds
Pattern(s): 
does not work on python 2.5+ zsi very painful to use and development is slow
has a module called soappy which is different than soapy above
newer libraries suds very pythonic and easy to create wsdl-consuming soap clients
207062
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
a folder called google-chrome can mean any number of things
google-chrome is a general term for the ui of a browser
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base
207937
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock
Pattern(s): 
do you store a timestamp and use that for comparison in your binary search
if a map-type structure is more appropriate you can use a concurrenthashmap
with a list a readwritelock is probably the most effective way
208011
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 
it s very granular and has lots of configurability---but has sensible defaults so it won t take you long to set up
the systems i run have a sudo -only policy
the root passwd is disabled and people have to use sudo to get root access
208011
sudoers	passwd
Pattern(s): 
the root passwd is disabled and people have to use sudo to get root access
you can then edit your sudoers file to grant revoke people s access
it s very granular and has lots of configurability---but has sensible defaults so it won t take you long to set up
208025
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 
while that may be considered a security flaw it allows us to still log in if the ldap server is down
while it is a good idea to use a sudo only policy like chris suggested depending on the the size of your system an ldap approach may also be helpful
we complement that by a file that contains all the root passwd but the root passwd are really long and unmemorable
208508
wymeditor	jwysiwyg	wymeditor	jwysiwyg
Pattern(s): 
jwysiwyg is an alternative with much less features
wymeditor what you see is what you mean is a jquery plugin
jwysiwyg is an alternative with much less features
208728
ingres	oracle	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql	informix	ingres
Pattern(s): 
so why might it be useful with oracle -- as a performance boost for read-only functions where wrong data is highly unlikely and highly inconsequential
in mysql db2 ingres informix not sure about sql server sybase it can be used to bypass the lock management facility for performance
here s an example of a situation where reads do not need consistency list of all products here s an example of a situation where reads need consistency list of products in stock oracle just doesn t even conceive of dirty reads nor could it be added as a feature without actually loosing the benefit of performance too many tricks would be required to get the dirty data in oracle s true mvcc architecture
208789
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
if the daemon can t grab the lockfile it just dies so there s no worry about multiple daemons running
another approach to consider would be to submit the files via http post and then process them via a cgi
this way you guarantee that they ve been dealt with properly at the time of submission
210096
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
urgency low sandro tosi debian control - list items lines in description starts with 2 space to avoid reformat on webpages closes #480341 bernd zeimetz debian patches 02_reconnect.dpatch - dropping patch comment in storm which explains the problem
if you are using ubuntu linux there was a patch added to the python-mysql package that added the ability to set that same mysql_opt_reconnect option see here
i have not tried it though
210685
post	get	post	put	put	get
Pattern(s): 
restful web services chapter 8 section overloading post reads if you want to do without put and delete altogether it s entirely restful to expose safe operations on resources through get and all other operations through overloaded post
doing this violates my resource-oriented architecture but it conforms to the less restrictive rules of rest. in short replacing put delete in favor of post makes the api harder to read and put delete calls are no longer idempotent

211049
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
even a class definition that does not explicitly specify a superclass still has a superclass class cookie end this defines the cookie class with the superclass of object
i ve encountered this error before and it will occur when you have some code trying to reopen a class without specifying the superclass and the programmer s assumption is that the class in this case cookie has already been defined and that he is simply reopening it to add some functionality
but if the reopening and the definition are in reverse order you ll get that error because the class will already have been defined as a subclassing of object but is trying to be redefined or reopened with a different superclass
211306
traceroute	packets	traceroute	packets
Pattern(s): 
the packets expires and it s discarded when the ttl reaches zero
traceroute sends icmp time exceeded messages rfc 792 back to the sender when this occurs
by using small ttl values the packets will quickly expire so traceroute causes all routers along a packets s path to generate the icmp messages that identify the router
211327
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
so i guess it s a final int
in java language spec arrays you can see in 10.4 arrays must be indexed by int values
short byte or chars values may also be used as index values because they are subjected to unary numeric promotion and become int values. an attempt to access an array component with a long index value results in a compile-time error
212565
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
mergesort this will teach how to merge which is important because there are a ton of speedups you can get by merging two sorted lists together as well as how to divide the problem into smaller sub problems important for dealing with hierarchical structures and also used in quick sort
quicksort though faster is much harder to understand
you need two scanning variables a pivot item etc.

opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers
opera has native svg support firefox has native svg support internet explorer does not include svg support natively
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1
215746

Pattern(s): 
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers

216153
haskell	scheme
Pattern(s): 
it s not too widely used but definitely seems like a solid language to use especially considering the robustness of drscheme which in fact compiles scheme programs to native binary code
after that - haskell is incredibly interesting
it s a language which does lazy evaluation right and the consequences are incredible including such things as a one-line definition of the fibonnaci sequence
217361
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
if you do this a lot you could write an extension method to convert to a dictionary and use it so
can you use dictionary string string instead of namevaluecollection
since dictionary t t implements ienumerable you could use linq as so edit actually you may be able to use dictionary directly as if it doesn t map key value the way you want you can always go back to linq
217688
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
i would suggest you call it testsuite and make the list as a properties
has-a is much easier to maintain compared to inherited
in general i d be very careful to inherit something like a list
217708
config	ini
Pattern(s): 
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions centralised location for the sites configuration on each server so easy to keep upto date server doesn t change that oftern updateing the config is simple with an update script
can be generated by the script all my sites have a function that rebuilds the config file useing the config assoc array
updates that effect the config file are as simple as config key new value
217836
jboss	geronimo	jboss	geronimo
Pattern(s): 
this article has many interesting points to aid your decision and is worth reading geronimo 2 is the clear choice if your java application needs are particularly extensive or if you just want to leverage total java ee 5 compliance
although jboss 4.2 is not completely compatible with sun s java ee 5 standard the jboss 4.2 team is responsible for many of the cutting-edge technologies used by all of the servers and added to the standard java ee 5 capabilities. tomcat 6 by itself is a lightweight solution
it does not come with all the java ee features and additional packages found in jboss and geronimo but also doesn t require much memory and runs fast even on smaller servers
217993
bitconverter	binaryreader
Pattern(s): 
whenever you convert to bytes however you re making a choice
the bitconverter class has an islittleendian field to tell you how it will behave but it doesn t give the choice
the same goes for binaryreader binarywriter
218749
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 
it s easier for my brain to tokenise each words and understand its meaning
although because the punctuation characters are harder to read it s still hard going - but maybe that will change given a bit of time to get used to it i ll update this answer again tomorrow assuming i can make it through an entire day like this

219729
cairngorm	puremvc	cairngorm	flex	flexunit	puremvc	flexunit	cairngorm
Pattern(s): 
assuming your project was designed with a fairly loose degree of coupling you shouldn t need to change much at all if anything in order to test your code
if you re already using an mvc framework like cairngorm or puremvc flexunit should integrate pretty painlessly
i will say however that my experience with flash flex unit testing is not nearly as positive as it has been with other languages such as ruby or .net for three reasons
221953
mathml	tex
Pattern(s): 
tex also has a large user base and a number of stable open wysiwyg editors
also mozilla mathml page contains links to a tex- mathml translator and a possibly dead javascript mathml editor

222347
post	get
Pattern(s): 
into the code will throw an exception that will not get handled
the second version from the original post does not have this problem and it is generally preferred
that said there is a minor overhead using the exception and if you are 100 sure the data will not change you can use the but i recommend against it

allocator	stl	allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
stl uses placement new to create container elements
it s useful if you want to separate allocator from initialization
stl uses placement new to create container elements
223288
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
if javascript validation didn t work for any reason regular server-side validation scenario page reload with error informations takes place using the same server-side script
this solution isn t as responsive as pure client-side validation needs time to send receive data between client and server but is quite simple and you don t need to translate validation rules to javascript

226299
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
if your application uses a database or web service that not loops control is almost always going to be be where the time goes
the list.foreach could be faster due to using that internally and a for-loop without the wrapper would be even faster
i disagree that the list.foreach delegate version is more functional in any significant way
226546
vb.net	vb6
Pattern(s): 
support for vb6 has ended but vb.net is still very much alive and gaining new features
vb.net compiles to msil bytecode that depends on some of the the .net libraries depending on which .net framework classes you use
some of those libraries are not written in pure .net or are just wrappers around the windows api
226925
facade	service-locator
Pattern(s): 
that is a service-locator though a low level one
in retrospect we probably should have created a modulefactory or something and used icontianerfacade to get a hold of it and then used that resolve modules vs going to the facade directly
hindsight is 20 20
227544
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
because it is easier the code will on average be better written and less buggy
to me that programmer and quality overhead is the primary argument against using try-catch for process flow
the computer overhead of exception-handling is insignificant in comparison and usually tiny in terms of the application s ability to meet real-world performance requirements
228254
kerberos	ntlm
Pattern(s): 
search ms support for kerberos hotfix to turn off kerberos for the site cscript adsutil.vbs set w3svc ### ntauthenticationproviders ntlm where ### is the siteid from the metabase
typically if you see an issue with authentication where it works in ie 6 but not ie 7 i d check to make sure kerberos is configured correctly
running as network service your kerberos spns should attached to the machine account
228882
post	get
Pattern(s): 
this blog post has a good rundown of what you need to do to get it working
i have done this myself too so if you re interested i can expand this post with some examples later

229451
gif	png
Pattern(s): 
note also that irfanview does an awful job of converting 32bit png image to 256 allowing only one transparent color which looks bad if full color was dithered
i see that the gimp manual states his png8 format like gif uses only one bit for transparency
only two transparency levels are possible transparent or opaque
229736
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
it can be interesting in some cases but it can be a pitfall i saw in a source which is a major way to slow down a program because strlen is a costly function in c
somehow the for-loop is mostly designed to run a number of times know in advance you can still use break to terminate early so the dynamic evaluation of the stop term is more annoying than useful if you really need dynamic evaluation you use or
on some other languages like lua the stop condition is evaluated only once at loops init
230358
public	protected
Pattern(s): 

in addition to mark biek s answer the __destruct function must be declared public
otherwise the function will not be executed on script shutdown warning call to protected mychild1 __destruct from context during shutdown ignored in unknown on line 0 warning call to private mychild2 __destruct from context during shutdown ignored in unknown on line 0 this may not be harmful but rather unclean
231706
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 

as far as ssl goes you can buy separate certificates for the domain and subdomain or a single wildcard .foo.com cert that covers them both naturally the wildcard cert will be more expensive
if you have an https page that requests items from other domains all will be well as long as everything is https
232602
ienumerable	ienumerator
Pattern(s): 
i guess the generic enumerator t inherits from idisposable so there doesn t need to be a runtime type-check it can just go ahead and call dispose which should have better performance since it can be probably be optimized away if the enumerator has an empty dispose method
ienumerable t doesn t inherit idisposable
ienumerator t does inherit idisposable however whereas the non-generic ienumerator doesn t
233234
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 
if the private key does not have a passphrase ssh can be used without prompting for a passwd
the usual solution to this problem is setuiding a helper app that performs the task requiring superuser access sudo is not meant to be used offline
later edit ssh can be used with private-public key authentication
233262
multiton	singleton	multiton	singleton
Pattern(s): 
it s not simply everything that s not a singleton
yes there is a multiton pattern but it means something very specific
it s not simply everything that s not a singleton
235259
ant	cruisecontrol
Pattern(s): 
i don t think so
ant has better documentation including some nice o reilly books and it s well-established in the java universe so you avoid the problems of 1 we haven t copied feature x to phing yet and 2 the risk of the phing project going dead
here s an article on configuring phpunit to work with ant and cruisecontrol not that hard
236111
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
on linux with glibc the memory is actually always returned to the os above a certain size glibc malloc uses mmap for big allocations controlled by mmap_threshold and in that case free calls munmap which frees automatically the reserved memory
below that threshold it uses brk and free does not return the memory in that case
note that the above explanation is not exact to be precise you need to know the difference between physical memory virtual memory etc.
236783
agile	sprint
Pattern(s): 
if you want to prove that agile development works i d probably vote for using the sprint to show what release early release often means
agile is quite the buzzword now but please keep in mind that it is not a silver bullet
it will not fix your development process just like that
237861
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
i tend to roll my own repo without maven maven is fine but it doesn t click with me
i run something similar to the bsd ports system that is one big structured tree that contains little ant build files
these build files either checkout the source of a project pull its dependencies from somewhere else in the tree and build it these are for the projects i want to build- mine or pull binaries from somewhere else which might be an external source or my own binaries repository
238767
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
my preference would be that the username password only be accepted via post so that it doesn t appear in the url at all but you could conceivably encrypt and encode the password so that it could be put in a get request
i can t envision any reason why i would do this instead of a post
edit as others have indicated if you have patient-related data you may need to encrypt all communications with the server
240272
post	put
Pattern(s): 
you can reissue a put update or delete request as many times as you want and it will have the same effect every time however the desired effect will modify a resource so it is not considered safe
a post request should create a new resource with every request meaning the effect will be different every time
therefore post is not considered safe or idempotent
240308
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
whether these two areas are the same is an implementation details which is another reason that malloc and new can not be mixed
new delete allocate release memory memory allocated from free store returns a fully typed pointer
new standard version never returns a null will throw on failure are called with type-id compiler calculates the size has a version explicitly to handle arrays
241908
octal	hex	octal	binary
Pattern(s): 
even a simple task for a human in binary is long winded simple second grade math is still a lot of ones and zeros
so octal became popular because it allowed you to think in groups of three bits and you could use symbols we are familiar with as numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
but groups of four which is another power of 2 gives the humans a lot more mental computing power than octal hex is based on 4 bits which is also a power of 2
241908
multiplying	subtract
Pattern(s): 
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software
take the worst case multiplying for a four bit system 1111 1111 11100001 so it takes 8 bits to store the result of a 4 bit multiplying you will quickly find that if you had a 4 bit system most of the multiplies you want to do will result a number that cannot be stored in 4 bits
so when i saw you taking 64 bit integers the unsigned long long is often 64 bits and multiplying four times that means you need 64 5 or a 320 bit integer to store your answer you were trying to put that answer in a 64 big result which quite often depending on the compiler and computer will happily do and will truncate the upper bits leaving you with the lower 64 bits of the result which can easily look smaller than any of your operands which is what i had thought you might have done at first
242254
feeds	rss
Pattern(s): 
so yeah the rss feeds are probably the easiest way of interfacing with kuler
universal feed parser is really nice for most feeds but for extended feeds you might wanna try something called beautifulsoup
it s an xml html xhtml parsing library which is originally designed for screenscraping
242348
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
otoh if you were looking to re-code your application to be transaction aware then deciding this setting will be part of the general performance review needed of the innodb settings
the other major thing to watch out for is that innodb does not support fulltext indices nor insert delayed
but then myisam doesn t support referential integrity
242683
directx	directdraw
Pattern(s): 
this removes the rectangle leaving the framebuffer intact
update the rectangle s coordinates details on how to do this with directx are a bit harder .
i believe directdraw the old school way of doing 2d in directx is obsolete so i guess you must be using direct3d
243197
redmine	bugzilla	redmine	bugzilla
Pattern(s): 
it is open source ajax enabled email interface scm integration integrated wiki configurable trackers workflow and roles rss and email notifications i have used jira too hard bugzilla too rubbish and fogbugz too expensive and i think redmine is fantastic
redmine
it is open source ajax enabled email interface scm integration integrated wiki configurable trackers workflow and roles rss and email notifications i have used jira too hard bugzilla too rubbish and fogbugz too expensive and i think redmine is fantastic
243285
printf	strtok
Pattern(s): 
which means that if one strtok is started while another is not ended one will corrupt the internal data of the other
using c api means using raw types which can lead to interesting bugs like buffer overflow and potential stack corruption when a printf goes too far or string cropping when using printf which is a kind of data corruption
even when working on raw data malloc can be easily abused as shown by the following code etc
244294
qsort	bsearch
Pattern(s): 
occasionally the perceived overhead of the function-call-per-comparison associated with using qsort or indeed bsearch is too great
sometimes people don t want to risk the potential o n 2 worst-case behaviour of quicksort but most production qsort algorithms will avoid that for you
quite apart from the various books on algorithms - sedgewick is one such but there are many others - you could also take a look at jon bentley s programming pearls or more programming pearls books
244584
cout	ofstream
Pattern(s): 
but i also think you need to rethink your solution to your problem
cout is just a ostream so if all classes functions takes a ostream then you can pass in anything you like
cout ofstream etc if that s too hard then i would create my own version of cout maybe called mycout that can be defined at either compiler time or runtime time depending on what you want to do
245323
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs
call me old fashioned but i much preferred the branching tagging model under cvs
in cvs branches and tags are different things
246649
vb.net	vb6
Pattern(s): 
in addition find a personal project you can get highly motivated about with a tangible end goal deliverable that will make learning your new skills much more fun
imho i would suggest not moving to vb.net at all but instead utilizing your c background and making the move to c#
the reason for this is you already know the syntax and that vb.net is not enough like vb6 to make it as easy a move as you might expect
247056
dependency-injection	factories
Pattern(s): 
something like of course strictly speaking your permissionmanager should implement some kind of ipermissionmanager interface and that s what your other class should reference so a dummy implementation can be substituted more easily during testing
if you are using a dependency-injection framework then the common way to handle this is to either pass in a permissionsmanager object in the constructor or to have a property of type permissionsmanager that the framework sets for you
if this is not feasible then having users get an instance of this class via factories is a good choice
247627
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
you should salt your passwords before applying the hashing function
salting a password does not affect the length of the hash result

247984
cobertura	emma	cobertura	checkstyle	cobertura	eclemma	emma	checkstyle	checkstyle	eclemma
Pattern(s): 
these are generated by our ci builds which run using continuum
i use a combination of cobertura checkstyle ecl emma and findbugs
eclemma is an awesome eclipse plugin that shows the code coverage by coloring the java source in the editor screenshot - the coverage is generated by running a junit test
248757
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 
edit looks like sudo has a nopasswd mode so i think it should work since you re running the programs as external commands
i would not run the application full time as root but you might want to explore making your application setuid root or setuid to some id that can become root using something like sudo for particular applications
you might be able to set up an account that cannot login use setuid to change your program s id temporarily when needed and have sudo set up to not prompt for passwd but always allow access to that account for specific tasks
248757
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 
it s been awhile since i ve done much unix development so i m not really sure whether it s possible to set up sudo to not prompt for a passwd or even if there is an api for it but as a fallback you could enable setuid to root only when needed
edit looks like sudo has a nopasswd mode so i think it should work since you re running the programs as external commands

248758
daemons	launchd
Pattern(s): 
that reduces the attack surface by allowing only permitted root launchd
your idea about the daemons has much merit despite the complexity it introduces
as long as the actions don t require some user interface interaction as root a daemons allows you to control what operations are allowed and disallowed
249603
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
i m sure you can do something similiar with svn but it s not as easy out of the box
perforce supports locking and seems to require it for some file types that cannot be merged binary resources think images etc
it does not however require locking for ordinary source files those can be opened for editing by multiple users at the same time and then merged back into the depot
249603
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
it does not however require locking for ordinary source files those can be opened for editing by multiple users at the same time and then merged back into the depot
i find perforce s system with changelists that group changes to multiple files and treat them as a unit nice
i m sure you can do something similiar with svn but it s not as easy out of the box
249808
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
the simple answer is that you can t share files in svn - in the end we had to restructure our directory and use batch files
for source code files that were shared we moved them to an include folder and have all the projects reference that folder
for binary files that need to be copied to more than one location we store them just once in svn and then use batch files to copy them across to the target locations on each developers machine or also on the build machine
251773
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 
if your application deals with documents it s better to let each one have its own window
it makes it easier for the user to arrange their workspace and switching between documents using the os s app switching capabilities
a lot of mdi applications prevent this by corraling multiple documents into the same window which limits usability of screens real estate in a multiple monitor scenario
253463
redmine	trac	redmine	trac
Pattern(s): 
with trac you can have multi-project setups as well having a separate environment for each project but in the end it s a workaround
redmine has builtin support for multi-project environments
i previously used trac to manage my projects but i switched to redmine
253703
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
with asp classic you d have to do this in a library instead of on the page to make sure that the user couldn t see your fixed salt
if you are trying to defeat brute force attacks you are better off enforcing some failed attempts window count rather than relying on the speed of the hashing or hash comparison mechanism to make the attack take longer to succeed
lock out the account after a certain number of failed attempts within the failure window and only let new attempts be made after a significant amount of time has elapsed
253740
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
actually all other aspects being equal a slower hash function is more secure than a fast one
this is because a slower hash function results in slower generation of rainbow tables and slower brute forcing or dictionary attacks on the password
from thomas ptacek at as referenced in this coding horror article the problem is that md5 is fast
255682
profiler	xperf
Pattern(s): 
this one is about profiling
a sample profiler is a good choice here
on windows you can use the profiler built into visual studio or the xperf tools from the windows organization
256099
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
but the server-side part is pretty simple
the client-side part is trickier i think
i found this article helpful he s writing things in php but the client side work is pretty much the same
256359
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
put is often described as the edit method as by replacing the entire resource with a slightly altered version you have edited what clients will get when they next do
using rest in html forms the html5 spec defines get and post for the form element
the method content attribute is an enumerated attribute with the following keywords and states the keyword get mapping to the state get indicating the http get method
256670
ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
this allowed my to run the stuff on linux but display it on my windows desktop
1 i used to run ubuntu in 64-bit mode but i had no end of trouble
mixing 64-bit and 32-bit is something mac os x does much better. 7.04 worked fine running 32-bit applications on the 64-bit kernel
257043
des	aes
Pattern(s): 
it s been widely in use for a long time but since it was originally specified with only a 56 bit key it s questionable whether it s secure enough for any important uses at this point
triple des is generally better but there are some known theoretical attacks
if you have a choice of cipher you might want to look at aes instead
257608
int	double
Pattern(s): 
the 10 byte long double provides a 64-bit mantissa
this is very convenient for when you want to store 64 bit int in floating point without loss of precision

257790
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket
Pattern(s): 
but no one seems to like struts anymore
the ex-jakarta menu on the apache jakarta page shows a number of web application frameworks that they ve incubated including tapestry turbine and velocity
there s also wicket a very decent comparison of wicket and tapestry is available here
257953
width	height
Pattern(s): 
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height
of course if there aren t any hard width values then the design is a liquid layout so the concern about designing for a particular width is somewhat altered
usually good liquid layouts despite being displayed correctly at any dimension are nonetheless designed to be viewed at reasonable window widths
258049
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
only provide accessor mutator functions if the accessor mutator methods are a sensible and useful part of the class s interface api
don t think of these methods as accessor or mutators
instead think of them as methods that access or mutate a certain abstract properties of the object that happens to be represented by a single member today but may be computed in a more complex manner tomorrow
258093
awt	swing	swt	swing
Pattern(s): 
i don t think that awt is capable of restyling native component peers in a reliable fashion
i know for certain that swt can t and it s a far more sophisticated toolkit than awt
this is part of why it was essentially deprecated in favor of swing back in java 1.2
259460
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that
i suggest using nhibernate with postgresql
you can do all your testing and development on sqlite so you don t need to have an instance of postgresql running on your dev machine
260148
lxml	elementtree	lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
Pattern(s): 
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well
if you have libxml2 and libxslt installed then also install lxml
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree
260148
lxml	elementtree	lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
Pattern(s): 
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

260735
keydown	keyup
Pattern(s): 
if you want to what someone is typing in a text box it s usually best to wait until they ve released before trying to decide what they re doing
but if it s something like a game where you want to respond the instant it s pressed than you would use keydown
keydown is the moment the key is pushed down. keyup is after the key has been released
260826
subclass	abstract-class	public	protected
Pattern(s): 
for abstract-class this constructor scope public or protected is not of much difference since the instantiation is not allowed even if public
since it is meant to be invoked by the subclass it can invoke either public or protected constructor seamlessly
its completely on choice what to use
260972
strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 
standard c provides strcpy strcat strncat strncpy memmove memcpy etc
it makes sense to use strncpy over strcpy for safety if you don t know the source string will fit inside the destination buffer
however strncpy has a major performance issue in that it always writes the amount of bytes specified for the size
261159
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
define all your constructors protected making them public is pointless anyway your subclass constructor s can call one constructor of the abstract class
it may even have to call it if there is no no-arg constructor in the abstract class in any case don t forget that if you don t define a constructor then the compiler will automatically generate one for you this one is public has no argument and does nothing

261277
boost	stl	boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out
boost has a utility called next and its inverse prior for just that purpose
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out
263011
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
an http post which is different from an http get is a separate logical call to the webserver but it still defines a uri that should process the post
a good webserver apache being one will again make the uri available to whatever module or appserver is running within it then will additionally make available the variables which were sent in the post headers
at the point where your application takes control from apache during a post you should have access to both the get and post variables and be able to do whatever control logic you wish including replying with a soap protocol instead of html
263791
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
some options for when you want to update your exported copy run svn export --force home ..... myproject this will stop it complaining about overwriting the existing files
this method will mean that if you delete a file from your repository it ll still remain in your www folder
change your svn command to export into a new directory each time svn export home .... myproject_20081105 and then create a symlink to that folder ln -s myproject_20081105 myproject just delete and recreate the symlink each time you release
263934
minix	linux	minix	linux
Pattern(s): 
the linux kernel is too big for an academic exercise
if you re trying to understand the kernel look at minix
the linux kernel is too big for an academic exercise
264473
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
sqlite runs in-process with the client application no network capability very low query overhead because of this potentially rather fast for easy queries because there is less ipc system calls and data copying to do
very limited concurrency i think it s either one writer or multiple readers per database file mysql far more features choice of engines innodb provides good features for many workloads much more control of storage backup restore etc network-capable - which allows its use in large scale applications better concurrency - the innodb engine has mvcc which means that readers do not block writers nor do writers block readers
even the old myisam engine has table-level locking rather than for the whole database as sqlite
265151
appfuse	spring	appfuse	stripes	sitemesh	stripes
Pattern(s): 
he calls it appfuse
i use struts2 with spring and hibernate and sitemesh which was an appfuse project to start with and it has served me well
stripes seems to be a great starting point for a java web app too
265372
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
asp.net validation controls also provide two ways of validation server-side or client-side
the nice thing about these validation controls is that it will preform client-side validation when it detects the browser is able unless client-side validation has been disabled
thus reducing roundtrips
267793
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
a protected class is visible to other classes in the same package and to classes that extend the enclosing class
a public class is accessible to a class in any package
a class with default access class joe is only visible to other classes in the same package
267839
octal	decimal	octal	decimal
Pattern(s): 
you mask and shift would look something like #define mask 0x0038 #define shift 3 masks are often assigned in hexadecimal because it is easier to work with bits in the data type in that base as opposed to decimal
historically octal has also been used for bit masks
if i have a variable var that contains data that the mask is relevant to then i can isolate the bits like this i can isolate all the other bits like this i can clear the bits like this i can clear all the other bits like this i can set all the bits like this i can set all the other bits like this i can extract the decimal value of the bits like this i can assign a new value to the bits like this
268287
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
personally i wish classes were sealed by default in .net
classes should either be designed for inherited or prohibit it
there is a cost to designing for inherited it can pin down your implementation you have to declare which methods are going to call which other methods in case a user overrides one but not the other it reveals your implementation rather than just the effects it means you have to think of more possibilities when designing things like equals are hard to design in an inherited tree it requires more documentation an immutable type which is subclassing may become mutable ick item 17 of effective java goes into more details on this - regardless of the fact that it s written in the context of java the advice applies to .net as well
268335
ssd	sata
Pattern(s): 
so it will as you see be more than twice as bad as the simple read case
to improve the speed the first thing i d try is a faster hard drive or an ssd
sata is pretty much the easiest fastest option
268785
organization	naming
Pattern(s): 
i strongly recommend user research card sorting for organizing and naming non-standard menus
look closely at the ribbon and you ll see it s organization is pretty much the same as menu bars with equivalents for file the logo menu edit the home tab which includes formatting and view so from an organization standpoint it makes little difference whether you re using a ribbon or menubar
the menubar is still the best choice for most apps
269535
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
use inherited
the new class is now a subclass of the original class
if the new class must have the original class
269670
copying	overwrite
Pattern(s): 
some platforms will not allow you to overwrite an existing file others will not allow you to rename a file so it changes location onto another partition
if you want to make the process completely safe you need to do the process yourself by removing the old file first and then renaming the new or copying if a partition change is possible
this is naturally prone to problems if your application machine crashes while doing this since it is no longer an atomic operation
270104
skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	tree
Pattern(s): 
a binary tree allows for more rapid searching and insertion by being inherently sorted and navigable
an alternative that i ve used successfully in the past is a skip-lists
this provides something akin to a linked list but with extra references to allow search performance comparable to a binary tree
271143
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
just remember that byte is always the size of a chars so if chars is bigger a byte is not only 8 bits any more
as kevin haines points out int have the natural size suggested by the execution environment which has to fit within int_min and int_max
the c89 standard states that uint_max should be at least 2 16-1 ushrt_max 2 16-1 and ulong_max 2 32-1
271143
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
the c89 standard states that uint_max should be at least 2 16-1 ushrt_max 2 16-1 and ulong_max 2 32-1
that makes a bit-count of at least 16 for short and int and 32 for long
for chars it states explicitly that it should have at least 8 bits char_bit . c++ inherits those rules for the limits.h file so in c++ we have the same fundamental requirements for those values
271143
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
for chars it states explicitly that it should have at least 8 bits char_bit . c++ inherits those rules for the limits.h file so in c++ we have the same fundamental requirements for those values
you should however not derive from that that int is at least 2 byte
theoretically chars int and long could all be 1 byte in which case char_bit must be at least 32
271590
cpython	ironpython
Pattern(s): 
speaking for python ironpython c# is probably the easiest optimization path
cpython with c++ is doable but i find c a lot easier to handle but not all that easy being c
two tools that ease this are cython pyrex for c and shedskin for c++
272261
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	greenplum
Pattern(s): 
see this posting for a bit of fan-out on this topic
i m not sure off the top of my head if mysql does this but postgresql certainly does
iirc some of the variants greenplum i think also directly support bitmap indexes and there was some talk of incorporating it in the main db engine
272898
post	get
Pattern(s): 
hope this helps
without testing it or even trying to compile it i would do something like also here s a link to a blog post that achieves the same accross web applications
and finally a word of advice you ll get better search results if you use programmatically instead of code wise
273818
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
so i wound up putting those resources in the package directory - in the end i had resources in several different places and it was more of a mess than putting everything in package directory would have been
that said here s the code i used to put my html templates in a separate folder
it should be added to init in your application class
275893
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
to access the relational data but if the object is available in the custom map you would at least avoid having to reconstitute it from the relational data
i d be more inclined to use a custom class backed by a dictionary t t than a datatable
presumably this would be built on top of a data access layer that could use linq or datatables etc
276255
inherited	properties	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
for instance this returns true and only if the specified type overrides the turningradius properties or declares a new one the properties has the myattribute attribute
okay given the extra information - i believe the problem is that getproperty is going up the inherited change
if you change your call to getproperty to then prop will be null if the properties isn t overridden
276842
ncover	partcover	partcover	opencover
Pattern(s): 
update opencover has replaced partcover
an alternative to ncover can be partcover is an open source code coverage tool for .net very similar to ncover it includes a console application a gui coverage browser and xsl transforms for use in cc.net
very interesting product
277177
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
unfortunately some more experienced programmers learn the wrong lesson and assume that everything always needs to be cached in ram or it will be too slow
modern operating systems have very sophisticated disk caches so the second time you access the same part of a file might be significantly faster
finally interactive programs should do all file operations in another thread so your application doesn t slow to a crawl or stop working when the disk is busy or when a remote volume is temporarily unavailable
277233
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 
the example you gave actually compiles c code where it is not an error to fail to declare function prototypes
if you meant to compile this as c++ code you would need the following command line g++ -o test test.cpp -framework opengl in that case you most certainly would get an error for not including gl.h and your code would fail to compile
when executing gcc from the command line g++ is the c++ compiler while gcc is the general c compiler
277445
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
there are numerous other differences however the common one s i am aware of are myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not innodb supports referential integrity whilst myisam does not innodb handles indexes a bit differently storing the primary key as part of every index making indexes take up more room on the disk but also making a covering index more likely myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking different memory buffer index settings are used in the mysql configuration files innodb is typically said to have better crash recovery as mentioned in another answer the data is store on disk differently
i believe innodb is configurable in this area and can have one file per table etc
if required i m sure a google search or the mysql site will bring up numerous other differences in more detail
277452
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
myisam uses a data file and an index file for each table stored in a directory named after the database
innodb seems to lump everything together in a file called ibdata1

277489
operands	scalar
Pattern(s): 
in scalar context or if the left operands is not enclosed in parentheses it returns a string consisting of the left operands repeated the number of times specified by the right operands
in list context if the left operands is enclosed in parentheses or is a list formed by qw string it repeats the list
if the right operands is zero or negative it returns an empty string or an empty list depending on the context
277511
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
myisam locks the whole table for reading while inserts updates are executing
innodb can do row-level locking thus allowing multiple concurrent writes and read on the table

279287
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
typically __init__.py is simply an empty file
if you structure your project this way src __init__.py main.py dirfoo __init__.py foo.py dirbar __init__.py bar.py then from foo.py you should be able to do import dirfoo.foo or from dirfoo.foo import fooobject per tom s comment this does require that the src folder is accessible either via site_packages or your search path
also as he mentions __init__.py is implicitly imported when you first import a module in that package directory
279805
tstringlist	tlist
Pattern(s): 
.add .insert .remove .clear etc. tstringlist has the basic tlist type methods and other methods custom to working with strings such as .savetofile and .loadfromfile if you want backwards compatibility then tstringlist is definitely the way to go
if you want enhanced functionality for working with a list of strings then tstringlist is the way to go. if you have some basic coding fundamentals that you want to work with a list of any type then perhaps you need to look away from tstringlist

280057
mousemove	mouseleave
Pattern(s): 
and yes they re classic vb -- that is vb6.
mousemove is the correct event in vb6
you ll have to do some work to manually detect when the mouseleave the client area cleanly
280621
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
the file should then get copied to the output directory where the test gets run
edit localtestrun.testrunconfig in your solution items folder
select the deployment option and add the hibernate.cfg.xml file to the list of additional files to deploy
280881
phpunit	simpletest	phpunit	simpletest
Pattern(s): 
simpletest is maintained by a small but involved group of people
phpunit seems to have a bigger userbase which may count as an argument for switching
i m quite happy with simpletest though
280900
vbscript	vba
Pattern(s): 
here is some sample vbscript to output a tab delimited file
vbscript works quite well with the jet engine
however i do not see why you say it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access. sub transfercsv docmd.transfertext acexportdelim putnameofqueryhere c putpathand filenamehere.csv true end sub is the usual way in vba
281024
ubuntu	centos
Pattern(s): 
these files have a simple syntax that enabled you to specify users groups and packages to install and even to script some custom stuff
fedora and ubuntu use totally different package managers so you won t be able to easily do it in any sort of generic way
in centos which is redhat enterprise edition with the serial numbers filed off and so therefore pretty close to fedora we did this using kickstart files
281479
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 
if it s a flashy custom-styled application with tons of custom controls and complex compositing swing is the only game in town
however if a simpler api is more important to you or if your users demand the ultimate in platform laf fidelity swt is the best choice

282162
phpunit	simpletest
Pattern(s): 
simpletest and phpunit which i prefer
read the tutorials on how to write and run tests on the homepage of phpunit
it is quite easy and well described
283767
textinput	textfield
Pattern(s): 
this event does not occur if you use data binding or actionscript code to change the text . you can also use the valuecommit event which is dispatched when the user commits the changes usually by moving the focus away from the textfield but remember that this event is also dispatched when the field value is changed programmatically
textinput is dispatched only when the user has input text into the control
change on the other hand is dispatched on every change committed by the user
284711
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 
a uinavigationcontroller is a distinct object that is very different from a uitabbarcontroller
in general your application should have a tab controller one of who s tab s loads a uinavigationcontroller which in turn loads it s views - not that both maintain management over the different views
it is also improper to refer to the display of a uiviewcontroller as such an object doesn t have a visual representation
284851
junit	testng	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
which are useful because maven will not execute the post-integration-test if any of the integration tests fail
not a problem with ant so i just use junit out of preference with it
in either case segmenting out the tests as both testng and junit do is helpful with integration tests too
285627
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
when you tag it with svn cp you re just making a copy of that particular revision with a longer name
and unlike a cvs tag you or other developers could continue doing ongoing development on that tag
it isn t a static entity like a cvs tag is well to be fair you can move a tag on individual cvs files which effectively changes it
285732
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 
these two techniques in tandem can form an iterative approach where you find the broad section of code that consumes the majority of your cycles using timers then instrumentation individual functions at a finer granularity to hone in on the problem
in essence if a profiling tool is not available you emulate what a profiling would have done
you insert counters into functions you think are interesting and count how many times and potentially with what size sort of arguments they re called
285809
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
if the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialversionuid than that of the corresponding sender s class then deserialization will result in an invalidclassexception
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization
286303
swt	swing	swt	swing
Pattern(s): 
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java
it depends with eclipse 3.4 swt 3.4 is quite supported with macos
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java
286617
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
note that the inline is just a compiler hint it doesn t force the method to be inlined. but that s good if the code size of an inner loop exceeds the instruction cache inlining easily hurts performance whether the pass return-by-reference can be resolved depends on the strength of your compiler i ve seen many where foo x out forces stack variables whereas x foo does keep values in registers
your wrapper itself will be inline however your method calls to the c library typically will not
this would require link-time-optimizations which are technically possible but to afaik rudimentary at best in todays tools generally a function call as such is not very expensive
286617
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
however inlining opens the door to more optimizations if you have v a + b + c your wrapper class forces the generation of stack variables whereas for inline calls the majority of the data can be kept in the fpu stack
also inline code allows simplifying instructions considering constant values and more
so while the measure before you invest rule holds true i would expect some room for improvements here
287676
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
then the attacker needs to know 1 the way you combine the salt and the password not much security there 2 the salt which is likely in the db already and 3 they have to compute that value for each combination of password and salt
that s a lot more than just computing hash of common passwords and looking for a match

288615
hash	md5	hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
there are no known pre-image attacks against md5
as of 2017 there s no research that comes even close to feasibility so even a determined well-funded attacker can t compute a url that would hash to a hash of any existing url in your database
the only known collision attack against md5 is not useful for attacking url-like keys
289396
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
a side note as the bin directory is managed by visual studio and is completely reproducible i suggest that it and it s sibling obj shouldn t be under source control
i assume that by bin folder you mean the build location where visual studio assembles the executable version of your application
generally i ve found that making manual changes to the bin folder is a good way to encounter a new world of pain
289412
mri	rubinius
Pattern(s): 
since approximately two years ago it is also possible to extend jruby in java and there is actually since last month a port of rcov for jruby
however this requires both a knowledge of ruby and c and a pretty deep knowledge at that because fiddling around with the internals of mri is not for the faint at heart
but only with rubinius will it be possible to write dynamic analysis tools such as code coverage tools in ruby itself making tool writing accessible to a much larger portion of the ruby community
290253
int	boolean	int	boolean	tinyint	boolean	tinyint	boolean
Pattern(s): 
for a boolean values bit 1 is pretty common
a tinyint is an 8-bit int value a bit field can store between 1 bit bit 1 and 64 bits bit 64
for a boolean values bit 1 is pretty common
290255
tinyint	boolean
Pattern(s): 
tinyint 1 allows any value that can be stored in a single byte -128..127 or 0..255 depending on whether or not it s unsigned the 1 shows that you intend to only use a single digit but it does not prevent you from storing a larger value
for versions older than 5.0.3 bit is interpreted as tinyint 1 so there s no difference there
bit has a this is a boolean semantic and some apps will consider tinyint 1 the same way due to the way mysql used to treat it so apps may format the column as a check box if they check the type and decide upon a format based on that
290553
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
i would like to see something like this in c# as it would simplify certain kinds of abstraction and contruction issues
was its support for mixin inherited - the methods from any other classes could be reused in your class
as long as your class provided the properties that these methods used it worked just fine and there was no diamond problem or other multiple-inheritance gotchas to worry about
290643
haskell	scheme
Pattern(s): 
inspired by lex augusteijn s sorting morphisms 3 ph.d
haskell programmer ate so many bananas that his eyes bugged out now he needs new lenses
post-doc haskell programmer from uustalu vene and pardo s recursion scheme from comonads 4 tenured professor teaching haskell to freshmen
290894
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
there s no reason to have multiple formats for a site available and any modern feed client can now parse atom feed
atom has quite a few technical advantages over rss and is being widely supported and utilized by major companies such as google and microsoft
as for branding i don t really care what acronym is used
290894
feeds	rss
Pattern(s): 
despite the proliferation of rss and atom feeds i d say the average web user still has no idea what they are
looking at it in that way the whole concept of syndication feeds is still in its infancy

291470
next	except
Pattern(s): 
after the script is loaded imported the python interpreter won t access it anymore except when printing source line in a exception stack trace
any pyc file will be regenerated the next time as the source file is newer than the pyc

292421
treemap	linkedhashmap
Pattern(s): 
in this case there two potential standard implementations you mights want linkedhashmap can retain the order that the entries were added
treemap a sortedmap navigablemap will sort the results order of which can be determined by a comparator
alternatively you might want a form of map that fire events or also provides a tablemodel
293400
emacs	jedit
Pattern(s): 
the thing about using emacs is that the editors extensions language is lisp so it is a great way to learn lisp
i tried for long to find a good editor for my scheme code besides emacs but even with emacs tringer foubles it was still the best
jedit was the second best but its kind of like saying that the choices between cake sawdust and dirt the sawdust was second best
293400
emacs	jedit
Pattern(s): 
jedit was the second best but its kind of like saying that the choices between cake sawdust and dirt the sawdust was second best
emacs with paredit mode just owns for structured editing of s expressions
add to that the highlight parens mode and it gets even better
295657
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 
of course if those additional clauses go anywhere near user text input you have to sanitize them to prevent sql injection attacks. the database can filtering faster than any other tier in general because using a where clause on the database will often allow the database to avoid even reading the unnecessary records off the disk which is several orders of magnitude slower than anything you can do with the cpu
sorting is often faster on the db as well because the db can often do the joins in such a way that records are already sorted in the order you want them
so performance wise if you can do it on the db all the better
297123
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
abstract data types are not specific to any one programming language and the map adt can also be known as a hash or a dictionary or an associative array others at
notice we re making a distinction between the dictionary class and the dictionary adt. the dictionary class has been marked as obsolete so it s best not to use it

298306
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
info checking out file opt viewstore common maven my_lf_ss vobs test_alm lf_build pom.xml info error build failure info info unable to enable editing on the pom.xml provider message the cleartool command failed. command output cleartool error element opt viewstore common maven my_lf_ss vobs test_alm lf_build pom.xml is already checked out to view my_lf_ss .
i have some maven repositories outside of clearcase for some third-parties libraries referential
but i have never used maven with clearcase since they follow a different logic maven needs signed names for files like myfile-1.2.jar whereas clearcase can store only myfile.jar and record the fact it is version labeled 1.2 that may have changed with the maven2 clearcase plugin reported by romaintaz but there is still some bugs in this new product as shown by this thread when one runs it a second time without unco ing the pom.xml file
298306
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
but i have never used maven with clearcase since they follow a different logic maven needs signed names for files like myfile-1.2.jar whereas clearcase can store only myfile.jar and record the fact it is version labeled 1.2 that may have changed with the maven2 clearcase plugin reported by romaintaz but there is still some bugs in this new product as shown by this thread when one runs it a second time without unco ing the pom.xml file
maven is getting through the checkout fine but is not able to whatever the next step is

299292
profiling	debugging
Pattern(s): 
we discovered this by enabling the cache debugging which puts a small comment in the html about what cache is being used
after changing the setting allow writers to view cached content in the authenticated cache profiling we are seeing what this does for editors but for regular viewers the anecdotal evidence is that it is having a big impact

300156
capitalize	uppercase
Pattern(s): 
the letter s position in a word can make a difference
there s also a a distinct notion of title case where you just want to capitalize the first letter of each word
sometimes the title-case of a character is not the same as its uppercase
300851
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
you are playing with numbers on the edge of the normal 31-32 bits range
please see additional documentation in the php manual the size of an integer is platform-dependent although a maximum value of about two billion is the usual value that s 32 bits signed
php does not support unsigned integers
300861
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 
however these only go so far if you add a large integer to a large integer php will see that the result is too big to fit into a normal integer and will assign it to a floating-point number
floating-point numbers floats themselves only go so high however and there s a point around the sixteen-digit mark where php will just lose the plot entirely
there is an option to use arbitrary-precision mathematics which supports numbers of any size and precision represented as strings
301455
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
many people still use hashing for this purpose and md5 is a popular algorithm that gives you a 128-bit signature for the file with a high probability of changing when the contents of the file changes
in the general case you need to look at every bit of the file to include it in the hash and performance will probably be i o-limited
it s a sequential sweep over all data in the file updating the state of whatever hash algorithm you use for each new byte
304007
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
if those are what you need then maven is the right tool
if you re just looking for a tool for dependency management you may want to look into ant s ivy too
it has been used in most of the projects that i worked on and
304481
minix	linux
Pattern(s): 
i d say go for it but remember that it is an experimenal environment not what you want for your day-to-day system
minix 3 is a new version
linux was prompted on the original minix
304481
minix	linux
Pattern(s): 
linux was prompted on the original minix
minix is really best suited to small systems of embedded systems
if you have an old x86 pc around it should run minix handily giving you an environment very much like what we called an amazing workstation in the mid-80 s
304880
maven	m2e
Pattern(s): 
along with the m2e plugin for eclipse managing dependencies becomes a doddle - it has an excellent dependency visualisation tool
overall i would say maven is a great tool starting out on a project but may start to lose its way once your build begins to gain complexity

305087
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
override folder working directory path to which the files from star team are to be checked out for the build
if not specified the original working folder specified in the starteam will be used to extract the files
auto get source specifying this to true will allow cruisecontrol.net to automatically check out files from starteam filehistoryregex i had to make a change to the date regular expression as my regional settings was configured to english india wherein datetime is specified as dd-mm-yyyy hh mi ss ist
307510
extjs	mootools
Pattern(s): 
for things that need really slick animations i used to find that mootools was a little bit smoother but at least 8 months since i had to do anything with that much eye candy so my testing probably out of date
for an ajax widget fest dojo or yui or extjs probably have a bit more to offer but at the expense of library size and complexity
so sorry if that s a little vague but like anything else it comes down to what is the right tool for the job as a general purpose tool jquery usually wins for me but it depends a lot on the job
310850
bigloo	gambit	bigloo	gambit
Pattern(s): 
gambit-c gambit benchmarks
bigloo bigloo enables full connections between scheme and c programs between scheme and java programs and between scheme and c# programs
gambit-c gambit benchmarks
311254
maven-dependency-plugin	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
more about the dependency plugin
with maven-dependency-plugin it s possible to resolve dependency conflicts and cyclic dependency problems
add to your pom.xml then run mvn dependency resolve or mvn dependency build-classpath to test it
312199
3-tier	n-tier	3-tier	n-tier
Pattern(s): 
i say this based on the n-tier architecture i have to work with
it s based on how you separate the presentation layer from the core business logic and data access wikipedia 3-tier means presentation layer + component layer + data access layer
n-tier is when unneccessary layers are added beyond these three and it s labeled with a buzzword so it doesn t seem like your architects are a bunch of crack monkeys
312593
packets	multicast	packets	multicast
Pattern(s): 
here is the abstract pragmatic general multicast pgm is a reliable multicast transport protocol for applications that require ordered or unordered duplicate-free multicast data delivery from multiple sources to multiple receivers
pgm guarantees that a receiver in the group either receives all data packets from transmissions and repairs or is able to detect unrecoverable data packets loss
pgm is specifically intended as a workable solution for multicast applications with basic reliability requirements
313394
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
as a side note https usually listens on port 443 rather than port 80
ssl is the secure socket layer a cryptographic protocol to encrypt network traffic
the most recent version of ssl is version 3 which fixed some known issues in sslv2
313523
np-hard	np-complete
Pattern(s): 
note that np-complete problems are also np-hard
however not all np-hard problems are np or even a decision problem despite having np as a prefix
that is the np in np-hard does not mean non-deterministic polynomial time
317990
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords
generally i prefer to keep passwords as hash that can t be recovered rather than as encrypted items that can be decrypted
by computing a hash from a visitor-supplied string plus some salt of course i can tell whether the user provided the same password twice without the security risk of allowing my application to be able to decrypt the provided password possibly maliciously
317990
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
by computing a hash from a visitor-supplied string plus some salt of course i can tell whether the user provided the same password twice without the security risk of allowing my application to be able to decrypt the provided password possibly maliciously
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

318010
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
it s beneficial in both scenarios
some applications require the user s password to be retrievable as opposed to a system where the user s password is randomly reset to something if forgotten because it cannot be decrypted because you re using a hash
also keep with the suggestion of using a salt value whether you hash or encrypt
318829
jsf	seam
Pattern(s): 
its always possible to use any orm framework with it because jsf doesn t play directly with the database it doesn t even know about it
hibernate + jsf is a very common combination
but if you are asking about using jsf managed beans with a jpa framework have a look at seam
319028
fgets	getchar
Pattern(s): 
if there is no terminating n before the ending 0 it may be that there is more data or that the next request will report end-of-file
you ll have to do another fgets to determine which is which
in this regard looping with getchar is easier. in the updated example code above if line sizeof line -1 0 after successful fgets you know that the buffer was filled completely

qmainwindow	qwidget
Pattern(s): 
the window with the tabs would not need to be a qmainwindow unless you want to also want add a toolbar to that window as well
you can have as many qmainwindow instances as you want
a qmainwindow is just a qwidget which provides a menu bar toolbar status bar and docking framework
319796
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
once you have your project built using maven all that is required for someone who wants to build from source is to run mvn install
fwiw the same can be accomplished using ant ivy to some degree

320181
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
i mark all my classes with sealed unless i specifically want to enable inherited and in those few cases i only make the required methods virtual
it is easy to remove the sealed tag if the class needs to change to allow inherited in the future
however if you want to change a class which is already being used as a base class for some other type you risk breaking the subclassing when you change the base class
322081
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
therefore the getter defined by your interface will be marked virtual when implemented in a derived class
the dbkey property getter is virtual in the il because it is in an interface
the setter is not virtual because it is not part of the interface but part of the concrete class
323221
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 

to talk to the same instance between appdomains it must inherited from marshalbyrefobject
done this way every method call to the object including properties etc is actually a remoting call to the other app-domain
324087
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
ntfs will operate in compatibility mode with that.
if i were you i would never rely on any version of any filesystems driver be it microsoft s be it another os s to be consistent about the algorithm it uses to generate short file names
the exact behavior of the microsoft fastfat and ntfs drivers is not officially documented except as somewhat high level overviews thus are not part of the api contract
324355
lxml	libxml2
Pattern(s): 
also libxml2 has more features
lxml is mostly api compatible with xml.etree.elementtree
and there is good documentation in its web site
325964
range	max	range	min
Pattern(s): 
deriving this from above if start and end dates can be out of order if it is possible that or then you also have to check that they are in order so that means you have to add two additional validity rules or or or but to implement min and max you have to code using c ternary for terseness
starta endb and enda startb proof let conditiona mean that daterange a completely after daterange b _ |---- daterange a ------| |---date range b -----| _ true if let conditionb mean that daterange a is completely before daterange b |---- daterange a -----| _ _ |---date range b ----| true if then overlap exists if neither a nor b is true - if one range is neither completely after the other nor completely before the other then they must overlap. now one of de morgan s laws says that not a or b not a and not b which translates to note this includes conditions where the edges overlap exactly
if you wish to exclude that change the operators to and to note2
326073
post	get
Pattern(s): 
the get is also easily accessible by manually adding query parameters to the url in the form of name-value pairs
the beauty and complexity of the post however is that the name-value pairs are communicated from the browser to the web server enclosed within the http request header which is not as easily accessible
the only way to accomplish the post without using a tag is to manually alter the http request header and add the name-value pairs in yourself
327402
prng	random
Pattern(s): 
what you want to do is to have an uniform random generated but restricted to a certain range in this case an entropy of 4
if your prng has say an entropy of 32-bit you cannot be certain that computing the output mod 4 will work as expected
this require a bit more work
327810
glassfish	geronimo
Pattern(s): 
for example by using the geronimo server which uses tomcat as its container or by taking the jar files from glassfish
glassfish is a complete java application server with implementation for apis like jpa ejbs and more
glassfish contains a servlet engine initially used by tomcat but they improved it don t know what exactly
328604
vsts	tfs
Pattern(s): 
so when you re using the full microsoft stack vsts and tfs i d suggest just sticking with msbuild scripts
i m actually still trying to figure this question out myself but there is one big bonus for msbuild here using the same build file for local continuous integration by calling msbuild.exe directly while also being able to use vsts s server-side continuous integration with the same build file albeit most likely different properties settings
as compared to teamcity s support for msbuild scripts vsts only supports msbuild scripts
328942
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 
in the case of uitabbarcontroller these are properties that can and do change
the uitabbaritem is actually more of a button than anything else
it s the thing you tap on to select a tab
329223
prepare	execute
Pattern(s): 
using a prepare and execute style means that only one place execute needs to know about escaping if escaping is even necessary
it s always better to use prepare queries and parameter placeholders
like this in perl dbi for best performance prepare all your often-used queries right after opening the database connection
329243
division	multiplication	division	addition
Pattern(s): 
since most processors can do an addition comparison or multiplication in a single cycle those are all counted as one flop
but division always takes longer
how much longer depends on the processor but there s sort of a defacto standard in the hpc community to count one division as 4 flops
330999
cvs	svn	cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
svn is good enough for most purposes and has the userbase community and tool support to make it a very attractive choice for people just getting started
cvs used to be the default it was pretty much the only answer
svn was designed explicitly to be a better cvs
331283
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	hash	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
md5 and now even sha1 may be broken but they are still relatively good for password hash and md5 is still the standard for linux local passwords
for some added strength you can get the crypt module to use md5 by using a salt in the format
where abcdefgh is your salt string
331283
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
Pattern(s): 
where abcdefgh is your salt string
note that this is a gnu extension to crypt see man crypt on a linux system
md5 and now even sha1 may be broken but they are still relatively good for password hash and md5 is still the standard for linux local passwords
332975
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 
however note that the set check can still be used with a typecast to eliminate the truncation warning actually this is the only reason that charinset exists its output on my laptop here is charinset 0.261 seconds case stmt 0.077 seconds set test 0.060 seconds
aqtime is an instrumenting profiling
instrumenting profilers often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured
333631
webkit	gecko
Pattern(s): 
having said that there are independent efforts underway to bring it to ie
with gecko-engined browsers you get in terms of other browsers implementing these features i m only aware of webkit implementing array extras but it s actually quite easy to monkeypatch support for those in all browsers since they re just additional methods
gecko opera and webkit also support the canvas element which although being a new html element is used via javascript so i m not sure if that fits your criteria
334646
windbg	mdbg
Pattern(s): 
but i used to do .net debugging support for msft and i ve never needed anything like that to troubleshoot memory leaks
windbg is first and foremost a win32 kernel debugger
so you may want to try one of the managed debuggers like mdbg
335379
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
happily sql server 2008 allows you to have your cake and eat it too with the filestream attribute in sql server 2008 you can apply the filestream attribute to a varbinary column and sql server then stores the data for that column on the local ntfs filesystems
storing the data on the filesystems brings two key benefits performance matches the streaming performance of the filesystems
blob size is limited only by the filesystems volume size
337637
jflex	cup	jflex	cup
Pattern(s): 
it works closely with cup which is a bit closer regarding actions
not sure if this is an answer but one of the scanner generators i regularly use is jflex which outputs java code
it works closely with cup which is a bit closer regarding actions
338821
wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 
however using joomla can be difficult at first as its content organization is rather complex
if the site would consist of basic blog-like webpages then wordpress is the way to go
wordpress is a very simple blogging cms with a huge user community
338821
wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 
wordpress is a very simple blogging cms with a huge user community
it s very easy to use has many plugins for it and the newest version of wordpress even has auto-updating features
wordpress isn t as good as joomla when it comes to user management though
340682
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
calling initanint on the properties raises an error
you shouldn t create public fields variables on classes you never know when you ll want to change it to have get set accessor and then you don t know what code you re going to break especially if you have clients that program against your api
also you can have different access modifiers for the get set get
346183
getter	setter	public	protected
Pattern(s): 
don t assume that the goal should be to keep all variables private. in cases of inheritance making variables as protected is usually a good alternative
rather than marking all instance data public you create getter setter for those that need to be accessed to the outside world
don t make them all available - only the ones you need
346958
width	margin
Pattern(s): 
without being given a width #inner is automatically expanding to the full width of #outer which causes its contents to be flush left
the problem is that you need to give #inner a set width anything but auto or inherit
the margin 0 auto
348516
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
one other note if you are using ntfs based storage windows server etc you might consider finding a way around putting thousands and thousands of files in one directory
i am not sure why but sometimes the filesystems does not cope well with that situation
if anyone knows more about this i would love to hear it
348548
codeigniter	kohana
Pattern(s): 
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv
assuming you are using the latest version of codeigniter codeigniter which is 1.7.0 codeigniter is pretty strict about what characters it allows in urls
you can modify the regex that is used to filter urls
350855
anjuta	kdevelop	anjuta	gnome	anjuta	geany
Pattern(s): 
looks promising
then there are some others where i cannot tell you how they are since i ve not tested them including anjuta for the gnome desktop and code blocks written with wxwidgets it s quite cross-platform
if all you want is a gui for the compiler and a symbol browser you could also use geany which is very fast and includes an embedded terminal like kdevelop
351679
vtk	paraview
Pattern(s): 
i believe the memory footprint was close to 500mb but i also had a 400 000 point set where each point had a 7-tuple vector property and some other miscellaneous data available as well
i wanted to point out that in addition to using vtk directly there are two other products built on vtk that may be of interest to you
1 paraview paraview.org is a user interface built on top of vtk that makes scientific visualization products much easier
351952
overwrite	preserve
Pattern(s): 
applying changes corresponding only to the differences between the model and the underlying db
that means any customizations renamed properties navigation properties etc that you have made in other areas of your model will not be removed overwrite unless they are in conflict with the underlying db schema
in which case you can still preserve them by adding them to the add-in s exclusion list you can download it and get a free 30-day trial license from
352804
onmouseover	onclick
Pattern(s): 
because some mobile browsers read handheld media and some insist on screen styles and pretend to have 960px-wide screen iphone you ll need to serve mobile stylesheet with both the latter is css3 media query very useful and works with other mobile browsers too you can use it in stylesheets with
don t rely on hover or onmouseover because these events don t work on touch screens
onclick is delayed mousemove may not work
352860
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
... a method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of error that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught since these errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur
as the specification mentions an error is only thrown in circumstances that are chances are when an error occurs there is very little the application can do and in some circumstances the java virtual machine itself may be in an unstable state such as virtualmachineerror although an error is a subclass of throwable which means that it can be caught by a try-catch clause but it probably isn t really needed as the application will be in an abnormal state when an error is thrown by the jvm
there s also a short section on this topic in section 11.5 the exception-handling hierarchy of the java language specification 2nd edition
354067
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
that s my thoughts anyway
i wouldn t create a publisher class to inherited book since publisher isn t a book it is metadata information about a book. the bible though would inherited book
my advice would be to create a publisher properties on the book. this publisher could be of type ipublishinformation and the string publisher could use a namedpublisher string name class implementing ipublishinformation
354253
mergesort	timsort
Pattern(s): 
and since you don t care about lexicographic order the hash table solution sounds better for you if you can afford to hash the keys
a galloping mergesort such as python s built-in sort c.f
timsort has good expected performance when there are large runs of already-sorted data like in your example identical objects -- you ll skip o log n work per merge
354253
mergesort	timsort
Pattern(s): 
timsort has good expected performance when there are large runs of already-sorted data like in your example identical objects -- you ll skip o log n work per merge
you can also distribute a mergesort across multiple cpu s and disks if your dataset is extremely large this is called an external sort
however it will be worst case o nlog n
355064
trie	tree
Pattern(s): 
i can t think of anything more simple and straightforward than that and it preserves efficient string storage and searching
to store a word like stackoverflow insert into trie path values s st sta stac stack stacko stackov stackove stackover stackover stackoverf stackoverflo stackoverflow
the materialized path in the tree is the prefixed sequence of characters itself
355405
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if you re using a single ip for multiple sites configure the ip and hostnames domains that will be used to access that site so iis will know which site entries belong to which domains and where to route the requests
generally when i configure iis i set the properties for the default web site to a folder that doesn t contain anything then create individual entries within iis for each web site
for example you would create a new entry for myapplication.com and set its home directory to the proper folder on the server that contains your root files usually c inetpub wwwroot myapplication.com but it could be anywhere you like
355768
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
no you have spotted a problem with using inherited - that subclassing get tightly coupled to superclasses and their internals so it can be fragile
that is why effective java and others say you should favour delegation before inherited if possible
i think krosenvold s solution sounds clean
356028
range	max	range	max	range	min	range	min
Pattern(s): 
the use of min max value is very inelegant but i m not aware of a good way around it at the moment
yep easily possible just make sure you re covering the times in your indexes to pull it based purely off the dates a small amount of trickery is required due to sphinx requiring a bounded range x..y as opposed to x y
the use of min max value is very inelegant but i m not aware of a good way around it at the moment
356920
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
if you have the necessary resources i would advise to look into fixing it up
google-chrome uses webkit a fairly standard rendering engine
safari uses it also and it doesn t sound like webkit is going away
360494
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
Pattern(s): 
some of its strategies include passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors
active loadbalancing if there are 3 tasks 2 on one physical cpu and 1 on the other when the second physical processors goes idle the scheduler will attempt to migrate one of the tasks to it
it does this while attempting to keep thread affinity because when a thread migrates to another physical processors it will have to refill all levels of cache from main memory causing a stall in the task
361157
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 
if you want to control the position of a view make it a subview of the view controlled by your uiviewcontroller
because the view owned by a uiviewcontroller fills the available space in its parent
its parent will be either a uiwindow or the view controlled by something like a uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller
361949
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
this is because tcp enforces an ordering before passing data to an application by default you can get around this by setting the urg pointer but no one seems to ever do this and that can be highly undesirable in an environment where you d rather get current realtime data than get old data reliably
udp is often used for various types of realtime traffic that doesn t need strict ordering to be useful
this is because tcp enforces an ordering before passing data to an application by default you can get around this by setting the urg pointer but no one seems to ever do this and that can be highly undesirable in an environment where you d rather get current realtime data than get old data reliably
362315
equals	icomparable
Pattern(s): 
by the way type should just use the regular reference compare provided by equals so it should just work fine with the above
do you mean this works with for else falls back to equals
there is also for inequality comparisons greater less this uses or t icomparable otherwise
362315
equals	icomparable
Pattern(s): 
there is also for inequality comparisons greater less this uses or t icomparable otherwise
by the way type should just use the regular reference compare provided by equals so it should just work fine with the above

362425
strtok	malloc
Pattern(s): 
for example you call malloc from thread1 and thread2 and they both get memory but they don t access each other s memory
a counter-example would be strtok which is not thread safe and would break even on unrelated calls
as soon as your threads start to talk to each other over data the usual thread safety doesn t guarantee much
362937
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
i don t have to write a default passthrough to a hashtable.hashcode object o method which frankly seems like it s moving away from object orientation
if there is a framework class that does almost exactly what you want but a particular function of its interface throws a notsupported exception or for some other reason you only want to override one method to do something specific to your implementation it s much easier to write a subclass and override that one method rather than write a brand new class and write pass-throughs for each of the other 27 methods in the class
similarly what about java for example where every object inherited from object and therefore automatically has implementations of equals hashcode etc
363214
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
Pattern(s): 
unlike a statically typed compiled-language it is rather easy to use dynamic hooks such as __get and __set and reflection to make generic abstract objects
i m rather sceptical on the merits of code generation in the context of a dynamic-languages such as php
you can generally use other kinds of abstraction to get the same results
363594
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
say the control class contains basic drawing functions ie paint - well control would become a basiccontroldelegate or similar and the subclasses would be created with a reference to a basiccontroldelegate which would be used for all inherited functionality
if you want to use the parent delegate functionality as-is you create a paint method in the each subclass which simply calls the same method on the delegate
if you want to change the functionality you create a different implementation
365834
innodb	myisam	innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
in innodb however primary keys are clustered meaning they stay attached to the data pages and ensure that the row contents remain in physically sorted order on disk according to the primary key but only within single data pages which themselves could be scattered in any order. this being the case i would expect that innodb might have an advantage in that myisam would essentially have to do double work -- write the integer once in the data pages and then write it again in the index pages
innodb wouldn t do this the primary key index would be identical to the data pages and would only have to write once
it would only have to manage the data in one place where myisam would needlessly have to manage two copies
366741
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
some languages like java have a fairly limited set of language features available meaning that subclassing is fairly often used because it s a convenient method for re-use technical inherited
closures and lambdas of c# make inherited for technical reasons much less relevant
so normally inherited is used for semantic reasons like cat extends animal
366864
hide	show
Pattern(s): 
the thing with web development as the nature of your question already show is that there are so many ways to do the same thing with the same results
though these are by no means official the common practices that i follow would result in something like this create the element that will act as the notification container in the markup but hide it by default this can be done numerous ways - javascript external css or inline styles
keep the scripts responsible for the behavior of the notification outside of the markup
367279
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
compatible upgrade
when merely altering a table to add a column that permits nulls the versioning number stays the same
incompatible upgrade
367335
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
users may need this to troubleshoot problems perhaps while in contact with tech support or when using a knowledge base
use a versioning number system such that this is all the user needs to specify their build
versioning number is also needed for the users to know if they can upgrade
367901
packets	pcap
Pattern(s): 
it seems this tool can import pcap files and some other formats and edit them
it can then export the edited packets again but only to colasoft capsa packets files colasoft s own capture file format
but that should not be a problem as packets player is be able to read their own format
371348
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 
the rules are if two things are equal then they must return the same value for gethashcode if the gethashcode is equal it is not necessary for them to be the same
this is a collision and equals will be called to see if it is a real equality or not
in this case it looks like return fooid
371946
stringbuilder	stringwriter
Pattern(s): 
something like this
i suspect it s because it s writing to a stringbuilder which is inherently utf-16
an alternative to get round this is to create a class derived from stringwriter but which overrides the encoding property
372544
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
in java a static member method or field cannot be overridden by subclasses this is not necessarily true in other object oriented languages see smalltalk. a static member may be hidden but that is fundamentally different than overridden
since static members cannot be overriden in a subclass the abstract annotation cannot be applied to them
as an aside - other languages do support static inherited just like instance inherited
373446
bluecloth	rdiscount
Pattern(s): 
the guts are implemented in c
see also moving past bluecloth on ryan tomayko s blog
ryan s post includes the following benchmark of 100 iterations of a markdown test bluecloth 13.029987s total time 00.130300s average maruku 08.424132s total time 00.084241s average rdiscount 00.082019s total time 00.000820s average update august 2009 bluecloth2 was released it s speed is on par with rdiscount because it is based on rdiscount - it is not pure ruby
373446
kramdown	bluecloth	kramdown	rdiscount
Pattern(s): 
ryan s post includes the following benchmark of 100 iterations of a markdown test bluecloth 13.029987s total time 00.130300s average maruku 08.424132s total time 00.084241s average rdiscount 00.082019s total time 00.000820s average update august 2009 bluecloth2 was released it s speed is on par with rdiscount because it is based on rdiscount - it is not pure ruby
thanks jim update november 2009 kramdown 1.0 was just released
i haven t tried it yet but it is a pure-ruby markdown parser that claims to be 5x faster than maruku
374428
equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 
if b is a subtype of a and a s equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof a and b s equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof b it is quite likely that the equivalence relation defined by these methods is not symmetric
this is only for classes implementing comparable and allows for an implementation of equals which is always the same
all comparison logics to be located into one place only the compareto function
376517
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
for scheme the easiest way to get started is drscheme
like others i suggest using emacs for common lisp
the easiest way to get started is lispbox which is emacs + slime + some common lisp implementation all fully featured and already configured
376828
haskell	scheme
Pattern(s): 
examples the programming language scheme is dynamically typed aka duck-typed and it has many dozens of interpreted implementations but also some fine native-code compilers including larceny gambit and plt scheme which includes both an interpreter and a jit compiler making seamless transitions
the programming language haskell is statically typed
the two most famous implementations are the interpreter hugs and the compiler ghc
376913
try-catch	exception-handling	try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
this code is a better replacement while the older code blocks look like or that s the microsoft enterprise library way of providing configurable exception-handling handler within hard-coded action policy plus if you have action policy you can tell it configure to log sleep retry on certain types of exception-handling instead of simply failing or doing some other hard-coded action
for complex production-grade scenarios it is a horrible practice to have multiple try-catch statements and it is highly inflexible practice to have these statements within the business logic at all
windows cloud computing team their code has to be efficient and reliable seems to stick with the exception-handling handling action policies instead
377155
polymorphism	specialization
Pattern(s): 
it means that the function measure takes a list of anything a is a generic type parameter because it starts with a lowercase letter and returns an integer
so this works for a list of any element type - it s what would be called a function template in c++ or a polymorphism function in haskell not the same as a polymorphism class in c++
we can now define that by providing specialization for each interesting case measure the empty list and you get zero
377533
inherited	subclassing	inherited	base-class
Pattern(s): 
there is a precedence issue - the overridden method is defined in the base-class so for best method purposes the overload even with an implicit cast is preferable since it is defined in the most-specific type the subclassing
if you re-declared the method new then it would get precedence but you can t override and new a method with the same name and signature in the same type - you d have to add an extra level of inherited to achieve this
the exact logic for this is detailed in 14.5.5 and 14.4.2 of ecma 334 v4
378253
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
all their code is self-contained in a single working directory that contains just what they need they can checkout multiple versions of multiple projects into separate working directory without wasting space and still keep track of what the hell is going on
it may require some minor refactoring of your workspace if project1 expects to find project2 outside of it s project folder rather than inside but that s a minor tweak in the grand scheme of things
if you really have your heart set on a single repository that s fine too that s what we use at my workplace and at home come to think of it however do ensure that you have a structure where each project has its own tags trunk branches folders and that checking out the trunk of project1 is all you need to do to get the code for project1 to build
379153
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 
in some of the cases you can copy out the subquery and execute it outside the context of the large query
this form also allows you to put the filtering clauses with the individual subquery and save the joining clauses for the final select
at work our development grouping generally finds them easier to maintain and frequently faster
379625
post	get
Pattern(s): 
for instance let s assume that you have a get request to a page which lets the user add an administrator to a site and the user clicks a link to a page which does a response.redirect username attackernamehere
while normally a post does not offer much protection against this nothing will stop someone from having a form method post action sharepoint has a concept of form digests which contain information about the previous request that is generating the post back including the user s name
this reduces the footprint for this kind of attack significantly
380149
range	max	range	minimum	range	min	minimum	max
Pattern(s): 
the xor operation used here widens both operands to int64 which requires an explicit cast back to longint so the min function will produce the correct result
finally if the operands are all neg the minimum will be found in the upper range and the answer will be neg
in this case we want the answer to be 0 so we simply clip it with the max function
381368
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
the cpu always reads at its word size 4 bytes on a 32-bit processors so when you do an unaligned address access on a processors that supports it the processors is going to read multiple words
the cpu will read each word of memory that your requested address straddles
this causes an amplification of up to 2x the number of memory transactions required to access the requested data
382550
polymorphism	specialization
Pattern(s): 
generic in haskell usually means polytypic but aboe i use the c++ meaning of generic
in haskell functions are as generic polymorphism as possible - the compiler will infer the most general type
for example themarko s example swap is polymorphism by default in the absence of a type signature main let swap a b b a main t swap swap t t1 - t1 t as for partial specialization ghc has a non-98 extension file c ghc ghc-6.10.1 doc users_guide pragmas.html#specialize-pragma also note that there s a mismatch in terminology

polymorphism	specialization
Pattern(s):

rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
from experimentation google reader seems to pass through certain styles unharmed
the philosophy of rss is indeed that the reader is responsible for presentation
many people think that rss should be plain text and that css in rss feed is inappropriate
383540
tostring	getter
Pattern(s): 
javascript s fundamental data structure is the object a special type of map which only accepts strings as keys and has special semantics like prototypical inheritance getter and setters and some further voodoo
when usings objects as maps you have to remember that the key will be converted to a string value via tostring which results in mapping 5 and 5 to the same value and all objects which don t overwrite the tostring method to the value indexed by
you might also involuntarily access its inherited properties if you don t check hasownproperty

dotnetzip	sharpziplib	dotnetzip	sharpziplib
Pattern(s): 
sharpziplib is a far more powerful and flexible solution
i ve found the dotnetzip library to be this easiest way to work with zip files
sharpziplib is a far more powerful and flexible solution
385054
typedef	typename
Pattern(s): 
in c not c++ you were required to use enum enumname to refer to a data element of the enumerated type
to simplify it you were allowed to typedef it to a single name data type
allowed functions taking a parameter of the enum to be defined as void f myenum x instead of the longer void f enum myenum x note that the name of the typename does not need to be equal to the name of the enum
385727
directcast	out
Pattern(s): 
with linq you can just use oftype for this purpose but you see what i mean... in my experience direct casting is appropriate more often than trycast - although with generics i find myself casting a lot less often than i used to anyway
for c# developers trycast is similar to as and directcast is the equivalent of normal casting
as mike pointed out in the comments as works for nullable value types but trycast doesn t. if the value really should be a t then directcast is indeed the right way to go - it fails fast with an appropriate error
386164
metaclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
also inside class definitions self is set to the class being defined so class greeting def self.say_hello hello end #is the same as def greeting.informal hi end end what happens there is that the object greeting which is of class class gets a new metaclass with the new methods so when you call there s no such thing as class methods in ruby but the semantics are similar
a quick explanation of what that means in ruby you can define methods on a particular object what happens when you do that is that the object a which is of class string gets its class changed to a ghost class aka metaclass singleton class or eigenclass
that new class superclass is string
386164
metaclass	superclass

that new class superclass is string

386948
armadillo	blitz++
Pattern(s): 
mathstudio mathstudio.sourceforge.net an interactive equation editor and step-by-step solver
library armadillo c++ library the armadillo c++ library aims to provide an efficient base for linear algebra operations matrix and vector maths while having a straightforward and easy to use interface
blitz++ blitz++ is a c++ class library for scientific computing biginteger c# libapmath welcome to the homepage of the apmath-project
389002
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
if you re doing a lot of lookups by pk or indeed range scans etc this is a good thing because it means that it won t need to fetch as many blocks from the disc
a non-pk unique index will never be clustered in innodb
on the other hand some other engines myisam in particular don t cluster the pk so the primary key is just like a normal unique index
389824
innodb	myisam	innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
myisam is effectively always autocommit
innodb enforces foreign key constraints
myisam doesn t enforce or even store foreign key constraints
390005
decimal	ieee
Pattern(s): 
the double type complies with the iec 60559 1989 ieee 754 standard for binary floating-point arithmetic
edit the reason why decimal has a getbits and double does not is that decimal preserves significant digits
3.0000m 3.00m but the exponents mantissas are actually different
392599
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
so the decoding logic of those designs is to translate cisc-type instructions into small uops which are generally targeted at a simpler load store unit risc-like
in this aspect we can say altough this may not be technically exact that machine code describes the higher-level complex instructions of the architecture not the real operations that are carried atomically by the underlying execution logic of the cpu
so we ve an architectural instruction set or architectural machine code and an inner-level micro-instruction set which is hidden from the outer world. the trace cache of the intel processors was conceived to store such ops to optimize the superscalar performance of the processors as the cpu executes uops not the architectural instruction-set available for execution by programs
395979
gridview	formview
Pattern(s): 
if you need to insert a new row formview appears also in a separate space
gridview shows them all like an html table
if you click on a key in a row detailview shows the details for the row in a separate space
397268
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
lots of com components seem to be 32 bit only i know this is a generalisation but is often the case
in order to use them you need to build your application as 32 bit x86
64bit windows has different 32 and 64bit registry nodes
397529
perl	tcl
Pattern(s): 
even when writing in c c++ i found a useful pattern was to embed a domain specific scripting language tcl though i don t much like that language
the actual choice of language is i think a religious choice though there are some tradeoffs that are obvious readability for example - perl is useful but is too easy to write cryptic scripts in
in some ways it is a write-only language -
399731
webclient	webrequest
Pattern(s): 
namespace system.net assembly system in system.dll you can alternatively use the system.net.webclient class webclient class provides common methods for sending data to and receiving data from a resource identified by a uri
namespace system.net assembly system in system.dll this class simplifies some common tasks like downloading a file method downloadfile the webclient class provides common methods for sending data to or receiving data from any local intranet or internet resource identified by a uri
the webclient class uses the webrequest class to provide access to resources
401693
salt	md5	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
with that type of salting even md5 is decently secure
i usually use sha1 and salt with the user id or some other user-specific piece of information and sometimes i additionally use a constant salt so i have 2 parts to the salt
sha1 is now also considered somewhat compromised but to a far lesser degree than md5
404802
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
also since you raised the issue yes the try-catch block does incur some overhead even if the exception-handling is not thrown
personally and i think this is backed up by convention eafp is never a good way to go. you can look at it as an equivalent to the following as opposed to moreover consider the following this may look a lot less elegant and yes this is a crude example - bear with me but it gives you much greater granularity in handling the error as opposed to wrapping it all in a try-catch to get that nullpointerexception and then try to figure out where and why you got it
the way i see it eafp should never be used except for rare situations
405361
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
the superclass changes and the subclassing is now broken
test every single method individually for each implementation class in particular failure to override a superclass method properly is a common bug
the author of the subclassing makes assumptions about the superclass
405484
webkit	gecko
Pattern(s): 
it is the user style sheet.
soypunk already mentioned the ua style sheet for webkit
the ua style sheet for gecko in standards mode consists of ua.css forms.css and html.css
408200
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
the good news is that matlab supports java objects so you can do something like this
matlab s for-loop is static in nature
you cannot modify loops variable between iterations unlike the for initialization
408830
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
finally you might also want to check out swt the gui toolkit used for eclipse and an alternative to both awt and swing which is somewhat of a return to the awt idea of accessing native widgets through java
awt is a java interface to native system gui code present in your os
it will not work the same on every system although it tries
408830
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
features of widgets that aren t the same on every platform might not be supported or worse they might work differently on each platform
people used to invest lots of effort to get their awt applications to work consistently across platforms - for instance they may try to make calls into native code from java
because awt uses native gui widgets your os knows about them and handles putting them in front of each other etc. whereas swing widgets are meaningless pixels within a window from your os s point of view
409034
bazaar	rcs	bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
one thing to note it will not mark your file read-only like rcs but i consider this an advantage
modern distributed version control systems like git mercurial or bazaar are the best tool in a situation like this
not because of the distributed aspect which is clearly not crucial here but because it is extremely easy to create a repository in-place
410681
converter	multibinding
Pattern(s): 
you should be able to do something along the lines of by using a multibinding and using self as the first binding we can then lookup resources in our converter
the converter needs to implement imultivalueconverter rather than ivalueconverter and can look something like this it s not something i do very often but that should work from memory

412098
uiview	calayer	uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 
my assertion that the calayer associated with a uiview shares the same coordinate system could in fact be entirely erroneous
it could also be that calayers use the same coordinate system as uiview they re never flipped vertically but i thought they were since coregraphics uses a flipped coordinate system relative to uikit
a simple way to test would be to add a screen-sized calayer as the sublayer of a view s layer then add another small calayer as a sublayer of that
412292
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
there is also sun s virtualbox which is free and the latest version is rather nice but i haven t looked at how slow disk operations are yet
with vmware disk operations are slower
for php development i doubt it would be a problem but you d definitely notice it if you are compiling a large c++ project
412765
free	malloc	free	memset	free	calloc
Pattern(s): 
the c translation of java code looks correct
second the suggested automatic free cannot work malloc does not initialize the allocated memory
i would use calloc instead or add a memset after malloc
413093
tostring	icomparable
Pattern(s): 
iequatable or icomparable or similar comes to mind
tostring - not all classes can be converted to a string should be moved to an interface
iformattable or similar comes to mind
413151
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
for example if you want a string which cannot be read by humans encrypt it - check out the mcrypt extension which offers a variety of options
if you want to make a tamper-proof string which is human readable add a secure hash to it
md5 is indeed falling out of favour so try sha1
413338
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 
you can also use and to select the file tab to the left or right of the current one
it is possible to re-arrange the file tabs by using the mouse to drag-sort them click and hold the mouse button on a tab and then drag it to the new location
this should make it possible to arrange them so that keyboard switching is more natural
414934
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
because innodb provides row-locking rather than table-locking your select s can be concurrent not just with each other but also with many insert s
however unless you are intending to use sql transactions set the innodb commit flush to 2 innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit
this gives you back a lot of raw performance that you would otherwise lose when moving tables from myisam to innodb
415091
multiplying	addition	multiplying	add
Pattern(s): 
in addition programmable calculator can store short sequences of keystrokes as a program which later can be replayed with a single keypress
say you set this sequence as a program one instruction per line now you have a custom operation pressing the program key or which one you ve assigned to it will run the sequence without your further assistance and will multiplying the content of the display with 2 and will add 1 - this is a program
later you can try more enhanced techniques storing temporary results to memory branch on result
415444
bash	zsh
Pattern(s): 
bash complicates this in that .bashrc is only read by a shell that s both interactive and non-login so you ll find most people end up telling their .bash_profile to also read .bashrc with something like other shells behave differently - eg with zsh .zshrc is always read for an interactive shell whether it s a login one or not
the manual page for bash explains the circumstances under which each file is read
yes behaviour is generally consistent between machines
415748
bash	subshell
Pattern(s): 
in your specific case you could use something like then pipe the output of go.bash into mysql and voila hopefully you won t destroy your database -
it can be done in bash itself if you have control of the configuration file format
you just need to source . the configuration file rather than subshell it
416340
keydown	keyup	keydown	keyup
Pattern(s): 
by the time keyup or keypress is triggered the default for keydown has already happened
i have found that in order to prevent the default action for an enter or tab key event you have to listen for the keydown event and handle cancel it
by the time keyup or keypress is triggered the default for keydown has already happened
416917
boost	allocator
Pattern(s): 
in the situation of a limited memory device i would avoid any kind of container more complex than a statically allocated array
replacing your containers with boost containers is not a good idea
the work to make appropriate custom allocator wouldn t be that bad but you d be violating the spirit of your allocate at startup rule
419198
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
this is no different from freeing p in this case would be an error because p points to n which is a variable on the stack
therefore p holds a memory location in the stack and cannot be free
in this case the free is correct because p points to a memory location on the heap which was allocated by malloc
419600
tiff	png
Pattern(s): 
tiff remains widely accepted as a photograph file standard in the printing business
the tiff can handle device-specific colour spaces such as the cmyk defined by a particular set of printing press inks
png the png portable network graphics file format was created as the free open-source successor to the gif
419602
gif	png	gif	bmp
Pattern(s): 
as there is no loss of information in lossless compression it is not able to achieve as high a compression as lossy compression in most cases
examples of lossless image compression is png and gif
gif only allows 8-bit images. tiff and bmp are both wrapper formats as the data inside can depend upon the compression technique that is used
419619
allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
i assume that c is being used over c++ for performance reasons and hence stl is not an option
edit as per request from filip s comment a simple strcat implementation based on a fixed size char buffer using dynamic allocator in this case you have to free your buffer manually when you are finished with it
handled by destructors in c++ equivalents addendum pax okay since you didn t actually explain why you had to create here it is
422343
int	double
Pattern(s): 
since floats and double already implement these values you might as well use them instead of trying to find the largest smallest values on your platform
with int it s more difficult to use infinity since it s not supported by hardware

422511
kerberos	ntlm
Pattern(s): 
i don t know which browsers support this off hand but my assumption would be that most do
from my experience kerberos is more of a prefered method but i have not worked with it much so unfortunately i don t have much advise as far as that goes
on a side note i recall reading somewhere that the jre also has ways of tying into ntlm on your web server in order to obtain identity information for the authenticated user
423100
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
using protected will of course allow subclasses to see the methods
btw i think that the reason interface methods are inferred to be public is because it is very much the exception to have an interface which is only implemented by classes in the same package
they are very much most often invoked by something in another package which means they need to be public
424750
post	get
Pattern(s): 
applied to the quick brown fox example renumbering the users to 1-3 i get this user 3 owns 75 45 60 of the final post user 1 owns 25 15 60 of the final post note that user 2 which only added the sometimes part which was subsequently removed is removed from the list
the id s for the post are as such things the algorithm will cope with if i copy something when making my new post the algorithm will properly attribute the copied elements even if i now copy parts of which i also added
example this is the first post which is cool 1111111111111111111111111111111111111 this is the second post which is the second post. 11111111111122222211111111111111112222222222111111 -- copied ------ the only problem with this algorith and this post in its entirety is that i m not entirely sure it produces what i would call an intuitively fair result
424936
bitwise-and	modulo
Pattern(s): 
however in my experience calling the modulo costs more than the benefit one gets so i use bit tricks involving 255 2 8-1 to compute the residue
for better or worse i am not using the trick of reading individual bytes out of a word only bitwise-and and shifts. to actually check if the residue is a square i look up the answer in a precomputed table. finally try to compute the square root using a method similar to hensel s lemma
i don t think it s applicable directly but it works with some modifications. before doing that i divide out all powers of 2 with a binary search at this point for our number to be a square it must be 1 mod 8. the basic structure of hensel s lemma is the following
425061
x86	64bit	x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
as has been stated the 64bit jit compiler behaves differently to the x86 jit compiler
the x86 compiler will take advantage of some optimizations that the x64 one does not
for example in .net 3.5 the 32-bit jit will inline function calls with structs as arguments but the 64bit jit does not
425061
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
for example in .net 3.5 the 32-bit jit will inline function calls with structs as arguments but the 64bit jit does not
in production code i have seen x86 builds running as much as 20 faster than x64 builds with no other changes

425349
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
Pattern(s): 
it depends the general rule is to throw runtime for programming errors and checked for recoverable conditions
if the exception could be avoided by programming correctly such as nullpointerexception or indexoutofbounds use runtime if the exception is due to some external resource out of control of the programmer the network is down for instance and there is something that could be done display a message of retry in 5 mins or something then a checked exception should be used
if the exception is out of control of the programmer but nothing can be done you could use a runtimeexception
425467
setinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval
Pattern(s): 
an example would be warning i ve not tested this at all
probably the best way to handle this is to use setinterval instead of settimeout
like settimeout setinterval returns an integer which can be passed to clearinterval to cancel the processing
426058
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
it will allow you to check out code from your subversion repositories develop independently with local history and check your code back in to subversion as and when you need to
take a look at bazaar
it s rather less daunting than git and has a useful-looking interface to subversion repositories via bzr-svn
426861
jsf	seam
Pattern(s): 
spring mvc seam struts are not suitable here
jsf is a good choice but it has quite a learning curve
i don t find it too difficult though but folks usually complain this alot and i have seen developers doesn t really understand the philosophy soon enough
430476
base	fractions
Pattern(s): 
on average then a brute force attack will find a successful password in about n k 2 or n k-1 trials
for convenience and because of some information-theoretic considerations i m not going to go into we usually express that as a number of bits which is lg n k where lg denotes the logarithm base 2
because we re used to thinking of bits as discrete things we actually usually take the ceiling of that number ie the least integer greater than lg n k but in fact the fractions value is perfectly legitimate
430553
unsigned	short	unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 
done away with short when did you last use 16-bit signed arithmetic
reading between the lines i think the logic was something like this generally the java designers wanted to simplify the repertoire of data types available for everyday purposes they felt that the most common need was for signed data types for implementing certain algorithms unsigned arithmetic is sometimes needed but the kind of programmers that would be implementing such algorithms would also have the knowledge to work round doing unsigned arithmetic with signed data types mostly i d say it was a reasonable decision
done away with short when did you last use 16-bit signed arithmetic
432844
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
another way to do it is bool a bool b the xor operator on two boolean is logical xor unlike on ints where it s bitwise
which makes sense since bool is just a subclass of int but is implemented to only have the values 0 and 1
and logical xor is equivalent to bitwise xor when the domain is restricted to 0 and 1
433829
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
i know nothing about the modules however
in regards to the custom skin there s a blog post from nina meiers that goes into a bit of detail on how to get a legacy skin to work in dnn 5
in the end i don t think she got it to work and it doesn t look like it d be a trivial task however so i d be prepared to put in some hours to learn how it works under the covers
433980
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
this explicitly forbids treating your class as a base instance from the outside
seen from the outside your class derived is not a subclass of base only from inside the class itself
the same counts for protected inherited with the only difference that the base class now isn t private to the own class any more but rather to any derived class as well

435831
vb.net	vb6
Pattern(s): 
if costs are a constraint you could try this there is a wizard in visual studio that will attempt to upgrade vb6 to vb.net
it s not 100 accurate and you will have to write code for things vb.net does not support such as control arrays etc
once the code is in vb.net you can use a tool like sharpdevelop to convert the vb.net to c#
436417
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
normal or break-word. this is currently supported in ie safari and firefox 3.1 alpha
with older and current versions of firefox there is no standard way google was my friend of doing it
some suggest using a small script that adds in the middle of the word
436754
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if instance variables could be overridden in subclassing like you re trying to do here it would cause many more problems than it would fix
accessor methods themselves getdee are inherited but instance variables are not
if instance variables could be overridden in subclassing like you re trying to do here it would cause many more problems than it would fix
437296
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
Pattern(s): 
one of factors you might want to consider is the support for inetracting with svn
git has git-svn bazaar has bzr-svn and mercurial has hgsubversion extension
disclaimer i am git user and small time contributor and watch and participate on git mailing list
439146
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
if you need some automatic post-check-out processing on the working copy you ll not have much other alternatives then writing a script and remind the clients to execute them
i ve never really been a cvs user so i do not know what common use-cases the solved wanted to... by using check-out hooks actually i haven t known them
svn provides pre-commit and post-commit hooks among some others which should be able to do whatever one wants to be done per-change on the source

inherited	properties	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
the style collection properties itself is read-only you can t replace it but you can an element to it to reflect setting that style properties
table.style.add display none or the same is true for table rows as the style collection is inherited from htmlgenericcontrol
edit the html control needs to be runat server for this to work which i m assuming yours is since you are able to set the visible properties

wordpress	phpbb	wordpress	vbulletin	wordpress	joomla	joomla	phpbb	joomla	vbulletin
Pattern(s): 
phpbb3 and vbulletin are good choices for php phpbb is open source but vbulletin is a private product unfortunately
some say wordpress is a good thing to look at i disagree but i expect joomla wouldn t be a bad place to look either
build a cacheable feed reader slightly more advanced - build a system that reads feeds stores their contents and returns the data
444692
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
2 things
put the try-catch blocks where they make sense
if you re interested in exception-handling from mycall as well as i s value then use throw objects of different classes for different errors
446068
width	margin
Pattern(s): 
the easiest thing would be to add a css-style property float right
to your 200px div however this would also cause your main -div to actually be full width and any text in there would float around the edge of the 200px-div which often looks weird depending on the content pretty much in all cases except if it s a floating image
edit as suggested by dom the wrapping problem could of course be solved with a margin
448079
free	malloc	free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
when free ing the piece first goes into a free-list for quick reuse by another malloc if the size fits
it may at this time be merged with another free item to form bigger free blocks to avoid fragmentation a whole bunch of different algorithms exist there from freelists to binary-sized-fragments to hashing and what not else
when freed pieces arrive so that multiple fragments can be joined free usually does this but sometimes fragments remain depending on size and orderof malloc and free
448079
free	malloc	free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
when freed pieces arrive so that multiple fragments can be joined free usually does this but sometimes fragments remain depending on size and orderof malloc and free
also only when a big such free block has been created will it be sometimes returned to the os as a block
but usually malloc keeps things in its pocket dependig on the allocated free ratio many heuristics and sometimes compile or flag options are often available
449918
webclient	webrequest
Pattern(s): 
update webclient is simpler to use than webrequest
normally you could stick to using just webclient unless you need to manipulate requests responses in an advanced way
see this article where both are used
450010
capitalization	toupper
Pattern(s): 
toupper in .net is a linguistic operation
in some languages capitalization rules are not straight forward
turkish i is famous for this
451156
ienumerable	ienumerator
Pattern(s): 
one of the limitations of ienumerator is that it holds its current state and it doesn t remember its prior state
as a result ienumerable is forward-only
if you need to hold onto prior states read the ienumerable into a list or linkedlist and enumerate through those objects instead
451612
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
the type chars without signed or unsinged is implementation-defined which means that it can act like a signed or unsigned type
signed int overflow leads to undefined behavior where a program can do anything including dumping core or overrunning a buffer

453149
matlab	simulink
Pattern(s): 
i m not sure what simulink is exactly
matlab is an interpreted programming language and graphics environment suitable for solving mathematical and engineering problems
it contains highly optimised matrix and other mathematical functions so it s not as slow as you might think if used properly
453149
matlab	simulink
Pattern(s): 
it contains highly optimised matrix and other mathematical functions so it s not as slow as you might think if used properly
i believe that there is a compiler that can compile a matlab program into an equivalent c program which can then be compiled to an executable
i m not sure what simulink is exactly
453751
kerberos	ntlm
Pattern(s): 
mike
there are 3 authentication protocols that can be used to perform authentication between java and active directory on linux or any other platform and these are not just specific to http services kerberos - kerberos provides single sign-on sso and delegation but web servers also need spnego support to accept sso through ie
ntlm - ntlm supports sso through ie and other browsers if they are properly configured
453751
kerberos	ntlm
Pattern(s): 
but i haven t tried it
the sun implementation of kerberos has been a comedy of errors over the years so based on sun s track record in this area i wouldn t make any promises about their spengo implementation until you have that bird in hand
for ntlm there is a free oss project called jcifs that has an ntlm http authentication servlet filter
453792
integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 
a javascript array by itself has numeric indices
if you store something with an index that can be interpreted as a nonnegative integer it will try to do so
if you store something with an index that is not a nonnegative integer it s alphanumeric negative or a floating-point number with a fractions piece it will fail on the array-index store and default to the object which is array s base class store which then converts the argument to a string and stores by string index -- but these stored properties are not seen by the array class and therefore are not visible to its methods properties length join slice splice push pop etc
456819
cpu	affinity
Pattern(s): 
if you want to this as a cpu load simulation you might want to take a few addtional steps on a multicore system be sure to either spawn the loop like this in multiple threads one for each cpu or execute the process multiple times and to make the scheduling predictable assign thread process affinity explicitly sometimes you may also want to increase the thread process priority to simulate the environment where cpu is heavily loaded with high priority applications
your loop mostly sleeps which means it has very light cpu load
besides of sleep be sure to include some loop performing any computations like this factorial implementation is left as an exercise to reader you may replace it with any other non-trivial function
456819
cpu	affinity
Pattern(s): 
besides of sleep be sure to include some loop performing any computations like this factorial implementation is left as an exercise to reader you may replace it with any other non-trivial function
by adjusting sleepbalance computebalance you may adjust how much cpu this program takes
if you want to this as a cpu load simulation you might want to take a few addtional steps on a multicore system be sure to either spawn the loop like this in multiple threads one for each cpu or execute the process multiple times and to make the scheduling predictable assign thread process affinity explicitly sometimes you may also want to increase the thread process priority to simulate the environment where cpu is heavily loaded with high priority applications
459061
perforce	cvs
Pattern(s): 
perforce has a nice document describing the process working disconnected from the perforce server one thing the document doesn t mention is the allwrite clientspec attribute which marks all files in your working directory as writable instead of only the files you have checked out
one option is to use perforce as if you were disconnected from the server and reconcile your changes later rather than telling perforce everything you do before you do it
this is roughly equivalent to the workflow in cvs or subversion. you would synchronize your working copy go off and develop and then ask perforce to figure out what you did while it wasn t watching
459061
perforce	cvs
Pattern(s): 
this is roughly equivalent to the workflow in cvs or subversion. you would synchronize your working copy go off and develop and then ask perforce to figure out what you did while it wasn t watching
perforce has a nice document describing the process working disconnected from the perforce server one thing the document doesn t mention is the allwrite clientspec attribute which marks all files in your working directory as writable instead of only the files you have checked out

459723
hide	show
Pattern(s): 
iirc you need to have a unique key or id for each node element and then use treeview.select for the node returned from treeview.findnode
-- or -- hide the treeview userform instead of closing it me.hide
when the second userform is closed or ok cancel pressed then show the treeview userform again treeviewform.show
460176
integer	radix	integer	radix
Pattern(s): 
the second paramter radix makes sure it is parsed as a decimal number
parseint will force it to be type integer or will be nan not a number if it cannot perform the conversion
the second paramter radix makes sure it is parsed as a decimal number
461754
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
i use svn with the tortoisesvn shell add-on and i m quite happy with it
cvs is alright too but gets very slow as projects get large

463340
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
Pattern(s): 
in this case you should throw an argumentnullexception
throwing a nullreferenceexception here is a bad idea for a few reasons a null reference did not actually occur so seeing one is counterintuitive throwing a nullreferenceexception and causing a nullreferenceexception to occur produce discernably different exceptions one way to see the difference is the error code
this is true of many exceptions that are thrown by the clr
463633
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
now perhaps in 2009 a 800gb database is the same for all intents and purposes as a 810gb if you converted the varchars to chars but for short strings 1 or 2 chars chars is still a industry best practice i would say
now if you look at the wide variety of data types most databases provide even for int alone bit tiny int bigint there are reasons to choose one over the other
simply choosing bigint every time is actually being a bit ignorant of the purposes and uses of the field
463769
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 
however doing so on a singleton is not a reliable way to capture process or appdomain tear-down
at the risk of offering subjective design advice if the object is truly stateless make it a static class
if it is stateful question why it is a singleton you re creating a mutable global variable
463954
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall
firefox lets you use different profiles
each profile can have separate preferences themes and plugins
464096
kerberos	ntlm
Pattern(s): 
as i eluded to earlier ntlm is only one of several windows security support providers ssp
there s also a digest ssp kerberos ssp etc
but the negotiate ssp which is also known as spnego is usually the provider that ms uses in their own protocol clients
464432
bazaar	perforce	bazaar	cvs
Pattern(s): 
then if there is ever a need to add them to an official work repository then that is nice and easy
bazaar is a good option
its simpler to install than subversion perforce or cvs and no server component is required
466217
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
but if you only want to vary the value of the data then just vary the data
other things being equal i prefer the simpler solution a single concrete class which takes a string as a constructor parameter to the more complicated one using a base class and a subclass
inherited is appropriate when you want to vary behaviour if the browser watcher will do something that the ordinary process watcher doesn t
466397
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
i prefer a tag all approach however this is my personal choice
you should leave cvs
cvs is old and not very fast in terms of branching tagging branch tag creation depends linearly on number of files in a project you should think of your branching strategy first do you want to have a stable trunk feature branches developer branches unstable trunk release branches platform branches this heavily depends on your project and development philosophy if you want to use svn you really have to think of your repository layout because nearly all softwareprojects are module-based and you should find a structure in which you can easily tag all needed modules
466926
ada	vhdl	ada	vhdl
Pattern(s): 
it s also a basis for vhdl
ada is still popular in colossal legacy government-targeted programs
it s also a basis for vhdl
470060
int	chars	int	double	int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
so you can convert it to a number but not necessarily an int
according to the vb6 documentation isnumeric returns true if the data type of expression is boolean byte decimal double int long sbyte short single uinteger ulong or ushort or an object that contains one of those numeric types
it also returns true if expression is a chars or string that can be successfully converted to a number. many of those cannot be converted to an int
472197
int	chars	int	double
Pattern(s): 
i count twelve of them
i would add as well as a common trick in these sort of questions it in the assumption you make that i is an int
other common assumptions might be s is a string x y are a double ch is a chars b is a byte etc. if you see a question like this you can bet that i is not its expect type
474081
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
they should only be used to extends class functionality
if you have access to the base class code and the functionality you re trying to implements is logically part of the inheritance heirarchy then you should put it in the abstract class
my point is just because you can doesn t mean you should
474567
int	double
Pattern(s): 
in fact if you want to handle equality correctly don t rely on double to work properly. if b d is positive a b c d if ad bc
if there are negative int involved that can be handled appropriately.
i might rewrite as the use of long here is to ensure there s not an overflow if you multiply two large int s
475394
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
Pattern(s): 
obfuscation is not a reliable protection against this
you can add prohibition against reverse-engineering to your end-user license agreement for your software
most proprietary companies do this
475953
jython	pypy	cpython	ironpython	cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 
ironpython is quickly becoming one of the best in this respect though and there is a lot of traffic on planet python about it
the main thing that will encourage developers to write code that s different from what they would write in cpython is the lack of c extension modules like numpy this is a problem in jython and pypy as well
an interesting project to keep your eye on is ironclad which will let you call c extension modules from within ironpython
476079
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
eric lippert recently blogged on this subject in a couple of posts - automatic-vs-explicit-properties future-proofing-a-design
aside from the point made by others whether to use an accessor or a field directly may need to be informed by semantics
some times the semantics of an external consumer accessing a properties is different from the mechanical necessity of accessing its value by internal code
476332
post	get
Pattern(s): 
the best way to get a beep sound is to pinvoke into the messagebeep function
the pinvoke signature for this method is pretty straight forward this blog post has an excellent more thorough example on archive.org

476633
metaclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
the fact that the target class is a meta class or an abstract superclass or a concrete class doesn t matter
metaclass make classes
they might make other metaclass which is weird but they re still just metaclass making classes
477345
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
all applications need to be treated accordingly on how they were build
most of the time wizards make a good job but you need to execute a walkthrough code review in order to refactor and take advantage of the new framework versioning
wishing my customers also approve the framework upgrade to the applications
477769
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
in this sense the c int arithmetic is a placeholder which is not defined exactly by the programming language specification but is only completely instantiated by determining the target machine
java precisely defines how int are represented and how int arithmetic is to be computed
java int -------------------------- signed | unsigned -------------------------- long 64-bit | int 32-bit | short 16-bit | chars 16-bit byte 8-bit | chars is the only unsigned int type
478244
integer	unsigned	integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
also adding unsigned does not affect the size of the column just how the number is represented
according to section 10.2 of the mysql 5.1 manual in non-strict mode when an out-of-range value is assigned to an integer column mysql stores the value representing the corresponding endpoint of the column data type range
if you store 256 into a tinyint or tinyint unsigned column mysql stores 127 or 255 respectively
480496
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
double dispatch is the same thing extended to work with two objects - usually the this parameter and a second parameter
you can implements this without too much difficulty using the vistor pattern
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard
480496
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard
some languages implements this ability right out of the box
in .net the tostring function is an example of single dispatch
481432
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 
swing inherits this
i believe swt does as well
be aware that you must manually dispose of the window if you override this event
482107
facade	mediator	facade	mediator
Pattern(s): 
mediator can be a two-way conversation with messages flowing back and forth between the client and mediator
i thought the distinction was directional facade is a one-way communication between client and facade
mediator can be a two-way conversation with messages flowing back and forth between the client and mediator
484745
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql is easy to set up fast for oltp and generally takes the approach of doing few things and doing them well
postgresql is kind of the opposite -- it s a database researcher s favorite playground which means it has a dozen different join strategies storage engines advanced optional packages and all kinds of stuff
it s slower than mysql when doing things mysql does well and blows it out of the water when doing things mysql just doesn t know how to do see above with hash joins
484840
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception	runtimeexception	classnotfoundexception
Pattern(s): 
only do this when you are positive that your clients cannot recover from the problem that you are rethrowing as an unchecked-exception
note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available
for example if the only reason your method could throw a classnotfoundexception is because a configuration file is missing you could rethrow a missingresourceexception which is an unchecked-exception but gives more information about why you are throwing it
484840
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception	illegalstateexception	classnotfoundexception	runtimeexception	unchecked-exception	runtimeexception	classnotfoundexception
Pattern(s): 
for example if the only reason your method could throw a classnotfoundexception is because a configuration file is missing you could rethrow a missingresourceexception which is an unchecked-exception but gives more information about why you are throwing it
other good runtimeexception s to use if they describe the problem you are rethrowing are illegalstateexception typenotpresentexception and unsupportedoperationexception
also note that it is always a good idea for your threads to catch runtimeexception and at a minimum log it
485994
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
you need to edit the file server servername conf jboss-service.xml and add rigth after then create a directory named server servername lib ext and drop your external jars in there
putting external libraries in the lib folder is a bad practice
you need to edit the file server servername conf jboss-service.xml and add rigth after then create a directory named server servername lib ext and drop your external jars in there
486440
toolbar	tabs	toolbar	tabs
Pattern(s): 
you anticipate there re typically be a large set of tabs 4 or more and you can control their display in a manner more effectively for the task than the os can if they were sdi windows on the taskbar dock with regard to order and labeling
with sdi you re having problems with users confusing the toolbar or palettes of inactive windows with active windows
tabs are fixed in number and permanently open when each tab is a different component of the same data object
486641
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
for a small table you ll probably have most of your data in the backing store
for a large table i guarantee that data will be flushed to disk periodically as the database engine needs more working space for other requests
edit if you re absolutely in need of ram-only temporary tables you can create a table space for your database on a ram disk dev shm works
488104
move	drag
Pattern(s): 
if on the other hand dragging one of the items elsewhere causes them both to move it s easy to drag the item s back to where they came from
yes but just as with the files move them first and make sure the subdirectories you d like to keep are unaffected before deleting them

488298
icomparable	compareto
Pattern(s): 
a b or call the compareto or equals method explicitly
your type needs to implement the icomparable or iequatable interface
probably you then need to rewrite a
488893
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
ideally you should use sha256
this hash method is available in php using the hash function
you should also apply a random salt to the password
488978
mockito	jmock	mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito	easymock	jmock
Pattern(s): 
- powermockito extends both easymock and mockito with the ability to mock static methods final and even private methods
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work
we are planning to add jmock support as well
490311
internationalization	translation
Pattern(s): 
sometimes this is the right choice depending on how extensively the ui will be used. internationalization is really not that difficult except for finding a firm to do good translation of your text
the programmer portion of internationalization is pretty straightforward
however i ve known a number of programmers who prefer the all-icon method as it s less work
493024
windows	wow64
Pattern(s): 
the seemingly counter-intuitive name of syswow64 for the directory where the files reside is makes more sense when you consider that wow64 means windows on windows 64-bit which is what the emulater that s mentioned above is called
raymond chen recently addressed the basic reason behind why 32-bit system directories are weird on 64-bit windows
the first paragraph of the entry is really the key to understanding the reason behind segregated 32-bit directories on 64-bit windows 32-bit programs run in an emulation layer...if a 32-bit program tries to look at the system it will see a 32-bit system
493533
gentoo	linux	gnu	uclibc	libc	binutils	libc	binutils	toolchain	binutils	toolchain	binutils
Pattern(s): 
if all you want is a compiler and linker for the kernel the libc part is irrelevant and you can use -s1 --stage1 to inform crossdev that you only need binutils and gcc
if you re using gentoo getting a cross-compiling toolchain is as easy as emerge crossdev crossdev -t arch- vendor- os- libc where arch is arm or armeb vendor is unknown or softfloat os is linux and libc is gnu or uclibc
if all you want is a compiler and linker for the kernel the libc part is irrelevant and you can use -s1 --stage1 to inform crossdev that you only need binutils and gcc
493701
cunit	cppunit
Pattern(s): 
for c++ projects i use cppunit which works quite well
i had this question once and discovered cunit
i only used it for a small project but it seemed alright
494207
reparsepoint	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
this is all available through p invoke of course
but most folks just 1 look for reparsepoint on the list of attributes returned by directoryinfo.getdirectories
1 note that a ntfs junction is a particular type of reparse point but not the only one
495136
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
the subclassing actually hides the variable var
when you cast to automobile you re getting the superclass version of the var variable
however the tostring method is still looking at the instance s version of the var variable
496486
stringbuilder	stringwriter
Pattern(s): 
use the stringwriter class if you want a stream that wraps a stringbuilder
stringbuilder has more than just append functions
it also has insert functions which is unnatural for a stream
497332
haskell	sml
Pattern(s): 
of course it is also an advantage if you want to use existing jvm libraries
haskell is extreme lazy pure has active users lots of documentation and makes runnable applications
sml is less extreme strict impure has active users formal specification many implementations sml nj mlton moscow ml etc.
497849
quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place
Pattern(s): 
as can be seen on wikipedia one can implement quicksort in different ways
i could imagine that by directly accessing the memory using c for example one can improve the performance of quicksort more than it is possible with mergesort
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort
497933
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
mergesort is still a pretty good solution for large data sets or other data structures like linked lists as your experiments confirm
one of the advantages of quicksort for relatively small array sizes is just an artifact of hardware implementation
on arrays quicksort can be done in-place meaning that you re reading from and writing to the same area of memory
497933
mergesort	in-place
Pattern(s): 
on arrays quicksort can be done in-place meaning that you re reading from and writing to the same area of memory
mergesort on the other hand typically requires allocating new buffers meaning your memory access is more spread out
you can see both of these behaviors in your example implementations
497933
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
you can see both of these behaviors in your example implementations
as a result for relatively small datasets quicksort is more likely to get cache hits and therefore just tends to run faster on most hardware
mergesort is still a pretty good solution for large data sets or other data structures like linked lists as your experiments confirm
499390
decimal	ieee
Pattern(s): 
they use the same ieee binary representation so there is no possible data loss when translating to and from the database format
the max precision of the .net decimal is 28 so there is no use defining an oracle number with a higher precision

499950
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
the verb get doesn t make sense in that context
you probably want a session resource btw this is how restful_auth works . so you would say create me a session for this user or something like post sessions where the body of the post is the username password for the user. this also has the good side effect of not saving the password in the history or letting someone capture it on the http proxy
so your controller code would look something like this you would set up your routes like this that will get you urls like
501311
vpn	lan
Pattern(s): 
it s slightly less reliable because as well as your having downtime when if ever the office lan is down there s now additional risk of downtime while either of the internet connections is down
i ve used it to work from home remote login to my in-office pc via vpn
the performance depends on your isps of course
503970
banking	payment
Pattern(s): 
the system is supposed to wait for the successful authorisation of a charge and it s post authorisation process to consider the charge a success
the exact reason for this is due to the unusual nature of our product and the stages of a given banking transaction
for online payment in the uk a charge is not able to be post authorised until the goods have shipped
504058
sdl	xlib
Pattern(s): 
sdl is not a hardware interface in its own right but rather a portability layer that works well on top of many other display layers including directx opengl directfb and xlib so you get very good portability and its a very thin layer on top of those technologies so you pay very little performance overhead on top of those
if you re trying to dump pixels to screen you ll probably want to make use of sdl s surface facuility
for the greatest performance try to arrange for the input data to be in a similar layout to the output surface
504668
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri
Pattern(s): 
i would be very surprised if rails doesn t catch up in the next few years
also rubinius jruby are doing things the right way and are moving along at a great pace
i wouldn t be suprised if mri gets dropped in the next few years in favor of one of those implementations for mainstream rails work
504950
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
i d suggest having a baseline script and upgrade scripts so that you can always run a sequence of scripts to get a database from it s current versioning to the new state that is needed
this does still require some process and discipline from the developers though all changes need to be rolled into a new versioning of the base install script and a patch script

504981
post	get
Pattern(s): 
get and post are part of http protocol. as mark noted post is more secure
post forms are also not cached by the browser. post is also used to transfer large quantities of data

505077
perl	tcl	vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
the only ones that don t tend to be very lightweight ones like pico
vim has a native scripting language and can also be built with embedded python tcl or perl interepreters that can operate on selections buffers etc through the plugin mechanism
emacs is all about scripting - it s has a lisp interpreter built right into the core of the system and most of the editor is written in lisp
505077
vim	emacs	vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
i used to use xemacs a major code-fork of emacs that goes back a number of years back in the 1990s but went to vim later on
i even use vim on windows
if you find the user interface of vim or emacs a bit too much there are a variety of other text editors available many of which offer scripting
505189
post	get
Pattern(s): 
some clients firewalls ids systems may frown upon get requests containing an excessive amount of data and may therefore provide unrelable results
post supports advanced functionality such as support for multi-part binary input used for file uploads to web servers
post requires a content-length header which may increase the complexity of an application specific client implementation as the size of data submitted must be known in advance preventing a client request from being formed in an exclusivly single-pass incremental mode
506896
websphere	ibm
Pattern(s): 
googling ibm s infocenter publib.boulder.ibm.com may help
websphere comes with out-of-box support of proapgation of authentication using ltpa tokens in web apps these are usually stored in cookies named ltpatoken and ltpatoken2
in general for this to work both the websphere and your php app have to share the same ltpa keys based on which the ltpa tokens are generated
508393
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
also don t put sensitive information in the query string only option with get because it shows up in the address bar bookmarks and server logs
hopefully this explains why people say post is secure
if you are transmitting sensitive data you must use ssl
511153
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
but in no case can you override a method and expect it to magically sometimes not be overridden
and let me explain why i want this say i have a class which has method test and it s can be overriden by sub classes some cases i want the overriden test and in some cases test of superclass itself there are many ways to do this it will be helpful if anyone can be best solution
if your subclassing overrides test then it overrides test - this is the whole point of object inheritance

int	double
Pattern(s): 
if you store such a large number in an integer you will get an overflow
int only have 32 bits
returning the integer as a double is the right thing to do here because it offers a much wider usefull number-range than a integer could
512358
fancybox	thickbox
Pattern(s): 
instead of the page refresh or final ajax call in each scenario you could simply use javascript jquery to update the list list details depending on whether a user has been added or edited respectively
fancybox is also another option
works similarly to thickbox edit it appears after some playing around that the plugin does not natively support closing the fancybox through an child iframe element
512358
fancybox	thickbox
Pattern(s): 
works similarly to thickbox edit it appears after some playing around that the plugin does not natively support closing the fancybox through an child iframe element
i think that this is certainly achievable with a little effort i started hacking together something here although i stress that this was simply a poc and does not work as the button within the iframe removes the fancybox div wrapper from the dom and therefore does not display when you click the google image again .i am wondering however if an iframe is the right lines to go down
for adding a user my thought would be that you could present the user with a modal form like the one on the monster site you get when you click sign in. once you click add user make an ajax call to your datasource to insert a new user and then on returning success you could either initiate a page refresh or use ajax to update the list
512677
prng	random
Pattern(s): 
the math.random method in javascript is a prng but you can t set the seed like you can in other languages
a prng is reasonably simple to create - lots of code on the internet
given a fixed start seed it will always generate the same sequence of random numbers which is what you re asking for
512790
trie	tree
Pattern(s): 
they are used to find matches between infixes using the fact that any infix is a prefix of a suffix and if you want to find a match between several strings concatenate them to one another and not just between prefixes
use either a trie or a radix-tree to store the standard prefixes
a suffix tree array is an unnecessary over-kill
513367
jpql	hql
Pattern(s): 
i did not find a real hibernate will translate this to that reference documentation but the expression in general can be found in hql expressions for hibernate 4.3
then there is the java persistence api 2.0 jpa specification which defines expressions for the java persistence query language jpql and their meaning for current_date 4.6.17.2.3 datetime functions functions_returning_datetime current_date | current_time | current_timestamp the datetime functions return the value of current date time and timestamp on the database server

513902
bam	b2b	bam	b2b
Pattern(s): 
these features make biztalk more suitable for b2b scenarios
other features that biztalk has but wf doesn t or has to be implemented by developer tracking natively integrated wtih the business activity monitoring bam transaction supports both atomic transaction and long-running transaction extensive set of tools for admin management migration and scaling however all this changes with dublin
having read your requirements once again i think that your application doesn t fall into either the b2b or eai categories so biztalk is probably an overkill
514639
opencv	emgucv	opencv	emgucv
Pattern(s): 
i had this problem a when i tried to get emgucv running
you don t have the right version of opencv installed or you don t have the opencv dll s installed at all
the latest version of emgucv uses cxcore110.dll previous version use cxcore100.dll
515333
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
but you already have a reference to b if b is what you pass to your function so you don t need to cast from i to b unless were talking about a different object then no don t do it going from i to b is the same as going from a to b you re trying to cast up the inherited chain which really is something you shouldn t do
needing to do this is a code smell it tells you that you should try and solve this problem in a different way possibly by redesigning you classes adding more properties methods to i or just deciding that the function will only work with the sub class - working with the subclass b will give you access to all the methods of a i
edit 2 procedure sendinterfaceobject iobj imyinterface
515603
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
it s designed from the ground up to handle the case of putting a database under versioning control without tying you to a particular programming language or vcs
at work we use a modified versioning of dbix migration it has some limitations such as no more than 10 migrations
then you have a core schema that you ve dumped from your database and when the versioning number is too low you upgrade your database using the migrations from the migration schema directory
515901
terminate	timeout	terminate	timeout
Pattern(s): 
i would presume that the last number is the timeout period
this is done so that it doesn t sit waiting forever but rather checks periodically if the thread has been terminate using the while loop condition
so the timeout is a normal situation for this sort of code and can be ignored
515981
outputstream	inputstream
Pattern(s): 
for inputstream this is fine
for outputstream you could lose an buffered data so you should at least flush the stream before exiting the program

516169
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
99.99 of the time you don t need to continue to use the iterator once loops completes so such a style can lead to bugs like this
the purpose of declaring the iterator within the for-loop is to minimize the scope of your variables which is a good practice
when you declare the iterator outside of loops then the reference is still valid alive after loops completes
518469
qtablewidget	qabstractitemview
Pattern(s): 
for example table.setedittriggers qabstractitemview noedittriggers
qtablewidget inherits 19 public slots from qwidget
one of those is setdisabled which should disable input events for that widget and all of its children
518902
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
the only reason to use vim is that you have already learned vim and you can t stand the keybinding and editing model differences between vim and viper
no viper is not a vim clone
it s emacs with modal editing. anyway jmho
519128
processors	hyperthreading
Pattern(s): 
a processors with hyperthreading enabled is treated by the operating system as two processors instead of one
this means that only one processors is physically present but the operating system sees two virtual processors and shares the workload between them
from wikipedia on piplining in computing a pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected in series so that the output of one element is the input of the next one
519191
emacs	jedit
Pattern(s): 
several months after the above answer i was doing a lot of remote logins into linux and nano got too constricting
and yes i ve spent time writing macros and plug-ins for emacs
jedit is still pretty good but emacs is quite better
520037
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
while the usage of regex in a programming environment language is question of maintainable code i find the knowledge of regex to be useful with some commands say egrep editors vim emacs etc.
using a regex to do a find and replace in vim is very handy when you have a text file and you want to do some formatting once in a while

521782
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
my conclusion like many other peoples check the net is that maven is a big step in the wrong direction
it definitely is not an improvement over ant
i have used ant for many years including writing a large open-source library of ant helper scripts
522942
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
but if you declare properties for the ivars they can still be accessed changed via kvc because there is still no such thing as a private method in objective-c
sometimes inherited just seems like more trouble than it is worth
it is correctly used when you want to add something to an existing class that is a change in the behaviour of that class
524069
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
multiple try-catch blocks in various layers may be ok if you can ensure consistency
for example you may put a try-catch in your data access layer to ensure you clean up connections properly
but as you can t do much more there you should probably rethrow the exception-handling
525369
webclient	httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 
once you have the httpwebrequest set up you can save the response stream to a file streamwriter either binarywriter or a textwriter depending on the mimetype. and you have a file on your hard drive
edit forgot about webclient
that works good unless as long as you only need to use get to retrieve your file
525745
des	aes
Pattern(s): 
you can read about block cipher modes of operation here block cipher modes of operation as for the cipher itself i d suggest you avoid using des if this is at all possible
des is extremely easy to crack nowadays
please use aes or at least 3des if aes is not available
525962
allegro	sdl
Pattern(s): 
if you need something simple you can try sdl which is a cross platform library to aimed to develop games simple applications
another alternative is allegro game library

526600
gdk	gtk#
Pattern(s): 
if it doesn t it s a bug in your gdk version
actually this might be a bug either in the c# bindings for gdk or your version of gdk
according to the documentation for gdk _threads _init g _thread _init has to be called first and the gtk# documentation says the same glib.thread.init has to be called before gdk.threads.init
526600
gdk	gtk#
Pattern(s): 
according to the documentation for gdk _threads _init g _thread _init has to be called first and the gtk# documentation says the same glib.thread.init has to be called before gdk.threads.init
on my linux machine with gdk 2.14.4 a c program that calls gdk _threads _init without having called g _thread _init prints an error message and terminates with an error
have you made sure that you have the same gdk version on both linux and windows and that the version on linux if it s different from the windows version also requires the call to g _thread _init or if it s something that has been changed between the two versions
526944
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
an index for up to a million rows fits in a 32-bit word so it can be used efficiently on 32-bit processors
function arguments that fit in a cpu register are extremely efficient while ones that are larger require accessing memory on each function call a far slower operation
updating a spreadsheet can be an intensive operation involving many cell references so speed is important
527794
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
think about what you want to do from an oo point of view
the superclass is providing common behaviour for all objects of that type animal
then the subclassing provides the specialisation of the behaviour dog
528363
super	implements
Pattern(s): 
conversely look at design patterns by the gang of four for ideas on how to combine objects to perform common tasks
before i learned about design patterns i was pretty much in the dark about how to use objects effectively other than as a super type structure
remember that implements interfaces is just as important if not more important than inheritance
528758
pop-up	dialog	pop-up	dialog
Pattern(s): 
you can then use jquery s ajax api to do your server dirty work jquery dialog ui -- bill konrad devtacular - web development tutorials
creating a pop-up has very little to do with ajax and a lot more to do with javascript
see the jquery dialog library here
529429
post	put
Pattern(s): 
hope this helps
ola you re wrong post is connected to create
put is normally connected to update
530155
printf	fgets	fgets	fread
Pattern(s): 
qsort is good except your compare function needs to compare byte by byte for entry_size bytes not just cast from void to int which is unsafe and probably incorrect
fgets and printf deal with strings which in c are char-arrays ending with the special character 0
use fread and fwrite for binary data
531083
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 
note that support should be a consideration in your decision
with swt there is a smaller community supporting it
with swing a larger community but this does not mean that fixes will get more quickly into a development release
532440
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
Pattern(s): 
i am not familiar with glassfish but you could do this in websphere or weblogic using a commonj workmanager
apparently the same can be accomplished in glassfish and jboss via a jca workmanager which i am not familiar with

532580
opera	safari	opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 
as a matter of fact firefox also supports the latter format if you use the following form in fact this is the preferred syntax and swfobject uses this as well
so for a cross-browser solution you d need to look for embed and object elements with type attribute set to application x-shockwave-flash object elements with classid attribute set to clsid d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000 im unsure about other browsers like opera or safari it is possible that you need to extend this list with further variants
finding these elements should be trivial with a javascript library like jquery or prototype but you can manage without those
534833
folder	directory	folder	dir
Pattern(s): 
d in .svn do if exist d rd s q d or for f usebackq d in dir .svn ad b s do rd s q d actually svn also gives you the option to export a working directory without the .svn _svn directory
afterthoughts three years later i think the reason people end up needing to recursively delete the .svn _svn folder is because they ve directly copied their local working copy to a new location in order to do a folder comparison of their modified version compared to a clean export after something goes awry with the modified local working copy
at least that s why i ve needed it
536038
bytearrayinputstream	objectinputstream
Pattern(s): 
oos.flush
bytearrayinputstream bais new bytearrayinputstream baos.tobytearray
objectinputstream ois new objectinputstream bais
536401
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
see the declared properties part of the objective-c tutorial
the self syntax uses the accessor method the other syntax does not
this might be a big difference if the accessor does something more than simply assign the new value
536620
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
use of sha-512 is going to prove to be more of a pain for someone generating a rainbow table than md5 for example
the strength of a hash function is not determined by its input
using a salt that is known to the attacker obviously makes constructing a rainbow table particularly for hard-coded usernames like root more attractive but it doesn t weaken the hash
537206
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
it really simplifies everything that has to do with changing the database and it works very well for simple situations
it consists of a base class that you can inherited from
you subclassing it easily it automatically figures out the indexes in the table and the primary key
537894
google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
Pattern(s): 
while gecko is primarily the rendering engine of a single browser which just happens to offer an api for embedding
try to opt for webkit as it is used by many different browsers konqueror safari and google-chrome
this makes webkit more versatile and more adaptable to other needs
538439
photoshop	paint.net	photoshop	paint.net
Pattern(s): 
paint.net is a nice graphics package not quite up to photoshop but impressive nonetheless written in c#
because you mentioned photoshop .
paint.net is a nice graphics package not quite up to photoshop but impressive nonetheless written in c#
538940
vmware	esx
Pattern(s): 
vmware workstation is only free for 30 days
vmware server is great i use it for compartamentalizing different projects which require different setups and would recommend it if you require different environment setups and your machine has enough resources
vmware esx is not free thus not for you
538940
vmware	esx
Pattern(s): 
vmware esx is not free thus not for you
vmware esxi is free but can t run on top of an os installation thus might not be for you
vmware player plays virtual machines.
540543
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation	nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
Pattern(s): 
if you don t want the overhead of subclassing take a look at the nsinvocationoperation class
this is a concrete subclass of nsoperation that makes it easy to attach an operation to an existing method
nsinvocationoperation objects can be added to an nsoperationqueue just like nsoperations so that you get multi-threading without having to subclass
541271
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
below is an example of how i bind a ddl with a collection of user objects and set the selected based on the related object unit of work below is what the overload will look like in your user object below will be needed in the base class for any entity domain objects dto etc this base class should also implement ilookupdto - because this will force you to make public a text and value properties that are used by the user object in this example the below is the def for lookupcollection used in the bind method at the top of this answer below is the interface for ilookuplist - used in the implementation of each ui specific control see the web and wpf examples below now in your code-behind you will need to do something like this in your read only properties for the view return new weblookuplist ddlusers here is an implementation for a web specific ddl here is the implementation for a wpf specific ddl if using wpf your read only properties for the view would look like - return new wpflookuplist ddlusers you only need 1 of these at a time but i thought showing both would help make clear what we are abstracting away because this was such a huge answer i could post a sample project for download showing this in action if requested - let me know
edit i got enough feedback about this topic that i felt it was worthy of a blog post one approach that i took when binding domain objects to ddl controls is to inherited from a base class that has an overload in the constr to allow for a text value only subset of the original
the code below is used in a model view presenter or model view viewmodel implementation that abstracts out the ddl control so you can push any ui on the top of this business code
541417
xsl-fo	xslt
Pattern(s): 
in some cases maybe xslt is not right for the job you could then consider using code to generate xsl-fo
i have used xsl-fo a lot professionally both from java and .net environments. it indeed gives you total control over the printed document pdf. i myself have generated very complex pdf s ready for mass-printing brochures and papers . they included complex structures like text floated in columns graphs using embedded svg and tables
xsl-fo is for print what html is for the screen
541417
xsl-fo	xslt
Pattern(s): 
altsoft s commercial .net xml2pdf is good 2
xsl-fo is definitely way to go when generating pdf s or printed documents
edit i only answered part of your question i guess. xsl-fo is not natively supported within any common browser as of today. i don t think there any plans for implementing native support in ie i d be very surprised if it was. xsl-fo is just xml so you won t need any further xsl-fo support by the .net framework then as of today. typically xsl-fo is generated using xslt and then the transformation result is passed to a formatting objects processor such as fop. in some cases xslt at least not 1.0 is not enough if your xsl-fo document is very complex
541456
document.write	window.open
Pattern(s): 
no px unit needed in window.open
i ve gone to using document.write to generate the page
i think you will probably have to use at least some document.write to put a skeleton page in place before you can interact with the dom before write has been called a new window s document is in an indeterminate state there is no document yet to interact with
541456
document.write	window.open
Pattern(s): 
i think you will probably have to use at least some document.write to put a skeleton page in place before you can interact with the dom before write has been called a new window s document is in an indeterminate state there is no document yet to interact with
firefox at least puts a temporary skeleton document in until you first call document.write but i can t see that this is actually documented anywhere so it s probably best not relied upon
var popup window.open popup height 400px width 400px
541506
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
in practical terms it means you can implement runnable and extends from another class as well
yes implements runnable is the preferred way to do it imo
you re not really specialising the thread s behaviour
542262
awt	swing	awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
otherwise swing gives you a much broader set of components to work with
if you are planning to move your gui onto multiple platforms then go with awt
otherwise swing gives you a much broader set of components to work with
544643
boxlayout	grouplayout
Pattern(s): 
grouplayout is not as powerful not as intuitive and not worth the trouble
my advice from years of laying out java gui and maintaining them is to learn and use the most powerful layout manager you can master in two hours and that you ll never forget then layout your gui with nested containers using this layout manager and the basic borderlayout gridlayout flowlayout boxlayout

545482
bonjour	avahi
Pattern(s): 
so it scales up
filemaker probably is using bonjour
check at and also avahi it does so by implementing what they call multicast-dns
545744
sprint	roadmap
Pattern(s): 
it should look like this sprint 8 -------- story 17 task 1 8 hours task 2 6 hours task 3 2 hours story 18 task 1 8 hours task 2 6 hours story 19 task 1 6 hours task 2 3 hours ... so basically these are the 2 types of estimation you should be doing at the start of each sprint where usually the 1st sprint requires a little more effort to build the initial project roadmap
usually estimation should be done in 2 levels at the start of each sprint story level and task level
for best results product owner and team should do both together every time although sometimes it is acceptable for the team estimate at task level without the product owner present
546453
hbase	hypertable
Pattern(s): 
in the mean time though if your application data storage can be modelled as a star schema see you might like to checkout the solution that hypertable proposes for secondary index-type needs
secondary indexes would indeed be useful for many potential applications of hbase and i believe the developers are in fact looking at it
checkout
546599
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
the os will keep the data alive until you either close the file or your process dies at which time unix will clean up after you
this design is the foundation of all unix filesystems
the windows file system ntfs works much the same way but the high level api is different
548136
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
in my case when the user navigates the tree we check with a database cache to ensure we don t need to repopulate the data
i find the best way to handle additional data is to subclass treenode
i create a basenode class that contains the shared data i want to maintain and inherited further from that for any specific node types
548154
pem	pkcs#12
Pattern(s): 

as far as i m aware stunnel only uses pem certificates so you will need to convert your jks files into two pem files one for the private key one for the public certificate
one way to do this is to convert the jks to a pkcs#12 aka pfx file using keytool and then use openssl to convert the pkcs#12 files into pem private key certificate files
548501
jruby	mri
Pattern(s): 
i believe this is changed in ruby 1.9 but i understand we re probably still not going to see great multi-threaded performance due to the global interpreter lock
if you really need good multi-threaded support and for your software to be written in ruby you might try running it on jruby
a quick sanity test showed that using your example i would get 2 os threads on mri and 12 when running the same thing under jruby
548705
haskell	scheme
Pattern(s): 
in lisp scheme a function is thought of a piece of code and examining a function simply means examining its code
in haskell a function means something closer to its mathematical definition as a map from a set a to a set b
so for example it make sense in the lisp context to compare two functions just compare their code
549212
ienumerable	icollection
Pattern(s): 
here s a small function i m using to determine if an object is a collection which will be enumerable as well since icollection is also ienumerable
i ve tried to use a similar technique as darren suggested however just beware that not just collections implement ienumerable
string for instance is also ienumerable and will iterate over the characters
549447
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
Pattern(s): 
if you want to interop with a custom tcp format that you need to handle you re much better off either using raw sockets or creating your own custom wcf transport channel which might not be trivial btw
the nettcpbinding uses a custom wire-level framing format that is not really documented though nicholas allen started a series of blog posts on the topic recently
the series start here to be honest net.tcp is really currently more useful for wcf to wcf communication
550341
debian	linux	debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
either use the packaged releases for whatever linux distribution you are running or build from source
if the machine doesn t have apt-get then chances are it isn t a debian or ubuntu machine which means that using a tutorial designed for debian or ubuntu is unlikely to get you very far
either use the packaged releases for whatever linux distribution you are running or build from source
551134
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
therefore i would not recommend a mind set where everything is to be buffered in ram
i would recommend setting up a search tree of slices representing the file where a single slice may be a reference to a range of bytes in the actual file on disk or a reference to an edited page
when you open a file you start by inserting a single item into the tree which is simply a range representing the whole file for a 10-mib file when the user edits the file create a page which is some reasonable size say 4 kib around the edit point
551394
emacs	textmate
Pattern(s): 
it s nice to have a simple text editor for such tasks although i m sure some would argue as to how simple emacs really is
but this isn t necessarily an argument for emacs specifically
on os x for example textmate is an awesome editor for these tasks
551394
emacs	textmate
Pattern(s): 
on os x for example textmate is an awesome editor for these tasks
2 emacs is powerful and wonderfully extensible but in my experience it is not a substitute for an ide
when starting a new project in my spare time one of the first things i think about is whether there s a good ide for my language and technologies of choice
551634
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 
from my point of view typdef-ing a structure is a bad idea as that hides the information that the typedef like foo is a structure and writing the keyword struct isn t really additional work especially if those typedefs get a postfix added to indicate them being a structure -- i ve seen this quite often
edit added missing typedef in second example

551877
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
the reason is that os x is licensed only for apple machines
however there are some hacks that allow installing os x under vmware
it might be also possible to install it under virtualbox or virtual pc although i have not seen specific instructions
554552
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if you re using postgresql for your database and you re willing to tie yourself to a database-specific feature it supports table inherited directly
for mapping inherited hierarchies to database tables i think martin fowler lays out the alternatives fairly well in his book patterns of enterprise application architecture
if the number of additional fields columns is small for subclassing then single table inherited is usually the simplest to deal with
554552
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if the number of additional fields columns is small for subclassing then single table inherited is usually the simplest to deal with
if you re using postgresql for your database and you re willing to tie yourself to a database-specific feature it supports table inherited directly

554810
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
see simple.cxx and the python test case at
python 2.2 introduced new-style classes which among other things allow the user to subclass built-in types like your new built-in type
inherited didn t work in your example because it defines an old-style class
556041
struts	wicket
Pattern(s): 
spring is a giant in itself it has the answer for almost everything that might confuse you in the start
struts 1 is already outdated and struts 2 has a very tough competition
i would suggest you to look into wicket
556411
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
see below for a brief description of kernel mode also known as supervisor mode and the system call mechanism
user+sys will tell you how much actual cpu time your process used
note that this is across all cpus so if the process has multiple threads and this process is running on a computer with more than one processors it could potentially exceed the wall clock time reported by real which usually occurs
557079
soappy	suds	soappy	suds
Pattern(s): 
from its documentation it can also be used to build applications using soap messages with attachments. their website is not as pretty as suds but the package includes promising documentation
soappy has support for attachments on its todo list
suds does not mention the word attachments anywhere
557583
interpolation	splines
Pattern(s): 
use the intensity roughly speaking the grayscale in simple rgb space to display the height or add contour lines in black like the example image does
what you are looking for is surface interpolation
some products exist to do this here s one the resulting function splines other mathematical construct can then be interrogated at the required resolution to supply the height map
557583
interpolation	splines
Pattern(s): 
some products exist to do this here s one the resulting function splines other mathematical construct can then be interrogated at the required resolution to supply the height map
your interpolation function sqrt x1 - x2 2 + y1 - y2 2 is similar to inverse distance weighted methods except you are applying an arbitrary filter and discarding many of the other data points
most of these techniques rely on a reasonable number of samples and terrain-like behaviour underpinning the values
558159
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
those two webservers are good products and strong in static content
just because apache is widely used doesn t mean other products are just optimization
in my experience lighttpd and nginx are easy enough to configure and you can use fcgi bindings for most programming languages
558332
ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerable	ienumerator
Pattern(s): 
thus when your class implements ienumerable you are saying that you can call a method getenumerator and get a new object returned an ienumerator you can use in a loop such as foreach
ienumerable implements getenumerator
when called that method will return an ienumerator which implements movenext reset and current

abstract-class	superclass	subclass	abstract-class	subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
your compiler is usually smarter than you are when it comes to optimizations like inline
something you might consider depending on the rest of your design is a factory where your abstract-class has a static method or multiple static methods depending on how you implement it that constructs the appropriate subclass and returns it as an iconverter
with this you can expose only the abstract definition in the header file and have all the concrete class definitions and implementations in a single .cpp file along with the superclass implementation
561037
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
this part overwrites the definition of since the newly created object already has a do properties it does not look up the prototypal chain
the classical form of inherited in javascript is awkard and hard to grasp
i would suggest using douglas crockfords simple inherited pattern instead
562587
vsto	add-in	vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
the reason is that the only way office can execute external code you add-in is via com
even vsto is still using the old idtextensibility2 com interface underneath
idtextensibility2 is a com interface that all add-in for microsoft office applications must implement
562587
vsto	add-in	vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
in such a com based add-in or com-visible managed add-in you can simply add your udf as described here
however now with vsto there is an additional layer of abstraction vsto uses a so-called solution loader implementing idtextensibility2 which is a dll provided by the vsto runtime
this means that your add-in is no longer com-visible
563391
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
that way you avoid having to index into the list each time you want to set a properties so it is a cleaner and slightly faster solution in both execution time and writing it time
i think your problem may be coming from being confused about the inherited hierarchy of your memberlist class
it isn t actually a subclassing of member at all it is a subclassing of list of t
563846
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
some like mysql 5 care about the length of a varchar n column as opposed to an unlimited-length text column
others like postgresql consider text and varchar n as internally identical with the exception that a length is checked on varchar n columns
writing something like varchar 65536 in postgresql is silly
564639
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
much like maven it is able to retrieve dependencies at build time from whichever repositories you configure including maven repositories or your own private repository
with ant you could do something along the following group all dependencies together
package a jar-file with your application and embed references to the dependencies in the manifest.mf-file with the class-path -directive inside the jar
566000
visualvm	jrockit
Pattern(s): 
that number should not grow over time or you have a memory leak
use visualvm to debug a memory leak
each time you reload an application it uses additional perm gen memory which cannot be reclaimed in sun jvm others like jrockit don t have this problem
566790
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
but yeah this sounds more like an emacs thing
vim is just a text editor

567408
jobs	cron
Pattern(s): 
i have a separate install of rails on another box that handles these jobs
this box just does jobs and is not accessible to the outside world
on this separate box a cron job runs all outstanding jobs every 60 seconds unless jobs are still running from the last invocation
567408
jobs	cron
Pattern(s): 
on this separate box a cron job runs all outstanding jobs every 60 seconds unless jobs are still running from the last invocation
the user s job status page auto-refreshes to show the status of the job which is updated by the jobs box as the job is started running then finished
once the job is done a link appears to the results file
568230
winpcap	wireshark
Pattern(s): 
ethereal while i m not certain if the library would work on wince or whether it directly provides what your looking for it may serve as a framework for any packet analysis that would need to be done in order to facilitate bandwidth use measurement
winpcap is a netwok packet capture library for windows which i believe is a port of a nix library
it is or was at one point used by the network traffic anlyzer wireshark a.k.a
568983
strsplit	substr
Pattern(s): 
the above method is bounded by the performance of indexof and substr which does too much index of out range checking and to be faster you need to optimize away these and implement your own helper methods
you can beat the strsplit performance but it s gonna take cleaver int-hacking
you can read my post about that here
569825
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
edit i corrected my post to use the scalar function to retrieve the size of the arrays and also add some checking in case the arrays does not contain an even number of elements
using a for-loop would do what you need
edit i corrected my post to use the scalar function to retrieve the size of the arrays and also add some checking in case the arrays does not contain an even number of elements
569836
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
it returns false to prevent the default behavior of a form submission from happen
this submit function will do an ajax post using the action of the form which you set to contact_us.php
finally this will take whatever content contact_us.php returns and replace the content of the div with the id content with that
570586
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 
since your equals method uses structural equality make sure you override gethashcode with an implementation based on your fields as well
its certainly more code than i d want to write for an equals method
there are a lot of redundant checks such as checking for referenceequals and hashcodes i know these checks are redundant because the last lines in your function check for structural equality
571782
pyopengl	pyglet
Pattern(s): 
i ve heard good things about pygame and pyglet though i must admit i haven t really done much messing around with either one
if you re already familiar with using opengl in another language probably c or c++ then pyopengl is awesome
i was surprised as to how easy it was to switch from opengl c to opengl python
571976
ioexception	filewriter
Pattern(s): 
regardless you don t need a random access file - a filewriter would be better
to ensure that the file is deleted do as eddie suggests and put the delete in a finnaly block - but you will also need to ensure that the raf.close ioexception is handled.
something like finally try raf.close
572748
ssms	sqlcmd
Pattern(s): 
now you could wrap the sql to create the trace in another stored proc that can be run via sql agent idle threshold but use fn_trace_getinfo to see if one if running already
you can not automate it in ssms or use an environment variable the code the job the alerts etc all must exist on the server
you can put the scripted trace into a batch file and run it via osql sqlcmd but it has to be invoked manually
572974
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
for example chars 10 is the same as x000a
the default type is int
more information at the c# reference at msdn
573057
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
more info at wikipedia
you need something that understands texinfo which i don t believe vi vim does
you might just be stuck with emacs
573250
width	height
Pattern(s): 
however as the div is located in a table cell the width is not fixed as the cell would expand and contract according to the contents of the other cells in the table
so there really is no correct width the cell will adapt itself according to the contents of all cells
by the way your height problem would be easily solved setting it to 400px but i guess the shown table structure is just an example 1 row 400px height...
573928
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
the example above is well structured because a dog is an animal and also a vertebrate
i find multiple inherited particularly useful when using mixin classes
as stated in wikipedia in object-oriented programming languages a mixin is a class that provides a certain functionality to be inherited by a subclassing but is not meant to stand alone
574325
zsh	tcsh
Pattern(s): 
tcsh is not bad for those who are very comfortable with c-like syntax
zsh i have not used zsh but it seems to be very feature rich
personally i prefer bash because it is installed on almost every unix-compatible os it is very versatile and is a good compromise between a simple command-line tool and a scripting language
574726
range	max	range	min
Pattern(s): 
it gives back 24 bits for float and 53 bits for double which is correct the mantissa itself contains only 23 52 bits but as the first bit is always one on normalized values you have a hidden extra bit
exponent length you are shifting 1.0 to the left or to the right until you hit the top or the bottom. normally the exp range is - max+1 - max
if min is smaller than - max+1 you have as floats and doubles have subnormals. normally positive and negative values are symmetric with perhaps one offset but you can adjust the test by adding negative values
574741
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
for native functions firefox ie opera and google-chrome returns a function with the body native code
however google-chrome has most functions implemented in javascript and will return the source for most functions object.constructor is one of the few native functions in google-chrome that does return native code below you find a function with a regexp that checks for native code
there is no need to call tostring since it is done automatically when the function isn t called
575390
fcntl	posix
Pattern(s): 
therefore choose the one that fits better your requirements and use it
one word of caution it is unspecified what happens when one process locks a file using fcntl and another using lockf
in most systems these are equivalent operations in fact under linux lockf is implemented on top of fcntl but posix says their interaction is unspecified
576183
super	self
Pattern(s): 
note that the syntax changed in python 3.0 you can just say super .__init__ instead of super childb self .__init__ which imo is quite a bit nicer
the standard docs also refer to a guide to using super which is quite explanatory

576849
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 
in interface builder uitabbar is under windows views bars in the cocoa touch library
it s possible to add a uitabbar to any uiviewcontroller
that way you don t actually have to push a uitabbarcontroller and therefore stay within the guidelines of the apple api
577186
uitableview	uipickerview
Pattern(s): 
it s not for navigation or long lists
uitableview is appropriate when you have a list possibly a quite long one and you want to navigate a hierarchy by tapping items on the list
also look at uipickerview which is similar to a drop-down list on a combo box
577405
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 
many .net types don t guarantee their hash codes to stay the same after a restart so you should only use the value of gethashcode for in memory data structures
in most cases where equals compares multiple fields it doesn t really matter if your gethash hashes on one field or on many
you just have to make sure that calculating the hash is really cheap b no allocations please and fast b no heavy computations b and certainly no database connections and provides a good distribution
577436
notepad++	jedit
Pattern(s): 
edit cobol mode ready and commited see aid 2654343 group_id 588 atid 350588
it seams notepad++ is not capable of highlighting columns
for jedit i found some possibilities but not finished yet the plugin columnruler version 1.0.2 author brad mace but it is shown in all file modes
578819
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
so for example if your vector has the first and the 30th element set b should contain by the end of the day the binary number 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000100
8 sizeof b is the number of bits that can be stored in b which is an unsigned int typically 32 or 64 bits
what the code is doing is that it is packing the boolean values in vector a to become bits in b
580155
chess	minesweeper
Pattern(s): 
alternatively it s solved very concisely in prolog
for chess start with minimax then try minimax with alpha-beta pruning
minesweeper is np-complete
580371
addition	modulo
Pattern(s): 
the integers modulo 2 32 which you are probably learning about in your abstract algebra class
modular addition over such a group is not terribly interesting though
more interesting might be modular addition over a group of size n where n has prime factors other than just 2 or size p where p is a prime
581876
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
create a redirect in whatever manner you prefer if you wish to preserve old directory and file names for continuity users may have bookmarked certain pages in the old site already
note if you are keeping the exact names of the old subdirectories in your mvc site during the porting phase it s preferable to migrate a whole subdirectory at a time i ve realised because by only doing a few files the routing rules you need to write become more complex since if an existing folder exists with the same name as a routing rule s path and that folder has a default.aspx file then foldername will default to the default.aspx page as it takes precidence over the routing rules
tip seriously consider using a tool like routedebug for route debugging so you can figure out strange things like above or when you have multiple routing rules firing and causing unexpected behaviors
582585
portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 
this forces landscape on most tablets and portrait on most phones but i still wouldn t recommend this for most normal apps some users just like to type in the landscape softkeyboard on their phones and many tablet users read in portrait - and you should let them
if you still need to force portrait for some reason sensorportrait may be better than portrait for android 2.3+
this allows for upside-down portrait which is quite common in tablet usage
584126
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
tcp is very nice but has a lot of overhead associated with it
udp is used when the protocol is going to be managed by the application itself
the app may have a better idea for how to do it or it may be faster under the special conditions of the application
584448
clang	llvm
Pattern(s): 
both clang and llvm are coded using c++
among the developers of clang is douglas gregor author of several c++1x language proposals like variadic templates and concepts
for reference see this test by douglas gregor of clang against gcc here are some quick-n-dirty performance results for template instantiation in clang and gcc 4.2
584890
yslow	pagespeed
Pattern(s): 
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow
it gives much more detailed analysis and smarter advice rather than recommending a cdn for small websites like yslow

585442
hudson	bamboo
Pattern(s): 
they are both great but hudson has better report support for instance publishing your coverage reports etc
is so much easier inside hudson
this is likely to change in the near future but despite bamboo s integration w jira etc
586803
short	base
Pattern(s): 
a shared code base is - all considered - simpler and more efficient
at least in the short run
an xml-rpc or plain http-based api can work well and is good for separating responsibilities since you get explicit boundaries
586834
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
contrary to my previous post it turns out that mysql is also using a cost-based optimizer which is very good news - that is provided you run your analyze at least once when you believe that the volume of data in your database is representative of future day-to-day usage
when dealing with cost-based optimizers oracle postgresql etc. you need to make sure to periodically run analyze on your various tables as their size increases by more than 10-15
postgresql will do this automatically for you by default whereas other rdbmss will leave this responsibility to a dba you. through statistical analysis analyze will help the optimizer get a better idea of how much i o and other associated resources such as cpu needed for sorting will be involved when choosing between various candidate execution plans
587370
profiler	perf
Pattern(s): 
andrew
as michael said above red gate ants profiler is an excellent tool for profiling your sharepoint code
my post here shows how easy it is to get up and running although you could argue that it is aimed at your specific code it is possible to test perf issues when things like large lists are populated
587597
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
make sure your php source directory is not there
keep the include in a folder not within webroot
in case someone does get web server access to your site and can see the php in the filesystem the included and sensitive details are not in the web root
588780
init.d	pid
Pattern(s): 
for example this is a script which can start stop a wsgi server you can also see there an example of how to use it with a virtualenv which i would always recommend
the best tool i found for helping with init.d scripts is start-stop-daemon
it will run any application monitor run pid files create them when necessary provide ways to stop the daemon set process user group ids and can even background your process
589685
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
that meant iirc that sizeof int was also 1 because both chars and int were 32-bit
for 32-bit systems the de facto standard is ilp32 that is int long and pointer are all 32-bit quantities
for 64-bit systems the primary unix de facto standard is lp64 long and pointer are 64-bit but int is 32-bit
590572
nvl	nullif
Pattern(s): 
select type craft sum nvl regular 0 + nvl overtime 0 as total_hours from hours_t group by type craft order by type craft oracle have 5 null-related functions nvl nvl2 coalesce nullif lnnvl nvl nvl expr1 expr2 nvl lets you replace null returned as a blank with a string in the results of a query
if expr1 is null then nvl returns expr2
if expr1 is not null then nvl returns expr1
591271
profiler	vtune
Pattern(s): 
something like this
this kind of problem is a perfect example of where a good low level profiler is essential
something like vtune it can give you a much more informed idea of where your hotspots lie
591935
codeigniter	cakephp
Pattern(s): 
from what i hear though you are able to use the components separately without using the whole framework and can even use them with other frameworks
i use codeigniter at work and i love it
it is by far the most newbie friendly framework and with your cakephp experience it should be a breeze
592127
gridview	rowdatabound	gridview	rowdatabound
Pattern(s): 
if that option is undesirable then i recommend that you use the gridview s rowdatabound event to selectively set the row s e.row visible property to false
the default answer is to remove the item from whatever collection you re using as the gridview s datasource
if that option is undesirable then i recommend that you use the gridview s rowdatabound event to selectively set the row s e.row visible property to false
595476
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
just in case because if at some point in the future you decide to implement lazy loading or something more advanced than a simple get set then you ll need to make sure this is working properly
the best practice for getter is to not allow them to throw exceptions at all
setter s are another matter
595731
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
for a loops with much longer code where a break or continue could easily hide from notice the purist approach might be more clear since loops is already complicated to grasp in that case
but you can always do this as part of the for-loop just add it as part of the conditional
it s also better practice to test the arrays bound with rather than for an exact equality in case something caused i to skip over the exact value i actually saw this happen in a y2k bug which could have been avoided by the better practice
595860
goto	break
Pattern(s): 
the thought of not using break since it is just as evil as goto is pretty nonsensical
that s just a non-local and non-deterministic goto
by the way this isn t a rant against exception handling just an observation
596104
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
however even with 32 bit variable there can be race conditions with reading and writing therefor any shared variable should be synchronized in some way to solve these race conditions
on a 32-bit x86 platform the largest atomic sized piece of memory is 32-bits
this means that if something writes to or reads from a 64bit sized variable it s possible for that read write to get pre-empted during execution
596828
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
such a trivial class extension would for instance be the addition of a debug-print method in a subclassing defined for exactly this trivial purpose
if the superclass prohibits mixed-type comparison via the getclass check then the trivial extension would not be comparable to its superclass
whether or not this is a problem fully depends on the semantics of the class and the purpose of the extension
597140
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
of course the emacs crowd says the same thing regarding emacs-style thinking but i gave up on learning emacs because vim was simpler and did the job for me
the amazing ubiquity of vim and the even more amazing ubiquity of vi-clones in general on unix systems alone is enough to make it worth learning
besides that the whole vi-style thinking is something that i really think has made me a bit more productive
597274
forth	smalltalk	forth	smalltalk
Pattern(s): 
also while smalltalk is probably not popular in the embedded community embedded development is definitely popular in the smalltalk community
forth is quite popular for embedded development
also while smalltalk is probably not popular in the embedded community embedded development is definitely popular in the smalltalk community
597470
hide	show
Pattern(s): 
vpd can ensure that for example the credit-card column is only visible to users logged in from a specific ip eg the application server as a certain user or with a certain role. while a user with dba role would be able to change the vpd privileges or grant themselves the appropriate role or impersonate the relevant user this would show up in the audit log
there have been disputing claims if it can be used to hide data from someone with dba privileges. probably because there can be conflicting ideas about what constitutes dba privileges
there is a dba database role a sysdba privilege and someone who can login as oracle or administrator to the server at the operating system level each with higher privileges privileges can be revoked from the dba role so that is even more vague
597847
northwind	adventureworks
Pattern(s): 
so decide on basis of your version
northwind database was the best sample database for sql server 2000
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind
597847
northwind	adventureworks	northwind	adventureworks
Pattern(s): 
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind
northwind is not the best database due to few new features of analysis and reporting service of sql server 2005
msdn book on line bol uses the adventureworks in all of their example and it makes it easy to follow up if proper understanding of adventureworks schema is developed
598093
opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 
for example firefox is more than okay with an array looking like this item0 item1
however this same code will make opera barf because it hates the trailing comma
ie will make the array a three-item array with the third item undefined
598449
scons	autotools	scons	autotools
Pattern(s): 
but if you compare to make alone not autotools scons alone is superiour
i used scons for some time and found it had several problems
therefore i switched back to autotools which is a pita itself
598723
addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo	multiplication	modulo
Pattern(s): 
for integers to be a group under multiplication you have to be modulo a prime number
eg z mod 7 2 4 1 so 2 and 4 are each other s inverses for floating point values simple multiplication or addition saturates to + - infinity and there are no values which are the inverses of infinity so either the set is not closed or it lacks invertibility
if on the other hand you want something similar to integer multiplication modulo a power of 2 then multiplication will do - there are elements without an inverse so it s not a group but it is closed - you always get a floating point value back
598779
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
from the ant file s perspective maven is just a means for defining classpath definitions which are subsequently used by the various ant build task
the maven scope classifier of dependencies can be utilized when defining classpaths such that a suitable classpath can be set for compiling running unit test packaging et al
other definitions in the pom.xml can also be accessed as ant property definitions
598779
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
other definitions in the pom.xml can also be accessed as ant property definitions
a lot of existing ant build files are rather complex
it can be a formidable undertaking to convert such projects to a full maven build process
598788
squash	branch	squash	merge	squash	fast-forward
Pattern(s): 
charles bailey provided there the most detailed answer reminding us that a commit is a full tree not just diffs from a previous states
and here the old commit the initial commit and the new commit result of the squash will have no common ancestor
that mean you can not commit --amend the initial commit into new one and then rebase onto the new initial commit the history of the previous initial commit lots of conflicts that last sentence is no longer true with rather with a the original initial commit and b a subsequent commit needed to be squashed into the initial one go back to the last commit that we want to form the initial commit detach head reset the branch pointer to the initial commit but leaving the index and working tree intact amend the initial tree using the tree from b git commit --amend temporarily tag this new initial commit or you could remember the new commit sha1 manually git tag tmp go back to the original branch assume master for this example git checkout master replay all the commits after b onto the new initial commit remove the temporary tag git tag -d tmp that way the rebase --onto does not introduce conflicts during the merge since it rebases history made after the last commit b to be squashed into the initial one which was a to tmp representing the squashed new initial commit trivial fast-forward merge only
598885
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
i don t know a lot about how the protocols work something that you definitely need to research or much about what goes on in a browser but a great place to start would be the source of the open-source browsers primarily google-chrome and firefox
google-chrome is an especially good project to look at as they only do what i d expect you to start with the google-chrome and the backend of the browser
forget creating a rendering engine at first - use webkit or gekko
599070
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
maven scopes can be used to fine tune classpath definitions such that one suitable for compiling or running unit test or for packaging et al can be established
also pretty much any element of something defined in the pom.xml file can be referenced as an ant property within the build.xml file
really with the ant task for maven there is no viable reason for ivy to even exist
599235
haskell	sml
Pattern(s): 
typically tuples lists and partially-evaluated functions are very common data structures in functional programming languages
mutable data structures like arrays and real hash tables are used much less because they don t fit in as well with haskell
sml which is also functional but not lazy can use arrays more naturally than haskell but lists are still more common because they map well to recursive algorithms
599421
jms	jta	openjpa	openejb
Pattern(s): 
local-only jboss jndi implementation documentation limited ejb 3.1 no apache openejb 3.1 license apache license java jdk 5.0 or 6.0 tomcat integration yes modifications to startup shell script tomcat versions tomcat 6.x or 5.5 deployment to tomcat war file list of features ejb 3.0 and 3.1 jta jax-ws jms j2ee connectors jpa jndi

jndi configuration flexible jndi naming schema deployment types collapsed ear war jar management support activemq jmx mbeans support community support mailing lists and forums ejb container for apache geronimo jms provider activemq xa connection pool yes ejb timer services yes persistence providers openjpa hibernate limitations openejb uses openjpa to provide jpa and cmp persistence and openjpa currently requires a javaagent to function properly
600279
scons	automake
Pattern(s): 
it s built with python and the build scripts are actually python scripts themselves which gives a great deal of expressive power
from the web site scons is an open source software construction tool that is a next-generation build tool
think of scons as an improved cross-platform substitute for the classic make utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf automake and compiler caches such as ccache
600279
scons	automake
Pattern(s): 
think of scons as an improved cross-platform substitute for the classic make utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf automake and compiler caches such as ccache
in short scons is an easier more reliable and faster way to build software

601753
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
Pattern(s): 
the higher level combinators in wxhaskell mitigate most of that advantage but they do require a deeper understanding of how you want your interface to look and behave and therefore are harder to use in an exploratory fashion
a consideration is that currently it is slightly easier to get wxhaskell to work natively on mac os x
gtk2hs depends on gtk which does have an implementation using native widgets on mac os x but that implementation is not as easily built as the wxwidgets implementation for mac os x is
601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
Pattern(s): 
wxhaskell is not updated as frequently but the core team is active and there are regular bugfixes but with major new functionality being added rather more slowly than we would like we all have day jobs
wxhaskell gives true native application appearance on all supported platforms out of the box
gtk2hs is of course native on linux and has a pretty good native theme on windows good enough to satisfy all but pedants... but has gtk look and feel on osx and depends on having x11 installed
601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
Pattern(s): 
i would admit that with only a small amount of extra work the same could be done with gtk2hs so this is probably the weakest argument in favour of wxhaskell
it is my personal opinion that wxhaskell is friendlier to closed source commercial developments
this is of course the subject of interminable flame wars so i will only say that wxhaskell is under the wxwidgets license which unambiguously allows for closed source development
602299
stringbuilder	stringwriter	stringbuilder	stringwriter
Pattern(s): 
the stringwriter is built on top to add more convenience functions for string formatting
the stringbuilder class is basically a mutable string a helper class to construct an immutable string
the stringwriter is built on top to add more convenience functions for string formatting

g++	gcc	g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 
if you only installed c compiler you would have command gcc but not command g++
g++ is c++ compiler not c compiler
if you only installed c compiler you would have command gcc but not command g++
603263
ant	maven	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
ant+ ivy is a pretty good combination if you want to avoid maven
ant is mainly a build tool
maven is a project and dependencies management tool which of course builds your project as well
604017
post	get
Pattern(s): 
however if it causes problems define _stlp_use_malloc or _stlp_use_newalloc to get bare malloc -based or new -based default allocator
though this post says it has not yet been ported to vs2008

606541
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
Pattern(s): 
mercurial s friction is a little lower than svn s
i have used cvs perforce subversion before as my personal version control system and went to mercurial since about two weeks ago - at work we use ms team system .
for me the most notable new thing is easy transfer between different machines
607496
boost	allocator
Pattern(s): 
here is an example not using the visitor pattern though and yes you should technically use instead of int for i s type and you should technically use instead anyway but i m trying to keep it simple.
boost variant is similar to dirkgently s suggestion of boost any but supports the visitor pattern meaning it s easier to add type-specific code later
also it allocates values on the stack rather than using dynamic allocator leading to slightly more efficient code
607732
post	put
Pattern(s): 
many touchscreens excluding multitouch average the area touched so chances are you don t want to put ui items any closer than fingertip area to cut down on mis-touches
touch screens need to be calibrated post installation and even then there might be some parallax depending on the screen type or the natural angle from which the screen is being viewed
you might also consider visual feedback on touch down and only let the event through on touch release
608043
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
in general you should usually only make things as public as they really need to be
only the types methods properties you want to be visible should be declared public
the rest should be declared private protected friend or protected friend
608207
base	fractions
Pattern(s): 
numbers formatted as general will be rounded to 15 significant digits of precision with precision as displayed turned on
the key is that excel stores numbers as base 2 floating point numbers
most decimal fractions cannot be represented as base 2 floating point numbers
609632
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
the dialog that pops up has a section for a minimum required versioning for this application which lets you enforce that a user upgrade to a specific versioning
once you ve set that users shouldn t be able to roll back to a previous versioning
they ll also be forced to upgrade if they re running a versioning older than the minimum
609632
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
they ll also be forced to upgrade if they re running a versioning older than the minimum
note that i haven t tried this but it s my understanding of the minimum versioning feature

610223
folder	dir
Pattern(s): 
the problem then is that the plugin uses the dependencies from in the plugins folder while the executable uses the dependencies from the root folder which are basically the same file in a different dir so while running the clr sees them as 2 different dll s and that really confuses the clr
so when the shared dependencies aren t copied to the plugins folder everything runs fine because the plugins use the depedencies from the root folder and thus the same dll s

610260
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
i d tend to use memcpy if i have already calculated the length although strcpy is usually optimised to work on machine words it feels that you should provide the library with as much information as you can so it can use the most optimal copying mechanism
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
610288
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 
with strcpy this can happen with strncpy this will never happen
that is why strcpy is considered unsafe
evil might be a little strong
610542
gif	png
Pattern(s): 
see
gif is best for images with lots of solid colour - jpeg for images with lots of colour variance edit thanks cletus
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots
610557
gif	png
Pattern(s): 
gif is not really a very good format and png can replace it completely in compression and quality for most applications but sometimes there are compatibility issues not sure if these have been ironed out in all the current webbrowsers
gif can be read by basically everything so that s when it s very useful

612164
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 
just putting this here for the benefit of readers
end edit what you probably want in addition to resolving the parsing however is to use setinterval with only one timer instead of a starttime and continuetime timer
settimeout executes only once whereas setinterval repeats every x milliseconds so you d need only one
612164
setinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	clearinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 
settimeout executes only once whereas setinterval repeats every x milliseconds so you d need only one
to cancel a setinterval use clearinterval

613013
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
you should call assuming the ivar backing the properties is called editmyobject
calling the accessor via self.editmyobject is safe for synthesized accessor but if an overriden accessor relies on object state which may not be valid at the calling location in -dealloc or causes other side-effects you have a bug by calling the accessor
2 object ownership rules in cocoa are very simple if you call a method that has alloc or copy in its signature or use which is basically equivalent to then you own the object that is returned and you must balance your acquisition of ownership with a release
613186
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
in other words if your api action changes the server state rest advises us to use post put delete but not get
user agents usually understand that doing multiple post is bad and will warn against it because the intent of post is to alter server state eg
pay for goods at checkout and you probably don t want to do that twice
616543
inherited	base-class
Pattern(s): 
then that one overrides a fn aswell as fn in c and b
for example the following results in a compile time error you can however derive non-virtual from a in c and b but then you have no diamond inherited anymore
that is each data-member in a appears twice in b and c because you have two a base-class sub-objects in an d object
616773
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
adding a salt only makes it harder for an attacker to generate the fingerprint it s a case of if they have all but one piece of information then the last piece of information is rendered useless i d suggest that you add some more things in for example within vbulletin a project i used to work on the session id hash which is basically the same as the fingerprint is generated with the following code
also a session hash is generated using md5 uniqid microtime true
these are both checked when trying to identify the session so to hijack the session the person would need to know the following the time exactly on the server when the session was created the users browser agent string the user s ip address they would also have to spoof the ip address or at least the first 2 3 octets to be able to do this
616773
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
vbulletin don t actually use a salt per se but in your above example the salt is just adding a limited amount of entropy it s always best to find as much entropy as possible
for example in something i m currently writing in python i generate a hash for usage with xsrf protection
the following is what i use
616815
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
even more the one who decides on inlining isn t vs compiler that takes you code and converts it into il but jit compiler that takes il and converts it to machine code
this is because only the jit compiler knows enough about the processor architecture to decide if putting a method inline is appropriate as it s a tradeoff between instruction pipelining and cache size
so even looking in .net reflector will not help you
616944
qsort	strcmp	qsort	strcmp
Pattern(s): 
unfortunately strcmp takes two non-modifiable strings hence it s signature is instead of what you have change the signature of both qsort1 and numeric and
that s a common problem the following line tells qsort to expect a pointer to a function with two void parameters
unfortunately strcmp takes two non-modifiable strings hence it s signature is instead of what you have change the signature of both qsort1 and numeric and
618034
dependencyobject	freezable
Pattern(s): 
dependencyobject could and should have been a very clean ubiquitous reusable class. instead it is structurally and behaviourly bound to it s inheritors and even contains specific constants fields methods and work-arounds to help freezable co-exist with the rest of the sub-classes which not only strays far from good oo design but also makes an otherwise superb class utterly unusable outside of the wpf framework
after much research and muddling through the source code for dependencyobject here s the short answer the inheritencecontext the property which reveals the logical parent of an instance is like 90 of the useful implementation of dependencyobject marked as internal and thus kept hidden from all code outside of windowsbase.dll it is possible to use reflection to set the _contextparent field as well as to call this hidden methods to set the inheritencecontext but at the end of the day its not a clean solution
after scouring the dependencyobject source code i ve gotta say that i m not impressed
618563
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
Pattern(s): 
so obviously there is no installer yet either
the answer to my question then is no monodevelop on windows is not ready for normal use
i guess i ll make do with visual studio and sharpdevelop on windows and wait patiently or maybe even have a look at the outstanding bugs..
620482
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
start the transaction create the group create the user then commit the transaction
you would have to be using an engine that supports transactions such as innodb for your tables in order for that to work though
the default myisam engine does not support transactions
621319
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
however if the upgrade code is the same but the product code is different then when you try to install the 2nd msi it will ask you if you want to upgrade at which time it is supposed to copy the values from the old config to a new config
if both values are the same and the versioning number didn t change then the new config will be in the same location as the old config and it won t have to do anything
msdn documentation clickonce is a little bit different because its based more off of the clickonce versioning # and url path however i have found that as long as you continue to publish to the same location the new versioning of the application will continue to use the existing config
621544
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
this is the ideal solution for trying code in some other os or some other architecture
a lot of people will call qemu simics or even sometimes vmware depending on the product a simulator
for production roll outs i use xen for testing something i just cross compiled i use qemu simics or virtualbox
621617
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
if your elements were allowed to be zero-sized then would be identical to which is going to cause all sorts of havoc to your processing loops
the reason why it may not be a machine word is that there are no elements within it that actually require it to be aligned on a word boundary such as an int
for example if you place chars x
621617
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
for example if you place chars x
int y
inside the class my gcc clocks it at eight bytes since the second int must be aligned in that implementation
622266
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
this is called a naked type constraint
it is a constraint on a type parameter meaning that the type t given to a generic class or method must inherited from the class attribute for example this is useful because it allows the generic class to do things with objects of type t with the knowledge that anything that is a t must also be an attribute
in the example above it s okay for gettypeid to query the typeid of attr because typeid is a properties of an attribute and because attr is a t it must be a type that inherits from attribute
622366
post	get
Pattern(s): 
and then you could get the values using
using post makes it possible to send larger quantity of data there is a vague limit to the size of a url and it s not visible in the url
you should note though that it s still sent in clear text so it does not means it s secure
622638
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
there is no way of knowing if any element has been set short of keeping a separate boolean array
i won t return null because int is a primitive type
it will return the default int value which is 0
622730
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
db your obvious choices are mysql and postgresql
postgresql has better performance of the two but as i said before you must look to keep your db activity to a minimum
language it doesn t matter
622954
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
if you really want to learn more about it have a look at schneier s applied cryptography
this is called a hash collision and the best way to avoid it is to use a strong hash function
md5 is relatively easy to artificially build colliding files as seen here
623015
putchar	gets
Pattern(s): 
it gets a character and the resulting infile that is returned by get is then checked to see if it is still good by converting it to bool
the line should probably be putchar prints to the standard output
but the return value same as the input goes to the outfile
623115
kate	kde
Pattern(s): 
-p on kde which is what i use i can recommend kwrite which is a well-featured but fairly basic text editor with syntax highlighting
or kate which is a fancier text editor with some extra features session management a builtin terminal panel automatic invocation of make and several plugins including a c c++ symbol viewer
i usually use kate for my c++ work when i don t want to bother with setting up a full ide project
623670
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
then i make my controller a qobject subclassing and have it create the view objects and connect signals from the qwidgets to slots in my qobject controller
my model class is a regular class that don t inherited anything from qt and implement the business logic
it gets modified by the controllers slots
625031
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc	strdup	strtok
Pattern(s): 
you can then pass them to functions that modify their argument given like strtok which writes into the string it has to tokenize
i think you can come up with something like this since it is called new strdup you would be supposed to free it once done using the string using an alternative way of writing it is using malloc
if the library is old it may have used that which c++ inherited from c now you are supposed to free the string using free when done prefer the first version if you are writing with c++
625585
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
the current attacks against md5 are where an attacker creates two documents with the same hash
salt are used for password verification - they prevent an attacker performing an offline attack against the password database - each user s password has a salt attached to the plain-text before the hashing - then a pre-computed rainbow table of plaintext - hash text is useless

626143
realloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 
realloc as well as malloc don t care what is the pointer type - you can use void as well as anything
use the suggested approach hold the pointer to the previous buffer until realloc has successfully returned
once realloc successfully returns the previous block has been freed and all pointers to it have become dangling adjust them
627566
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
if you re having issues getting the server-side code to work right with your custom controls post it and we ll help you out
keep in mind reording client-side leaves yourself open to issues in three ways
if the client computer is slow this reordering may be visible no matter what you do
628081
affinity	processors
Pattern(s): 
you can then replace scheduled tasks or shortcuts with a call to start with the appropriate parameters
you may want to look at the affinity parameter to start
from the help affinity the new application will have the specified processors affinity mask expressed as a hexadecimal number. as processors affinity on windows is a bitmask you may need some experimentation but i d assume 1 being the first core therefore 7 being the first three cores and f being all four
628202
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
this means they will all be saved in the users profiles tables but when you instantiate them activerecord will instantiate them as the correct type
with this you ll be able to call user.find but also do things like actor.find actor.all etc and have it scoped to only actors google rails single table inherited for more details and examples
of course you d need to declare your profile subclassing the same way you declared your user subclassing class profile activerecord base belongs_to user end class actorprofile profile end class dancerprofile profile end etc
628851
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
if you chars set is small enough you might not need more than 30 bits
how about something simple this assumes 32 bit int
it uses 5 bits per chars so the hash value only has 30 bits in it
630279
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 
the instrumented code is different to uninstrumented code
and this means you have to be slightly careful with the results - but most profiling do a reasonable job of drawing your focus to the important bits
i ve never had much luck with the sampling option - instrumentation has often been useful though
631115
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml	children	parent
Pattern(s): 
there are a lot of wrong ways in maven therefore one must stick to something that is known to work - like pom.xml hierarchy directory structure
i don t think you should do that. you could try defining a profile - let say a complete-build profile where you make sure that every module is compiled just once an another profile that adds the additional modules when you do a sub-build. but you better go the maven way - every project should include as modules only directories from its own directory only direct children
maven has some non-written implicit assumptions like - always inherit submodules from the pom.xml in the parent directory the inheritance tree must match your directory tree otherwise some plugins won t work release plugin or some report plugins
631115
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
maven has some non-written implicit assumptions like - always inherit submodules from the pom.xml in the parent directory the inheritance tree must match your directory tree otherwise some plugins won t work release plugin or some report plugins
the short answer is - in maven you cannot have a module twice in your project hierarchy tree
there are a lot of wrong ways in maven therefore one must stick to something that is known to work - like pom.xml hierarchy directory structure
632342
des	aes	des	aes
Pattern(s): 
the money quote is tdes is slowly disappearing from use largely replaced by the advanced encryption standard aes . rc4 is honestly just not an acceptable option for any application where security is important
sorry - triple des is no longer considered best practices
aes is simply a better algorithm so if you can use it then you should
633408
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
marshalling is basically the same concept as serializing and unmarshalling is the same as deserializing
check this out this will give you a good explanation i think the most common use of the term serializable has to do with converting a binary object into an xml or other string representation so that it can be stored in a database file or sent across a network in a web service call
deserialization is the reverse process - converting an xml string back into an object
633410
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
deserialization is the reverse process turning a stream of bytes into an object in memory
serializable is the process of turning an object in memory into a stream of bytes so you can do stuff like store it on disk or send it over the network
deserialization is the reverse process turning a stream of bytes into an object in memory
633651
initializer	class-method
Pattern(s): 
even if you do not want use oo programming using abap objects is still a good idea since it provides some features that procedural programming does not
so here s what abap objects offers you over procedural abap better encapsulation support for multiple initializer better techniques for reusing code better interfaces an explicit event concept there are only two purposes for which procedural abap is found essential encapsulation of classic screens in function modules
when you want to make functions available to other systems but are not able to make class-method available externally using xi server proxies
635507
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
my guess is that your web server is set to send certain header values based on directory
it s the only image being read from the articles image folder the rest come from the images images folder it s also the only image on the page which has a content-type at all
and it s also the only image not cached
636369
webkit	gecko
Pattern(s): 
this would require you to write some c++ code
as far as i know the gtk webkit port is not available on windows yet and still appears to be undergoing a lot of change
for an example of a cross-platform gecko embedding solution check out miro . miro is python and they ve written just a couple of c++ classes to embed gecko on windows while using gtkmozembed on linux
636468
debian	linux
Pattern(s): 
os upgrades always have the potential for subtle bugs whether it s windows linux or anything else
debian has got better than it used to be in this regard
dist-upgrade doesn t hose the machine nearly as often as it used to back in the day
637883
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
this is where you would plug cargo start stop goals
if you are using ant you can use cargo s ant task
another option based on the maven is described in the mavan jetty plugin configuration guide
638022
strftime	strtotime
Pattern(s): 
strtotime is a good start which yields a unix timestamp
you can format that one using strftime then

638355
width	text-align
Pattern(s): 
the best thing to do is to apply a specific width to the label that is greater than the width of the content - this will give you the results you want
label is an inline element so its width is equal to the width of the text it contains
the browser is actually displaying the label with text-align center but since the label is only as wide as the text you don t notice
638446
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
Pattern(s): 
especially since you can give tcp the same sort of latency as udp by disabling the nagle algorithm for example if you re transmitting real-time sensor data and you re not worried about congesting the network with lot s of small packets
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp
this is the case when doing lots of small writes relative to the mtu size
639135
apache	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
for this you d be happiest with a mod_wsgi engine
apache certainly does this
ngingnx and lighttpd might also work
640964
django	turbogears
Pattern(s): 
differences django uses its own handlers for http routing templating and persistence
django also has stellar documentation and an established community
turbogears defaults to best-of-breed libraries which apparently are paste object dispatching genshi and sqlalchemy
642160
webkit	gecko	border-color	height
Pattern(s): 
so if the image is 200x200 and you want a 2px border you ll probably have to make the div 196x196 since the box model dictates that the border width is added to the width height dimensions
gecko and webkit support setting rgba as a border-color property so you could potentially set border-color rgba 255 255 255 0.42
..and have a border that is semi-transparent
643018
loops	if-statement
Pattern(s): 
this is also one of the reasons why a call to a virtual function or a function-pointer-call is not that worse as many assume
also note that inside a loops is not necessarily very expensive
modern cpu assumes upon first visit of an if-statement that the if-body is to be taken or said the other way it also assumes a loop-body to be taken multiple times
643936
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
only type conversions to integral or enumeration types can be used
note that integral is another term for int but is not the same as int
chars for example has int integral type but is not the int type obviously
644490
viewdidload	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 
instead of viewdidload try putting that code in viewwillappear which gets called every time the view will show on the screen
viewdidload is only called once unless the view is released and needs to be reloaded
this occurs usually only when the view controller receives a low memory warning
646388
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
also not all virtualization solutions perform the same in different areas
vmware is great for stability and mobility of vm images but you might want to try some other solutions if you have the time
i ve found that better disk io performance gives me a better overall experience so i traded the better cpu performance and overall stability unfortunately of vmware server for the better io performance of virtualbox
646805
ienumerable	ienumerator
Pattern(s): 
and even though i would say they were first class in c# 1 i could see why someone might disagree
a similar case might be made for ienumerable
in c# 1.0 it was supported by foreach but the foreach loop wouldn t dispose of the ienumerator at the end
647519
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
Pattern(s): 
when pushing a new view a uinavigationcontroller will inject references to itself and to a uinavigationitem containing metadata about the navigation back button with the title of the view behind it etc...
generally you want to initialize your uinavigationcontroller with interface builder using the nib name field to specify the root view controller the first view to appear which should not have a back button
the equivalent in code roughly looks like this then when you need to push a new view controller probably in your didselectrowatindexpath delegate method in your rootcontroller notice that you didn t have to create the self.navigationcontroller property it is already defined in uiviewcontroller and will be injected with the right reference depending on the current state of the navigation
648017
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
the other point is that chars in c++ are integral datatypes
they can be treated as int with no casting required. i can do and the compiler won t complain
it takes w as an integer value and assumes that this is an address
649277
3des	aes
Pattern(s): 
but it is slow especially in software des was designed for efficient hardware implementation but it sucks in software
and 3des sucks three times as much
aes is the successor of des as standard symmetric encryption algorithm for us federal organizations and as standard for pretty much everybody else too
649402
portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 
what i really want is a 15.4 or 16 laptop with a portrait screen - these should still be wide enough to package a full-size keyboard into the base - a flybook-style pivot arm would be nice but isn t required
if you re working mostly with text as most programmers or other technical folks do or even documents then portrait mode is much more valuable
in fact the general trend in displays is all the wrong direction aspect ratios are squishing landscape displays to a mail slot to better fit the format of movies
649736
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
but i ultimately went with vim because i find the chord-input model that emacs uses to put unnecessary strain on my fingers
i use vim mostly for the input model
once you have become proficient in the input model going back to an editor where you are forced to use a mouse feels clumsy and ultimately at least to me irritating
650721
realloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 
if size is 0 either a null pointer or a unique pointer that can be successfully passed to free is returned
if there is not enough available memory realloc returns a null pointer and sets errno to enomem
re-alloc will work like malloc when you pass in null if ptr is a null pointer realloc behaves like malloc for the specified size
651900
datamapper	activerecord
Pattern(s): 
you can also replace activerecord with another orm that is more flexible
datamapper is a drop-in replacement that seems to have some traction

653565
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
a properties represents one or two units of code that are executed to retrieve or set a value of the specified type
the use of these accessor methods is syntactically hidden by using a member that appears to behave like a field in that it can appear on either side of an assignment operation

654866
move	drag
Pattern(s): 
if you right click and drag drop your svn folder when you release the mouse button you will be prompted by a menu including these entries svn export to here svn export all to here the latter also copies files not placed under svn control
this right click trick can also be used for dragging files and folders around within a repository simultaneously with editing the working copy to achieve move and copies that are otherwise tricky

655110
post	get
Pattern(s): 
you can do that in 2 ways either use linker commands or pragmas to make sure things are aligned or add a special case for the extra byte at the front of an unaligned buffer
not sure exactly what the question is - i think that post has the right solution. as you stated the issue is that the standard memcpy routine reads a byte at a time which does not work correctly for memory mapped hardware registers
that is a limitation of the processor - there s simply no way to get a valid value reading a byte at at time
655610
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 
there are several ways you can represent these in memory depending on how big the table will get
the mostly-likely fit for the by-name lookup is a dictionary the range is trickier
for that you will probably want to store either just the minimum or the maximum item depending on how your range works
656063
cos	atan2	cos	sin
Pattern(s): 
instead just use atan2 atan2 returns the full range of angles from -pi to +pi and handles the edge cases appropriately
this probably won t affect you since you re just taking the sin cos of the resulting angle
you re doing so in a very inefficient manner however -- you re calling anglebetweenpoints 8
656559
keystore	jks
Pattern(s): 
bash keytool -keystore foo.jks -genkeypair -alias foo -dname cn foo.example.com l melbourne st victoria c au enter keystore password re-enter new password enter key password for return if same as keystore password bash keytool -keystore foo.jks -exportcert -alias foo | openssl x509 -inform der -text enter keystore password asdasd certificate data version 3 0x2 serial number 1237334757 0x49c03ae5 signature algorithm dsawithsha1 issuer c au st victoria l melbourne cn foo.example.com validity not before mar 18 00 05 57 2009 gmt not after jun 16 00 05 57 2009 gmt subject c au st victoria l melbourne cn foo.example.com subject public key info public key algorithm dsaencryption dsa public key pub 00 e2 66 5c e0 2e da e0 6b a6 aa 97 64 59 14 7e a6 2e 5a 45 f9 2f b5 2d f4 34 27 e6 53 c7 bash keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore foo.jks -destkeystore foo.p12 -srcstoretype jks -deststoretype pkcs12 enter destination keystore password re-enter new password enter source keystore password entry for alias foo successfully imported. import command completed 1 entries successfully imported 0 entries failed or cancelled bash openssl pkcs12 -in foo.p12 -out foo.pem enter import password mac verified ok enter pem pass phrase verifying - enter pem pass phrase bash openssl x509 -text -in foo.pem certificate data version 3 0x2 serial number 1237334757 0x49c03ae5 signature algorithm dsawithsha1 issuer c au st victoria l melbourne cn foo.example.com validity not before mar 18 00 05 57 2009 gmt not after jun 16 00 05 57 2009 gmt subject c au st victoria l melbourne cn foo.example.com subject public key info public key algorithm dsaencryption dsa public key pub 00 e2 66 5c e0 2e da e0 6b a6 aa 97 64 59 14 7e a6 2e 5a 45 f9 2f b5 2d f4 34 27 e6 53 c7 bash openssl dsa -text -in foo.pem read dsa key enter pem pass phrase private-key 1024 bit priv 00 8f b1 af 55 63 92 7c d2 0f e6 f3 a2 f5 ff 1a 7a fe 8c 39 dd pub 00 e2 66 5c e0 2e da e0 6b a6 aa 97 64 59 14 7e a6 2e 5a 45 f9 2f b5 2d f4 34 27 e6 53 c7 you end up with foo.jks - keystore in java format
foo.p12 - keystore in pkcs#12 format
foo.pem - all keys and certs from keystore in pem format
657574
post	put	post	put
Pattern(s): 
and only put is supposed to be idempotent that is to say you should be able to the same operation again and again with the same result
if you posted repeatedly i d expect to republish something and create a new version on the server for every post
and the above are only recommendations for how put post are implemented
657815
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 
here is the bug report for google-chrome which has the same problem as firefox
i don t know about opera but i heard that they use some heuristics for a saner automatic scaling

658007
set	bag	set	bag
Pattern(s): 
we have a number of web services that have to be consumable by this sort of mixed bag of clients and whilst i d love to make life simple for us we have to dumb down a bit purely to ensure maximum interoperability
if you absolutely know for sure what your end-user client technology is for example pure .net and java where the feature set is probably the richest then by all means go ahead and take advantage of strongly typed interfaces where available
but if your client base is a mixed bag of perl php asp python etc then i d keep life simple and accessible for these folks
659658
abstract-class	superclass
Pattern(s): 
mine add a setup method to each handler class that adds itself or a new class instance to the dictionary
explaining a bit make an abstract-class that has a static dict and methods to register an instance with a selector string
on each subclass the setup method registers itself with the superclass dict the factory method is little more than a dictionary read
660854
singleton	facade
Pattern(s): 
results are unpredictable otherwise
i would say that creating a singleton is actually the only viable idea
assuming that code inside this black box is known to use static fields it is absolutely unsafe to create two instances of this facade
660920
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
it certainly wasn t because you detected a bottleneck
negating a number is a very simple operation in terms of cpu hardware
i m not aware of a processors that takes any longer to do negation than to do any bitwise operation - and that includes some 30 year old processors
661568
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
learn how to use it using lexical binding
this style of programming does not work in plain emacs lisp
emacs lisp uses dynamic binding and languages like scheme and common lisp are using lexical binding
661964
richfaces	icefaces	richfaces	tomahawk
Pattern(s): 
icefaces is not an implementation but a component library
other libraries exist such as richfaces myfaces tomahawk and so on
you can have a look here for the differences between components libraries
662414
spaces	linefeed
Pattern(s): 
then you can ltrim normally and replace the special character with 0 s again
instead of a spaces replace the 0 s with a rare whitespace character that shouldn t normally be in the column s text
a linefeed is probably good enough for a column like this
665042
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
you can find loads of comparisons tween these 2 all over the web
postgresql has better foreign key support better referential integrity transactions views subselects etc
but that doesn t mean mysql doesn t have its place
668515
super	abstract
Pattern(s): 
if you look at the second mapping document i posted it shows the super class and the sub class
the super class s discriminator is the objecttype column
i also map this as a property to the abstract class objectinrole
669298
post	get
Pattern(s): 
w3c http standard says that get is idempotent the same url get executed multiple times should always result in same response and consequently can be cached along the way while post is not and must reach the url target
response of an openid html form post or saml html form post should not be cached
it must reach the target in order to initiate the authenticated session
669888
hash	salt	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
cryptographic salt is used in password-based key derivation algorithms
storing a hash password for authentication is a special case of this function
salt causes the same password to yield different hashes and thwarts dictionary attacks where a hacker has pre-computed hash values for common passwords and built a reverse-lookup index so that they can quickly discover a password for a given hash
670524
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
if an application can t even keep track of its installation path through the registry then it s probably not worth installing in the first place
b. i m assuming they put 32-bit applications into an x86 folder because it s not a 32 bit os that is old stuff goes here
if 64bit is a step forward then why would you put the legacy software in what will continue to be the standard installation folder
671250
put	get
Pattern(s): 
so it really uses only get and post and on server it reads this hidden field and reacts on it
i ve heard that delete and put is not fully supported in all browsers i didn t check it
rails is doing workaround - it is sending post with a hidden field containing real method
671451
config	ini
Pattern(s): 
config options could be stored in the registry ini file or anyother storage option
after the config changes all you need to do is make sure you restart your service so it can reload it s new settings

672257
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
thanks to bobbyshaftoe for pointing that out
awt is said to be heavyweight because basically each awt component is a native platform component
awt is implemented on top of the platform s native gui toolkit. this also explains why awt was pretty limited compared to swing
673121
gstring	xmlslurper
Pattern(s): 
and then after using xmlslurper on the xml you can substitute values in the xml like this
the xml file will not return a gstring since the gstring is constructed by the groovy compiler at compile time
when you parse the xml file you get a string not a compiled groovy executable
674037
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
salt is a base64-encoded random salt
and hash password is a base64-encoded hash
if you need to migrate hashes you can intercept people with an old password format and make them change their password the next time they log in
674435
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
that raises the problem of not delaying the refired event
my suggestion would be to instead fire an event object that inherited from mouseevent instead of a simple clone
the mouseevent is very simple to copy it only has a few properties
674725
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
in each loops check condition execute loop-block execute post-loop-block repeat from 1
syntax of for-loop is for pre-block
condition
675019
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 

i learned that firefox out-of-the-box supports multiple selection ranges in a web page that contains multiple frames hell firefox even supports multiple selections on a single frame
try click-drag then ctrl-click-drag on a separate piece of text. in safari i noticed immediately that when i click on an html button the current user text selection goes away as if clicking on the button repositioned the text caret works for me in safari 3.2.1 on windows
675708
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
you should be worried about hash to password lookup tables rainbow or otherwise
onebyone.livejournal.com the attacker has rainbow tables consisting not of the hash of dictionary words but of the state of the hash computation just before finalising the hash calculation
it could then be cheaper to brute-force a password file entry with postfix salt than prefix salt for each dictionary word in turn you would load the state add the salt bytes into the hash and then finalise it
676595
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
then you clear the list the element inside is destroyed and free is called
then a variable is destroyed and free is called again for the same address which leads to segmentation fault
you need a copy constructor for deep copying class temp variables which would malloc another buffer and copy data
676786
expression-blend	silverlight
Pattern(s): 
the xaml designer editor in vs2008 is very limited in what it offers for xaml editing whatever the version of silverlight being really just a rendering engine at the moment
expression-blend is the visual editor of choice for now - there are 3rd party editors available such as xamlcruncher and kaxaml but they don t really support xaml with code-behind classes
additionally the blend 3 preview that was released to support sl3 seems to have a few improvements which address previously inferior experience of directly editing xaml in blend notably intellisense
677315
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if you want different behaviour in a generic class depending on the parameterised type you have pass an object of that type in and use a virtual method or pass in the class for the type and use reflection
unlike c++ templates java generics work by type erasure so it only generates one class for all values of t and translates all references to type t in this class to the super type of t in this case superclass then uses virtual dispatch to provide the variance for calls to object methods and static dispatch to calls to static methods
so when you do the compiler does not make a global replace of t with subclassing in dummy
677839
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
update lieven has now clarified his request to say that he was in fact asking whether an int or an nchar field would be better as an index so my original take on this question was correct
to add to my answer lieven it is almost always better to have an int as your pk
the exception is when there is a natural key that can be captured as a short chars string in an accounting system where item entries are chars strings
678590
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 
nearly all apps have only one window. other than that walking up the view hierarchy is perfectly legitimate
edit i just noticed that uiview has a window property that will get you straight to the view s window so you don t need to walk the hierarchy after all
as for bad things happening i can t really think of any unless some other part of the app decides to add or delete the key window s direct subviews
679196
margin	height
Pattern(s): 
you would have to make sure the outer div was the same width height as the inner input though perhaps by floating it left to activate the shrink-to-fit behaviour that comes with floats
you would also need to account for the top margin on the button and any padding on it
however as the button in question has a fixed-pixel on-page size you don t really need to use nested backgrounds at all
679875
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
a href javascript function ... that said all the other reasons for using post over get apply crawlers and the like
post is not a protection from all malicious behavior as some people have implied
malicious users can still create links that contain javascript to do the post and cause the same cross-site scripting problems as with get
680613
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss
while quicksort is often a better choice than merge sort there are definitely times when merge sort is thereotically a better choice
the most obvious time is when it s extremely important that your algorithm run faster than o n 2
680613
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
the most obvious time is when it s extremely important that your algorithm run faster than o n 2
quicksort is usually faster than this but given the theoretical worst possible input it could run in o n 2 which is worse than the worst possible merge sort
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss
680664
goto	break
Pattern(s): 
switch switch is usually more compact than lots of nested if else and therefore more readable if you omit the break between two switch cases you can fall through to the next case in many c-like languages
with if else you d need a goto which is not very nice to your readers .
if the language supports goto at all
680713
jasmine	intern
Pattern(s): 
they recommend karma browserstack-runner or intern
jasmine this is a behavior-driven framework as stated in quote below that might interest developers familiar with ruby or ruby on rails
the syntax is based on rspec that are used for testing in rails projects
683902
jar	war
Pattern(s): 
because it sounds like you have tampered with a signed archive and normally the war itself is unsigned
if you alter a signed jar file the signature is invalidated
either re-sign the code with your code-signing key or remove the invalidated signature information from the meta-inf
684807
freebsd	linux
Pattern(s): 
the lastest java binaries perform better on my ubuntu than on xp netbeans performs better as ide also
freebsd is an awesome platform for development
if you look at the kernel source for example it s so clean and understandable in comparison with the mess at linux
685258
glut	sdl
Pattern(s): 
if you are working on an opengl application which needs some native gui as well for example a 3d modeler you may be more interested in using wxwidgets or as batbrat suggested qt
glut is rather simplistic for serious game development
sdl is used by numerous commercial game porting companies
685258
glut	sdl	glut	sdl
Pattern(s): 
sdl is used by numerous commercial game porting companies
glut happens to be good for studying opengl and for simple demos
something like sdl is quite good for actual games
686957
invokerequired	begininvoke
Pattern(s): 
begininvoke involves taking several locks adding delegates to an invoke queue and potentially a marshal between threads
this code is much more expensive relative to the actual invokerequired call likely an order of magnitude or 2
you would need a great deal more calls where invokerequired returns true before you would see any gain by just going straight to beigninvoke
687006
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql does not support transactional database definition changes
rails 2.2 includes transactional migrations for postgresql
rails 2.3 includes transactional migrations for sqlite
691470
textblock	itemscontrol
Pattern(s): 
that container an instance of contentpresenter for a plain old itemscontrol wraps the textblock and is a direct child of the grid
therefore the grid never even sees the column and row properties on the textblock because it s looking instead at the container
you can solve this by setting an itemcontainerstyle that binds the appropriate properties for the container
692804
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
i haven t looked up what each cpuid means but i assume the .5 are for pentium 4 which ran some components of the chip at double speed allowing it to do things in half cycles i don t really see what you plan to use this information for however but if you know the exact cpu family the code is running on then adding up the latency tells you the minimum number of cycles required to execute this sequence of instructions
what the other answers say about it being impossible to accurately predict the performance of code running on a modern cpu is true but that doesn t mean the latencies are unknown or that knowing them is useless
the exact latencies for intels and amd s processors are listed in agner fog s instruction tables
694450
webclient	webrequest
Pattern(s): 
you d need to add a similar override for getwebresponse webrequest request iasyncresult result too if you were using the async stuff
if i understand the question it s much easier than people are saying - if you want to let webclient do all the nuts and bolts of the request including the redirection but then get the actual response uri at the end you can subclass webclient like this just use mywebclient everywhere you would have used webclient
after you ve made whatever webclient call you needed to do then you can just use responseuri to get the actual redirected uri
694688
pyexcelerator	xlrd	pyexcelerator	xlrd
Pattern(s): 
dates don t come out as floats and the full story on excel dates is in the xlrd documentation
pyexcelerator is abandonware mdash
xlrd and xlwt are alive and well
695552
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
for getting it up and running quickly mariadb the successor to mysql is probably your best bet
if you foresee it growing much beyond where it is now you might as well put it in postgresql since that s where it will need to go eventually anyway -

695838
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
this lets clients upgrade downgrade specific requests instead of every single one
of course that granularity of versioning needs to be baked in at the start and could severely complicate the server-side code
most people just use the url used the access the servers
696496
tunnel	packets
Pattern(s): 
in case of ssh tunnel tcp ip packets are sent inside an ssh connection to another host which then decides how to treat those packets usually forward to internal network
the wikipedia article about tunnel is helpful but to understand it better you should have a basic idea how encapsulation and osi model work

696666
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
this means that any readily available dictionary is useless since the likelyhood of it containing the hash for that text is a lot less than the likelihood of it containing the hash for dog this likelihood becomes even lower if the salt is a random alphanumeric string
it relies on the fact that a hash is a one way function
in other words its very easy to convert a password into a hash but very difficult to do the opposite
697819
des	aes	des	aes
Pattern(s): 
des is slow and now considered obsolete aes is the replacement for it . rc4 sucks don t use it
it s a stream cipher but you can use a block cipher instead just pad the final block of data google pkcs#5 padding scheme . lately i ve only seen des being used in embedded devices firmware because the implementation is simple and it uses very little memory
even in javame you can use aes
699126
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
you have to tell ant exactly where your source is where you want the resulting bytecode to be stored and how to package this all into a jar file
while there are some recent developments that help make ant less procedural a developer s experience with ant is in coding a procedural language written in xml
contrast the previous ant example with a maven example
699126
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
this is true
if you have a bunch of smart people using ant + antlibs + ivy you ll end up with a well designed build that works
even though i m very much convinced that maven makes sense i d happily use ant + ivy with a project team that had a very sharp build engineer
699266
boost	stl	inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
also you could easily make the decision to use boost function to supply the comparison with std map if you needed it to be polymorphic
because boost function is polymorphic it cannot be inline
the design of the stl is aimed at maximum potential for the compiler to do inlining of code which is easy on expanded templates
699350
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 
that can be circumvented but i d rather advise to use the replacing directly on commas dots
you can use afterwards which will replace all spaces with nothing
but you can also do that with commas but keep in mind that a the delimiter changes it s a dot for me not a comma
701777
imperative	declarative
Pattern(s): 
this is called imperative programming
while imperative code works great for your normal client code it s backwards when you re working with a database
instead you want to start using declarative programming and think in terms a sets you write some code that declares to the database the set of records you need returned
701778
qtkit	quicktime
Pattern(s): 
qtkit the objective-c api for quicktime is new with leopard os x 10.5 and is very good
you ll likely want to start with qtkit s capture api
since you re working with c++ you ll also want to learn about objective-c++ for building the connection between qtkit and your code
703271
django	turbogears
Pattern(s): 
but for custom setups that need to be both fast and aren t particularly suited to the defaults provided by django or turbogears it s a great solution
django
i think django is a very nice tigtly integrated system for developing websites
706758
put	get	filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 
in this case it would be a and b resulting in this ends up ordering the results consistently between calls when the count of the items between grouping is not unique assuming the same set of data
i would use a sub-query to get the values of the function into the result and then the row_number ranking function like so if you wanted only a certain section of results say for paging then you would need another subquery and then filtering on the row number note that in this query you could put row_number anywhere in the select list since you are no longer reliant on using the order by 1 syntax for the order by statement
there is a subtle issue here when calling this query multiple times
707543
wxpython	pyqt
Pattern(s): 
but qt is far superior to wx
seems your complains are about wxpython not about python itself
but both wxpython and pyqt are just python bindings to a c c++ respectively library it s just as conceptually low level as the originals
708639
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
serializable and deserialization is not the simplest problem you can work on
my advice would be investing in learning libraries boost serializable and using them
they have already worked out many of the problems you will face at one time or another
709950
createfile	getlasterror
Pattern(s): 
to see if the file is in use if you get a valid file handle then you know the file does not have conflicting sharing permissions with a process that already has this file open
if you specify no sharing access 0 to the dwsharemode parameter of the createfile call then you will not get a file handle if any other process is currently using that file in any way
getlasterror in this case would return error_sharing_violation 32 to see if there is a security problem with accessing the file to see if there is a permissions problem accessing that file the createfile call will also fail but with a different getlasterror
711712
super	self
Pattern(s): 
parent is the pointer from a class to its superclass which method lookup follows
not sure why they have super and parent mean the same thing typical confusion super is the receiver not the parent of its class
just like self is not the receiver s class
711969
exponent	modulo
Pattern(s): 
this form includes the two secret numbers often denoted p and q from which the totient is computed
with totient and the private exponent the public exponent is quickly computed
in any case most rsa key pairs use 65537 as the public exponent and the modulo is always carried as part of the private key
713091
indesign	framemaker
Pattern(s): 
if you need very fine control over typography you re better off with tex or a proprietary tool like framemaker or indesign
beware indesign currently has weak xml support imo

713223
octal	hex	octal	decimal
Pattern(s): 
the hexadecimal or decimal or octal is just the representation of that value in the source code
once stored they re all the same value the last being octal so checking for a particular value is the same code
a value won t know if it s been represented as hex dec oct
714864
tao	jacorb	tao	jacorb
Pattern(s): 
we use remedy it for our support needs both tao and jacorb
tao is definitely the most commercially used open source c++ orb
it works very well with jacorb as a java orb but you can use the jdk orb too
715043
ssl	https	ssl	ntlm
Pattern(s): 
secondly it you need to use https in all cases to make it secure after that you got basic auth similar stuff such as digest and ntlm auth
firstly http auth is secure over ssl other than the fact that you can t implement a true logout functionality
user need to close their browser which is pretty bad
715574
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception	runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
Pattern(s): 
below exception there is runtimeexception also an unchecked-exception
the way that the designers of java intended exceptions to be used is exception things that can go wrong error low level things that can go wrong and a program cannot recover from runtimeexception programmer errors like going past the end of an array or calling a method on null
the idea behind not having to catch unchecked-exception is that they indicate failures vm level or programmer that either you cannot handle vm error or should not exist in a properly debugged program programmer mistake
716516
groovy	gpath	jruby	mri
Pattern(s): 
but groovy as a language has made huge strides and is a pleasure to work with
thanks to the improvements made in groovy 1.6 grails is quite a bit snappier than jruby on rails and you get amazingly good xml support via gpath
there s a lot of nice features you get by being on the jvm like concurrency and tons of threadsafe code but without having to muck about with java a language i don t much care for so i m having a really hard time of convincing myself to use anything on mri
717812
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
in c++ this is rather different as the length of a string is discovered by reading up until the first null chars
because of the way memory usage works in the clr you can essentially consider that getting the length property of a string is just like retrieving an int variable
the performance cost here is going to be absolutely minimal if that s what you re considering
718492
copying	overwrite
Pattern(s): 
also your program might crash with a different length if it ran for a longer time if something less important was being overwrite
you re copying to the stack so it s dependent on what the compiler has placed on the stack for how much extra data will be required to crash your program
some compilers might produce code that will crash with only a single byte over the buffer size - it s undefined what the behaviour is
718586
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
it needs to be the right expression though - if you do and cast c a double the multiplication will be done with double arithmetic but a b might still be done as integers. here s the listing changed appropriately to make sure double arithmetic is used everywhere it should be
if they re both int then the lines initializing angx and angy will be evaluated using int arithmetic
this can be fixed by casting one of the operands the fovy and fovx variables are already double though this isn t the problem
718697
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
looking at things at a lower level a pointer is typically implemented as an unsigned integer
the size of the integer is large enough to hold the address of any memory location
the only way for a pointer to overflow is if you exceed the address space and that is impossible to do while conforming to the c standard
719228
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
it is free to create and distribute compiled plt scheme code on any platform
edit you asked for any lisp dialect
edit 2 you said that clojure is an option
719332
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
forcing the app to run in emulated x86 mode instead should do the trick
if the other machines you used to run the program were using vista x86 it s likely that there s a pinvoke in your code that s causing the issue. you may want to try setting the compiler target architecture to x86 to force your program to run in wow64 on the x64 vista. by default visual studio uses settings building assemblies in architecture-agnostic ways
that means that when you try to run a .net program on a 64bit system it should be run hosted by a native x64 version of the clr
721444
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
that s not generally considered good practice for authentication systems any more
if it s two-way it s not really a hash
it s encryption and from the sounds of things this is really more of a salt or cypher not real encryption. a hash is one-way by definition
722238
sudoers	visudo
Pattern(s): 
both open a can of worms and since you are a newbie given the question you asked you are very likely to miss some of small details that would create potential problems
you can t just sudo like that you need to setup passwordless sudo first in etc sudoers file
this can be done with visudo command for example
722238
sudoers	visudo
Pattern(s): 
this can be done with visudo command for example
make sure you set up privileges in sudoers file in such way to constrain the apache user to that single command you wish to run your shell script
even then it poses a security risk because anyone could create a php script and run your shell script in turn
724327
int	chars	int	double
Pattern(s): 
in that memory now you can store either an int or a double or a chars
if you store an int and then store a double the int is gone forever
there are two major uses for unions
724890
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
absolutely
postgresql has very good documentation and community
there are also lot of ppl who have experience with mysql and postgresql
724903
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
if you just use basic sql then you will hardly notice any difference
postgresql has some nice features like generate_series custom aggregate functions arrays etc which can ease your life greatly if you take some time to learn them
on the other hand it lacks some features of mysql like using and assigning session variables in queries force index etc. which is quite annoying if you are used to these features
728038
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
your public methods are a contract with users of your class foo saying that you can always call those methods on foo
subclassing foo means that you re saying that a subclass bar is always acceptable to use where a foo could be used
in particular it means you inherited not necessarily foo s implementation you can override that or foo may be abstract and give no particular implementation for a method
728595
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
each of these sites provide localized searchable events
rss provides you with a few standardized formats instead of having to all the malformed html that makes up the web.
there are opensource libraries like rome java that may help with the consumption of rss feed
728716
width	height
Pattern(s): 
to get a real figure fit the string into a frame that is taller than the one you need - then you ll get a height that is greater than your actual height
note my fudge in this subtracting 15 from the width
this might be something to do with my views i have one within another so you might not need it
729163
realloc	memmove
Pattern(s): 
simply rearranging pointers frags i frags i+1 or using memmove is easier quicker and stops you wasting memory though
your realloc is likely failing because you re not reserving a byte for the trailing nul 0 character in strings -- adding a +1 to your realloc size will fix that bug
the specific error you re getting is likely because one of your strings is length 0 and realloc foo 0 simply gives you that error on your system or because you re writing the trailing 0 in unallocated memory and overwriting something else important causing corruption
729994
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 
versus
the setinterval makes it easier to cancel future execution of your code
if you use settimeout you must keep track of the timer id in case you wish to cancel it later on
730843
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
solution ..._support ...webproject copy the dll s into here and then reference the dll from this directory this is a nicer solution then checking in the bin
one solution if i understand correctly is create a support folder for the dlls you wish to reference in your project we use _support here so that is goes to the top of the tree in the solution folder
solution ..._support ...webproject copy the dll s into here and then reference the dll from this directory this is a nicer solution then checking in the bin
730959
portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 
in my case i am using didrotatefrominterfaceorientation to check if the last orientation was portrait and if so load the view i want displayed in landscape mode
i then implemented the same methods in the viewcontroller i am loading and it is responsible for detecting when the orientation changes back to portrait and dismissing itself from the view stack
hope that helps a little
732574
django	web.py	django	web2py	django	turbogears
Pattern(s): 
pylons and turbogears offer enormous flexibility and focus on best of breed components web2py appears to have a very cool dal orm that i m itching to dig into and web.py and werkzeug amongst others are minimalistic and don t try to dictate how you should build your app
and if you re sticking with django definitely check out the pinax project - it might help kickstart your development efforts

733075
profiler	gprof
Pattern(s): 
it might interest you to know that an execution profiler like gprof does exactly what you re asking about - it tracks the amount of time spent executing each function
a profiler basically works by recording the instruction pointer ip the address of the currently executing instruction every 10ms or so
after the program is done running you invoke a postprocessor that examines the list of ips and the program and converts those addresses into function names
734130
forth	smalltalk
Pattern(s): 
i m becoming more enamored with this usage which i think hearkens back to smalltalk s idioms a little
i wobble back and forth on using this
i think that it depends on the ratio of c++ to objective c in my projects at any given time
735449
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
if ever
in any case if your hash is not cryptic secure enough it can simply be guessed from the data which can probably be sniffed too
you should probably use some kind of random salt per session per user per time-frame... to make sure this is as hard to guess as can be
735964
multiplying	subtract
Pattern(s): 
the allowed range for initial n is -64 to +63. here s what the function does for positive n if n is in 0..63 initial range the function call adds 64 mapping n to the range 64..127 intermediate range if n is in 64..127 intermediate range the function subtract n from 64 mapping n to the range 0..-63 for negative n the function uses the intermediate range -65..-128
using complex numbers you can effectively divide the task of negating a number into two steps multiplying n by i and you get n i which is n rotated 90 counter-clockwise multiplying again by i and you get -n the great thing is that you don t need any special handling code
just multiplying by i does the job
736836
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
whatever you do writes may be delayed by contention in the database
if your application needs to not block when it s writing audit records to the database you should make the audit writing asynchronous and keep your own queue of audit data on disc or in memory so you don t block the main worker thread process innodb may allow concurrent inserts but that doesn t mean they won t be blocked by contention for resources or internal locks for things like index pages
myisam allows one inserter and several readers concurrent inserts under the following circumstances the table has no holes in it there are no threads trying to do an update or delete if you have an append-only table which you recreate each day or create a new partition every day if you use 5.1 partitioning you may get away with this
737344
outputstream	bufferedinputstream
Pattern(s): 
bufferedinputstream is suitable for most text processing purposes
if you re doing something special like trying to serialize the fields of a class to a file you d want to use datainput outputstream as it offers greater control of the data at a binary level
hope that helps
741117
inherited	base-class	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
that is a fundamental problem which can be solved by just stating at the interface for a template or generics what properties a type parameter has to have
c# as far as i know it can constraint the parameter to implement an interface or inherited a base-class
it solves that on a type-level
742211
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
it s a plug-in replacement for malloc new and free
in fact free is a no-op so you can just remove those calls from your program
if instead you hand-optimize your program and manage a pool of memory as previously suggested you ll end up doing a lot of the work that the cgc already does for you
742217
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
safari also has fairly good tools built-in i m using the safari 4 beta at present though i find it s easier to navigate around firebug
firebug is a good solution for firefox
you can browse a page s html javascript dom network activity etc
742752
accessor	properties	accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
if you choose to use get set accessor instead of normal properties you will be creating a library which has a very different appearance than what every other programmer is expecting
using get set accessor will only increase the chances that you create code which is incompatible with various tools
for instance there are many tools out there which special case properties and fields and provide special features for them
743033
mbunit	nunit
Pattern(s): 
nunit is the grandaddy of the .net testing frameworks and it works very well
there are others around though such as mbunit and xunit
documentation no version of visual studio has a good story for documentation
743106
post	get
Pattern(s): 
in the code above you are creating and adding the component in the loadcontent function of game.cs which occurs after initialize
verify that the initialize function in your editor class is calling the base initialize function check out this blog post by nick gravelyn for more information
particularly relevant to your question in his post nick writes that first you ll get a call to initialize
744516
joomla	typo3
Pattern(s): 
the more extensions you use at the same time the harder maintenance of hacked code will be
joomla pros and cons in general joomla is definitely one of the best cms but it always depends on your needs what tools you use
two websites can help with the choice greatly cms overviews opensourcecms a page where you can live-test over a 100 open source cms and similar software cmsmatrix basically an extremely large feature comparison matrix of almost 1000 a thousend yes cms and similar software in all price ranges my own experience story there was a time when typo3 was strong among free cms but that time is over the interface is clunky and complicated typo3 has fallen far behind in the race
744516
joomla	typo3
Pattern(s): 
two websites can help with the choice greatly cms overviews opensourcecms a page where you can live-test over a 100 open source cms and similar software cmsmatrix basically an extremely large feature comparison matrix of almost 1000 a thousend yes cms and similar software in all price ranges my own experience story there was a time when typo3 was strong among free cms but that time is over the interface is clunky and complicated typo3 has fallen far behind in the race
then there was a time when mambo became strong and later joomla split from mambo and became even stronger
but the code legacy of the joomla 1.0 series was strongly flawed and a new player quickly took the momentum drupal
744662
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
it is based on udp but is reliable
there actually is reliable udp it s called rudp and it was invented for plan 9
however there really is no point to this just use tcp
745211
vim	textmate	vim	textmate
Pattern(s): 
if you don t like vim textmate is a decent text editor
if you like vim adding onto it with fuzzyfilefinder and rails.vim plugins provides a really nice experience
if you don t like vim textmate is a decent text editor
745380
jsf	seam
Pattern(s): 
since the focus of your criteria seem to be the marketability of your skills i would suggest trying out seam and jsf via facelets
jsf is a well accepted standard and is actually enjoyable to use if you are using facelets
you can have slick ajax functionality via richfaces and ajax4jsf
745963
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
versioning 4 s parser was fairly forgiving when mixing implicit table joins with explicit left join clauses
versioning 5 is not so forgiving
so we took the opportunity to scour the app and upgrade all the join s to explicit join s
746513
ferret	sphinx
Pattern(s): 
you can watch the railscast about it in order to learn more
yes ferret has been very well known for corrupting indexes
i recommend switching over to another searching plugin like thinking sphinx
748597
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
however that practice is currently discouraged because significant additional code is required to reliably catch a stack overflow exception-handling and continue program execution
starting with the .net framework version 2.0 a stackoverflowexception object cannot be caught by a try-catch block and the corresponding process is terminated by default
consequently users are advised to write their code to detect and prevent a stack overflow
748779
webclient	httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 
i was doing some web scraping and started my own class to wrap httpwebrequest httpwebreponse
then i discovered webclient part way through
i finished it anyway because i needed functionality that webclient does not provide control of cookies and user agent
749610
qt-creator	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
qt-creator comes in two flavours a simple one which is open source and is licensed only to create open source software and a paying one which is licensed to create both oss and closed-source projects
qt-creator is just as portable between platforms as qt itself and uses the mingw compiler under ms windows and the gcc compiler under linux
generally speaking i found open source qt a polished piece of software which gives a much smoother and more pleasant user experience than kdevelop which tries so desperately to implement slews and slews of bells and whistles that it neglects to make simple things easy and reliable and it has few features and a much simpler interface than kdevelop perhaps the paying version also has a more complicated interface
749610
qt-creator	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
generally speaking i found open source qt a polished piece of software which gives a much smoother and more pleasant user experience than kdevelop which tries so desperately to implement slews and slews of bells and whistles that it neglects to make simple things easy and reliable and it has few features and a much simpler interface than kdevelop perhaps the paying version also has a more complicated interface
using the qt-creator exclusively allows you to easily make applications that run under linux and ms windows with no more than a recompile and which look the same on both platforms
kde on the other hand is linux-only
749686
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	md5	hash	salt	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
according to the code of set_password as the documentation describes the hash is the salt algorithm and password hash
according to the docs hashtype is either sha1 default md5 or crypt -- the algorithm used to perform a one-way hash of the password
salt is a random string used to salt the raw password to create the hash
750075
free	malloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 
if the requested size is zero then you get back whatever malloc 0 might return which is often usually a null pointer but might be a non-null pointer that can also be returned to free but which cannot legitimately be dereferenced
actually the last of those is equivalent to a call to free
read the specification of realloc very carefully and you will find it can allocate data anew or change the size of an allocation which especially if the new size is larger than the old might move the data around and it can release memory too
751439
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
just insert the following code into the file pom.xml in the build plugins section see the documentation
here is the answer it can be configured with maven
just insert the following code into the file pom.xml in the build plugins section see the documentation
751449
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 
and it would be worth something for the inventor. bisection has the same behavior
it takes roughly 10 bisection steps to cut the interval length by a factors of 1024 2 10 but only 20 steps will cut the interval by a factors of 2 20
log complexity does not always mean an algorithm is fast on all problems
751449
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 
log complexity does not always mean an algorithm is fast on all problems
the linear factors in front of the o log n may be large
so your algorithm may be terrible on small problems not becoming useful until the problem size is appreciably large that other algorithms die an exponential or polynomial death
752905
ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
thus you ll sometimes hear linux-based systems referred to as gnu linux .
ubuntu ships with the gnu version of find which is more featureful than mac os x s find which is of bsd lineage
in fact most of the ubuntu s user-land utilities are from the gnu project
753024
fink	macports
Pattern(s): 
i d add that there is nothing stopping you from installing gnu find from the findutils if you need it
if you use fink there is a findutils package
macports has it too
754381
tclientdataset	bde
Pattern(s): 
if it is the tquery failing this will mean adjusting the sql fewer fields fewer records or moving to a better database the bde is getting a little tired after all
the error might be from the tquery rather than the tclientdataset
when using a tquery it creates a temporary table and it might be this limit that you are hitting
754803
ceil	floor
Pattern(s): 
if floor is not granular enough you can use someweight someweight to adjust it to the granularity you want
and of course you can use ceil or round to do the same thing
the whole point is to collapse a bunch of nearby measurements to one measurement and then take the average of the collapsed values
754987
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
printf hi n
inaccurate test of code reachability because stdout is likely buffered
i d recommend fprintf stderr hi n
757162
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
i would decide for a table per subclassing mapping because.
it resamples the inherited hierarchy very good
there is no need for an artificial discriminator column
757911
bibtex	latex
Pattern(s): 
if you look at step 3 in this discussion you ll see the following the first run through latex generates an auxiliary file paper.aux containing information about citations and other types of references the bibliography style used and the name of the bibtex database
the second run through bibtex uses the information in the auxiliary file along with the data contained in the bibtex database to create a file paper.bbl
this file contains a thebibliography environment with bibitem entries formatted according to the bibliography style specified
758037
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
it s all about the contract of superclass and about subclassing implementing this contract
if your superclass has such method then not supporting this method is still ok with the contract
if it is not supported you probably should disable corresponding action in ui
758485
jsf	seam
Pattern(s): 
alternatively you could try springmvc which lots of people find easier to use
jsf can be tricky to get started with and is harder to learn than many java web frameworks
you might find it easier to use jsf with seam which simplifies much of how you work with jsf and replaces jsp with facelets which is a great improvement
763036
loops	while-loop
Pattern(s): 
loading the code into irb and evaluating producer should result in # thread 0x000000010afb58 dead and consumer in a sleeping thread take out the comments relating to producer s while-loop and you ll have a working infinite loops that produces the current time at 2 second intervals
as your code stands with the commented out while-statement in producer-loop the producer thread simply runs through loops once and exits
the consumer reads the one produced line from buf and then is left in a deadlock waiting for more lines that will never arrive
763288
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
from the online help for imnoise it internally converts the image to a 0 1 double number adds the gaussian noise then converts back to int output
so your blurred image should still be int probably uint8 elements
the help for fspecial says it will return a double precision output for psf
763934
valgrind	glibc
Pattern(s): 
and in conjunction with glibc n which puts extra checking on various string and memory functions
in the linux kernel there are many configuration switches under the kernel hacking menu config_debug_slab config_debug_pagealloc etc. which ensure that memory is allocated used and freed sanely config_debug_objects which checks that objects are used and freed orderly kmemcheck valgrind for the kernel config_prove_locking which analyzes for all possible deadlocks config_debug_preempt config_debug_mutexes config_debug_spinlock config_debug_spinlock_sleep etc. which warn on improper use of locking config_fault_injection co
which probabilistically cause failures of memory allocation and i o
764756
ienumerable	ilist
Pattern(s): 
ilist is an interface which abstracts list functionality count add remove indexer access away from the various concrete classes such as list bindinglist observablecollection etc
ienumerable provides only minimal iterable functionality
you can traverse the sequence but that s about it
766736
haskell	scheme
Pattern(s): 
functional languages such as standard ml and scheme do not restrict side effects but it is customary for programmers to avoid them
the functional language haskell restricts side effects with a static type system
only a function that produces a result of io type can have side effects
766929
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
honestly as a rule of thumb i prefer to attempt an upgrade in a development environment and deploy to a testing environment to see how much work it will be
the real reason i prefer to keep everything at the current versioning is this products are not usually kept up-to-date and when the particular versioning of the product is no longer supported the task of upgrading to the latest versioning tends to be quite time consuming and expensive
i agree and as such prefer to do a little work each time something can be upgrade rather than waiting and having to sort through everything later on
769001
int	double
Pattern(s): 
this would not be true for addyears because double has not enough precision to represent one tick if 1.0 equals one year
but if you look at the datetime class you see that the design respects that fact - addmonths and addyears have both int and not floating point arguments
to check this just execute the following code
769780
sortedset	insertion-order
Pattern(s): 
you can easily access the first and last items using first and last methods
a sortedset comes in handy every once in a while when you need to keep your collection both duplicate-free and ordered in a certain way
edit if you need a set whose elements are kept in insertion-order much like a list take a look at linkedhashset
770154
xapian	whoosh	xapian	whoosh
Pattern(s): 
an interesting pure python new kid on the block is whoosh although i ve heard nothing about how well it performs in production
xapian is a good option for python it s very fast and simple to get set up with
an interesting pure python new kid on the block is whoosh although i ve heard nothing about how well it performs in production
771037
hash	md5	hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
presidential election in a file with the md5 hash value 3d515dead7aa16560aba3e9df05cbc80
they then created twelve files all identical except for the candidate s name and an arbitrary number of spaces following that hash to that value
the md5 hash value is worthless as a checksum because too many different files give the same result
771794
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	bubble-sort
Pattern(s): 
so this comparer can be used with bubble-sort as well as with quicksort heapsort or any other sort algorithm
the built-in sort algorithm of list.sort is quicksort according to msdn

772162
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
also converting from mysql to postgresql on the pgsql wiki
you could try postgresql gotchas that contains the most common issues
generally the postgresql documentation is pretty good too so keep that under your pillow as well
772196
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
case sensitive text lack of insert ignore and replace explicit casting needed almost everywhere no backticks load data infile copy is close but not close enough change autoincrement to serial although bad form in mysql in postgresql an inner join without an on clause can t happen use cross join or the like can be crazy slow databases are encoded with character sets not tables you can have multiple databases with multiple schemas mysql really has just one database and multiple schema partitioning is different mysql interval vs
postgresql interval for time intervals implicit column renaming postgresql requires as cannot update multiple tables at the same time in postgresql postgresql functions are powerful
so there is no call proc
772245
vmware	esx
Pattern(s): 
vmware esx is the heavy for-pay solution the big brother of esxi and has all of the high-end goodies needed for a virtualized server environment including live migration of running machines from server to server yes you can move across hardware shared images shared filesystem etc
vmware workstation will do all of the above and more create whole-cloth straight file copies or delta-only which uses a parent image and only records changes clones of machines simulate an environment with multiple machines useful for client-server integration with visual studio debugger screen captures recordings import physical machines as images appliances ova s open virtual machines and also export a few other formats
vmware player allows you to deploy a single machine to someone else free of charge
774116
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
Pattern(s): 
argumentexception something is wrong with the argument
argumentnullexception argument is null
argumentoutofrangeexception i don t use this one much but a common use is indexing into a collection and giving an index which is to large
775268
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
if the public facing apache is left only to serve static content then consider replacing it with something lightweight such as nginx or lighttpd
you could configure a second mod_python apache with minimal worker threads to run only on the local interface and with a different port
then for your public apache instance on port 80 disable mod_python and tune for optimal ram utilization
775693
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
zifre is right that on current x86 cpus memory writes are atomic but that is rapidly ceasing to be the case - memory writes are only atomic for a single core - other cores may not see the writes in the same order
in other words if you do on cpu 2 you might see location b modified before location a is
also if you re writing a value that s larger than the native word size 32 bits on an x32 processors the writes are not atomic - so the high 32 bits of a 64 bit write will hit the bus at a different time from the low 32 bits of the write
777149
bazaar	svn
Pattern(s): 
i have no idea why svn has it that way but basically tags are just a marker at a point in time in your bazaar repository
when you want to diff against a tag it can be done like bazaar diff -r tag tag_name so whenever you re making a release just tag it and be on your way
nothing special like moving something to a specific folder or anything
777194
photoshop	fireworks
Pattern(s): 

adobe imageready used to come with photoshop for slicing
that was replaced with fireworks adobe has free trials of all their products
777224
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
the code is rather long - it creates the empty database + the needed tracking table structure + required db functions and the populating trigger all running under a ga schema
here is a sample poor man s solution for a trigger implements tracking of changes on db objects via ddl stateements on a sql server 2005 2008 database
i contains also a simple sample of how-to enforce the usage of required somevalue xml tag in the source code for each sql command ran on the database + the tracking of the current db version and type dev test qa fb prod one could extends it with additional required attributes such as etc
778224
textmate	aptana
Pattern(s): 
the other issue is that since it s based on eclipse it s quite ressource intensive and from my experience it s not as stable as textmate. aptana has some cool features like being able to call script generate and rake tasks directly from the interface but this is something i could live without
in my opinion textmate is the best ide if you have a mac
it is highly customizable and you can pretty much do everything you want with it
778292
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
the process of deserialization is pretty complex - a single working cast hardly takes any time at all
of course if you re interested in fast portable compact serializable with a good versioning story you should be looking at protocol buffers google version java python c++ good overall docs my port of the java version good for portability with java code marc gravell s port good for wcf arguably more idiomatically .net there are other serializable frameworks too such as thrift .

778411
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
violate encapsulation no alteration fo the type system everything else continues to work
maintenance effort potentially high on runtime change apps will break if the runtime changes underneath them for your needs if and only if you control the runtime versioning this operates on entirely a controlled corporate environment the following evil but effective hack is appropriate
so long as you test any time you upgrade it may well keep working with little effort
779895
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
for optimization and any other tuning features
quick postgresql optimization query optimizing short read explains a lot of things well and works a real example which is nice for those of us that learn better that way
after seeing the wiki link to postgresql figured i d edit this post with links for mysql oracle docs not really an optimization guides specifically but both are good resources especially the mysql one
780251
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
unlike tcp this does not mean that the peer closed the connection because with udp there is no connection
actually you can send a udp datagram of 0 bytes length
all that gets sent is the ip and udp headers
780251
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
all that gets sent is the ip and udp headers
the udp recvfrom on the other side will return with a length of 0
unlike tcp this does not mean that the peer closed the connection because with udp there is no connection
783615
qt-creator	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
kdevelop is a great ide although it might be a bit too cluttered
i really like qt-creator . you might wanna give eclipse a shot too
as of what distribution to use i would recommend you archlinux if you feel like really learning something out of this and learning about linux along with learning to do development under linux
784578
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
instead read it into a string and you can check whether or not the input is valid
if cin reads an invalid number it will go into a failed state which can be checked with if cin.fail however it is easier to read the input as a string and then convert the input to an int or floating point number afterwards
isdigit c should be called on a chars not an an int
786958
datamapper	activerecord
Pattern(s): 
if you re on sinatra datamapper is a very practical choice
if you re using sinatra i can t recommend datamapper highly enough
i have a couple rails apps where i m stuck with activerecord and i m constantly cursing its shortcomings and design flaws
786958
datamapper	activerecord
Pattern(s): 
i have a couple rails apps where i m stuck with activerecord and i m constantly cursing its shortcomings and design flaws
if you re on sinatra datamapper is a very practical choice

787841
post	get
Pattern(s): 
there are several ways to reduce the risk which you should test for - get requests should not have side-effects - all actions should be done using post requests only
it s more difficult for an attacker to generate a post request originating from the user
you want to have a random unique per-page string sent to the user and checked on return to the server
787901
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 
nginx is a popular one
apache s memory and resource usage depends a lot on what you re doing with it - which modules are loaded what your php etc
scripts are doing
789280
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
and then again jumping major version numbers means increased revenue by way of user upgrade
in web applications the versioning is mostly for the developers themselves and it s much easier to do small iterative enhancements
that s the reason why desktop applications still adhere to waterfall development cycle because pushing out changes is costly and you must get it the first time
789571
struts	stripes
Pattern(s): 
i am very familiar with stripes and only am aware that struts 2 is similar so i will focus this entry on stripes
as an aside struts 1 is worthless
it offers no value frankly
789715
vim	textmate
Pattern(s): 
try e-editor windows port of mac textmate
vim is ofc superb but .
long learning curve may be a problem and some people can t find themselves in 2 mode editors
790216
bash	subshell
Pattern(s): 
so the first command echoes blank but the second and third echo bye and getting this to print the way you want it in so takes several tries is apparently impossible...
just to expand on this a bit bash has fairly complicated rules for dealing with metacharacters in quotes
in general almost nothing is interpreted in single-quotes shell substitution is done inside double quotes but file metacharacters aren t expanded everything inside backquotes is passed to the subshell which interprets them
790722
instances	transient
Pattern(s): 
i suggest you look at the documentation for serializable which goes into a fair amount of detail about serialization
if you want an instances of mylistener to be placed in a session you need to make it serializable
that might involve making some fields transient but then those fields won t be saved in the session
791028
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 
i manage the maven central repo that gets millions of hits a day and i have some experience with nginx
apache is great if you need lots of flexibility that is provided via various mods
if you re looking for straight-up file serving or proxying then some lightweight options might be better
791119
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
as you visit a node you point its left-child pointer to its parent its right-child pointer to the last time you took a right turn on your path which is to be found in the parent s right-child pointer at this moment and store its real children either in the now-redundant parent s right-child pointer or in your traversal state resp
the next visited children s left-child pointer
you need to keep some pointers to the current node and its vicinity but nothing non-local
792319
bazaar	git	bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
according to many sources including wikipedia git is particularly slow on windows because it needs its posix environment but that nothing beats the speed of git in its native posix-y linux
this is one reason i use bazaar - apart from personally finding it easy to use i use windows 66 of the time and bazaar has no performance problems on windows
i don t doubt that git is very fast on linux though
792370
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
since it is up to you what getters you provide how visible you make them and how they are implemented you can exercise a lot of control as to who can access the data and how
note that there does not really need to be a name field if there is a getname it is entirely up to the implementation of the getter where that data comes from
even if the getter or setter just wraps a private field it is good style to have these setter and getters as opposed to allowing direct field access
793551
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
for your problem the execution speed of for loops versus vectorized code will probably depend on how big the values n and k are
if you want to avoid having to use a for-loop this is probably the cleanest way to do it the first line puts each column of indexmatrix into separate cells of a cell arrays using num2cell
this allows us to pass all k columns as a comma-separated list into sub2ind a function that converts subscripted indices row column etc. into linear indices each matrix element is numbered from 1 to n n being the total number of elements in the matrix
793996
directx	direct2d	directx	directwrite	directx	directwrite
Pattern(s): 
for details on directwrite in particular being released for vista but not xp see this msdn blog
direct2d is built on directx 10.1 so will not work on xp since directx 10 is vista+ only
direct2d and directwrite technical previews are both currently available in the march 2009 directx sdk
794998
equals	compareto	equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 
whether or not equals and hashcode are consistent with compareto is a different matter
from the javadoc for comparable it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals
this is so because sorted sets and sorted maps without explicit comparators behave strangely when they are used with elements or keys whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals if you want to have compareto inconsistent with equals it is recommended that you instead use an explicit comparator by providing a class that implements comparator
794998
equals	compareto	equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 
this is so because sorted sets and sorted maps without explicit comparators behave strangely when they are used with elements or keys whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals if you want to have compareto inconsistent with equals it is recommended that you instead use an explicit comparator by providing a class that implements comparator
you should still override equals and hashcode
whether or not equals and hashcode are consistent with compareto is a different matter
796667
rtos	ecos
Pattern(s): 
i have used µc os-ii in several projects over the years and can recommend it
you might find it helpful to read the source of a typical rtos
there are several open-source examples out there and the following yielded links in a little bit of quick searching freertos ecos a commercial rtos that is well documented available in source code form and easy to work with is µc os-ii
797067
internationalization	globalization
Pattern(s): 
for example the turkish i character is a common problem for many programs which capitalize it in a wrong way
the so called turkey test is related to software internationalization
one problem of globalization internationalization are that date and time formats in different cultures can differ on many levels day month year order date separator etc
797684
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
in fact the salt is generated randomly for each password and stored without any form of obfuscation alongside the password
passwords are never stored in a database only the hash is stored md5 sha1 sha2 etc
the md5 of password is always 286755fad04869ca523320acce0dc6a4
797684
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
if you choose a salt then xor the salt with the password hash then the attacker can just undo the xor operation and get the original hash at which point rainbow tables are extremely useful
if you think the mathematical formula can t be reversed there s a chance that you re actually losing data and that you re mapping multiple passwords to the same final hash
this actually multiplies the chance that the attacker will find a password for the hash since any of the appropriate passwords will work
797706
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
the table includes john1970- d3 88 99 bc 0c b5 dc 0e d1 7f bb f7 eb f4 ea b2 if they then steal your unsalted database and see a hash d3...b2 they ll know ignoring collisions the password was john1970 and they can then use that password on your site and possibly others
if however you use the salt 123456 obviously a random one would be better they will see a hash 2a ca 76 59 03 23 35 61 e0 20 49 11 8f fe f3 0e instead
even if they are able to compromise the salt when they get the hashes you should try to prevent this by storing them separately they will be left with md5 x+123456 2a...0e and no way to easily determine x
797706
salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
even if they are able to compromise the salt when they get the hashes you should try to prevent this by storing them separately they will be left with md5 x+123456 2a...0e and no way to easily determine x
salt are a very powerful technique and should be used whenever possible
on the other hand what you call non-standard methods appear to be half-cocked attempts at inventing your own unproven hashing algorithm
797860
git-am	git-apply	git-am	git-apply
Pattern(s): 
in such a case git-apply currently rejects the patch
if it is called from git-am then a 3-way merge is attempted by taking the index ... data from the patch and constructing a temporary tree applying the patch to that then merging the temporary tree to the current branch
for various reasons it would be nice to do the entire temporary tree dance directly inside of git-apply as it can benefit say the git-sequence s apply command speed up git-am processing by forking less etc
798611
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
Pattern(s): 
p.s. a com object is case-insensitive when it comes to method- and property names
this wrapper is as all javascript case-sensitive
for example if your code happens to call both send and send you will need a skeleton send method in the wrapper as well
799006
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
effectively they are trying to avoid this kind of scenario i purchase a encryption library from company a shortly afterwards company b gets hold of my email details and sends me a free upgrade to the assembly pretending to be a major security bug fix from company a when it really injects a hidden method into my code that sends all the data i was trying to encrypt off to company b s servers
assuming that i m an idiot and blindly add this new dll into my application s bin directory the fact that this wasn t signed with the same private key as the old versioning will be picked up at runtime causing an exception and protecting my data
so i see no reason that you would publish the public key outside of the assembly since it isn t supposed to guarantee that the original file comes from a specific vendor only that all subsequent versions come from the same place as the first
799078
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
writing a reliable protocol on top of udp is a very non trivial task and there is no reason to do so for almost all applications
when you re sending udp datagrams your read size will equal your write size
this is because udp is a datagram protocol vs tcp s stream protocol
799092
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
if you re working on an application where some loss is allowable streaming media etc. then go for udp but don t expect everything to get from one of the pipe to the other intact
the big thing to know when attempting to use udp is your packets might not all make it over the line which means there is going to be possible data corruption
if you re working on an application where 100 of the data needs to arrive reliably to provide functionality use tcp
799233
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
also note that udp can be multicast while tcp can t
one way to look at the difference between applications appropriate for udp vs
tcp is that tcp is good when data delivery is better late than never udp is good when data delivery is better never than late
800399
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 
this sounds similar to a problem i had
if i remember correctly the mac swt jar uses certain startup hooks to launch itself automatically
then swt interferes with swing
800474
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
hashing is designed to be a relatively fast and or small token to be able to see if one piece of data likely is the same as the other
it s fully possible for entirely different sets of data to produce the same hash though being able to produce these algorithmically is very hard
all of that aside for checking likely identity md5 is fairly fast
800574
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
warning if a subversion 1.6 client encounters a pre-1.6 working copy it will automatically upgrade the working copy format as soon as it touches it making it unreadable by older subversion clients
if you are using several versioning of subversion on your machine be careful about which versioning you use in which working copy to avoid accidentally upgrading a working copy
but note that this auto upgrade behavior does not occur with the repositories only working copies. if you accidentally upgrade a 1.5 working copy to 1.6 and wish to downgrade back to 1.5 use the change-svn-wc-format.py script
801116
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
indeed md5 is often still used in applications where the smaller key size and speed are beneficial
that said due to its flaws researchers recommend the use of other hash functions in new scenarios
sha1 has a flaw that allows collisions to be found in theoretically far less than the 2 80 steps a secure hash function of its length would require
803700
nginx	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
nginx serves all static media and proxies dynamic request to the web server behind it
you could also use nginx and its x-accel-redirect feature
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd
804936
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
this can be added normally with js not a good solution or with after css pseudo element not widely supported in older ies
the problem is that containers won t naturally expand to include floated children
be warned with using the first example if you have any children elements outside the parent element they will be hidden
806814
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 
bind macros to keyboard shortcuts keyboard shortcuts to navigate task list search her blog for plenty of other tips and tricks
your real question is about pain and productivity the mouse is just a by-product of your circumstances
i would rephrase the question to reflect your real purpose
807289
client-side	server-side	xval	fluentvalidation
Pattern(s): 
the first which i personally use is fluentvalidation that allows you to create validators for your model objects
it can be found at there s another library out there specifically for asp.net mvc applications that provides both server-side and client-side validation called xval
i usually setup my projects the way you have mentioned and most of my logic and or validation happens in the service layer and the repository layer is simply for queries
807966
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
Pattern(s): 
calloc allows you to initialize the memory block you allocate while malloc does not
the main difference between new and malloc i can recall is that you cannot reallocate memory allocated by new using realloc
so if you wanted to increase decrease the size of the memory block you had to allocate a new block and copy everything over
807970
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 
new and delete is the c++ way to allocate arrays of contiguous memory
should be used because it is more type safe than malloc should be used because it calls the constructor destructor cannot be used in a realloc way but can use placement new to re-use the same buffer of data data cannot be allocated with new and free with free nor delete malloc free + family malloc free family is the c way to allocate and free memory from the heap
calloc is the same as malloc but also initializes the memory should be used if you may need to reallocate the memory data cannot be allocated with malloc and free with delete nor delete also see my related answer here
808517
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
what you describe a macro recorder should be implemented using a controller that generates is fed a series of application-specific action messages look at the command pattern
if you re looking for standard gui events then you want java.awt.robot if you re looking to define your own events you re going to have to subclass the gui classes that need to receive those events or better create an external controller for them define an event class and dispatch the events
you can use java.beans.eventhandler to dispatch create your own handler class i ve found that more useful on occasions or inject your events depending on how they inherited into the system event queue can t find the class to do that .
808689
pdfsharp	itextsharp	pdfsharp	itextsharp
Pattern(s): 
and the same is also possible with itextsharp
pdfsharp seems to allow merging multiple pdf documents into one
and the same is also possible with itextsharp
808903
pdfsharp	itextsharp
Pattern(s): 
personally i ve been playing with itextsharp which has been pretty easy to work with
i know a lot of people have recommended pdfsharp however it doesn t look like that project has been updated since june of 2008
further source isn t available
810051
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
then when that pointer passed to delete which passes it to free free looks one int before the passed pointer to find the size that s being given back
passing back something other than what we got is going to mean that free thinks an arbitrary amount of actual memory is being passed back and it ll screw up the free list accordingly
again this is how it s often implemented not how new delete malloc or free are required to be implemented
810597
jikes	javac
Pattern(s): 
edit jikes support incremental compiling which may be very interesting in environments where development with a full-size ide is not an option
jikes does not support the new java 5 things so it is not an option for projects using these facilities
the best alternative to javac these days is in my opinion the eclipse compiler which is available in a stand-alone version
811111
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
you can adjust the every 10 words above to every x words to reduce memory consumption
so your size used in ram would be only num_words_in_file x sizeof int which is much smaller than the size of storing the entire file in ram even if you stored each unique string only once
accessing each word with no extra space if you pad each word with a certain chars so that each word is the same size then ignore the padding chars when you read in
811797
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
maybe the layout is fine in the history
i ve heard but cannot validate for ie that both ie and firefox support the view-source pseudo-protocol
firefox on mac indeed understands it but safari does not
812283
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
to test start with a old database create a method to updatedatbaseifneeded the test should pass if the schema gets updated and the db versioning gets set you can also preload your test database to test for various conversion issues that need to be handled by your upgrade scripts
here is an option store a db versioning somewhere in you database at startup ensure that the database is current by comparing a constant in your code to the db versioning
if not current run a set of scripts to create alter tables convert data etc
812283
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
if not current run a set of scripts to create alter tables convert data etc
if you have already deployed and don t have the db versioning then just check the schema for something you expect in the latest db versioning
to test start with a old database create a method to updatedatbaseifneeded the test should pass if the schema gets updated and the db versioning gets set you can also preload your test database to test for various conversion issues that need to be handled by your upgrade scripts
812363
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
the solution i came up with i was targeting mssqlserver originally and then went mysql in the end so i think my solution is a little more flexible as it seems to work fine on mysql and sqlite
haven t bothered checking postgresql yet

812758
sml	prolog
Pattern(s): 
i don t see sml as particularly suited to any clear niche
indeed sml is a very well-rounded general-purpose programming language
prolog is well established in the logic programming artifical intelligence rule based system solving niche s but it s used for a lot of things besides these traditional domains
812758
sml	prolog
Pattern(s): 
prolog is well established in the logic programming artifical intelligence rule based system solving niche s but it s used for a lot of things besides these traditional domains
for anyone who is considering using sml for a software project in the real world here are some of the advantages and disadvantages we ve noticed so far sml is a very nice general programming language especially the module system rocks mlton optimizes so well that you can use abstractions freely without losing performance our old code is written in plain c
we can replace that piece by piece with sml linking both c and sml code to the same executbles. sml nj provides a repl for rapid development portable to all of our platforms disadvantages miniscule user base lacking in the supporting tools area ide code documentation debuggers etc. i had to actually port mlton myself to aix and hp-ux
813524
openbsd	freebsd
Pattern(s): 
see it like a sandbox on steroids with neglectable performance penalties
as richard said openbsd is definitely worth a go it is my #1 choice for everything that is dedicated for firewalls and gateways
for other services i tend to stick to freebsd although there is no obvious reason for it just a personal preference
813646
haskell	sml
Pattern(s): 
although operator overloading in sml is totally bogus it is also simple
it s going to be hard to teach a whole class in haskell without having to get into type classes
student can debug using print
813646
haskell	sml
Pattern(s): 
there just isn t a nice way to deal with type signatures in sml
haskell has better concrete syntax
the haskell syntax is a major improvement over ml syntax
814199
docx	.doc
Pattern(s): 
this means that there is no lossy conversion on either the way in or the way out
so for example when you save after editing anything which was in the original docx is round tripped back to word
as far as support for older .doc is concerned poi can be used to convert them to .docx although your mileage may vary
814317
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
note that the implementation of the subclassing requires the drawrect method be called
i m not sure if this is a bug or not since i d expect the drawrect method to be called in the superclass
i filed a bug report with apple on this one but i haven t heard anything
815047
memcached	apc	memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 
so you could for example be using apc for increased execution performance while using memcached for cache storage
memcached if you need to preserve state across several web servers if you re load balanced and it s important that what s in the cache is the same for all servers
apc if you just need access to quick memory to read write on a or each server
817278
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
the other alternative is to create a custom runner which understands the global properties and delegates to the appropriate runner
this approach is a lot more brittle since the junit4 internal runners are unstable and can be changed from release to release but it has the advantage of being able to be inherited down a class hierarchy and be overridden in a subclassing
it is also the only realistic way to do this if you have to support legacy junit38 classes
817649
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 
here s the page 2 on compilers and getting set up
an excerpt on what compilers you can use windows dos code blocks and mingw borland djgpp dev-c++ and digital mars windows only microsoft visual c++ nix g++ is a c++ compiler that comes with most nix distributions
gcc is a c compiler that comes with most nix distributions
818320
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if there are methods common between types you can do this by declaring an interface using extension methods on that interface and using partial classes to add the interface to the specific types or if you need to know the type
you can t extend linq-to-sql entity types in this way via inherited - you should instead use a partial class to add extra methods to the existing generated entity
because linq-to-sql supports inherited for discriminated tables etc it expects an exact match to a known entity type - not unexpected subclassing
818446
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
perhaps you can do it the same way as i did it if mysql has some similar geometric types
i m using postgresql and i wanted to do the same thing
perhaps you can do it the same way as i did it if mysql has some similar geometric types
820689
put	get	put	get
Pattern(s): 
you have to disable the tool bar in the registry to get it back if you look in the emacswiki under w32sendsys command-codes you ll find that 61488 is maximize current frame
i found an answer a year-or-so back that explains you have to manipulate the registry to do things right to start emacs maximized put this line at the end of your .emacs file w32-send-sys-command 61488 if you don t want the emacs tool bar you can add the line tool-bar-mode -1 note value is 0 on original page to your .emacs file but emacs won t fully maximize in this case - the real estate occupied by the tool bar is lost
you have to disable the tool bar in the registry to get it back if you look in the emacswiki under w32sendsys command-codes you ll find that 61488 is maximize current frame
820976
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 
the selection screens btw is a good place for the new record button
disclaimer i have been doing cruds for i don t know how long but i m just starting now with my first winforms app. p so some mixed ideas in our current system written using centura gupta we use a mdi-like approach. i think it is important to allow the user to start working on a new record without forcing him to close his current work so a list of open windows is always displayed to allow quick switching between the different forms
example alt text list of open windows in the lower left. also this system makes it possible to open one record from inside another open a customer show the orders of this customer doubleclick on one of his orders to open it and so on
821980
int	chars
Pattern(s): 

op wrote my goal originally was to come up with a specific method to pack 1..n large int aka longs together so that their string representation is notably shorter than writing the actual number
think multiples of ten 10 6 and 1 000 000 are the same however the representation s length in chars isn t
822462
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
thus if you wanted to wrap up the whole datafile in one pass then you could do the following instead then if you want the func type you would use the following sorry for being so obsessive but i am trying to get a better handle on creating list comprehensions and i decided that this was worthy of a shot
i think this might cost less than the use of regexes though i am not totally clear on what you are trying to accomplish i have learned from other post it is cheaper and better to wrap up all of the data when you are reading through a file the first time
thus if you wanted to wrap up the whole datafile in one pass then you could do the following instead then if you want the func type you would use the following sorry for being so obsessive but i am trying to get a better handle on creating list comprehensions and i decided that this was worthy of a shot
822786
int	chars	int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
sun has a short page about autoboxing which is aimed toward a more experienced programmer but might be informative
the difference between the scalar type int and the boxed type int is surprising to someone new to java
java has always made a distinction between the scalar types which are not classes boolean true false chars unsigned 16-bit short signed 16-bit int signed 32-bit and long signed 64-bit
822845
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
one last note ocaml gives you hashtable but it s hardly sensible to use it in code if you really want to embrace functional programming
persistent trees like data.map are really the right solution for haskell and have lots of nice properties which is one of the cool things to learn about when you pick up haskell

823338
haskell	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
ocaml has the simplest type system especially if you don t write objects and functors which many caml programmers don t although it seems crazy to me not to write functors if you re writing ml
haskell s type system is ambitious and powerful but it is continually being improved which means there is some inconsistency as a result of history
f# essentially uses the .net type system plus ml-like hindley-milner polymorphism see question what is hindley-milner . ocaml is not quite consistent on whether it thinks variants should be statically typed or dynamically typed so it provides both algebraic data types and polymorphic variants
823632
gson	jackson
Pattern(s): 
for java at least following parsers from json.org page offer such an interface jackson pull interface json-simple sax-style push interface in addition to software monkey s parser referred to by another answer actually it is kind of odd that so many json parsers do not offer this simple low-level interface -- after all they already need to implement low-level parsing so why not expose it
edit june 2011 gson too has its own streaming api with gson 1.6

824603
set	bag
Pattern(s): 
that is nhibernate will make sure that while reconstituting an instance the collection will not contain duplicates. - when you map the collection as a bag it is possible that your collection will contain the same entity more then once when loading the object from the db
a set is a collection of distinct objects considered as a whole
a valid example of a set of letters is a b c d
826146
recv	epoll	recv	epoll
Pattern(s): 
experimenting i ve found that epollhup only happens in conjunction with epollerr the reason for this may be the way python interfaces with epoll and lowlevel io normally recv would return a -1 and set errno to eagain when nothing is available on a non-blocking recv however python uses nothing returned to signal eof
closing your telnet-session only closes that end of the tcp-connection so it s still perfectly valid to call recv on your side there may be pending data in the tcp receive buffers which your application hasn t read yet so that won t trigger an error-condition
it seems that epollin and a recv that returns an empty string is indicative of the other end having closed the connection however using an older version of python before epoll were introduced and plain select on a pipe i ve experienced that a read that returned did not indicate eof just a lack of available data
826797
action-filter	onactionexecuting
Pattern(s): 
since onactionexecuting is called after your controller code example return redirecttoaction whatever it sets as the actionresult takes precedence
i found decent coverage of action-filter in steven sanderson s book pro asp.net mvc framework
1 2 1 the content on action-filter is not available in the google book preview 2
827588
wtl	atl
Pattern(s): 
atl mfc might be included in the windows sdk or other free products that i am not aware of. wtl 8.0 is available as a free download
you can also get wtl sources from source forge wtl project
to use winforms or wpf you need the latest .net framework well tehcnically you need any .net framework - and optionally visual c# vb.net express
827733
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 
you can then store the seed in the user s session - so each user will see a set of results unique to them
rand accepts a seed in mysql rand n from the mysql docs rand rand n returns a random floating-point value v in the range 0 v 1.0
if a constant integer argument n is specified it is used as the seed value which produces a repeatable sequence of column values
828567
mktime	strtotime
Pattern(s): 
3 if your date is a string you first parse it for example with strtotime then do whatevee you like
1 if your date is say array of year month and day then you can mktime 0 0 0 month day + 15 year or mktime 0 0 0 month + 1 day year
note that mktime is a smart function that will handle out-of-bounds values properly so mktime 0 0 0 13 33 2008 which is month 13 day 33 of 2008 will return timestamp for february 2 2009
829111
uiview	uiwindow
Pattern(s): 
this map is queried in a few key places inside cocoatouch
in particular uiview nextresponder queries it and returns the controller if found
i guess uiwindow does the same lookup with its root view to know which controller to forward rotation events to
830476
webclient	webrequest
Pattern(s): 
edit example code
webclient is fairly limited
if you switch to using webrequest then you gain the ability to send an http head request
830889
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	uiwindow
Pattern(s): 
that is you typically do not manipulate the view-related properties of a uiwindow object directly
edit the uiview is something generic provides common methods you use to create all types of views and access their properties
while uiwindow is more concrete class defines objects that manage and coordinate the windows an application displays on the screen. i know is a little vague and i think only apple would know the exact reason for this hierarchy
832674
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
you want to enhance a but a is final and can no further be subclassing then you need to use composition and delegation
assume your class is called b and the derived delegated to class is called a then here are some examples when inherited or delegation are being used if you want to express relationship is-a then you want to use inherited
you want to be able to pass your class to an existing api expecting a s then you need to use inherited
832925
allocator	stl	allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
stl is easy to use incorrectly so many studios choose to avoid it on these grounds
of those that use it heavily many people pair it with custom allocator
ea has created eastl which addresses many of the issue stl causes in game development
835841
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
shorter isn t necessarily simpler it does have less code though
simplest form minimum code no int overflow no extra checks just a little more memory usage but who doesn t have 32 spare bits lying around
while i suppose has fewer chars i can t really say that it is simpler
836138
radtreeview	radgrid
Pattern(s): 
options for the ui are something like radgrid for asp.net ajax that can provide a built-in filtering ui that enables users to quickly find the values they re interested in
using the radtreeview s client-side api and support for loading nodes on-demand you could create a textbox that would filter the nodes in the tree as the user types
you would simply handle the textbox s onkeyup event and then fire a request to a web service to grab the nodes that meet the filter criteria and replace your treeview s node collection with the result
838168
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
you ll need to upgrade your device in order to run 3.0 apps on it
more specific to the most recent release of the sdk there is an entry in the release notes that states that this versioning does not let you compile against any sdk except the 3.0 sdk
i believe the last versioning that allowed you to do that was 3.0b2
838424
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
today we are in a similar situation
if we are confident that a hash function is collision resistant then we can also be confident that the hash function is preimage resistant
but md5 has significant weaknesses
840370
jmeter	soapui
Pattern(s): 
to achive this you can use the jaxwsserverfactorybean server-side and jaxwsproxyfactorybean client-side classes provided with cxf see this page for sample code i would also give a big thumbs up to soapui for doing functional testing of your web service
jmeter is also extremely useful for stress testing web services which is particularity important for those services doing database lookups

840438
strtol	strtod
Pattern(s): 
alternatives include strtoll and strtod respectively if you want to allow bigger numbers or non-integer numbers
call strtol check that the value stored to endptr is not equal to the input successful conversion and is a pointer to a nul byte the whole string was used
explains that if you also want to detect overflow the trick is to set errno to 0 then call strtol then check that errno is still 0
840631
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
you can try isnumeric function on the results to check if it is a numeric value
i am sure it won t be an int that is the result it is failing
my guess is that it will have come chars which makes it a non-numeric value
842198
qcodo	qcubed
Pattern(s): 
qcodo has really had no active development for well over a year and there doesn t appear to be much chance that development will continue on qcodo anytime soon
qcodo appears to be dying a slow death
qcubed a branch of qcodo is under active development and has been since nov 2008
842198
qcodo	qcubed
Pattern(s): 
qcubed a branch of qcodo is under active development and has been since nov 2008
it was created by users of qcodo who got frustrated with the lack of qcodo progress
if you are just getting started start here and not with qcodo
842900
int	chars	int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
a byte is 8 bits
most primitive types in java are signed and byte short int and long are encoded in two s complement
the chars type is unsigned and the concept of a sign is not applicable to boolean . in this number scheme the most significant bit specifies the sign of the number
843116
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 
that s tricky enough even in english since you need to look out for periods question marks exclamation marks and any other sentence terminators
then you process one sentence at a time after removing all punctuation commas semi-colons colons and so on
then when you re left with an array of words it becomes simpler that s it pretty simple after initial massaging of the text block which may not be as simple as you think
843131
mate	puremvc
Pattern(s): 
i m not in favor of using any mvc framework cairngorm puremvc in flex code
mate is a better candidate
at least it s simple to understand and is non intrusive
843460
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 
in viewwillappear it calls reloaddata if the table view contains no rows
in viewdidappear it calls flashscrollindicators
it monitors the keyboard appearing and disappearing and resizes the table view appropriately so that when you tap a text field in a table view it remains visible after the keyboard appears
843978
icefaces	woodstock	icefaces	trinidad	icefaces	trinidad	woodstock	trinidad	woodstock	trinidad
Pattern(s): 
there are rumors that the development is a bit stalled trinidad the oracle adf faces open source kernel these are important
woodstock is dead and the icefaces guys are on the way to offer a migration path
if you work with oracle tools already jdeveloper trinidad is a good candidate to start
843978
richfaces	icefaces	richfaces	tomahawk	richfaces	trinidad
Pattern(s): 
if you work with oracle tools already jdeveloper trinidad is a good candidate to start
if you work with jboss tools already richfaces is a good candidate to start
for a more independent use have a look at tomahawk and icefaces
845253
nsimage	nsstatusitem
Pattern(s): 
if your image does not load it means that the file is not named correctly not really an image or not actually in the application bundle
you use the setimage method supplying it with an nsimage which you want to display on the menu bar
note also that you can have an nsstatusitem showing an image and text for example with the battery indicator
845370
restrict	shared
Pattern(s): 
shared hosts tend to be stack-em-high affairs where you can get 100s of sites hosted
you could go for a virtual host where they will give you freedom to do whatever you like but you ll probably find there that the amount of cpu power you re restrict to is limited possibly too limited for you
virtual hosts tend to split the host between several virtual guests sometimes as little as 4 but more often and especially for the cheaper plans all the way up to 64
846356
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
in mysql you connect to all databases not just one at a time
postgresql postgresql is much more standards compliant but it s uglier and more complicated especially from a ui perspective
it used to require manual vacuuming and actually enforces referential integrity which is a great thing that can be a pain in the ass
846356
postgresql	mysql	innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
and mysql isn t really faster
if you re using innodb tables for acid or just because at more than 30 million rows myisam tables tend to get crappy yes a straight one-table select is probably faster than in postgresql
but add in joins and postgresql is suddenly significantly faster
848997
collabnet	svn	collabnet	svn
Pattern(s): 
if they are not important to you and you re comfortable using standard svn command line commands collabnet is a nice option
collabnet works great but it doesn t have the visual interfaces for management that are included in visualsvn
if they are not important to you and you re comfortable using standard svn command line commands collabnet is a nice option
849022
collabnet	svn
Pattern(s): 
in the change log it is documented how they are incorporating -original- svn versions currently 1.6.1
actually collabnet has the original source code of subversion
check this out from wikipedia in 2000 collabnet started the open source project subversion a version control system with over 5 million users
849495
xstream	jackson
Pattern(s): 
to get good json-support i would consider using a json processing library that does real ojm mapping i assume svenson does too but additionally such as jackson google-gson also even if you do need to support both xml and json you are imo better off using separate libraries for these tasks -- objects beans to use on server-side need not be different just serialization libs that convert to from xml and json
i agree with other poster in that xstream is not a good fit -- it s an oxm object xml mapper and json is handled as a secondary output format using xml processing path
this is why a convention of how to convert hierarchich xml model into object-graph model of json and vice versa is needed
849924
mockito	jmock
Pattern(s): 
i prefer and currently use jmock but it s worth trying both as their philosophies are rather different
i ve also heard that mockito is very good but haven t really used it in anger

853042
ilist	icollection	ilist	icollection
Pattern(s): 
icollection is slightly better because it provides a count property
listcollectionview is the view type created when the source implements ilist
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access
853042
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping	ilist	icollection
Pattern(s): 
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access
in addition ilist allows sorting grouping and filtering
but ideally your source collection derives from observablecollection the mother of all collections in the eyes of data binding since it provides several extra goodies such as property and collection change notifications
853803
integer	unsigned	integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
the overload resolution stems from the fact that there exist one promotion from an enumeration to the first of int unsigned int long unsigned long that can represent all values of its underlying type
a conversion to any other integer type is lower ranked and overload resolution won t prefer it
and it prints this one here int unsigned int int unsigned int it s not of particular interest to this serialization problem since the size of the data serialized is not of constant width and this can cause problems when the enumeration and its underlying type is changed but it is generally interesting to figure out a type storing the whole of an enumeration
854193
agile	sprint
Pattern(s): 
most often these practices are test-driven development refactoring pair programming and user stories though by no means are these required in scrum or the only way to do things just highly recommended
agile modeling is another common source of agile engineering practices
so in short when mixing scrum and xp which is by far the most common mix you use all of scrum s management artifacts sprint daily scrums retrospectives burn down charts and so on and add xp s tdd refactoring pair-programming and jit design via user stories
857114
unix	bsd	unix	bsd
Pattern(s): 
open bsd source code is available here
unix dc is able to do base conversions on arbitrary large integers
open bsd source code is available here
858183
csc	vbc
Pattern(s): 
cl is c++ cli plain c++ compiler
go to the project directory i assume .net framework is in your path if you want to compile a bunch of c# source files not in a project you d use the csc command
vbc is vb.net compiler
858549
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
don t forget to return false as shown above to stop the default post-back behaviour of the asp button
if so passing id is not enough as .net does not assign the same server id as client-side id
you need to access the clientid property of the .net control server-side to get it s real client-side id the above code shows how you would attach some javascript please don t call it java
858910
sqlparameter	oledb	sqlparameter	oledb
Pattern(s): 
if you re looking at oledb you need to be aware that the parameters are not named you can and probably should name them but they will be used in the order they are entered and not according to their names - this also means you can t use the same parameter twice which can be a bit tedious
the update is failing because it can t find a record that matches the customer id supplied and i think that that is because the parameter value is not being defaulted - there are additional values for the sqlparameter that will allow you to do this
if you re looking at oledb you need to be aware that the parameters are not named you can and probably should name them but they will be used in the order they are entered and not according to their names - this also means you can t use the same parameter twice which can be a bit tedious
860351
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
many argue that in this case you should aggregate the base class that is instead of having the base class as a private base make in a member of derived in order to reuse base class s functionality
it has to do with how the public members of the base class are exposed from the derived class
public - base class s public members will be public usually the default protected - base class s public members will be protected private - base class s public members will be private as litb points out public inheritance is traditional inheritance that you ll see in most programming languages
860887
fgets	feof
Pattern(s): 
feof f then it is broken since the eof flag does not get set until after a read has been done
instead do something like this since fgets is defined to return null on either failure to read or eof
if you are doing this in c++ then i recommend a similar pattern but using c++ iostreams instead
861907
maven	buildr
Pattern(s): 
perhaps tools like buildr are the way to go
maven is a software management tool that can boost your productivity
i believe that such a tool is essential for software development in a new era
862659
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
i also looked at the assembly code
it seems that the performance characteristics on x86 are quite different from ppc
on ppc the binary interface to c specified that arguments would be put into registers there were so many to chose from however it seems that even on 64bit x86 requires arguments to be put on the stack
862659
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
on ppc the binary interface to c specified that arguments would be put into registers there were so many to chose from however it seems that even on 64bit x86 requires arguments to be put on the stack
so that explains why on x86 passing by pointer always seems to be faster
however i noticed the compiler is very eager to inline
862711
uilabel	uifont	uilabel	nsstring
Pattern(s): 
uifont is pretty tightly constrained
if you have the linebreaks in place yourself then it s fairly trivial to draw the string yourself rather than creating multiple uilabel
you can generating sub-strings using componentsseparatedbystring and rendering each of them at your specified leading increments using the uikit nsstring addition drawatpoint withfont
863026
vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
so when i press run outlook starts and my add-in is displayed which may be debugged in the normal fashion
i m not sure how vsto visual studio tools for office works in this respect - or at least i can t remember

864132
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
as long as the schema don t change a svnadmin upgrade is unnecessary
to cite anyone upgrading between versioning of subversion that have different repository schemas
schema versioning are as follows subversion version number schema version ------------------------- -------------- up to and including 0.27 1 0.28 - 0.33.1 2 0.34 - 1.3 3 no released version used this 4 1.4 - 5 if necessary you can see which schema version your repository is currently using by looking at the format file in the repository. it should be noted that these changes are extremely rare
865696
daemon	cron
Pattern(s): 
however unless you really need the flexibility that daemons provide cron is much easier and simpler
here s one daemon walk-through

865907
hide	show
Pattern(s): 
i think it depends on what you re planning on displaying if it s images then i d be tempted to hide them on page load and then show on hover but if it s just a block of text then i d probably be tempted in appending to the dom and then removing on hover out
if you inspect facebook with firefox s firebug plugin you can see that the hide div is there when the page is loaded but is hidden and activated through css classes

868549
libxml2	libxslt
Pattern(s): 
make sure py2app is using the right version of python or install libxml2 and libxslt on your mac
------------- edit-------------- libxml2 is standard in the python.org version of python
it is not standard in apple s version of python
869908
fgets	strtod	fgets	strtol
Pattern(s): 
you can slurp data from stdin using nsfilehandle
for interactive input fgets is better
you ll then want to use either strtol strtoul strtod nsscanner or nsnumberformatter to convert the input to numeric types
869948
qcoreapplication	qdebug	qcoreapplication	qdebug
Pattern(s): 
qdebug understands virtually every type and should give you reasonable output that will allow you to tell whether the it s coming in as keyboard events or something else
i don t know the answer but here are some suggestions to find out what your options are install an event filter on qcoreapplication instance or reimplement qcoreapplication notify in event filter handler output each event looking for anything useful examine the debug output to determine which events are triggered by the scanner
qdebug understands virtually every type and should give you reasonable output that will allow you to tell whether the it s coming in as keyboard events or something else
871761
uitableview	nsindexpath
Pattern(s): 
also be prepared for it to return nil if the cell is no longer in view
the uitableview instance method will allow you to get a pointer to the cell
simply store the row+section info from nsindexpath argument of the didselectrowatindexpath event
872315
trojan	virus
Pattern(s): 
conclusion leave windows updates on automatic have minimal resident protection avast web shield + network shield
3 because this is a trojan that sends back your ftp password it doesn t matter how good your password was
4 try to lceanup your pc with malware or avast it will find a file ending with .ctv you must have a virus database dated 14 may or more recent
872315
trojan	virus
Pattern(s): 
4 try to lceanup your pc with malware or avast it will find a file ending with .ctv you must have a virus database dated 14 may or more recent
if you can t update as explained above then follow these instructions you ll need to extrapolate but basically you have a file the name may vary which is pointed in the registry and use hijackthis to remove it once you rebout without this file excuted all is fine 5 of course update your passwords but make sure the trojan is removed first
6 for an exact list of all pages modified try to get a ftp log and you ll find the ip of the script hacker and all touched files
872761
tapestry	grails	tapestry	wicket
Pattern(s): 
there are others but i have no experience with them and cannot offer any more information
tapestry is another framework that attempts to be a full stack from what i understand and takes a wicket like or i guess wicket takes a tapestry-like approach
grails is yet another full-stack framework using groovy and built on top of spring and hibernate
873401
width	height
Pattern(s): 
you can also add a height and width to the error message
if you are still having issues try to replace the span with a div and then give the container a width this is very important about the blank page
as i said i tried your code and it is working for me
874032
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
not that there s anything wrong with saying sizeof chars - it clearly shows your intention and provides symmetry with calls to calloc or malloc for other types
but sizeof int is actually useful int s can be different sizes on 16- and 32- and these newfangled 64-bit computers
the more you know
874572
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
it can support oop because it supports inherited through prototyping as well as properties and methods
many developers cast off js as a suitable oop language because they are so used to the class style of c# and java. many people don t realize that javascript supports inherited
when you write object-oriented code it instantly gives you power
875344
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
therefore seeing as the alternative using an explicit loops is not harder to implement than a call to map it is highly recommended that one restricts use of map to those cases in which the function to be applied does not cause side effects
you could use map instead of the for-loop you ve shown but since you do not appear to use the result of item.my_func this is not recommended
map should be used if you want to apply a function without side-effects to all elements of a list
875407
floor	sqrt
Pattern(s): 
floor sqrt floor 2 floor sqrt 2 floor 1.41... without the outer floor the result would be 1.41.
the outer floor is not redundant
counterexample x 2
875444
floor	sqrt
Pattern(s): 
a proof by contradiction assume the inner floor is not redundant
that would mean that for some x and d where floor x floor x+d
then we have three numbers to consider a sqrt x b floor sqrt x+d c sqrt x+d
876242
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
in other words the reuses the file descriptor which stdout currently uses
bash executes the redirects from left to right as follows open file.txt in append mode and redirect stdout there
redirect stderr to where stdout is currently going
877269
quartz.net	log4net	quartz.net	log4net
Pattern(s): 
edit based on ganesh s comment edit 2 for the benefits of those who don t want to read the comments the log level was actually set in the log4net root config
quartz.net uses common.logging so something like this in your app.config web.config be sure to change the youradapterhere to the actual logging adapter you re using or nooploggerfactoryadapter if you want to disable logging entirely
edit based on ganesh s comment edit 2 for the benefits of those who don t want to read the comments the log level was actually set in the log4net root config
878981
post	get
Pattern(s): 
which method must be used is specified in the method attribute
post is commonly used when data should be submitted only once or should be private registering at or logging in to a site
get is used for data that may be send as often as necessary because the resulting url contains a query string that one can bookmark
879589
markitup	fckeditor
Pattern(s): 
also i believe it is fairly lightweight at least more so than tinymce or fckeditor
you should check out markitup
it is built on jquery and has support for various markup syntaxes markdown wiki bbcode etc
880612
gtk	cairo
Pattern(s): 
shoes was written to be very small and derives a lot of its formatting and functionality from the web
gtk is huge and very useful but not at all shoes-ish
_why has written shoes mostly on top of cairo which is what recent versions of gtk use for widget drawing also so it appears he purposely stepped back to the core of ui design and created a different framework from the ground up for a solidly different reason than one would use gtk for
880651
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
unless you re developing an entirely new protocol...this isn t something you really need to worry about
unless you re dealing with streaming media or another application where packet loss corruption is acceptable you probably won t be using udp for this application
tcp ip is probably going to be your best bet...and that will dictate the packet design for you
880696
identifier	ambiguous	identifier	ambiguous
Pattern(s): 
there are quite a few possibilities depending on rules that you have left ambiguous - some of the following relations may not be required or may need to be modified machine platno model name - represents each machine field fieldno - represents each cane field task taskid taskname - represents the various tasks plowing harrowing that can be done by any machine userdept deptid deptname - represents each department project projid projname deptid - represents each project for each department plantation rehabilitation expansion shift shiftno - represents the shifts that any machine might be assigned to machine_field platno fieldno - represents the fact that a particular machine can work on a particular cane field machine_task platno taskid - represents the fact that a particular machine can perform a particular task project_requirement projid taskid - represents the fact that a particular project for a particular department requires a particular task machine_assignment projid taskid shiftno platno - represents the fact that a particular machine has been assigned to perform a particular task on a given shift
i ll assume platno can be used as a unique identifier for a machine
there are quite a few possibilities depending on rules that you have left ambiguous - some of the following relations may not be required or may need to be modified machine platno model name - represents each machine field fieldno - represents each cane field task taskid taskname - represents the various tasks plowing harrowing that can be done by any machine userdept deptid deptname - represents each department project projid projname deptid - represents each project for each department plantation rehabilitation expansion shift shiftno - represents the shifts that any machine might be assigned to machine_field platno fieldno - represents the fact that a particular machine can work on a particular cane field machine_task platno taskid - represents the fact that a particular machine can perform a particular task project_requirement projid taskid - represents the fact that a particular project for a particular department requires a particular task machine_assignment projid taskid shiftno platno - represents the fact that a particular machine has been assigned to perform a particular task on a given shift
881252
single-quotes	double-quotes
Pattern(s): 
another handy benefit of using single-quotes is that the literal double-quote characters within your string don t need to be escaped
you should use single-quotes for string delimiters
the single-quote is the standard sql string delimiter and double-quotes are identifier delimiters so you can use special words or characters in the names of tables or columns
881800
autofac	castle-windsor
Pattern(s): 
once you get that and you feel the need for more mature product that can do other things than simply di i d suggest taking a look at castle-windsor which is pretty powerful out of the box very well designed and customizable. if you don t like that i ve heard good things about strcuturemap
if you need only dependency injection probably autofac will be the best option since it s small quite simple and logical
it should not be to hard to grok
883490
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
b when the user logs in you perform exactly the same operation on the provided username and password then compare the resultant hash to the previously stored value in the database so you use pardon any errors vb aint my language to answer your given questions 1 see above
never store the password directly store the hash value 2 use a char x the number of characters returned from the hash is constant so you can give it a known storage size
3 what you are effectively storing is the password for the user salt with their username and also salt with the constant on your server
885785
vim	emacs	vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
but for emacs 22 one still needs to install it manually
as far as i know vim vi has always had the set nu feature to show line numbers along-side the lines themselves
by default emacs only had line-number-mode which showed the line-number of the current line in the mode-line not the same thing
888536
newid	aggregates	newid	aggregates
Pattern(s): 
can t test right now it could be done all in one with an aggregates but it s not reliable 2 calls in quick succession etc
insert null or random string then update using scope_identity afterwards apologies if newid does not cast directly.
can t test right now it could be done all in one with an aggregates but it s not reliable 2 calls in quick succession etc
890765
wcf	openrasta
Pattern(s): 
if you want to do rest over http why not give a look at openrasta that has been built from the ground-up to support rest scenarios seb
wcf is certainly not the way to go as far as v1 is concerned
it prevents you from implementing many of the constraints of rest architectures
891854
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
subclassing must be aware of superclass es implementation details
creating the superclass is much harder when you have to think about how it can be extended
you have to document class invariants carefully and state what other methods overridable methods use internally
892649
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if the program you re using is installed correctly it should already be in the program files folder so you could just refer to the configuration file as . config_file.txt if its in the same directory as the program or .. other_program config_file.txt if its in a directory different than the other program
this would apply not only on windows but on almost every modern operating system and will work properly if you have the start in box properly set or you run it directly from its folder

893584
valgrind	callgrind
Pattern(s): 
even though it could use dynamic translation that is the host and target processors are from different architectures it doesn t
valgrind recompiles binary code to run on host and target or simulated cpus of the same architecture
callgrind is a profiler build upon that
893692
tiff	png
Pattern(s): 
for a gif file bytes 0 through 2 will have the ascii value gif . for a jpeg file bytes 6 through 9 will typically have the value jfif . for a png file bytes 1 through 3 will have the ascii value png
tiff is more difficult since there are so many different tiff standards
once you have determined the file type you can use brian s method to save the file
894009
vsto	add-in	vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
for one thing if your add-in is going to work in high security mode then you re going to need a code-signed com shim to sit between your code and office and that needs to be registered
i believe vsto provides its own shim if you choose to go down that path i didn t since i needed to be able to drive office from scratch rather than relying on the user to start the application
deployment - and dealing with the installation security issues - is one of the hardest parts of office add-in development with .net and it s a real kicker that it comes right at the end when you thought you were done
894032
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
had the struct been int int chars chars then the same object could have been 12 bytes because chars has no alignment requirement
i said that whether int is 4-aligned is platform-dependent on arm it absolutely has to be since unaligned access throws a hardware exception
on x86 you can access ints unaligned but it s generally slower and iirc non-atomic
894081
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
take a look this part was taked from the page of ieinspector ieinspector http analyzer is such a handy tool that allows you to monitor trace debug and analyze http https traffic in real-time
the ssl tsl is a transport layer security yes the data can be picked with bho as jp wrote or any add on but also with out of browser http sniffers
they read messaging between winsock32 and the application
894281
int	boolean	int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
the boolean will tell you if it worked or not
you can use tryparse to determine if the string can be parsed into an int
the boolean will tell you if it worked or not
899292
post	get
Pattern(s): 
incidentally i m running php on iis 6 windows2003 and i discovered an interesting workaround
while php does not receive the post variables from iis as you would expect php still has access to a raw input stream identified by php input which it can read the original request body from
this will contain the post variables in a raw format--i was able to use php s parse_str function to get the post variables out of that raw string

inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
java s visibility rules state that private members can only be accessed in the class that defines them protected members can only be access in the class that defines them subclassing of the class that defines them other classes in the same package as the class that defines them of course as you mention in reflection you can change the rules unless a securitymanager forbids it
it s all about inherited and encapsulation
java s visibility rules state that private members can only be accessed in the class that defines them protected members can only be access in the class that defines them subclassing of the class that defines them other classes in the same package as the class that defines them of course as you mention in reflection you can change the rules unless a securitymanager forbids it
899926
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
that was a deep seated prejudice left over from my java days indeed
the only important part left to my answer is that controller methods that are not actions should not be public or at least your routes should protect them
single table inheritance is a perfect example of when protected is helpful in the model tier as it s one of the most common uses of inheritance there
900203
passenger	thin
Pattern(s): 
it s got virtually everything i need already to build my apps with
sinatra doesn t have to be deployed with passenger but can easily be custom tailored to be fast
if you use things like enterprise ruby and thin you could proxy to either nginix or lighthttpd
902764
goto	break	goto	break
Pattern(s): 
in high level programming it s considered a bad practice because break the program control flow and also makes the code harder to read
goto is good just for error handling in vb6 when you program in assembler or for a pic
in high level programming it s considered a bad practice because break the program control flow and also makes the code harder to read
903768
background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position
Pattern(s): 
you set the background-color and background-image styles
if the image is smaller than the element you need to use the background-position style to place it to the right and to keep it from repeating and covering the entire background you use the background-repeat style background-color green
background-image url images shadow.gif
904652
persistent	transient	persistent	transient
Pattern(s): 
this is opposed to a transient object that only exists in memory
it means that an entity is associated with the database and changes will be written or persistent to the database
this is opposed to a transient object that only exists in memory
908126
post	get
Pattern(s): 
i m sure there are others but that ought to be sufficient
given all that if the http spec defines a method that does exactly what you want your request to do there s no reason to send a post instead
the reason post is so common is that historically at least web browsers only supported get and post
909712
set	bag
Pattern(s): 
other features of .settings is the ability to designate some settings as user-specific and also to save the user-specific settings with a single call
the best reason of all to use .settings is generally that you gain the ability to clearly identify who is using which setting in a code base by following usages of properties and each set is a separate block in the xml file
configuration.appsettings is more global in it s nature - it s just a bag of properties and you dont know which dll subsystem or class depends on a particular setting entry
909942
factors	matrix
Pattern(s): 
as explained in the previous text the normal transformation matrix is m-1 t
scaling m to sm would result in m-1 t s the smaller the scale factors the bigger the transformed normal.
here we go
911854
bash	tcsh	bash	tcsh
Pattern(s): 
here s tcsh
see this previous so question which covers bash
tcsh provides the same functionality with filetest -t 1 to see if standard output is a terminal
912729
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
it is easy to create a situation where inlining does nothing more than make the code size explode cause more cache misses and overall slow down your code
that is one of the reasons why inline is at best treated as a hint by the optimizer
at worst it is ignored entirely
913243
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
try to avoid using hacks because they could be fixed in a newer versioning without fixing the problem you were trying to work around
if you use purely browser detection you need to update your list each time a new browser or browser versioning is released
this causes ridiculous situations like users of a new versioning being told to upgrade downgrade to an older versioning
913356
typedef	struct	typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 
it s the c way of declaring struct c++ does it automatically for you
delete typedef
it s the c way of declaring struct c++ does it automatically for you
914298
csla	.net
Pattern(s): 
this leads to objects that are not friendly for ui development and force you to know the intricacies of your database
i would be interested in hearing more about why you think csla is over-engineered
i have found it to be very feature rich but most of the features just implement standard .net interfaces and so all the plumbing comes free and you definately have to use it
914410
put	get
Pattern(s): 
i d also change the object thrown to a value type even if it is int and update the catch clause accordingly to see if you get changed behaviour that way
the code looks ok to me but i d be tempted to put a few more catch clauses in to see if it s hitting one of the other ones
namely i d put in i would expect that it ll either hit the pointer catch even if that s really not a good idea see the link that igor oks provided or the std exception in case it can t allocated the memory
915822
fileoutputstream	filewriter
Pattern(s): 
note also that you should almost never use filewriter since it does not allow you to specify the encoding
instead manually wrap a fileoutputstream in an outputstreamwriter - then you can also obtain the corresponding channel for locking

915986
post	get
Pattern(s): 
watch out though as cookies also end up in this array and can produce unexpected results if they have the same name
as far as i can tell from your question your problem is this your page is hit from adobe flash and apparently not with a post request as the code that you wrote expects
if the request is not a post it is most likely a get
916923
icomparable	compareto
Pattern(s): 
the sortarray method calls array.sort which requires the array that is passed in to contains objects that implement icomparable
therefore we must have an icomparable constraint now the class will compile and work correctly as an array of t is valid for array.sort and there is a valid .compareto method defined in the interface
however if you are sure that you will not want to use your class with a type that does not also implement the icomparable interface you can extend your constraint to this means that when areequal is called it will use the faster generic compareto method and you will see a performance benefit at the expense of not being able to use it with old .net 1.0 types
917763
xval	fluentvalidation
Pattern(s): 
you may want to look for xval and fluentvalidation for .net
nhibernate validator 1.2 alpha has fluent syntax as well and it is integrated with xval not sure about alpha but 1.0 should be
enterprise validation block has few negative sides as well
918825
vtk	itk
Pattern(s): 
expect to bang your head against the wall a little in the beginning because the documentation isn t as mature as matlab s
vtk comes with python bindings one description
i m assuming itk does too
920673
ienumerable	ilist
Pattern(s): 
i m finding the conversation between myself and drjokepu in the comments fascinating but i also appreciate that this isn t supposed to be a discussion forum so i ll edit my answer to further outline the reasons behind my choice to buck the trend and suggest that you expose it as an ilist well a list actually as you ll see
let s say this is the class we are talking about so first of all let s assume that we are exposing external as an ienumerable
the reasons i have seen for doing this in the other answers and comments are currently ienumerable is read-only ienumerable is the defacto standard it reduces coupling so you can change the implementation you don t expose implementation details while ienumerable only exposes readonly functionality that doesn t make it readonly
923533
subclass	superclass	subclass	inherited	subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
however django inherited does provide a way to get the subclass version from the superclass which would then allow you to do i happen to think this is a weakness in django s inherited implementation since it doesn t exactly mirror the behaviour you d expect from object inherited in python generally but at least there is a workaround
since i m hardly rushing out to submit a patch with my version of the right behaviour i can t complain - i agree with carl meyer s comment it could expensive to automatically fetch the subclass without altering the parent model s db table and returning the instance of the subclass from the parent class query would be inconsistent with django s promise that a queryset returns the model on which the queryset was run
i still find in practice however that django s inherited leads to some awkward extra steps on occasion
923798
error-handling	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
i know of plenty of your beloved c# programmers who don t bother dealing with all their problems either
i have to say i slightly resent the tone that implies this sort of lax error-handling behaviour is something fundamental to java programmers
sure java programmers can be lazy just like every other programmer and java s a popular language so you ll probably see a lot of code swallowing exception-handling
926598
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
getitem for loops expect that an indexerror will be raised for illegal indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the sequence. raise indexerror to signal the end of the sequence
your code is basically equivalent to where object is what you re iterating over in the for-loop

926806
int	double
Pattern(s): 
suppose we add an additional design criterion that the problem be solved solely with int arithmetic rather than computing the quotient as a double since the double solution has been explicitly rejected in the problem statement
clearly to meet our spec while remaining solely in int arithmetic we need to know three facts
second was the division free of remainder
926864
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
also there is a handy gui tool that should make it amazingly easy to use called toroisebzr
if it s just you you might want to try bazaar
it s distributed like git so it ll be nice for a single person--no server to deal with but one of their main goals was to make it it much easier to use than git
926904
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
since you are always removing index 0 you don t have to worry about going out of bounds of the arrays
the issue is in your for-loop
as you remove labels scrollview subviews count decreases which means you won t get to all your labels since loops runs less times than there are labels
926904
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
as you remove labels scrollview subviews count decreases which means you won t get to all your labels since loops runs less times than there are labels
imagine you had 5 labels at time of comparison i | scrollview subviews count 0 | 5 1 | 4 2 | 3 -- loops ends here since i+1 scrollview subviews count 3 | 2 you should save the initial count to a variable and use that in your for-loop condition
since you are always removing index 0 you don t have to worry about going out of bounds of the arrays
927797
redmine	trac
Pattern(s): 
if it s the first thing then when you look down the logs you ll be able to see the bug numbers easily
i know redmine has an additional feature that checks for these bug numbers in the commit logs and attaches the revision to the bug so you can see from the bug all the revisions that were involved in fixing it
i d be suprised if trac doesn t have something similar
930194
asterisk	freeswitch
Pattern(s): 
asterisk is cool for simple logic but if you need some processing in the background and leaving the call in some state for an undefined time it becomes quite hard to manage
this may not be the answer you expected but if you plan to create a proper application for doing stuff over the phone have a look at other solutions apart from asterisk
both yate and as far as i know - never tried this one for anything serious freeswitch implement a more asynchronous interface where you can connect an incoming call to whatever sound source you want without losing control over it
930847
partialfunction	implicit
Pattern(s): 
that function is not defined at 0
a partialfunction is just a function that promises to tell you where it s not defined
still scala makes it easy enough to do what you want if you prefer you can make func2partial implicit
931197
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
cs teachers at colleges and universities today particularly the young ones were educated using java c and c++ and they probably learnt either scheme or common lisp in a course called comparative studies of programming language or programming paradigms which was probably taught by someone who doesn t like any lisp language and taught them about functions lists symbols and higher-order functions
period. then they end up teaching what they learned lisp is one programming language lisp is interpreted lisp is slow lisp is an ai language the last time i checked robert sebesta s book it still claimed that -- but there is a new edition so he may have fixed this lisp has no oo support
lisp is a functional language as opposed to minimally supporting any other paradigm in lisp there are no data types lisp has no data structures except lists and hence is not useful for number crunching lisp is not used anymore and is only used in this course because it is the most important functional language i even saw a very intelligent professor giving an example of matrix multiplication in common lisp -- representing the matrices as lists of course
932362
profiling	debugging
Pattern(s): 
although eliminating debugging data is a technical certification requirement that nintendo requires you to do i don t think they ll bounce you for having a couple of extra strings in your elf
use a profiling and try to identify where you re using the most memory
chances are there will be a way to save huge amounts of memory with little effort if you focus your energy in the right place
933152
nsstring	nsdata
Pattern(s): 
you need to use an nsdata object as an intermediary like in this example
ok there s a couple of things wrong here the conversion from url url to nsstring newimage is incorrect what the code actually does there is try to load the contents of into the nsstring
the -imagenamed method takes a string that is a path of a local file not a url as an argument
933662
ftp	telnet	ftp	telnet
Pattern(s): 
if you need to implement a telnet client you should understand the good old rfc 854
ftp is just a bunch of other rfcs you can start with rfc 959
both telnet and ftp clients are directly implementable with tcpclient
934296
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 
added to a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller that is added directly to uiwindow or a chain of these that leads to uiwindow
viewwillappear should be called if you are using a uinavigationcontroller
did you check if viewwilldisappear gets called when it goes offscreen
934570
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
in any case the inline specified is indeed a hint
the compiler is not required to inline the function
there are a number of reasons why any compiler might decide to ignore an inline hint a compiler might be simple and not support inlining a compiler might use an internal algorithm to decide on what to inline and ignore the hints
934669
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
i don t actually know but it s possible that the compiler disables inlining for debug builds because it makes things difficult for the debugger.
inline is nothing more than a suggestion to the compiler that if it s possible to inline this function then the compiler should consider doing so
some functions it will inline automatically because they are so simple and other functions that you suggest it inlines it won t because they are to complex
935862
width	height
Pattern(s): 
that makes it more readable to most common off-the-shelf barcode readers
what i ve done is to take the barcode and make it fit the width that i want by resizing it down
what then happens is that the height is not good enough for most readers so i copy the image and duplicated it above it so it now is the width i want and double the height of the generator
935945
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 
i would try implementing the uitabbarcontrollerdelegate protocol and implementing the tabbar didselectviewcontroller method
i know that when you assign a delegate to a uinavigationcontroller the component uiviewcontroller delegate methods are not called
it seems likely that the same is true of uitabbarcontroller
936403
tabcontrol	tabitem
Pattern(s): 
the value of the itemtemplate property is used whenever a new item needs to be added and in the case of a tab control it will be used to create a new tabitem
you should declare an instance of your class within the datatemplate itself this will cause a new closabletabitem to be created whenever a new tab is added to the tabcontrol
update
936760
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
which means you probably want to start with a socketserver using a tcp connection tcp is basically guaranteed delivery of data
udp is not
google for some simple example code
938795
post	get
Pattern(s): 
in iis this is a case of selecting integrated windows authentication
i m not certain about tomcat but this post looks pertinent
however if your web server replies with www-authenticate basic for a particular resource which would involve sending the creds in clear text encoded note not encrypted as base64 you ll get an argumentexception as it s considered a security exception to send your account s credentials over basic auth
939155
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
Pattern(s): 
4. if you re only running this code on windows you could probably just use directshow
p invoke can be used in a cross platform way once you have your pcm data using a ogg c lib or managed code something like this of course there are licencing issues with mp3 you will need a way to play it unfortunatly .net does not provide any direct assess to your sound card or methods to play streaming audio
you could convert the ogg files to pcm at startup and then use system.media.soundplayer to play the wav files generated
941141
beyondcompare	winmerge
Pattern(s): 
i used their svn proxy in delphi 7 back in 2006 and it worked reasonably well
on the file comparison front beyondcompare is a good low-cost commercial alternative to built-in tortoise compare merge
i have also used winmerge and give both high marks
941188
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 
for more general profiling like object allocation you want to use instrumentation which is also part of apple s developer tools suite
yes you can run shark on your application to get time profiling information
see for example this apple tutorial
941663
factors	matrix
Pattern(s): 
it is currently the algorithm with the fastest known asymptotic running time for matrix multiplication o n 2.376
however its constant factors is far too large to be useful in practice
like fibonacci heaps it s frequently used as a building block in other algorithms to prove theoretical time bounds
942051
inherited	properties	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
now after thinking about it you most likely do not want the masterpage properties set....but just the class inheritance
basically what you have done is setup the page so that the class inherited all of the items from the specified base
the hookup of the masterpage properties creates a weak association and renders content inside of a specific structure
943515
mockito	easymock	mockito	easymock
Pattern(s): 
actually we made a lot of jokes about how easymock is not easy
after attending a lecture on mocking frameworks i decided to go with mockito and have never looked back
it allows partial mocking painlessly - something that easymock required a separate library for
943515
mockito	easymock
Pattern(s): 
it allows partial mocking painlessly - something that easymock required a separate library for
also mockito has much better error messaging
when you do something wrong it will give you verbose errors on how you violated mockito s contract
943532
filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 

the documentation for os.stat has a note that says the exact meaning and resolution of the st_atime st_mtime and st_ctime members depends on the operating system and the filesystems
for example on windows systems using the fat or fat32 file systems st_mtime has 2-second resolution and st_atime has only 1-day resolution
948285
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
it still a little immature for example windows support hasn t hit the mature stage and the tool support is still catching up but if distributed branching is important to you it is worth taking a good look
there is only one good argument i ve heard in favor of cvs and that is in situations where you have a project that will have many different releases and branches in cvs it is easier to just push an arbitrary file into the branch or tag you need when you need it
svn is more formal about these things and makes it harder to just pick on one file and merge it as you need it
948818
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 
the 2 second fat thing can bite you if you are backing up based on time stamp between fat and ntfs or ext3
it depends on the filesystems
fat has 2 second precision. ntfs is 100 nanoseconds. ext3 is 1 second
950011
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 

thus native processes with a bitness of 64 find their dlls where they expect them in the system32 folder
a second directory syswow64 contains the 32-bit dlls
950103
coalesce	nvl
Pattern(s): 
sys_guid s are not generated and the query is instant
coalesce is more modern function that is a part of ansi-92 standard
nvl is oracle specific it was introduced in 80 s before there were any standards
950712
ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
and how to determinate that depends on the os where you run php-cli
addition original poster indicated that he s running on ubuntu
so how to make it work sudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt and note there are on .dll files in linux dll refers to dynamicaly loaded library its used in windows linux equivalent is .so and im pretty sure that you havent just installed the mcrypt packages
952134
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
read the docs
i think you really should consider the use of postgresql combined with postgis
i have given up on mysql for geospatial data for now because of the following reasons mysql only supports spatial datatypes spatial indexes on myisam tables with the inherent disadvantages of myisam concerning transactions referential integrity... mysql implements some of the opengis specifications only on a mbr-basis minimum bounding rectangle which is pretty useless for most serious geospatial querying-processing see this link in the mysql manual
952203
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
since you want no references to anything else you will need to build an app to parse the xml from the parents and then write them to the target pom.xml file in the dependencies section
i don t think there is any plugin to do what you want since it seems to go against the very core of how maven is supposed to help you
the whole point of maven is so that you can include all your dependancies using inheritance or importing them with the import scope
952727
direct3d	directx
Pattern(s): 
edit changed directx in original answer to direct3d
when you start dealing with hundreds of thousands of distinct vertices and vectors in your geometry you should probably consider migrating your graphics code to use a graphics framework instead of depending on wpf which while built on top of direct3d and therefore capable of remarkably efficient vector graphics rendering has a lot of extra overhead going on that hampers its efficiency
it s possible to host both direct3d and opengl graphics rendering windows within wpf -- i d suggest moving that direction instead of continuing to work solely within wpf
954364
ready	each
Pattern(s): 
so this might not really work all that well - or you need to wrap a try...catch around it to handle those cases where the closing of the client proxy causes an issue
see avoiding problems with the using statement that way the client proxy is automatically closed and disposed of when the scope of the using block ends and your channel from the client to the server is released and the server is ready to receive another call from another client
also with the wshttpcontextbinding you should check whether you really need the sessions that are on by default - the recommended best practice would be to use per-call instancing on the server each caller instantiates a new server object
954395
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
it keeps the code where another programmer would expect it and they are likely the only audience for this kind of design
post is non-idempotent meaning if you send the same post request many times you will get many new items
put should be idempotent since the same update happening on the same resource should have no side effects when executed multiple times
955153
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
for example create a base class called basepage which inherits from system.web.ui.page
have your asp.net pages inherited from your new basepage class
in the basepage class you can have a public properties which contains the extra fields you want to store for your user eg
955456
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
c# powershell
in .net you can differentiate x86 from x64 by looking at the size property of the intptr structure
the intptr.size property is returned in bytes 8 bits per byte so it is equal to 4 on a 32-bit cpu and 8 on a 64bit cpu
956032
direct3d	directx
Pattern(s): 
graphics apis are a mean for your application to communicate to the gpu and thus makes you incredibly dependent on how well a given driver is implemented for installed gpu
my choice direct3d is sometimes faster on some graphics card than opengl and that is because of graphics vendors and their drivers
directx offers plenty of tools to speed up development
959276
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
the best advice i ever received for ood was to look to the smallest object that each logical branch of your app can be distilled to it probably on has native types for properties with .net there no point in reinventing framework objects either so they can be in your base class and then using inheritance polymorphism and encapsulation to expand on those base classes until you have an object that encapsulates the logical branch
at the time i was writing an app that pushed data to an i2c device so i started with a class that put a bit onto an i2c bus that was inherited by a class that put a byte onto a bus inherited by a class that put an array of bytes onto the bus and finally a class that put an address and an array of bytes
this is rather extreme ood but it produced very clean code with each class being very small and very easy to debug
959368
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
this lets you link unit tests with bugs reports and build numbers a handy feature if you re disciplined enough to use it
nunit really is supported everywhere
our 200+ developer shop just moved away from mstest to nunit and so far we ve not encountered issues with lack of tool support in fact rather the opposite it seems that the support infrastructure around nunit is very extensive
960490
codeigniter	cakephp
Pattern(s): 
to get you started i personally think cakephp has a more elegant solution and has tighter design philosophies
codeigniter on the other hand seems more natural to pure php-ist because it s less abstract so it might be easier to pick up
to answer the titled question though i d think any huge project should roll their own from the start instead of using a framework
960573
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
to get curl to do that for you you need to use --data-urlencode instead
content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded is already default with curl -d no need for anything extra -x post is superfluous as -d implies post -d does not url encode the data
to get curl to do that for you you need to use --data-urlencode instead
961049
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
safari 4 which runs on both mac os x and windows comes with some development tools including a debugger that are very useful
if you prefer using firefox firebug provides similar functionality
jslint can help you track down simple errors
961939
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
if lazy evaluation is an issue then you probably don t want a generator expression
for example if you want to perform all your calculations up front so that you can release a resource then a list comprehension or for-loop is probably best
if you use psyco you ll get a significant speed increase for list expressions and for loops but not for generators
962806
multiplying	multiplication
Pattern(s): 
10 9 is key constant for unsigned int of 32 bits and unsigned long long int of 64 bits
the code has two parts multiplying easy and power by 2 more hard
multiplying is just multiplication and scale and propagate the integer overflow
962890
mergesort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 
it s easy to see that mergesort does as it s symmetric but reasoning about something like bubblesort or more importantly quicksort or heapsort is not
the bottom line as long as sort uses mergesort you should be reasonably safe except in corner cases at least i m hoping that 2 c n
is a corner case if not all bets are off
963204
glut	glui	glut	glui
Pattern(s): 
the first links against the native win32api libraries glut32 glu32 opengl32 also glui . those are somewhat older glut v3.7.6 opengl v1.1 glui 2.11 the second way uses the x11 libraries glut glu gl
they have newer version number in their header files note that to use gl extensions requires v1.2 glut v4 freeglut opengl v1.3 glext ... so to use the first option comile with -i usr include opengl and link against -lglut32 -lglu32 -lopengl32 to use the x11 version compile with -i usr include which is included by default and link with -lglut -lglu -lgl note the difference you could add the x11 headers and libraries but i guess their included by the gl ones
-i usr x11r6 include -l usr x11r6 lib -lxmu -lxi -lxext -lx11 in the cygwin installer the following packages are your choices opengl -- gives the win32 version of opengl glut glui libglut-devel -- x11 version of glut freeglut this will also pick all dependent packages
964160
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
adress can have a name though so composition should be used
yes. when your class b is-a class a then you can use inherited
that is in such situations it is ok to let class b be a subclassing of class a
964160
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
that is in such situations it is ok to let class b be a subclassing of class a
in situations where this relationship is not clear then you should consider composition instead of inherited
has-a relationship instead of is-a relationship
965764
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
at its heart pbkdf2 is combining salt and the password through via a hash function to produce the actual key
the hash is repeated many times so that it will be expensive and slow for an attacker to try each entry in her dictionary of most common passwords
the older version pbkdf1 can generate keys for des encryption but des and pbkdf1 aren t recommended for new applications
969881
many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 
edit in response to your comment you could do something like obviously that code won t compile but it should give you a rough idea - also i m certain it can be done in better ways but something like that should work
your problem is that your schema has the semantics of a many-to-many relationship between ad and milbase and as such the really desired way you would be wanting to do this in linq would be ad.milbases which would then hold a collection of milbases
the problem is not made any better by the fact that linq to sql does not support many-to-many relationships directly and in reality assuming that your lookup table only defines a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship you d have to do something like ad.adbases.single .milbase of course assuming there will always be one - if that s not the case then you ve got some more complicated things ahead of you
969881
many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 
the problem is not made any better by the fact that linq to sql does not support many-to-many relationships directly and in reality assuming that your lookup table only defines a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship you d have to do something like ad.adbases.single .milbase of course assuming there will always be one - if that s not the case then you ve got some more complicated things ahead of you
many-to-many etc
also - if this is not a many-to-many and you are able to do so i would really change this to be a foreign key in either milbase or the ad table
970048
int	chars	int	double	int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
the primitive data types are byte short int long float double boolean chars a data type that is a non-primitive is a reference data type which are references to objects
some examples are string int arraylist random jframe here is a simple example of the difference between the two types int i1 is a variable of the primitive data type int with the primitive int value of 10
int i2 is a variable with a reference data type of int referencing an int object which contains the value 10
971297
toolbar	tabs
Pattern(s): 
when i press tab it creates spaces instead of for tabs check the option if unchecked it will display tabs not space
this should be cover with the show invisible option from eclipse3.3 it is now possible to see the invisible whitespace characters in textual editors this feature can either be controlled via preference or via the toolbar button when the editor presentation action set is enabled
i did not tried it with pydev but its editor should be a textual editor and the option should work
971393
subclass	abstract-class
Pattern(s): 
subclasses often need more information to be put into a usable state than the abstract-class
that being said i typically make sure to implement every constructor in the base class plus add the new parameters required for the subclass
that being said unless there is good reason i d avoid having a subclass constructor with fewer parameters than the base class .
971710
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
it will fire each time the checkbox is clicked.
i ve done the same for a submit button idea as id buttonid.

972440
put	get
Pattern(s): 
i m not the best person to speak to the process but it basically consists of breaking replication to one slave running the patch on that instance turning replication back on once the alter table is completed so that it catches up on replication
once the replication catches up you put the site into maintenance mode if necessary to switch from your master to this new patched slave as the new master database
the only thing i can t remember is exactly when you point the other slaves at the new master so that they also get the alter applied
972450
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
on disk restore the original name of the directory refresh project
if you have a linked resource pointing off to some other file folder on disk with the same name in the same location in the resource tree then the real folder on disk will be hidden from the resource model
unfortunately you can t create the linked resource if the real directory is already there in the project structure
974012
daemons	launchd
Pattern(s): 
for example apache is extremely adept at handling lots of accesses at one
on the other hand if you re not already using apache or don t want to make it handle svn traffic the svnserve daemons is lightweight and quite performant
on my macs i set up svnserve using launchd to start up only when a request comes in so it doesn t use any resources when there is no repository activity
975194
vb6	vba
Pattern(s): 
this knowledgebase article explains how to do it from vba it s exactly the same in vb6
the references command is on the project menu in vb6 not the tools menu i think that s the only difference
edit this knowledgebase article explains how to do it in vb6
975480
stderr	fflush
Pattern(s): 
sometimes that buffer doesn t get fflush before your program crashes so you never see the output
two ways to avoid this use fprintf stderr error string
since stderr is not buffered
975480
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
Pattern(s): 
since stderr is not buffered
add a call to fflush stdout
after the printf call
977462
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
that said the opposite is true
if you spent the same amount of time improving your knowledge of vim you d could be just as productive
maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent
977807
integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 
c# is the language - it doesn t decide how math.round is implemented
and secondly no - if you read the docs you ll see that the default rounding is round to even banker s rounding return value type system.double the integer nearest a
if the fractions component of a is halfway between two integers one of which is even and the other odd then the even number is returned
977839
ironruby	ironpython	interpreted-language	compiled-language
Pattern(s): 
f# is a functional highly typed compiled-language
ironruby ironpython are dynamically typed interpreted-language
i believe ironpython does additionally support compilation but i m not 100 sure and less about ruby
979198
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
you ve essentially tried to swim up a waterfall
i imagine boost uses a lot of advanced c++ features like templating etc
boost libraries tend to be very complicated as they try to follow strict programming standards and styles for them to be compatible with things like the stl
979275
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 
since m_pi is a floating point number and multiplication in c is left-associative meaning it proceeds from left to right the first multiplication 2 m_pi will be promoted to a float as will each successive multiply
since cos returns a float pnumber will be assigned a float without having performed any integer division hence no loss of precision
note it s not usually wise to count on operator associativity or precedence but in this case i m just trying to demonstrate that it would in fact work. as far as the range of numbers you should expect to see recall that the cosine unmodified ranges from -1 to +1 not 0 to 1 so you would actually see -100 to 100 in theory
979622
wxpython	pyqt
Pattern(s): 
for another project which is to be delivered exclusively on .net i plan to use winforms after lots of great feedback from stackoverflow members
i choose wxpython after much research
the reasons were wxpython in action book by rappin dunn the voluminous examples that come as part of the wxpython download the number of projects that have used wxwidgets the fact that wxpython code runs equally well on linux mac os x and win32 i did consider pyqt and other researchers are successfully using it
979622
wxpython	pyqt
Pattern(s): 
the reasons were wxpython in action book by rappin dunn the voluminous examples that come as part of the wxpython download the number of projects that have used wxwidgets the fact that wxpython code runs equally well on linux mac os x and win32 i did consider pyqt and other researchers are successfully using it
after writing many examples in all api s that i considered i found wxpython ticked the most boxes for me
as for tkinter tix i think it looks rather dated. unless you are using ironpython or jython i would not consider using the associated native windowing apis
980259
pascal	delphi
Pattern(s): 
turbo pascal was one of the if not the main compilers of the dos era and delphi is still the second most sold ide in the world after visual studio so i think the dead language and teaching language bits are a bit exaggerated
note that older 1.0.x versions of the free pascal compiler sources were effectively turbo pascal compatible as in could be debugged with tp which demonstrates basic pascal capabilities
the question of use of pascal as a basic language is roughly the same as for c since they are nearly equivalent on a language level
983503
ssl	https	ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
there is no special encryption dedicated to headers https encrypts the entire message
they are encrypted in transit through ssl
there is no special encryption dedicated to headers https encrypts the entire message
984511
wxpython	pythoncard
Pattern(s): 
i know nothing about pythoncard but in wxpython one would use for events there s wx.evt_text wx.evt_char wx.evt_text_enter and more details about these can be found in the wxpython docs and also usage examples in the wxpython demo if you happen to have that
also wxpython has several types of the text entry controls and i m assuming that you re using the wxtextctrl though the docs should have info on the others as well

986412
vsto	add-in	vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
that makes a starter add-in - just paste your code and press f5 to run
vsto has no support for creating excel udfs
automation add-in can be created in .net and seem to be the microsoft approved way of doing it
988694
profiling	debugging
Pattern(s): 
for performance testing specifically i recommend firebug
being able to profiling which methods are the most expensive in terms of time has been invaluable for a number of projects i have worked on
as client-side libraries become more and more robust and more responsibility is placed client-side in general this type of debugging and profiling will only become more useful
992527
textmate	jedit	textmate	kate
Pattern(s): 
at least 8 text editors support mediawiki syntax highlighting gnu emacs eclipse vedit vim jedit kate kwrite notetab
i assume that wikipedia syntax just means mediawiki syntax. mac osx subethaedit textmate there is also a mediawiki javascript add-on called wiked that does syntax highlighting inside the mediawiki edit box

993495
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 
the struct module allows for finer-grained interpretation of binary strings
however neither is quite as rich as you require for example to present the same data as bytes or halfwords you need to copy it between two arrays the numpy third-party add-on is much more powerful for interpreting the same area of memory in several different ways and for example to display some bytes in hex there s nothing much bundled beyond a simple loop or list comprehension such as
i suspect there are reusable third-party modules to facilitate such tasks yet further but i can t point you to one.
996807
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
if you are producing a consumer application for example - most users on personal pc s have strayed away from ie6 as part of windows mac upgrades to either at least ie7 if not ie8 and safari 3 now 4
of course firefox has huge market share and the up and coming google-chrome etc crowd
the problem is - if you application is broadly audience - such as a news site - most enterprise legacy applications still run on ie6 and require it - inferring that the corporate enterprise it crowd will still run ie6
997384
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
talking to ram takes a fairly long time
it s much faster than going to the hard disk as there aren t any spinning plates or magnets involved but it s still pretty slow by the standards of a modern cpu
so when you try to read from a particular location in memory your cpu doesn t just read that one location into a register and call it good
998269
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
edit the code in the second question is missing the int in both cases but adding it makes it ok works fine and with different values for a maxhp and cat maxhp -- in this case the subclassing is not inheriting the static from the base class since so to speak it s hiding it with its own homonymous one
3 in all cases since the static int total inherited by somederivedclass is exactly the one in someclass not a distinct variable
edit actually 4 in all cases as ejames spotted and pointed out in his answer which see
998420
cvs	rcs
Pattern(s): 
cvs uses the old rcs file format and uses rcs tags both for branches and cvs tags
there s several good references for cvs
read up on tags and branches
999113
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
this made it completely unsuitable for the largely distributed development model of linux kernel
bazaar was probably too slow at least then and a bit on centralized side i guess
git is more powerfull in my opinion mercurial is simpler in people opinion and a bit more portable python
999174
kde	gnome
Pattern(s): 
there are ways to do this for both kde and gnome
the kde way is quite elegant which makes sense considering that qt is kde s toolkit
instead of using the pyqt4.qtgui class qicon you instead use the pykde4.kdeui class kicon
1000593
opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 
without explaining which or why here s the current wisdom 2009 build your site using firefox or opera on any platform
btw opera uses its own presto engine
test in whichever of the above you didn t use
1001344
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
if it is 0x00h then the system is big-endian
as explained in computer animation faq you can use the following function to see if your code is running on a little- or big-endian system collapse #define big_endian 0 #define little_endian 1 this code assigns the value 0001h to a 16-bit int
a chars pointer is then assigned to point at the first least-significant byte of the int value
1001344
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
a chars pointer is then assigned to point at the first least-significant byte of the int value
if the first byte of the int is 0x01h then the system is little-endian the 0x01h is in the lowest or least-significant address
if it is 0x00h then the system is big-endian
1002956
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
Pattern(s): 
uiview s are not pushed to and popped from the uinavigationcontroller s stack
what is being pushed and popped is uiviewcontroller which in turn handle one or more often several views each
fortunately the uiviewcontroller has these methods - void viewwillappear bool animated
1003423
pylons	turbogears
Pattern(s): 
the turbogears framework uses sqlalchemy as its default orm
pylons lets you use sqlalchemy as well
there are also ways to get django to use sqlalchemy though i ve not tried them myself
1003562
margin	font-size
Pattern(s): 
i d start by removing the padding-top on the parent and convert that into a margin-top 10px on the actual child element
if that still gives you trouble remove the margin and try a position relative on the child with a top 10px
finally try adding a overflow hidden to your parent element to force it to not budge when the font-size gets larger
1004041
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 
most rts games work using the one-hand-on-mouse-the-other-on-keyboard
they generally support using the mouse exclusively but it s not optimized for this
itunes is on the other extreme -- it relies on the mouse almost exclusively as do most drag-drop dominated uis and using the keyboard only is next to impossible
1004498
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
Pattern(s): 
in addition oracle s provider called oracle data provider for .net odp.net is a popular and viable option
note this excerpt microsoft will still make system.data.oracleclient available in .net framework 4 but it will be labeled as deprecated so go ahead and keep using it for updating existing applications where you relied on it previously
but for new development you ll want to find an alternative
1005202
super	extends
Pattern(s): 
for example if superclass holds some ui elements and you extends it and your class will hold some more ui elements
to get the size to fit your whole object you would probably call super class to calculate the size of its elements and then you add to that size the size of the elements that you added
it would not make sense otherwise - super class is not aware of your elements so it would overwritten your calculation
1005241
goto	break
Pattern(s): 
people always complain about goto s being in a language
yet i bet your last program included a type of goto
if you have ever used a break or a continue you ve used a goto
1005835
atoi	strtod	strtol	atoi	strtol	strtod
Pattern(s): 
it s a quick dirty shortcut for strtod s 0 without the error reporting
same for atoi and strtol . if a function be advertised to return an error code in the event of difficulties thou shalt check for that code yea even though the checks triple the size of thy code and produce aches in thy typing fingers for if thou thinkest it cannot happen to me the gods shall surely punish thee for thy arrogance
henry spencer ten commandments for the c programmer commandment #6
1006227
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
at least it does in a simple implementation of std string - in reality it has a more complicated structure to provide better memory use and performance
this is because a string at least in c c++ is not quite the same sort of thing as an int
if we re talking c-style strings then an array of them like what is actually happening under the hood is that test is an array of pointers each of which point to the actual data where the chars are
1008704
post	get
Pattern(s): 
realm before encrypting see rfc 2617 for how it is done in digest auth
http post is not encrypted it can be intercepted by a network sniffer by a proxy or leaked in the logs of the server with a customised logging level
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure
1008704
post	get
Pattern(s): 
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure
to secure a password or other confidential data you must use ssl or encrypt the data before you post
another option would be to use digest authentication with the browser see rfc 2617
1008716
internationalization	translation
Pattern(s): 
or imagine some localized windows with a translation of my documents that uses non-ascii characters
that would be internationalization that has though you don t support internationalization at all have effects on your software
also having the option of supporting internationalization later is always a good thing
1009949
division	addition
Pattern(s): 
but really jvanderh s answer most expresses what you want to do because it allows for easy addition of cases in the future that don t break on a multiple of 50 and don t require future maintainers to follow the math or know about the operator
albertein is onto something but to do integer division like that in vb.net you have to write it like this notice the backwards division symbol
from there you can select case range
1011238
bazaar	git	bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
git article but in the end it all comes down to what you are looking for in term of feature-rich code management
if by code management you are referring to file and directories and renaming go with bazaar
if by code management you are looking at content management git is designed to manage just that the staging area for instance allows you to record what current content you want to commit even though you have already begun to make some large modification you end up not wanting to commit in the current branch to be sure re-read linus s original vision for git back in april 2005
1011888
padding	right-align
Pattern(s): 
to save you some time i ll explain the string that i m using parameter zero 19 should be formatted using a magic 0 to indicate that i want 0-padded right-align number with 10 digits of precision in binary format
you can use this syntax to achieve a variety of creative versions of alignment and padding

1012719
merb	ruby-on-rails
Pattern(s): 
it is not considered lightweight though and has a lot of dependencies included stuff you might not want to use
merb is more lightweight has a plugin architecture and is somewhat cleaner but it s doumentation is almost non-existent and searching for merb based stuff on the net will get you 0.x based answers from which most of are out of date
if you re starting with ruby based web projects use ruby-on-rails
1013561
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
that way the files are part of the project and get added to the bin folder automatically
you won t be able to if your bin folder is included in your project
instead you can put your browser definition files in your project under a separate folder or just under the project and change the build action to content or none and copy to output directory to copy always or copy if newer in the properties for each file you want to go to your bin folder
1013561
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
instead you can put your browser definition files in your project under a separate folder or just under the project and change the build action to content or none and copy to output directory to copy always or copy if newer in the properties for each file you want to go to your bin folder
that way the files are part of the project and get added to the bin folder automatically

1016440
post	get
Pattern(s): 
suppose you were writing a program that wanted to read and interact with the blog programmatically
you might want all the post given in xml rather than having to scrape the html for information
get post 4.xml is intuitive server please give me xml describing post #4. the response will be that xml
1017309
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
i don t know how good it works there but as lieven wrote delphi comes with a command line compiler
i just don t have any experience how it works with third-party compnents but i think delphi supports msbuild in the latest versioning
i m also unsure whether including thiry-party components into versioning control is a good thing because of the space it takes - though you can also put them somewhere else and include them as external which makes it much smaller but also imposes the problem that upgrading the components for one app will upgrade them for all - so you better have good integration tests
1018476
cppcheck	pc-lint
Pattern(s): 
if it needs to be free open source your choices dwindle
cppcheck is free and will check for unused private functions
i don t think that it looks for things like uninstantiated classes like pc-lint
1018881
alloca	malloc
Pattern(s): 
however if the thing you want to alloc using alloca is reasonably small i think that it s a good technique that s faster and more convenient than using malloc or otherwise
in other words alloca 0x00ffffff is dangerous and likely to cause overflow exactly as much as is
be cautious and reasonable and you ll be fine
1019215
bazaar	svn
Pattern(s): 
reasonable learning curve for developers used to clearcase the gui can be a factor to alleviate the learning curve but a dvcs is very different from clearcase as this core concepts answer illustrates
windows development they all work well on the windows platform with maybe a slight advantage better integration to mercurial or bazaar
issue tracker integration probably going to be redmine though it isn t set in stone redmine supports now most of them and not just svn as it did at the beginning
1019823
nsscanner	nsnumberformatter	nsscanner	nsstring
Pattern(s): 
consistent centralized apis that simplify formatting and parsing phone numbers for a variety of locales
currently you have to roll your own with an nsnumberformatter or nsscanner and the process is tedious and error-prone
for example see nsnumberformatter to format us telephone numbers and remove all but numbers from nsstring . of course i m definitely a fan of a wide variety of data structures in general although cocoa s simplicity is refreshing compared with some languages
1019915
subclass	inherited	subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
you can use the type object to dynamically construct a class given a name tuple of base classes and dict of methods class attributes eg mysub is now a subclass of drvcrystalfontz and some_other_class inherited their methods and adds a new one some_extra_method
i m not sure i m clear on your desired use here but it is possible to subclass dynamically
you can use the type object to dynamically construct a class given a name tuple of base classes and dict of methods class attributes eg mysub is now a subclass of drvcrystalfontz and some_other_class inherited their methods and adds a new one some_extra_method
1020275
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
third check how good your source control is for branching and merging
for example cvs is notoriously very poor for this kind of operation
svn cvs done right as they claim is somewhat better
1020862
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 
to mutate a tree i create a brand new one with new node i want -- this is very efficient because i don t need to make a copy of every node in the tree i can reuse the old ones in my new tree
using a more significant example i also wrote this sql parser which is totally stateless or at least my code is stateless i don t know whether the underlying lexing library is stateless
stateless programming is just as expressive and powerful as stateful programming it just requires a little practice to train yourself to start thinking statelessly
1021335
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
by default the temporary asp.net files directory is available to users administrators iis_usr system and trustedinstaller -- which is to say just about everyone
try out matthewmartin s advice of the different compilation folder
and then limit the limitedpermissioncompilationdir folder to just the users and groups who need permission -- say iis_usr if you re running on iis or your own account if you are compiling for the file-based webserver
1022042
hide	show
Pattern(s): 
i don t think the standard dialog accepts flags which control which drives are show
having said that there is systemwide group policy that can be used to hide drives from all common file dialogs but this would impact all applications
if you re building a kiosk keep in mind that bad guys attack these things pretty regularly
1022596
fgets	strlen
Pattern(s): 
with the function signature given in the question you avoid calling strlen twice per line of input
note the use of fgets even in test programs it is a bad idea to use gets
the downside of fgets compared to gets is that fgets does not remove the trailing newline where gets does
1022972
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
the loops would exit two or three times faster if it was
the results change in the sample code you posted because in that version the for-loop now has an implicit type conversion
i left assignments out of my loops to avoid that. of course one could argue that it s okay to have an extra cast in the for-loop because real code would need it anyway but to me that s just another way of saying there s no general answer
1024141
gtk	fltk
Pattern(s): 
c++ is particularly well supported
apparently gtk has native osx widget support though i ve never used it so you could skip the x11 stack altogether if you desired
other cross platform widget sets include wxwidgets fltk and tk
1025627
inherited	base-class	inherited	base-class
Pattern(s): 
let s say t base-class is of type stream and u is of type memorystream inherited class you cannot assign a stream to a variable of type memorystream
your code boils down to the line where you try to assign a baseclass to an inherited class which is impossible
let s say t base-class is of type stream and u is of type memorystream inherited class you cannot assign a stream to a variable of type memorystream
1025655
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
that would also let you map additional data in the product class that is not part of the iproduct interface and also let you map additional iproduct implementations in the same way if you wish to
you could map the interface- implementation relationship as an inherited relationship using an appropriate inherited model
that would mean mapping iproduct and then creating a subclassing map of product in the iproduct mapping for example using table-per-hierarchy
1025921
expression-blend	silverlight
Pattern(s): 
with the new silverlight 3 you can use the writablebitmap to do image cropping
as far as i know there s no way to crop an image directly in expression-blend
blend is not an image editing application
1026098
ucfirst	capitalize	ucfirst	substr	capitalize	uppercase	capitalize	substr
Pattern(s): 
however in javascript when you take a substr of an empty string you just get an empty string back
here is a function called ucfirst short for uppercase first letter you can capitalize a string by calling ucfirst some string -- for example it works by splitting the string into two pieces
on the first line it pulls out firstletter and then on the second line it capitalises firstletter by calling firstletter.touppercase and joins it with the rest of the string which is found by calling str.substr 1
1026810
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
Pattern(s): 
as guid.empty is usually used when there is no defined value at all there isn t really any value that can be outside of the range
the situation is similar to when you use argumentnullexception except there is no specific exception for empty values
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit
1029302
xlib	xdotool
Pattern(s): 
xdotool lets you programatically or manually simulate keyboard input and mouse activity move and resize windows etc
it does this using x11 s xtest extension and other xlib functions
e.g
1030165
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
actually with the rise of frameworks like servlets ejbs etc i find this problem to be rather common. also a lot has been written recently about over-reliance on inherited as an anti-pattern
in java inherited is a scarce resource for each class you only get to do it once
you should reserve inherited for things that are genuinely subclassing not just to add some functionality here and there
1030414
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
there are lots of ways to do this and lots of ways to do this wrong
postgresql is probably the right database
it s a little more enterprisy than mysql
1030559
width	height	width	height
Pattern(s): 
edit to answer your question the correct design should probably be that both rectangle and square derive from a common polygon or shape class which does not enforce any rules regarding width or height
i believe the reasoning is something like this let s say you have a method that accepts a rectangle and adjusts its width it should be perfectly reasonable given what a rectangle is to assume that this test would pass .
because changing a rectangle s width does not affect its height

vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
i get the impression that emacs does a better job as ide for more languages
vim has first-class support for c and c++ as an ide
you even have a visual debugger with clewn and gdb
1034717
vb.net	vb6
Pattern(s): 
to maintain some semblence of compatibility just like the way vb6 handles non-lazy evaluation of the if statement this has been carried over into vb.net
fortunately as ocdecio points out there were other similar peccadillos which have not been carried forward into vb.net such as the set statement for assigning objects to variables

1035179
scons	autotools
Pattern(s): 
everyone i ve seen that uses ant for c advocates calling out to gcc with exec tasks
scons is better but cross compiling is not its strong point
it is not a build system like cmake or autotools either it is only a build tool
1035522
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
i find this to be more readable
later in the script the use of single brackets for int addition is not recommended
the single brackets are evaluating an expression to a boolean
1036129
gprof	shark
Pattern(s): 
the behaviour described here is exactly what i am experiencing
it looks like gprof has been broken on osx for quite some time
i ve resorted to shark which has been helpfully suggested by dave rigby
1037510
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
indeed firebug in firefox shows the computed style for this element as having 0px for marginleft and marginright but this is non-zero in safari
as expected changing from margin-left to marginleft makes no difference nor does accessing the attribute directly like .container_16 not first 0 .style.marginleft because firefox is computing it wrong in the first place
sorry i don t have an answer but hopefully this will lead you in the right direction
1039395
salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
use instead
you didn t salt the password
also md5 is considered not strong enough for hashing passwords
1039477
nexus	artifactory	nexus	artifactory
Pattern(s): 
p i ve used both nexus and artifactory
the interface for nexus is a lot more robust it s a lot more configurable and of course written by sonatype who repesents pretty much everything maven well
that being said artifactory is decent and workable
1039477
nexus	artifactory	nexus	artifactory
Pattern(s): 
that being said artifactory is decent and workable
a review of nexus vs
artifactory oh my
1040083
int	chars	int	chars	int	double
Pattern(s): 
since it s a chars each of your floats is actually receiving the bit pattern 00001010 00001010 00001010 00001010
casting a double to an int just creates the binary number 00001010 10 in binary and that is the value that is memset ed
since it s a chars each of your floats is actually receiving the bit pattern 00001010 00001010 00001010 00001010
1041003
aggregate-functions	sum
Pattern(s): 
you may only reference non-aggregate values single-row values in an aggregate-functions or in the where clause so the solution would involve placing your case inside an aggregate-functions in this case your sum
bear in mind that the result of a group by statement or of a statement where one or columns uses an aggregate-functions has each row containing a summary of other rows
the case expression you re using is dependent on values of individual rows rather than summaries
1042071
put	get
Pattern(s): 
that seems like a terribly convoluted way to get what is otherwise a simple app on the phone to avoid the us 400 purchase of a used mac mini
there is the hackintosh route which may work on your existing hardware but again one has to put a price on time
it s what got me started before i dropped big coin on a macbook pro an msi wind then a home-built
1042498
int	double
Pattern(s): 
see also double precision and what every scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic
from here the internal representation of all numbers including int uses double-precision floating-point numbers
on most modern systems these are in ieee 754 standard format
1043184
integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 
you can enforce non-integer division on int arguments by explicitly casting at least one of the arguments to a floating-point type
int is an integer type
dividing two ints performs an integer division the fractions part is truncated since it can t be stored in the result type also int
1043290
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	informix
Pattern(s): 
it is more or less standardized and used by almost all relational database management systems sql server oracle mysql postgresql db2 informix etc
pl sql is a proprietary procedural language used by oracle pl postgresql is a procedural language used by postgresql tsql is a proprietary procedural language used by microsoft in sql server
procedural languages are designed to extend sql s abilities while being able to integrate well with sql
1045521
actionscript	haxe
Pattern(s): 
in addition haxe utilizes some hidden new bytecodes that came into being with flash player 10 that currently neither flash or flex utilize - only adobe s alchemy which cross-compiles from c c++ source into swcs
the only gotcha that i know of is that it s kind of bizzaro actionscript - things are just enough different that it will trip you up a fair amount
that being said with features like generics and faster code that s small price to pay
1045742
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
click the insert.
button next to the bottom list box in the dialog that shows up
in this dialog choose systemroot microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 aspnet_isapi.dll as the executable and make sure to un-check verify that file exists checkbox since the files to be requested don t live in your virtual directory
1045938
width	margin	width	margin
Pattern(s): 
in other words your report s body s width plus the report s left margin plus the report s right margin must be smaller than or equal to the report s pagesize s width
so...if your margins are too wide or if your report s body is too wide or if the pagesize s width is too narrow the rendered result is forced to be broken down to multiple pages in order to fit
for example if my report s body has width 7.75 my left margin is 0.5 my right margin is 0.5 and the width specified in the pagesize is 8.5 my report will always use 2 pages for each 1 page of data
1045938
width	margin
Pattern(s): 
for example if my report s body has width 7.75 my left margin is 0.5 my right margin is 0.5 and the width specified in the pagesize is 8.5 my report will always use 2 pages for each 1 page of data
the 7.75 width of the body plus 0.5 +0.5 for the margins add up to 8.75 which is larger than the 8.5 available in my page
so the first 7.5 or so of each page of my report s body will be shown in the first page and the rest will be split down to the next page
1046373
haskell	agda	erlang	agda
Pattern(s): 
guaranteed to make your head explode or double your money back
i m amused that ancient work like ml caml haskell and erlang is being passed off as new. scala is genuinely new and f# is an attempt to adapt an old language ml into the .net framework and is bound to be interesting
if you want something really new agda is the new haskell
1047523
allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
if your type is closely related to a specific container a typedef of that container can be useful as the stl pattern uses many nested typedefs you can easily access v value_type below
this has the added advantage of requiring less change as your code evolves using a different allocator the second template parameter to vector requires just one edit

1047730
imagemagick	wand	imagemagick	wand
Pattern(s): 
you can use either of two c apis the low-level magickcore or the more high level magick wand
imagemagick supports bmp
you can use either of two c apis the low-level magickcore or the more high level magick wand
1048912
perl	tcl
Pattern(s): 
and that can be directly attributable to the excellent api and the power of perl obviously
the well documented c api also allowed easy integration in perl
my experience with tcl tk goes back to 1995 but in 2000 or so i discovered perl tk and never looked back
1049247
des	aes	des	aes
Pattern(s): 
aes is approved by the nsa for all of its top-secret operations
des is insecure
use aes
1050895
teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 
before that i used plain nant
the teamcity server realy changed things because now everybody in the team understands what is going on on the buildserver
it is free for up to 20 project configurations
1051731
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
Pattern(s): 
for example a numberformatexception which can be thrown when handling some unparsable string to the integer.parseint method is an unchecked-exception so it does not need to be caught
however the method calling that method may want its caller to properly handle such a problem so it may throw another exception which is checked not a subclass of runtimeexception . in the above example a numberformatexception is caught in the try - catch block and a new badinputexception which is intended to be a checked exception is thrown
any caller to the getintegerfrominput method will be forced to catch a badinputexception and forced to deal with bad inputs
1051849
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
often it doesn t though so you can get into complicated calculations of how a browser calculates how much space it needs
if all its children are percentage width then it ll often end up having less width than the designer usually intends
so when you see margin-left -100 that basically means move this element outside its parent to the left the complete width of the parent
1053520
xna	slimdx
Pattern(s): 
i have some experience in creating games with gdi+ and xna and i can understand that gdi+ is giving you trouble
if i where you i d check out xna it s much faster than gdi+ because it actually uses your video card for drawing and it has a lot of good documentation and examples online
slimdx also looks good but i don t have any experience with it
1054302
put	get
Pattern(s): 
however pointers and arrays in c are indeed different
put simply the pointer to type t is not same as the array of type t
please have a look at c faq discussing pointers arrays to get a better understanding of this
1054538
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
of course the non-portable assumption is that chars is 8 bit and short is 16 bit
it is also assumed that index 6 does not overflow int . there might be a penalty for reading a short crossing a 16 bit boundary though
there used to be such issues way back when i was still keeping track of such things
1057619
opera	google-chrome
Pattern(s): 
google-chrome google-chrome 1 supports xml xslt and xpath
opera opera 9 supports xml xslt and xpath
opera 8 supports only xml + css
1059733
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
do this before attempting to import the project into intelij
i would use maven
creating a maven pom.xml file to create a war is almost trivial and you can easily override the the default locations for your src conf and web content to match you existing src directory
1059733
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
creating a maven pom.xml file to create a war is almost trivial and you can easily override the the default locations for your src conf and web content to match you existing src directory
then test the build by deploying your newly maven created war to tomcat
i wouldn t think this first task would take more than a half day at most a full day
1060431
globalization	localization
Pattern(s): 
.net localization has worked great on the projects i ve used it for without modification of the core principles
for example the features you ve listed can be done with the asp.net globalization framework
all your translations are gathered in your resource .resx files
1060445
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if i had to guess i d say that the perl script is not properly specifying the directory files that need to be updated and svn is defaulting to the current working directory which is not a working copy
the subversion client says skipped when you try to update something that is not part of a working copy not a folder file that was checked out
if i had to guess i d say that the perl script is not properly specifying the directory files that need to be updated and svn is defaulting to the current working directory which is not a working copy
1061522
uninstall	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
since a minor upgrade does not uninstall the product but merely reinstalls it
this allows you to fix whatever was wrong in the uninstall sequence before it is called
2 hotfix there is a very small tweak required for a very large product
1062066
yacc	bison
Pattern(s): 
the quality of the results of a parsing effort depends on your perl coding style
i think the quote below sums up the theoretical side very well. from wikipedia perl in wikipedia perl has a turing-complete grammar because parsing can be affected by run-time code executed during the compile phase. 25 therefore perl cannot be parsed by a straight lex yacc lexer parser combination
instead the interpreter implements its own lexer which coordinates with a modified bison parser to resolve ambiguities in the language
1062629
pytables	recarray
Pattern(s): 
accessing the data as a numpy recarray again is as simple as the hdf library takes care of reading in the relevant chunks of data and converting to numpy
pytables and numpy are the way to go
pytables will store the data on disk in hdf format with optional compression
1062852
subclass	superclass	subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
is there functionality in the superclass that is publicly accessible only through the constructor
but it may be better to hide that behaviour behind a normal method rather than a subclass constructor
but that s still not as good as fixing the superclass
1064428
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
operators to cost zero asm instructions even with an optimizing compiler
it is usually true that int i t is usually optimized away completely
or even signed chars c t
1066034
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 
depending on what you want to do you may want to use viewwillappear or viewdidappear instead
the viewdidload method is only called when the view is first loaded from the nib file
if the view was already loaded and you push the view again it will not fire again
1067520
profiling	debugging
Pattern(s): 
he says do less stuff. and always profile the release build - profiling the debugging build is generally a wasted effort
profiling by stopping in the debugger is not a reliable way to get timings as you ve discovered
free trial fully functional
1067927
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
this would then require you to special case the logic so that rather than trying to blanket convert.todatetime you check for string.empty and pass dbnull.value to the database instead
add some client-side validation to check for the textbox being empty and refuse to submit the form if it is
accompany this with a validation check server-side that confirms the passed-in value is non-null and also a valid date and then fails the save and returns an error message to the user when a valid date is not present
1068025
stdout	stderr	stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
if you are showing the help text because there was a problem with parsing the command line arguments then you might use stderr
always stdout makes it easier to pipe to less grep it etc
if you are showing the help text because there was a problem with parsing the command line arguments then you might use stderr
1069365
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
one of the most common things to do is replacing this query with this one in some rdbms s like postgresql distinct and group by use the different execution plans so sometimes it s better to replace one with the other vs
select mo.grouper sum col from mytable group by mo.grouper in postgresql distinct sorts and group by hashes
mysql lacks full outer join so it can be rewritten as folloing vs
1070240
rundll32	regsvr32
Pattern(s): 
always use full path to your-com-dll when you issue regsvr32 commands if you have the same dll somewhere else in path for example c windows system32 regsvr32 will use the other dll and not the one in your current directory
another trick would be to use rundll32 your-com-dll dllregisterserver
in case of missing dlls it will tell which dll is missing instead of just saying that loadlibrary failed
1071015
django	web.py	django	web2py
Pattern(s): 
for more on lightweight python frameworks check out this question
as far as full frameworks go i believe django is relatively small
if you really want lightweight though check out web.py cherrypy pylons and web2py
1071040
django	web2py	django	turbogears	turbogears	web2py	turbogears	cherrypy	pylons	web2py	pylons	cherrypy	pylons	turbogears
Pattern(s): 
for pylons there is also an interesting pylons book available online
there are a couple of web frameworks available in python that will relieve you from most of the work django pylons and the new turbogears based on it
web2py cherrypy and the old turbogears based on it i do not feel django as big as you say
1071040
pylons	web2py	pylons	cherrypy	pylons	turbogears
Pattern(s): 
web2py cherrypy and the old turbogears based on it i do not feel django as big as you say
however i think that pylons and cherrypy may be a better answer to your question
cherrypy seems simpler
1071040
pylons	cherrypy
Pattern(s): 
cherrypy seems simpler
but seems also a bit passé while pylons is under active development
for pylons there is also an interesting pylons book available online
1071790
expander	togglebutton
Pattern(s): 
using mole we can see that the togglebutton has an ellipse - representing the circle a path - representing the arrow and the contentpresenter which displays what you set for the header property
alt text now that we know the actual layout of the expander there s a few ways we could go about modifying it
creating a brand new controltemplate for the expander or getting the parts we want to remove and removing hiding them
1072414
aggregate-functions	sum	aggregate-functions	coalesce	sum	coalesce	min	max
Pattern(s): 

a few things to focus on that will exercise a lot of areas of sql that you should know if you re going to be writing a lot of it joins - inner and outer difference between left and right join group by clause and working with aggregate-functions such as sum min max etc
where - for filtering records returned in a query subqueries - subqueries and correlated subqueries case coalesce between convert cast functions statements find a good data set and try to run some meaningful queries on it
1072508
apache	nginx	apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 
apache s crucial because it s the most popular one but maybe you should also look at nginx which is also deservedly popular though still a niche player compared to apache and focused on one-master many-workers processes architecture
apache should be fine -- it can be configured in either multi-process or multi-thread ways after all and of course it can be built with all static links
apache s crucial because it s the most popular one but maybe you should also look at nginx which is also deservedly popular though still a niche player compared to apache and focused on one-master many-workers processes architecture
1072558
viewdidload	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 
viewwillappear is called after viewdidload and called before anything is displayed - it gets called each time where viewdidload only gets called when your view objects are created
viewdidload is the first method called when all of the objects in your view have been created
initwithcoder is called before any of them are
1073169
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 
free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc
otherwise or if free ptr has already been called before undefined behavior occurs
if ptr is null no operation is performed
1073182
ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
edit you might want to try a vmware player and try a few linux distributions to play around in before you install the dual boot
ubuntu seems to be very user-friendly and has a lot of specific information for it in forums etc
so support-wise you ll be covered
1074663
pthreads	fork	pthreads	fork
Pattern(s): 
fork handlers may be established by means of the pthread_atfork function in order to maintain application invariants across fork calls
threads on linux nowadays tries to stay pthreads complient
only the calling thread is replicated not other threads note that on solaris you can chose what fork does depending on what library you link to from a process shall be created with a single thread
1074697
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
this value is inserted into the form which is then submitted to the same server the server stores the results of the form under the key of the specified token client creates server fetches the form results for abc123 and returns then as json
for cross-domain communication there is no easy client-side way for you to retrieve results
server-side support would be required - exposing additional services that you can hit on the client for example by embedding a element into the page
1075150
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	isnull
Pattern(s): 
it should be noted that with two arguments isnull works the same as coalesce which you could use if you have a few values to test - coalesce in_my_field1 otherval null
coalesce also returns after the first non-null which means it s marginally faster if you expect my_field1 to be blank
however i find isnull much more readable so that s why i used it here
1076017
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
since you don t know the actual types before runtime you can dynamically add attribute overrides to the xmlserializer
you just need to know the list of types that inherited from a
for instance if you use a as a properties of another class you can dynamically apply xmlelementattribute s for each derived type to that properties this is just a very basic example but it shows how to apply xml serialization attributes at runtime when you can t do it statically
1076398
ienumerable	iqueryable
Pattern(s): 
if you want the first item of a linq query try using the first firstordefault single or singleordefault methods
ienumerable is not indexable
neither is iqueryable
1077452
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
and all work fine in netbeans
if you using maven this is easy if you don t i recommend you look on it netbeans 6.7 has great maven support
simply add such dependency also you need add jboss repository to main pom.xml
1077682
accessor	ivar
Pattern(s): 
note that you can reopen any existing class and make a private ivar into a reader
since an accessor is just a method you can do computer.new 4 .send var_that_evaluates_to_cpus

1078952
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
get would also be possible but clients and servers allow just a limited url length something like 2048 characters
if you want to send an arbitrary amount of data to your server post is the only reliable method to do that
get would also be possible but clients and servers allow just a limited url length something like 2048 characters
1079384
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
Pattern(s): 
source
getordinal performs a case-sensitive lookup first
if it fails a second case-insensitive search is made
1080147
nsimageview	cgimage
Pattern(s): 
it is often useful when the actual type of image is not important for what you re trying to do
it is also the only image class that appkit will accept in its apis nsimageview and so forth
cgimage can only represent bitmaps
1080417
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
you can find more information in the follow msdn article accessibility levels c#
the accessibility levels in c# are as follows public access is not restricted
protected access is limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class
1081130
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
Pattern(s): 
we use svn at work
i have been using bazaar and bzr-svn to do all my interaction with and it works wonderfully
my workflow is something like hack hack hack repeat when i m ready yes instead of updating you have and commit change possibly shelving what you are working on but local commits are a very nice thing and shelving is too shelving is like revert with a save i think git handles this as well
1081349
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
it is better to think of it as an out-of-band sentinel value
in c eof is usually -1 and the associated api specifies int return values so that eof is guaranteed to never be confused with a valid in-band value
here s some more proof do this on unix typing v d inserts a control-d chars literally into the file
1081696
verilog	vhdl
Pattern(s): 
i started out with vhdl then learned verilog and am now pro verilog
verilog is much easier to learn and simpler syntax
its also a newer language
1081696
verilog	vhdl
Pattern(s): 
its also a newer language
secondly most people use verilog
vhdl has many datatypes which give it a learning curve
1082201
nsmutablestring	nsstring
Pattern(s): 
you cannot modify an instance of nsstring it is immutable
if you have an nsmutablestring is has a method called deletecharactersinrange that can modify the string in place

1082338
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
unless you re really concerned with the speed using the properties is probably your best bet
using the accessor self.bar is translated into a method call self bar
the period syntax is just for looks
1083320
int	double
Pattern(s): 

once stored in an int it has zero decimals left clearly
a double is stored in a binary form so no obvious or simple relation to decimals either
1083980
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 
in c++ this is not so useful because c++ was designed to make definition of new types easier and more complete than c at least at the beginnings of c++ and the typedef is not even necessary to refer to a previously declared struct or class
the typedef version is a special case of typedef foo bar
which defines a new type bar as an alias for foo
1084104
photoshop	paint.net
Pattern(s): 
finally you could always run paint.net in a virtual machine
as gary suggested photoshop is best but it does cost quite a lot
pixelmator is about the closest application to photoshop that isn t photoshop it has a decent ui on os x compared to gimp and should contain everything you mention
1084905
min	max	minimum	max
Pattern(s): 
after that it s plain sailing anydict.pop somekey returns the value corresponding to the key and also removes it from anydict
min anydict returns the minimum key in the dictionary
note the sentinel idiom at this says that the year one after the max one is always deemed to be a change-year with a dummy placeholder value of none so that the last set of rows is always written properly with a maximum year of max_year + 1 - 1 that is exactly max_year as desired
1085680
m2e	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
it is now possible to import maven projects directly without mvn eclipse eclipse and it turns out that the root pom.xml is also imported as a project which is excactly what i wanted
i tried this again with galileo and the latest version of m2e
it is now possible to import maven projects directly without mvn eclipse eclipse and it turns out that the root pom.xml is also imported as a project which is excactly what i wanted
1086288
uitableview	nsindexpath	uitableview	nsindexpath	uitableview	uisearchbar	uisearchbar	nsindexpath	uisearchbar	nsindexpath
Pattern(s): 
the searchbar isn t counted as a row in the tableview so if you scroll the top of the tableview to the first row it hides the searchbar or in swift yourtableview.scrolltorowatindexpath nsindexpath forrow 0 insection 0 atscrollposition uitableviewscrollposition.top animated false make sure to not scroll the tableview before it contains data scrolltorowatindexpath will raise an exception if the given indexpath does not point to a valid row if the tableview is empty
first make sure to add the uisearchbar to the tableheaderview of the uitableview so that it gets scrolled with the table s content and isn t fixed to the top of the view
the searchbar isn t counted as a row in the tableview so if you scroll the top of the tableview to the first row it hides the searchbar or in swift yourtableview.scrolltorowatindexpath nsindexpath forrow 0 insection 0 atscrollposition uitableviewscrollposition.top animated false make sure to not scroll the tableview before it contains data scrolltorowatindexpath will raise an exception if the given indexpath does not point to a valid row if the tableview is empty
1086649
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
for completeness here is my very brief test harness
this should do the job for enum types with any underlying types convert.toint64 is used because a 64-bit int is the widest integral type possible to which all enum values can be cast even ulong
note that chars is not a valid underlying type
1088052
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
the sever still needs to check whether the hash is correct or not and authenticate the session
you can implement your hashing algorithm client side in javascript and send only the user name and hash result over the wire
note that in order for this to be secure the hash must be salt with a string provided by the server and the string must be unique for every request
1088052
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
note that in order for this to be secure the hash must be salt with a string provided by the server and the string must be unique for every request
the sever still needs to check whether the hash is correct or not and authenticate the session

1088439
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
after a few days you ll find yourself getting grumpy every time you have to reach for the mouse or hit 15 times when you re in a gui editor
vim s my poison
i m sure emacs offers similar gains the biggest gain not needing to touch the mouse
1088705
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
many of these points apply equally well to emacs in different but usually equally-powerful ways
for vim vim has better integration with other tools shell commands scripts compilers version control systems ctags etc. than most editors
even something simple like
1088705
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
lots of editors handle different file encodings ok but vim gives you very specific and foolproof ways of setting file encodings and converting between them
the very first thing that impressed me about vim is how perfectly it handles tab space indentation options and unix dos linebreaks compared to other editors that i had problems with at the time
many of these points apply equally well to emacs in different but usually equally-powerful ways
1088933
hash	md5	hash	hmac
Pattern(s): 
if they send you a long string or file and a hmac you can compute the hmac yourself compare your hmac and theirs and if they match the data was not corrupted in transit nor was the data tampered with
md5 is not encryption - it s a hash
it doesn t allow a string to be decrypted
1088933
hash	md5	hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
md5 is an unkeyed hash function - there is not key in use at all
so let s say the server sends you a giant string or a file and a hash of it
you would then md5 the string or file and compare the hash you computed with the hash they sent
1089392
exponent	addition
Pattern(s): 
then since the mantissa ended greater than two we normalized the result by bumping the exponent
it s just like when we adjust the exponent after doing an operation on numbers in decimal scientific notation
in each case the values that we worked with had a finite representation in binary and so the values output by the basic multiplication and addition operations also produced values with a finite representation
1091876
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 
just because you can create tables in a graphical tool doesn t necessarily mean you should
i think a decision on the relative merits of the two approaches might take into account factors such as the frequency of changes to the schema the frequency with which changes need to be propagated to other schemas test user acceptance production clients n etc the degree to which the schema may vary across development branches how well-known in advance your various changes can be scheduled whether or not you can generate sql diff scripts between schemas
on balance i tend to prefer to work with a script for each change or migration
1092119
shadowing	named
Pattern(s): 
if you can avoid it though you should since it may cause confusion
shadowing is not really a java only term
in any instance where a variable declared in a scope has the same named as one in a bigger scope that variable is shadowed
1094596
hide	show
Pattern(s): 
with this scheme if a form is never show to the user it s location will never be restored or saved
whenever the user dismisses hide closes makes invisible whatevers a form save its location
and only at this point in time
1096596
murmurhash	md5
Pattern(s): 
then again md5 is by no means fast or secure so i wouldn t bother with it at all
if you want blinding speed with good distribution but no pretence of security you could try the 64-bit versions of murmurhash
see for details and code
1098342
width	height
Pattern(s): 
you could do something like the equal height column trick
for width it s easy simply remove the width 100 rule
by default the div will stretch to fit the parent container
1098467
hash	salt	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
so long as you use a unique salt for each row then the salt will prevent slow down an attack
the attacker will need to mount a brute force attack rather than using rainbow tables against the password hash
as mentioned in the comments you should ensure that the salt is a sensible size
1099359
udp	mtu
Pattern(s): 
so if you do not know the mtu on your particular network path it is best to leave a reasonable margin for other header information that you may not have anticipated
a 512-byte udp payload is generally considered to do that although even that does not leave quite enough space for a maximum size ip header

1099695
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp
read this udp is useful for broadcasting information in a publish-subscribe kind of application
iirc tibco makes heavy use of udp for notification of state change
1099712
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
cheers
udp is a connection-less protocol and used in applications like snmp simple network management protocol dns domain name system where data packets arriving out of order unreliability and not of concern and immediate send through of the data packet matters
since udp does not involve connection establishment there fore applications like dns where connection establishment delays needs to be avoided udp is preferred over tcp
1099807
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
and if you take shortcuts like assuming a tcp packet received is the complete packet that was sent are you better off
udp has lower overhead as stated already is good for streaming things like video and audio where it is better to just lose a packet then try to resend and catch up
there are no guarantees on tcp delivery you are simply supposed to be told if the socket disconnected or basically if the data is not going to arrive
1099870
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
see techrepublic article understanding tcp over tcp effects of tcp tunneling on end-to-end throughput and latency
in some cases which others have highlighted guaranteed arrival of packets isn t important and hence using udp is fine
there are other cases where udp is preferable to tcp
1100454
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
for a quick take on the topic of rest consider this post the funny thing is that most people debate the merits of put v post
the get v post issue is and always has been very well settled
ignore it at your own peril
1100553
itextsharp	sharppdf
Pattern(s): 
here s the shortlist itextsharp sharppdf report.net nfop and siberix report writer
ultimately i went with siberix but i now think itextsharp would have been the better choice
if it is helpful you can find out a bit more here
1100554
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 
the two queries you are unioning together must be separate and distinct
when you think about this it makes sense since all a union really does is serially splice the output from the two queries together

1100868
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
however if you need guaranteed delivery of packets with no loss and in the right sequence then tcp is probably what you want
on the other hand udp is appropriate for transmitting short packets of information where the sequence of the information is less important or where the data can fit into a single packet
it s also appropriate when you want to broadcast the same information to many users
1101645
ndepend	fxcop
Pattern(s): 
as for code metrics you can use fxcop to at least identify methods with relatively high cyclomatic complexity
ndepend is a pretty slick package and whatever you find to replace it won t be quite as smooth or integrated but.
reflector is probably one of the best tools to build on there s a few dependency graphing addins for it that can provide some of the diagramming tools
1101655
gprof	shark
Pattern(s): 
update it appears as though gprof is now working on mac os x 10.6 snow leopard using the latest developer tools
unfortunately gprof does not work on mac os x
you ll probably want to use shark instead
1102170
textarea	textbox
Pattern(s): 
textareas are very little customizable since what you re after is changing part of the content
you can t add tags inside a textarea which makes it impossible to only change part of the text
if you look at the editor here in so you write normal text inside a textarea and it is then transformed in the box below it so you ll see the asterix inside the textbox but in the box below it ll transform special characters by regexing them with tags
1102696
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
the same applies for deserialization
if you want to ensure that the serializable of your objects doesn t break then by all means unit test
if you read the msdn docs for the xmlserializer class the xmlserializer cannot serialize or deserialize the following arrays of arraylist arrays of list t there is also a peculiar issue with enums declared as unsigned longs
1103211
range	max
Pattern(s): 
since 0 alpha 255 you know that each output is bound by max 255 a x y 255 b x y
and since your output range is the same as both input range 0-255 this is ok
with a small loss of precision you could calculate
1103942
cpu	affinity
Pattern(s): 
that s its job
it s interesting to note that threads can swap between cores quite frequently in the course of a single running process due to other loads and interrupts that can hit a cpu core
if you decide that you need specify the core that a particular thread can run on the os will generally provide a mechanism set the thread s affinity to a specific cpu
1104479
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
my initial approach was to extend the matrix type with a scala class and then overload the arithmetic operators and call the java native methods but the matrix class doesn t provide a default constructor without arguments the scala class needs one primary constructor i thought one good primary constructor could be the one accepting an array array double first thing that sucks that syntax is much more verbose and hard to read than double as far as i know by reading the manuals the parameters of the primary constructor are also implicitly fields of the class so i would end with one array array double in the scala subclassing and another double in the java superclass which is pretty redundant
i think i could have used an empty primary constructor that initialized the superclass with some default values for example a 0 or just make an adapter class that used the jama.matrix as a delegate but if a language is supposed to be elegant and seamless integrated with another that kind of things shouldn t happen
those are my two cents
1105111
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
Pattern(s): 
by using scroll you are moving the widget translate should achieve what you are looking for moving the contents of the qgraphicsscene underneath the view
i haven t done this myself but this is from the qgraphicsview documentation .
when the scene is larger than the scroll bars values you can choose to use translate to navigate the scene instead
1105528
cpu	processors	cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
multiple processors use a coherency protocol such as mesi to ensure that data remains in sync between the caches
with mesi each cache line is considered to be either modified exclusively held shared between cpu s or invalid
writing a cache line that is shared between processors forces it to become invalid in the other cpu s keeping the caches in sync
1105582
loops	while-loop
Pattern(s): 
if you really want to mess about manually with loops indices consider using a while-loop
in addition to what lasse wrote assigning to a loops variable is generally considered a code smell
it makes code harder to read if you want to leave the loops premataturely you can express that a lot clearer using break continue and is often done by accident causing all kind of nasty side-effects
1105582
loops	while-loop
Pattern(s): 
it makes code harder to read if you want to leave loops premataturely you can express that a lot clearer using break continue and is often done by accident causing all kind of nasty side-effects
so instead of jumping through hoops to make the compiler not do its optimizing fu on any loops where loops variable is touched borland now codegear bit the bullet and made assigning to loops variable illegal
if you really want to mess about manually with loops indices consider using a while-loop
1105601
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
additionally you cannot declare unsigned integers
integer size is platform dependent
you can t normally use 64bit integers on a 32bit machine without any outside module
1106894
lisp	smalltalk
Pattern(s): 
so the very idea of lisp the computation with symbolic expressions has been applied to lisp itself
lisp programs are symbolic expressions and the computation is a lisp expression
alan kay of smalltalk fame calls the original definition of lisp evaluation in lisp the maxwell s equations of programming
1108111
decoder	encoder
Pattern(s): 
unfortunately i never got round to writing an encoder which is obviously rather harder - and wasn t necessary in our case where we needed to apply patches in .net on a mobile device but could create them however we wanted at the server
i have a decoder for vcdiff written in c# which would probably be fairly straightforward to port to java if that s any help
it s part of miscutil but i don t think it relies on any other bits of miscutil or only minimally anyway
1110101
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
i don t know how gcc handles the issue
by extension this also means that if the getter is defined in a different .dll .so the call can not be inlined
in any case i don t think trivial get setter are necessarily good oop practice or that there are all the other reasons for using them
1110150
nsstring	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
Pattern(s): 
therefore the nsstring initializer grabs even the bytes after the end of the received nsdata until it reaches some zero byte previously stored in memory
i think the garbage comes from the logging here you are saying that you want an nsstring from this c-string array of bytes terminated by zero
the problem is that the bytes method of nsdata does not return data terminated by a zero because it s an ordinary array not a c-string
1110632
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
from those facts i ll let you make your mind about those who say mysql is fast and simple
if you want to scale more save time have less weird bugs to hunt have more simple application code spend more time optimizing your business not fighting with your database then the open source solution of choice is postgresql

1110977
put	get	put	get
Pattern(s): 
with the 500 you ll have left get everyone at least 2 20 flatscreens
put a high-end ssd and 4gb ram in every machine
with the 500 you ll have left get everyone at least 2 20 flatscreens
1112003
thunk	trampolines	thunk	trampolines
Pattern(s): 
as i understand it it is basically just a series of function calls performed by a trampolines function
each function is called a thunk and returns the next step in the computation until the program terminates empty continuation
here is the first piece of code that i wrote to improve my understanding of the trampolines results in
1112084
curlpp	libcurl
Pattern(s): 
libcurl is really complete
there is a c++ wrapper curlpp that might interest you as you ask for a c++ library
neon is another interesting c library that also support webdav
1112087
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
also check if the verify if file exists checkbox is unchecked
this screen appears after you click the edit button after selecting the axd extension
check if the http handler is correctly registered in web.config
1112649
width	height	width	height
Pattern(s): 
if you specify only a height and no width the height value does not affect the width calculation and flex sizes the control to fit the width of the maximum line
as a general rule if you have long text you should specify a pixel-based width property
if the text might change and you want to ensure that the text control always takes up the same space in your application set explicit height and width properties that fit the largest expected text
1113249
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
firefox 3.5 is already there as far as i know
the reason why is that is a mozilla specific firefox css selector
the relevant css3 selector would be border-top-right-radius webkit safari also has a non-standard selector -webkit-border-top-right-radius
1113249
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
the relevant css3 selector would be border-top-right-radius webkit safari also has a non-standard selector -webkit-border-top-right-radius
since google-chrome is based on webkit i d expect -webkit-border-top-right-radius to work
i d personally include all 3 selectors as below then you won t need to edit sometime in the future when everyone catches up with the standard
1113356
comparator	icomparer
Pattern(s): 
and actually it could probably be improved to include the seed that you have... anyway the project is called essence and it uses the system.linq.expression libraries to generate based on attributes standard representations of equals gethashcode comparator tostring as well as being able to create iequalitycomparer and icomparer classes based on an argument list
i also have some further ideas but would like to get some community feedback before continuing too much further. what this means is that it s almost as fast as being handwritten - the main one where it isn t is the comparator
cause the linq.expressions doesn t have the concept of a variable in the 3.5 release - so you have to call comparator on the underlying object twice when you don t get a match
1113524
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
i d give this a try or this possibly faster variant the stringwithformat guarantees there will always be a .nn at the end where n is a digit chars
the while and if simply strip off trailing zeros and the trailing decimal if it was an int
obviously you may want to put it in a function or class so you can get at it from anywhere without having to duplicate the code all over the place
1113869
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
so it is implementation-defined and sizeof enum might be equal to sizeof chars 1
in chosing the size of some small range of int there is always a penalty
if you make it small in memory there probably is a processing penalty
1114794
windows	wow64
Pattern(s): 
.net clr 3.0.30618 mozilla 4.0 -- netscape 4.0 compatible - compatible with whatever we just claimed to be but not actually msie 7.0 - internet explorer 7.0 windows nt 6.0 - windows vista wow64 - 32-bit ie on a 64-bit windows trident 4.0 - i m really internet explorer 8 trying to be internet explorer 7 -- this might be the source of your problems gtb6 - google toolbar 6 is installed slcc1 - secure licensing commerce client is available for windows anytime upgrade detection .net clr 2.0.50727 - .net framework 2 is installed media center pc 5.0 - windows media center 5 the version in windows vista is installed .net clr 3.0.30618 - .net framework 3 is installed
my user agent on ie8 on windows vista sp2 64-bit mozilla 4.0 compatible
msie 8.0
1115672
expression-blend	silverlight
Pattern(s): 
and this site is pretty useful
you might want to download the expression-blend trial
blend makes it easier to develop applications for both wpf and silverlight
1116594
margin	height
Pattern(s): 
this is because slideup works by reducing the height to 0 but it doesn t change the margin
so when the element has finished sliding up it still has a 15px margin
the last step is to hide the element at which point the margin disappears too and you see the jump
1117741
ubuntu	centos
Pattern(s): 
in our case this development stack is running under ubuntu workstation components eclipse ide maven and centos server components maven nexus subversion trac hudson sonar
as for the documentation latex texlive and kile under ubuntu works just great supporting high quality pdf generation
the documentation source can be managed by subversion the same way as the application source
1118005
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
to use it create an instance of the object then set the image property inherited from uiimageview to the picture and overlaycolor to a uicolor value the blend levels can be adjusted by changing the alpha value of the color you pass down
first you ll want to subclass uiimageview and override the drawrect method
your class needs a uicolor property let s call it overlaycolor to hold the blend color and a custom setter that forces a redraw when the color changes
1118415
magento	oscommerce
Pattern(s): 
been there done that. if anybody tells you to use oscommerce - for all the existing extentions that are out there - stand up and leave the room
extra tipps magento is slow
- in the oss world prestashop has some popularity
1118678
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
check whether folder already exist at the destination in which case move files in that folder over and continue traversing the source directory structure otherwise move the folder wholesale
at the end of the script the source folder is removed altogether to eliminate these folder which have had their files moved over to an already existent folder at the destination meaning these folder have been emptied but not deleted at the source
additionally we check whether a folder is both empty and already exists at the destination in which case we do nothing and leave the source folder to be deleted to the last line of the script
1119175
free	malloc	free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
however since you may only want 4 bytes and the os needs to work in pages often 4k malloc does a little more than that
it takes a page and puts it s own information in there so it can keep track of what you have allocated and free from that page
when you allocate 4 bytes for instance malloc gives you a pointer to 4 bytes
1119334
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
normally it also tries to meld together adjacent blocks in the address space
the free block list is just a circular list of memory chunks which have some administrative data in the beginning
this is also the reason why managing very small memory elements with the standard malloc free is not efficient
1119484
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
the size is determined from the type of the operand
the result is an integer
the value of the result is implementation-deﬁned and its type an unsigned integer type is size_t iso c99 section 6.5.3.4.
1121225
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if you want the .dll in that folder either create a reference to the .dll from your test project or use the deploymentitem attribute to make sure the item is copied to the test directory
the bin debug folder is not where the unit tests run
visual studio will copy the output of your unit test compilation to a testresults folder typically keeping the last five test runs each with a timestamp embedded in the folder name and run the unit tests there
1121490
bash	zsh
Pattern(s): 
otoh if you have perl s lwp installed it should ship with a sample binary named get hellip
bash compiled with --enable-net-redirections is pretty powerful
zsh has similar features. heck i ll even throw http basic auth in here too
1123909
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
then how the motherboard sends the data to the operating system
then how the operating system stores the data on the disk what filesystems it uses
ntfs is common in modern windows installations. finally what you ll see when reading the data is groups of 8 bits bytes which are basically 8 on off flags which together form 256 possible combinations
1124138
.htaccess	httpd.conf
Pattern(s): 
finally i ve added on head of the php script an if statement based on the remote host name if someone is interested it s also possible to query but must be configured the httpd.conf file on the server
now i ve do this in the folder where is stored the php script and the 2 configuration files i ve created an other folder where i moved the 2 config files and where i ve placed a .htaccess with the following code order allow deny deny from all now the 2 config files have a good protection
.
1125111
allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
i implemented a custom stl allocator a number of years ago that used a shared memory store
the same techniques can be used to implement a disk-backed allocator
i would start by looking at this sourceforge project for inspiration
1125307
freebsd	linux	freebsd	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	freebsd
Pattern(s): 
and if you wish to move ahead and are suffering from the dogma of a simplified to more complex or geeky linux distro then read this question it made me stick to ubuntu
well freebsd contrary to everyone s expectation does not perform extra-ordinary well efficient or fast from ubuntu
various benchmarking are now available for linux and those benchmarks show clearly that there is very little difference between the two in terms of over-all performance
1125337
qtp	loadrunner
Pattern(s): 
you will want a real load testing tool rational performance tester opensta jmeter loadrunner et al
if you are talking about scenarios where you need to have qtp running on 2 machines accessing the same record s or something along those lines then yes you can do this with qtp
qtp has no special handling for this but it is fairly straightforward to set up a mechanism to do this
1126248
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
but if you could the indexer would have to be written like so as you can see calling this multiple times in a loops is going to be much slower than using an enumerator that can remember where it is in the list
a for-loop gets compiled to code approximately equivalent to this where as a foreach loops gets compiled to code approximately equivalent to this so as you can see it would all depend upon how the enumerator is implemented versus how the lists indexer is implemented
as it turns out the enumerator for types based on arrays are normally written something like this so as you can see in this instance it won t make very much difference however the enumerator for a linked list would probably look something like this in .net you will find that the linkedlist t class does not even have an indexer so you wouldn t be able to do your for-loop on a linked list
1126608
teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 
this can be set up to run nightly weekly etc
you can also set it up to monitor your source control for changes and build anytime it sees a change the only one i ve used is teamcity the install was easy and depending on how many build agents you need it s free
if your just looking to build and deploy from vs another option is creating an nant script and running it from vs as an external tool
1127291
capitalization	uppercase
Pattern(s): 
if each character can be either lowercase or uppercase that s 2 to the power of n variations for the characters as long as they are letters
now each combination above has 2 n variations based on capitalization so the end result is 2 n-1 2 n which is equal to 2 2 n -1
for each aditional letter you either double or quadruple depending on the capitalization thing the time taken to enumerate them as can be easily understood from the formula
1128215
textmate	jedit
Pattern(s): 
alas...
smultron another nice os x editor mentioned in the comment above and similar to textmate but free has an open hidden... file menu item that works splendidly for this purpose
sad news smultron is apparently no longer being developed further beyond v3.5.1 which requires leopard according to a post from its author at its homepage jedit is another free option that has hidden file support www.jedit.org users-guide vfs-browser.html sorry for the lack of http in the link -- being a new user my posts are limited to just one link
1129061
cos	floor	cos	ceil	cos	exp	cos	sin
Pattern(s): 
floor and ceil will be exact since their computation is straightforward
what you are concerned with is rounding on the last bit for the transendentals like sin cos and exp
but these are native to the cpu microcode and can be done in high quality consistently regardless of library
1130714
int	chars	int	double
Pattern(s): 
chars -128 to 127 - any ascii chars includes alphanumerics special chars int -32768 to +32767 - only numbers int float 3.4 e-38 to 3.4 e+38 double 1.7 e-308 to 1.7 e+308 void notapplicable in case if any of the above are not sufficient for representing any type for your problem c has provided us with compound types like struct where you can defined your own types
for eg fractions. to represent fraction we need two int one for the numerator second for the denominator
so we define a strcuture like below and from now we can start using fraction to declare any new variable. fraction here is a user-defined data type also referred some times as derived data type
1131775
partition-problem	np-hard	partition-problem	np-hard
Pattern(s): 
the problem for is weakly np-hard so there exists a pseudopolynomial algorithm that solves it effectively as long as the weights are small integers
this is partition-problem generalized to y groups instead of 2
the problem for is weakly np-hard so there exists a pseudopolynomial algorithm that solves it effectively as long as the weights are small integers
1132622
linkbutton	addhandler
Pattern(s): 
use addhandler to do that
i think this is what you would use the commandname and commandargument properties of the linkbutton for
assign the user id as commandargument and a suitable string as commandname and hook up the command event to an event handler sub linkbutton_command sender as object e as commandeventargs e.commandargument will contain the user id end sub update the problem is that the event handler is never attached
1132777
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 
the precision of a decimal will be scaled to be as big as it needs to be within reason
from system.decimal a decimal number is a floating-point value that consists of a sign a numeric value where each digit in the value ranges from 0 to 9 and a scaling factor that indicates the position of a floating decimal point that separates the integral and fractions parts of the numeric value
the binary representation of a decimal value consists of a 1-bit sign a 96-bit integer number and a scaling factor used to divide the 96-bit integer and specify what portion of it is a decimal fractions
1134501
std	ostream
Pattern(s): 
your operator is defined as taking a constant instance of a type t but manipulators are function pointers and the compiler is not able to match it against your methods
manipulators are functions that operate on the std basic_ostream template
the basic_ostream template and ostream class are defined as then the possible manipulators that can be passed to a std ostream are if you want to accept manipulators you must provide that overload in your class in particular the signature for endl which may be the only one you require is so it falls under the manip1 type of functions
1134501
std	ostream
Pattern(s): 
the basic_ostream template and ostream class are defined as then the possible manipulators that can be passed to a std ostream are if you want to accept manipulators you must provide that overload in your class in particular the signature for endl which may be the only one you require is so it falls under the manip1 type of functions
others like std hex fall under different categories manip3 in this particular case

1134826
sorting	filtering	datarow	dataview
Pattern(s): 
see dataview.rowfilter iterating over filtering rows is as easy as this article contains several examples a practical guide to .net datatables datasets and datagrids - part 1
ado.net supports two fundamental approaches for performing filtering and sorting of datasets the datatable select method - this method is overloaded to accept arguments to filtering and sort data rows returning an array of datarow objects
the dataview object sort filtering and find methods - this object uses the same filtering arguments supported by the select method but the dataview exposes structures that can be bound to data-aware controls
1135257
setinterval	clearinterval
Pattern(s): 
is essentially useless as it always passes null to the clearinterval function and doesn t clear anything
this means that as you keep clicking on more you are creating more and more setinterval function calls never clearing the old ones
anyway i have refactored your code a little bit i think this should work as expected
1135308
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
in addition you get free hosting from launchpad which is a huge plus
bazaar is very well integrated with ubuntu i have been using ubuntu for many years now tired to switch to other more geeky distro but no point
i choose bazaar over git mercurial coz bazaar is notifications are very well integrated in ubuntu

hex	binary
Pattern(s): 
you could also add some code to the utility that converts the data for unicode so it will scan the db2 records for any anomalies
db2 has a built-in function called hex that takes in just about any expression of any type and returns a varchar of the hex representation of each byte
you can also specify any binary value as a literal by prepending it x for example x 0123456789abcdef if the problem is coming from a single-byte character you could find it by building up temp table of all single characters from x 00 to x ff and seeing which ones appear in each row of your db2 data
1137216
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved
Pattern(s): 

after a touchesbegan event is fired the uikit looks for a positional movement of the finger touch which translates into touchedmoved events as the x y of the finger is changed until the finger is lifted and the touchesended event is fired
if the finger is held down in one place it will not fire the touchesmoved event until there is movement
1137535
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
depending on your application this may or may not screw up data server-side
the server-side script may stop processing if the http connection is dropped though upon clicking submit again the first request is canceled and a new request send
to avoid problems with multiple submission you can for example send a unique id with the form that will be checked on the server and can only be used once
1138516
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	informix	interbase	bde	informix	interbase
Pattern(s): 
it runs on linux unix beos and windows and a dynamic driver loader for elf oses is under development navicat is nice gui tool for postgrsql
libpq++ is one provide very good connector for postgresql sqlapi++ is a c++ library for accessing multiple sql databases oracle sql server db2 sybase informix interbase sqlbase mysql postgresql and odbc sqlite
abstract database connector is a c c++ library for making connections to several databases mysql msql postgresql interbase informix bde odbc
1141349
glut	sdl
Pattern(s): 
if you still long for cross platform compatibility then your best bet is likely sdl which is very much like glut in that it is a fairly thin layer over the underlying abstractions but it provides a slightly richer event system and more opportunities for interacting with hardware such as sound and joysticks
that being said there s nothing particularly archaic about glut
there are many implementations of glut
1145852
imperative	declarative
Pattern(s): 
declarative set-based code just doesn t fit that model well
now poorly -written sql procedural imperative etc. does but the better you design the procedure the less reason you have for a debugger anyway
a better solution imho if you need that what a debugger could do for you is to use the sql profiler which has the advantage of being able to tell you what a procedure is actually doing in production instead of just what it does in you artificial tests
1147858
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
question 1 - i have never used the database splitter as i feel i have more control doing it manually
if you do it manually you can do it to a versioning that does not have a database splitter
but if you do use the splitter then--yes--you will have to upgrade to a versioning that has a splitter before doing it
1148702
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 
thin nginx is very easy to set up compared to apache mongrel and uses less memory
apache wins in some performance test but uses more memory

1148784
haskell	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
although ocaml suffers significantly in that floats on the heap need to be boxed due to the vm design but arrays of floats and purely-float records aren t individually boxed which is good
if you re willing to use arrays more than lists or plan on programming using mutable state use scala rather than haskell
if you re looking to write threaded multi-core code use scala or haskell ocaml requires you to fork
1148804
haskell	ocaml	haskell	sml
Pattern(s): 
but i m poorly informed here
object-oriented not to be found in haskell or sml
ocaml has a bog-standard oo system grafted onto the core language not well integrated with other languages
1148939
perforce	cvs
Pattern(s): 
it s come a long way from it s better than cvs roots
perforce is pretty nice
its windows implementation seems the best last i checked their cross-platform gui was pretty lousy
1149369
crypt	salt	crypt	hash
Pattern(s): 
wikipedia has a good page on salt and rainbow tables which are the main reason why we have salt
without salt crypt is basically just a one-way hashing function
it would take in a password and return a hash version of that password
1151541
uiview	uipagecontrol
Pattern(s): 
uipagecontrol is probably the easiest way to implement the swiping behavior but it can be tricky -- read the documentation carefully
the pictures need to be added via addsubview to a uiview object or an object subclassed from uiview such as uicontrol uiscrollview etc
you probably do not need to create a view class of your own myview
1151579
visualsvn	sharpsvn
Pattern(s): 
different subversion distributions manage permissions in different fashions so approaches to controlling this outside of sharpsvn will differ
visualsvn server utilises an authz-windows file in the root of the repository for managing ad based permissions
it stores the sid of the user against the repo name all in plain text so i ve worked around the api problem by just managing the contents of this file directly
1153158
nsstring	nsobject
Pattern(s): 
this is virtually identical to the common printf specifiers
also the specifier is not limited to nsstring objects but is for any objective-c objects
the base nsobject class provides a generic description of the object consisting of its class and its address but many objects will supply information specific to their type such as the collection classes nsarray nsdictionary which will supply nicely formated dump of their contents
1153743
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
ram can be seen as merely a performance optimization total amount of virtual memory your program consumes is really not hugely relevant to its performance running out of ram seldom results in an out of memory error
instead of an error it results in bad performance because the full cost of the fact that storage is actually on disk suddenly becomes relevant

1155448
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
from that page when an abstract base class is created django makes any meta inner class you declared in the base class available as an attribute
if a child class does not declare its own meta class it will inherited the parent s meta
if the child wants to extend the parent s meta class it can subclassing it
1156143
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
apparently for loops are very fast which is not what i expected so i d take these with a grain of salt without understanding why they ve come out the way they do
anyway when i used the list defined in the question with three sublists of two elements each from fastest to slowest i get these results richiehindle s answer with the for-loop clocking in at 0.22 μs terence honles first suggestion which creates a list at 0.36 μs pierre-luc bedard s answer last code block at 0.43 μs essentially tied between markus s answer and the for-loop from the original question at 0.48 μs coady s answer using operator.itemgetter at 0.53 μs close enough to count as a tie between alex martelli s answer with ifilter and anon s answer at 0.67 μs alex s is consistently about half a microsecond faster another close-enough tie between jojo s answer mine brandon e taylor s which is identical to mine and terence honles second suggestion using any all coming in at 0.81-0.82 μs and then user27221 s answer using nested list comprehensions at 0.95 μs obviously the actual timings are not meaningful on anyone else s hardware but the differences between them should give some idea of how close the different methods are
when i use a longer list things change a bit
1156487
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 
the hash code of two objects might be equals even though the objects themselves are not equals this is the essence of a hash code
an object hash code may be useful for determining when two objects are not equals but to determine whether they are equals you will have to call equals
an implementation that always returns 0 for gethashcode is legal but may not be very efficient when objects of that type are inserted int various types of containers
1157812
fast-forward	merge	fast-forward	merge
Pattern(s): 
however most but not all version control system notice that one of parents one of branches in merge is strict ancestor of the other and instead of creating merge it would just advance one branch
git cals this situation fast-forward or up-to-date
after a merge we have the following situation after scm merge b when on branch a below there is attempt at ascii-art diagram --- --- --- ---a---m --- trunk branch a --- --- --- ---b- --- branch branch b merge commit m has parents a and b
1157843
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
the solution however is to simply configure the clientbin directory or whatever folder you store your xaps in on the server
assuming iis you need to explicitly specify the the clientbin folder expires immediately
this will cause the correct cache configuration headers to be sent when the xap is retrieved
1158121
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
additionally the file system website model is lacking in vs 2003
vs 2003 requires a web application to be a configured virtual folder in iis
it does not need to be copied to inetpub wwwroot folder but it does need to be a virtual directory
1158121
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
it does not need to be copied to inetpub wwwroot folder but it does need to be a virtual directory
so you do not need to copy the files to the iis folder
lastly vs 2003 does not have a publish site option because when you build the website all files are compiled into a single assembly
1158161
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 
swing is imho tried and true but also incredibly painful to develop in
other desktop libraries eg netbeans rcp eclipse swt are more modern but have other idiosyncrasies
desktop remoting libraries include things like spring remoting even web services and other things like burlap
1159372
ends-with	substr	ends-with	substr
Pattern(s): 
you ll have to do the substr method i detailed below--that is if you are using xslt 1.0 which uses xpath 1.0 edit 2 just so my comment has some nice syntax highlighting
edit see my comment below i checked the xpath 1.0 documentation and it does not include an ends-with function
you ll have to do the substr method i detailed below--that is if you are using xslt 1.0 which uses xpath 1.0 edit 2 just so my comment has some nice syntax highlighting
1159557
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
unfortunately javascript does not have the ability to make this change
css does have a means of specifying landscape printing via the page directive css paged media is well supported by google-chrome v15+ and opera v15+ is partially supported by firefox v19+ ie8+ and all versions of edge
however it is not supported by safari at all
1159613
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
we provide here an implementation in common lisp defmacro delay expression lambda expression defmacro cons-stream a b cons a delay b define force delayed-object funcall delayed-object defparameter the-empty-stream make-symbol the-empty-stream now comes portable code from the book now common lisp differs in stream-for-each we need to use cl progn instead of begin function parameters need to be called with cl funcall here is a version we also need to pass functions using cl function define display-stream s stream-for-each function display-line s but then the example works
using sicp with common lisp is possible and fun you can use common lisp for learning with sicp without much problems
the scheme subset that is used in the book is not very sophisticated
1160417
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
although if you have a lot of columns that are only used by one subclass sti probably isn t the best inherited model to use
as far as rails is concerned every column can be set in every subclass
you can add logic to your subclass models to prevent certain fields from being set but there s no automated way to do so
1161224
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
update confirmed - upgrade to 1.8.6 resolved the issues
after looking at the versioning it appears i am running ruby 1.8.5 on the rhel box and ruby 1.8.6 on my local box
strange problems indeed
1161352
qt-creator	kdevelop	codeblocks	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
having said that kdevelop you are next on my test list as i haven t tried it yet
have tried codeblocks netbeans and eclipse with c++ support and qt-creator
netbeans and eclipse work just fine but their default window layout and editor settings make me sick each time when i install them as one needs to remove minimize change fonts size etc in order to make it somewhat readable as the default settings are just covering too much of the screen
1163561
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
for this reason using persistent connections or a connection pooler is much more important on windows when using postgresql
another issue i ve seen is that early postgresql on windows will by default make sure that it s writes are going through the write cache - even if it s battery backed
afaik mysql does not do this and it will greatly affect write performance
1164454
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
the only hope is that browser developers finally agree to make their products compliant to the acid3 test
but as i write this my firefox 3.5.1 gets only 92
webkit safari and google chrome and opera go the full 100 see this article
1165553
gradle	ivy	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
note i happen to like writing maven plugins but appreciate that many will object to the effort involved
gradle promises to hit the sweet spot between ant and maven
it uses ivy s approach for dependency resolution
1165566
loops	while-loop
Pattern(s): 
a while-loop won t be faster
loops structure is not your bottleneck
optimize your algorithm first
1166033
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
using gettype .equals as i do is more precise than is or as since value must be exactly of the type string
is and as will work even if value is a subclass of the checked type
this is irrelevant though when comparing with type string since you cannot inherited from string
1166745
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 
usually when you have to declare self referencing structures like lists you use both because the typedef has not effect until the structure is defined unless you make a forward declaration for example so now you can declare variables of the same type in the following ways the three variables above are the same pointers to the node structure
i think that s the same as in c typedef creates an alias of a type.
in your first case the name of the type is struct person while in the second case is just person
1166745
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 
in your first case the name of the type is struct person while in the second case is just person
usually when you have to declare self referencing structures like lists you use both because the typedef has not effect until the structure is defined unless you make a forward declaration for example so now you can declare variables of the same type in the following ways the three variables above are the same pointers to the node structure

1166898
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
in c people do not have a major problem with accidentally calling free on streams instead of fclose
if i had to codify it i d put in the style guide something like this free may be called only on a private pointer field of an object
malloc ed buffers or buffers returned from a c api which caller must free must be assigned to a private pointer field of an object
1166898
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
malloc ed buffers or buffers returned from a c api which caller must free must be assigned to a private pointer field of an object
private pointer fields which hold free -able buffers must only be used for that purpose
if you use hungarian notation add a letter for it and if you don t don t
1167696
mkmapview	mapkit
Pattern(s): 
btw there are definite fixes improvements in os 3.1 to aspects of mapkit that were giving me trouble in 3.0
first of all mkmapview does not use have a predefined set of zoom levels like google maps does
instead the visible area of a mkmapview is described using mkcoordinateregion which consists of two values center the center point of the region and span the size of the visible area around center
1168224
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
you need to right-click on your solution not your project choose add create a new test run configuration
then you need to edit the test run configuration and specify which files will be copied to the test execution folder
there should be a sibling directory to your solution directory called testresults which contains the folders used for each test run
1168962
ienumerable	icollection
Pattern(s): 
the only means of absolutely ensuring that it isn t deferred is to accept an icollection or
the message about expanding the results view will evaluate the collection is a standard message presented for all ienumerable objects
i m not sure that there is any foolproof means of checking if an ienumerable is deferred mainly because even a yield is deferred
1169205
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
if you want the code run forever or until you stop the program the code you want is while true os.system kjor time.sleep seconds this is literally and infinite loops but in this case that is probably what you want
if you are attached to having a particular number of iterations then you could do something like sunqiang s answer repeated here for-loop in xrange 240 os.system kjor time.sleep seconds finally if you are on a unix platform such as linux or mac you should take a look at cron as it is designed to set up recurring programs to run and particular time periods
you could set it up to run your script every minute and it will happily do so until the end of time or you remove it whichever comes first
1169602
jquery	jqmodal	jquery	jqmodal
Pattern(s): 
using jquery with other libraries if you need to do the modal dialog box in jquery there are a lot of samples available like jquery block ui jquery ui jqmodal jquery impromptu
if you don t want to implement the functionality done in mootools to be applied in jquery you can read the official jquery documentation for using jquery with other libraries
using jquery with other libraries if you need to do the modal dialog box in jquery there are a lot of samples available like jquery block ui jquery ui jqmodal jquery impromptu
1170263
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
you can then put a safecontrol entry into your web.config for this folder the folder is located at 12hive template controltemplates on the file system
this is happening because you have put the user control in a folder at the root of the site which sharepoint won t have access to
typically when you deploy a user control in sharepoint you put your control in the controltemplates folder which is mapped to the _controltemplates virtual directory in iis by default sp has access to this folder
1170263
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
typically when you deploy a user control in sharepoint you put your control in the controltemplates folder which is mapped to the _controltemplates virtual directory in iis by default sp has access to this folder
you can then put a safecontrol entry into your web.config for this folder the folder is located at 12hive template controltemplates on the file system

1172148
sctp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
to create a connection-oriented protocol better than tcp in speed security and redundancy the latest releases of linux already have sctp support
indeed sctp is used mostly in the telecom area
traditionally telecom switches use ss7 signaling system no
1172805
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
for example if you have an aggregator pom.xml that is also the parent for the projects that it aggregates and the children and parent versions get out of sync this mojo can help fix the versions of the child modules
note you may need to invoke maven with the -n option in order to run this goal if your project is broken so badly that it cannot build because of the version mis-match
versions lock-snapshots searches the pom.xml for all -snapshot versions and replaces them with the current timestamp version of that -snapshot -20090327.172306-4 versions unlock-snapshots searches the pom.xml for all timestamp locked snapshot versions and replaces them with -snapshot
1175729
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
either it converts the value to the corresponding unsigned value before shifting which is guaranteed to use a logical shift right putting zeroes into the vacated bits or it ensures that the value is positive or it tolerates the variation in the output
the c standard leaves it undefined whether the right shift of a negative necessarily signed integer shifts zeroes logical shift right or sign bits arithmetic shift right into the most significant bit
it is up to the implementation to choose
1176134
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
just because they both subclassing exception eventually doesn t mean they re related to each other
you can only throw a checked exception if that exception class or a superclass is explicitly listed in the throws clause
myownexception isn t a superclass of filenotfoundexception
1176723
freemarker	velocity
Pattern(s): 
freemarker despite its stricter implementation offers a lot more in terms of correctness and facilities
freemarker works well and is very powerful
velocity has a simpler syntax is somewhat less powerful and is a lot more forgiving wrt
1176723
freemarker	velocity
Pattern(s): 
i ve used both and velocity is very easy to get started with
freemarker despite its stricter implementation offers a lot more in terms of correctness and facilities

1179093
tabs	tabpanel	tabs	tabpanel
Pattern(s): 
you can see the below 2-row grid and a tabpanel as the header panel
this is why the default tabcontrol has its headerpanel tabs sits on the top first row
you can change this rows to columns and replace the tabpanel with a stackpanel or something with a vertical orientation will do the trick
1179379
memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 
maybe trying there could be useful
to answer your first point the power of memcached is that it allows to create a cluster of cache servers it is not meant to be used on a single server event it you can use it that way the theory is you have many servers and each one has some free ram you have no use for to use this ram you install memcached on these servers and configure it to use the amount of ram that wasn t used and if one machine is down it automatically stops using it and put load balance the data on the others the drawback of memcached for some people is that it s network based even when you use it on only one machine
which means a bit slower that local-only apc works on only one machine it is great used as a caching mecanism to store data you only need on one server or if you only have one server
1179908
fseek	fread	fread	strlen
Pattern(s): 
you re not treating this as a null terminated string you aren t allocating enough space for teh null terminator - just exactly what s needed to fit your binary data so strlen is probably inappropriate
i would recommend checking the results of fseek and fread
in particular make sure fseek is returning 0 - if it s not this may be the entire problem
1179908
fseek	fread	fread	strlen
Pattern(s): 
in particular make sure fseek is returning 0 - if it s not this may be the entire problem
provided that fseek is succeeding fread should tell you the total number of bytes read
also strlen is not necessarily a valid thing to use since it s going to assume that this is a null terminated string
1179924
bindparam	bindvalue	bindparam	bindvalue
Pattern(s): 
to bind those parameters you ve got to use bindparam and not bindvalue
here are some i can think about with bindparam you can only pass variables
not values with bindvalue you can pass both values obviously and variables bindparam works only with variables because it allows parameters to be given as input output by reference and a value is not a valid reference in php it is useful with drivers that quoting the manual support the invocation of stored procedures that return data as output parameters and some also as input output parameters that both send in data and are updated to receive it
1181524
addslashes	multibyte
Pattern(s): 
with regards to this vulnerability when character set-unaware escaping is used for example addslashes in php it is possible to bypass the escaping in some multibyte character sets for example sjis big5 and gbk
as a result a function such as addslashes is not able to prevent sql-injection attacks
it is impossible to fix this on the server side
1181629
integer	unsigned	integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
there s no point in using it in application code a size_t is completely ok int is not because it s signed and you ll get signed unsigned comparison warnings
a nested size_type typedef is a requirement for stl-compatible containers which std string happens to be so generic code can choose the correct integer type to represent sizes
there s no point in using it in application code a size_t is completely ok int is not because it s signed and you ll get signed unsigned comparison warnings
1182540
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
fields that are initialized in their declaration are evaluated before the constructor of the class is called
fields that are initialized in a subclass in this manner will be evaluated after the super s constructor is completed but before the subclass s constructor is called
consider the following example i have a test class i have a superclass and i have a subclass in my main method i create an instance of testsub the results are as follows tester 3e205f super init block tester bf73fa super constructor tester 5740bb sub init block tester 5ac072 sub constructor
1182972
uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 
following this line of thought if your need is not making use of any ui controls and or you want to create your own custom animation 2d or 2.5d animation it makes sense to drop down to the coreanimation level and create your own calayer to do your thing there
if however you are only interested in performing basic animation and it can be done through uiview the api is usually simpler so it will make sense to use uiview to save yourself time there

1183073
uiview	calayer	width	height
Pattern(s): 
the memory overhead is really of no concern
while an uiview has a memory footprint of at least 4 width height pixels this statement is absolutely not true
the memory overhead of a uiview compared to a calayer is just the size of the instance variables of the uiview class plus a few instances of additional classes that will get allocated
1183073
uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 
the memory overhead of a uiview compared to a calayer is just the size of the instance variables of the uiview class plus a few instances of additional classes that will get allocated
the uiview instance variables take up about 24 bytes and the additional data storage is probably the same or less
if uiview adds functionality that s useful for your application then use it
1183552
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if you want to add features -- say a different strategy for constructing the parse tree -- your subclassing have to also manage this feature addition before they parse
it may not amount to a simple super because the superclass does too much
also parsing in the constructor allows me to fail early kind of
1183936
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
i thought it was a mysql question
postgresql p.s
my postgresql is rusty so if the mysql query works on postgresql i d like to know edit 2 i can t stress enough to be wary of the count suggestion below
1183936
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
my postgresql is rusty so if the mysql query works on postgresql i d like to know edit 2 i can t stress enough to be wary of the count suggestion below
you generally want to avoid this with postgresql

1185384
move	drag	qtreeview	qabstractitemview
Pattern(s): 
qabstractitemview has no notion of trees so it only calls fetchmore on the top most index
it calls fetchmore when geometry is updated the scroll bars are move rows are inserted the current item is changed as a result of an autoscrolling drag drop operation qtreeview additionally calls fetchmore when an item is expanded this is essentially the only time it calls fetchmore with a non-root index the view s layout needs to be relaid such as with expandall and collapseall i think the best solution would be to subclass qtreeview to make it call fetchmore in the appropriate places and with the appropriate indices

1186250
printf	fgetc
Pattern(s): 
the reason that fgetc is apparently working for multibyte characters for you is because the bytes making up the multibyte character are being read in seperately written out seperately and then interpreted as a multibyte character by your console
if you change your printf to printf c somechar
that is put a space after each character then you should see multibyte characters broken up into their constituent bytes which will probably look quite weird
1186597
boxlayout	miglayout	boxlayout	miglayout
Pattern(s): 
use miglayout if you are interested in a good flexible modern layout manager
well mostly because boxlayout is an old api before they knew any better
use miglayout if you are interested in a good flexible modern layout manager
1187087
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
update #2 for me the following die-class works exactly the way you want it hope i could help you
first of all the following for-loop is wrong obviously you switched _dicesize and _noofdice
the correct loops would look like because of that the line has to be changed to maybe you should think about renaming these variables so it s more clearly which means what
1187573
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 
i haven t really looked into how other libraries handle those cases but look at the source code of jquery for example for inspiration
for your first problem don t use setinterval ndash
use settimeout in the callback for your request don t forget to call your function once after it has been defined to start it off after that settimeout will be called every time after a request has finished. note that in some cases you might not reach readystate 4
1187895
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
it would be nice to get it integrated into visual studio so you could interact with your existing code base more easily though
marc s answer is entirely correct the possibility of a repl or script like c# has been discussed by eric lippert in two blog post why doesn t c# implement top level methods it already is a scripting language i would add that the 2010 ctp does contain an f# repl not much use for c# but if you were interested in some aspect of the bcl or clr then it might be sufficient for your needs i find that linqpad makes up for the lack of a repl in many cases
it would be nice to get it integrated into visual studio so you could interact with your existing code base more easily though
1188198
thin	webrick
Pattern(s): 
webrick is very slow
using mongrel or thin would give you better performance
also even though you are in production mode just double check the production.rb configuration settings and make sure class caching etc is turned on still
1191410
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
folder is usually used on windows
personally i use folder even for gui apps on both linux and windows it just sounds more user friendly
and i doubt anyone will really care that i didn t use the correct term. if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder

int	chars	readonly	temporary
Pattern(s): 
edit programs generaly runs from red only locations rom disk flash and they need stack for temporary values
for instatnce in c c++ almost evertying but specialy values defined as chars int long float and arrays of course go on stack. that mean that linker use and expect only data on stack or in program itself which is generaly readonly when program need extra memory in sizes which can not be defined in time of compilation it need heap
heap is allocated whit malloc or new c c++ but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there
1193670
opera	firefox	opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 
i have to refresh while firefox works perfectly or at least reload the page the way i d expect it to while i m debugging
i use opera and i admit it doesn t manage the cache the way i d want it to
i have to refresh while firefox works perfectly or at least reload the page the way i d expect it to while i m debugging
1194930
outputstream	inputstream
Pattern(s): 
but this requires you to keep count how many bytes you read this can be implementd with a filterinputstream then close the inputstream open it again skip that many bytes and only then wrap it in an objectinputstream
the easiest way to avoid this problem is to keep the outputstream open when you write the data instead of closing it after each object
calling reset might be advisable to avoid a memory leak
1195096
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
directory and folders behave differently
for example if you want to remove a file from a folder you need access to the folder and the file because the file is stored inside the folder
if however you want to remove a file from a directory you need access only to the directory because a directory itself is just a regular file that lists the locations of but does not contain other files
1195605
many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 
if you can clarify your question i ll update my answer to include the actual mapping if you need it
your links table looks like many-to-many mapping table between location and endpoint rather than one-to-many
if it does then you would have to map it as a separate entity location would have a collection of links mapped as bi-directional one-to-many link would have many-to-one relationships with both location and endpoint if otoh links has no other columns and you re willing to forgo its primary key which is neither needed nor can be mapped for many-to-many join table then you can map it as many-to-many collection of endpoint s on location
1196033
range	max
Pattern(s): 
this only supports the basic us-ascii character set which is very likely not what you want
i d suggest you use nvarchar instead which supports the full range of international characters
if you need a short field say a few hundred characters at most then it would be reasonable to use a field with a specified maximum length nvarchar 256 however if it s a lot of text as can appear on this site then nvarchar max is probably more appropriate
1196642
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
this preserves insertion order while removing duplicates
the java design of the enhanced for-loop was to not expose the iterator to code but the only way to safely remove an item is to access the iterator
so in this case you have to do it old school if in the real code the enhanced for-loop is really worth it then you could add the items to a temporary collection and call removeall on the list after loops
1197657
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
it should be avoided and perhaps replaced with composition
think if you really really need them as subclass
that s why you see very often interfaces used insted here b and c could have inherited from a which would have created a very high coupling among them by using interfaces the coupling is reduced if a decides it will no longer be nameaware the other classes won t broke
1198427
post	put
Pattern(s): 
i put the scripts to do that in the following stackoverflow answer
that also has the link to the code so you can download and play with settings in the project if the post is not enough

1199016
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
if you want something centralized go for svn and if you want something decentralized use mercurial i had bad experiences with git on windows
some other issues i had with perforce what you commit is not what you get back for example if you commit an utf16 file on an intel mac and sync it from another ppc mac you ll get another utf16 file because perforce is smart and does covert you the file to the client byte-ordering

1201642
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
in c++ sizeof a is equal to sizeof chars
in c sizeof a is equal to sizeof int
in c++ sizeof a is equal to sizeof chars
1201925
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
in c it s possible to provide an overlarge initializer where c will discard the trailing null chars
c89 allowed implicit int in many contexts and c++ doesn t
this means that all functions must be declared in c++ while in c89 it was often possible to get by with assuming int for everything applicable in the function declaration
1202486
profiler	yourkit
Pattern(s): 
i can particularly recommend yourkit which is commercial but offers an evaluation licence
it s the best profiler i ve used but some margin

1203389
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
from fslib-extra-pervasives.fs note also the use of options on the keys
f# has two common associative data structures the one you are most used to the mutable dictionary which it inherits that s to it s presence in the bcl and uses a hashtable under the hood
the other is known as map and is in common functional style immutable and implemented with binary trees
1203718
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
if you like to put programs in program files folder that clashes with that directory being read-only
for me it just seems easier to have two programs separated and make shortcut just to x86 file
if that version detects 64bit it just needs to launch x64 file
1205712
integer	radix
Pattern(s): 
however suppose you were to really need the performance.
note that log10 x log2 x log2 10 log2 x 1 log2 10 1 log2 10 is a constant log2 x can usually be performed cheaply in the integer pipeline on modern architectures using instructions such as clz or a bit twiddling hack yielding a number between 0 and 63 for a 64-bit integer
that fits in 6 bits leaving us up to 58 bits after the radix point usable for fixed point arithmetic in a 64-bit type
1207350
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
for example if you have 4 projects parent core ui and utils you could declare all the external dependences and the internal project versions in the parent
the child projects then inherited that configuration for any dependencies they declare
if all modules are to have the same version these can be even be declared as properties in the parent
1207350
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
if all modules are to have the same version these can be even be declared as properties in the parent
an example parent is as follows and the utils core and ui projects inherited all the relevant versions. utils core ui

1208500
objectdatasource	detailsview
Pattern(s): 
i d also consider using an objectdatasource - keeping your binding all in the markup can make things easier to find
when you use the objectdatasource - it ll automatically wrap your single object in an ienumerable so binding to a method that returns a person is acceptable
you could also consider using a detailsview if you don t want to write out the form yoruself
1209190
128bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 
real is equivalent to float 24 not float float 53 . the decimal x y sql server type is for when you want exact decimal numbers rather than floating point which can be approximations
this is in contrast to the c# decimal data type which is more like a 128bit floating point number
mssql float does not have exactly the same precision as the 64bit double type in .net slight difference in mantissa iirc but it s a close enough match for most uses
1209737
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
yes there is
have a look at the maven versions plugin specifically versions update-child-modules updates the parent section of the child modules of a project so the version matches the version of the current project
for example if you have an aggregator pom.xml that is also the parent for the projects that it aggregates and the children and parent versions get out of sync this mojo can help fix the versions of the child modules
1209737
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
for example if you have an aggregator pom.xml that is also the parent for the projects that it aggregates and the children and parent versions get out of sync this mojo can help fix the versions of the child modules
note you may need to invoke maven with the -n option in order to run this goal if your project is broken so badly that it cannot build because of the version mis-match
edit of course using maven3 you can now have version -less parent elements in sub modules developers working in multi-module or multi-pom projects won t have to specify the parent version in every sub-module in maven 3
1212042
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
but whether plain chars is signed or unsigned is implementation specific - that means it depends on your compiler
this makes difference from int types which all are signed int is the same as signed int short is the same as signed short
more interesting thing is that chars signed chars and unsigned chars are treated as three distinct types in terms of function overloading
1212798
lapack	fftw	scalapack	fftw
Pattern(s): 
for gui programming are good choices
for numerical scientific programming blas lapack and or their parallel versions blacs and scalapack are very widely used directly or through wrapper c++ classes as can be found in boost for blas
a good fft library is also often needed fftw is good if its gpl licence is not a burden for you
1213596
post	get	post	get	submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
for example a search form should be submitted using get because the search result page is a place and the user will want to bookmark it or retrieve it from their history at a later date
if you submit the form using post the user can only recreate the page by submission the form again
on the other hand if you were to perform an action such as clicking a delete button you would not want to submit this with get as the action would be repeated whenever the user returned to the url
1214388
vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
perhaps you have f# confused with c# s new support for dynamic
however office interop in f# is the same as c# - you can use the native com apis or the newer managed visual studio tools for office vsto libraries
unfortunately f# doesn t have the ui-designers for creating vsto add-in like c# so the simplest way to do office interop is to use the com apis
1215141
range	max
Pattern(s): 
this cannot be used with m or d option s shutdown r shutdown and restart a abort a system shutdown. only during the time-out period p turn off the local computer with no time-out or warning only with d h hibernate the local computer only with f e document the reason for an unexpected shutdown of a computer options m computer a remote computer to shutdown. t xxx time until system shutdown in seconds
the valid range is xxx 0-600 seconds
default 30 c msg an optional shutdown message max 127 chars f force running applications to close. this will not prompt for file-save in any open applications. so will result in a loss of all unsaved data
1216879
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
i don t think inherited is making this model clearer or better
i don t see how it breaks liskov substitution which demands that you can use the subclass in any situation that calls for a base class
the methods map 1 1 as far as i can see
1217016
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
i did use nunit and still want to give xunit a test drive but for work i mostly use mstest what comes with visual studio
the most used ones out there are probably nunit and xunit
i m not sure how testdriven.net supports xunit but with nunit you can run a single test a class its tests or all test with a click of the mouse or keyboard shortcut
1217441
bash	subshell
Pattern(s): 
use one of those shells as your default shell and it will be used as subshell in gnu midnight commander
so i decided to change the shell note bin bash at the end of the passwd file
it means the shell is now changed
1218185
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction
Pattern(s): 
56 + 78 + 0 carry 134 34 with 1 carry 34 + 00 + 1 carry 35 35 with 0 carry 12 + 00 + 0 carry 12 12 with 0 carry this is in fact how addition generally works at the bit level inside your cpu
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid
i ve actually written libraries to do this sort of stuff using the maximum powers of ten that can be fit into an integer when squared to prevent overflow when multiplying two int s together such as a 16-bit int being limited to 0 through 99 to generate 9 801 32 768 when squared or 32-bit int using 0 through 9 999 to generate 99 980 001 2 147 483 648 which greatly eased the algorithms
1218856
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
that way loops is just two lines one that checks the condition and when that executes the delegate at the current arrays position
depending on what you are doing you could consider having each statement be a delegate create an arrays of delegates and run a for-loop across the arrays
that way loops is just two lines one that checks the condition and when that executes the delegate at the current arrays position
1219264
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 
it even has direct support for logging frameworks
for example you could write support for junit 4.4 was dropped however
junit 3.8 junit 4.5+ and testng 5.8+ are supported
1220721
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if you have powershell check out or you can always use windows search to find all hidden directory in the hierarchy and delete them from the results window
you can simply drag drop the folder in windows explorer into the file system view of your installer vdproj
all the files and folders in the hierarchy will be added to your setup project
1220721
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
all the files and folder in the hierarchy will be added to your setup project
tip if the folder are in svn or similar source control delete all the hidden folder before you do this
if you have powershell check out or you can always use windows search to find all hidden directory in the hierarchy and delete them from the results window
1220727
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
if you want to execute scripts inside this project my advice would be to extends the associated project s which are msbuild compatible csproj vbproj etc. and reference execute your scripts from there using your tool of choice
how you implements it is up to you for example you could hook into beforebuild target and execute scripts using sqlexecute task
fwiw we have to support sql server 2000 2005 2008+ so the task becomes much harder
1223403
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 
if you want the keyboard to animate back on after the modal view has completely appeared put it in viewdidappear
otherwise put the same code in viewdidload or viewwillappear

1224260
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
historically 255 chars has often been the maximum length of a varchar in various dbmses
the length limit for a field that wasn t an lob large object back then was 255 bytes 1 byte int
so the first byte was used to store the length of the field 0-255 and the remaining n bytes for the chars
1224707
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 
what doesn t output anything is echo false is considered as an empty string and nothing get outputed
strtotime s documentation also gives the valid range for dates note the valid range of a timestamp is typically from fri 13 dec 1901 20 45 54 utc to tue 19 jan 2038 03 14 07 utc
these are the dates that correspond to the minimum and maximum values for a 32-bit signed integer. additionally not all platforms support negative timestamps therefore your date range may be limited to no earlier than the unix epoch
1225397
move	drag
Pattern(s): 
a browser does virtually the same work calculates geometry of nodes finds the underlying node and dispatches a mouse move event appropriately
the current implementation doesn t use mouse move events and do not calculate the geometry
instead it relies on mouse over out events detected by targets after a drag was started
1225405
jboss	oc4j
Pattern(s): 
so that is reason enough if you are doing this for personal use and are not going to get a support license there will be many more users willing to help out if when you encounter issues
+1 on jboss that is mainly what i use for personal use and work
i have also used oc4j and find that it is harder to use and more finicky with it s class loading mechanism maybe i m just used to jboss
1227406
sprint	branding
Pattern(s): 
it also helps branding the methodology different from other iid methodologies as to the sprint length anything goes as long as the sprint is timeboxed it is finished on the planned date and not when it s ready
or alternatively in rare occasions the sprint is terminated prematurely to start a new sprint in case some essential boundary conditions are changed. it does help to have the sprint of similar durations
there s less to remember about the sprint schedule and your planning gets more accurate
1228619
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
as for more advanced static languages.
haskell is a wonderful language it has #1 and #2 and although it doesn t have #3 it s type system is so flexible that you will probably not find the lack of meta to be limiting
i believe you can do metaprogramming in ocaml at compile time with a language extension
1234364
try-catch	exception-handling	try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
i believe that how you deal with exception-handling depends on what layer of the software you are working in exception-handling in the rainforest
usually empty try-catch is a bad idea because you are silently swallowing an error condition and then continuing execution
occasionally this may be the right thing to do but often it s a sign that a developer saw an exception-handling didn t know what to do about it and so used an empty catch to silence the problem
1235077
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
by the way extends thread is not generally as good as implementing runnable for quite a few reasons
the best way might be for class b s start to be overloaded to take a parameter a or better yet an interface implements by a
then b can either store that for retrieval by c if it s an inner class or pass it to c s constructor.
1235114
post	get
Pattern(s): 
therefore you are correct in defining the post comment aggregate but it would not make sense to group users into that aggregate
users being its own aggregate can contain a relationship to all of their post because post is the aggregate root
you could also implement this a method on the postrepository to get all of the post by a given user
1235181
super	implements	public	protected
Pattern(s): 
in this derived class declare a public constructor which takes the device address
this public constructor is then able to call the protected super constructor now you have remotedevice for a specific device address without doing a device scan and without querying the known devices list
note while this approach works according to my experience it may still fail on a blackberry device in case rim implements some hidden functionality in the remotedevice class which is ignored if a remotedevice instance gets created as shown here
1238173
jar	manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 
then run javac test.java jar cfm test.jar manifest.mf test.class java -jar test.jar output hello world
you need to specify a main-class in the jar file manifest
oracle s tutorial contains a complete demonstration but here s another one from scratch
1240713
actionscript	mxml
Pattern(s): 
it is hard to reverse engineer the original mxml from the decompiled actionscript that has been generated from that very mxml source
the generated actionscript is not really a pleasure to work with
comments always get lost during compilation and local variables function parameters lose their names
1242771
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
compare with this new style for-loop can be used with arrays as well
the first of the two you specify is a classic c for-loop
this gives the programmer control over the iteration criteria and allows for three operations the initialization
1244371
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
if you insist on strings of form x.y.z you ll have to play around with regular expressions but i d guess it s possible to find a corresponding check constraint
in the materialized path model you can use arbitrary strings maybe unicode strings to allow more than 256 children instead of special strings of form x.y.z
the id of the parent is then the id of the direct children with the last character removed
1244547
textmate	gedit
Pattern(s): 
on windows e-editor is great textmate replacement
textmate is my favorite on the mac
when on linux i really like gedit with lots of plugins
1245368
lxml	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 
it works with multiple class values separated by spaces class1 class2
despite its name lxml is also for parsing and scraping html
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame
1248776
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
and there is currently no appender that will only append on application shutdown
the smtpappender is something in between since it inherited the bufferingappenderskeleton
these appenders have a buffersize properties which controls how many messages are kept in memory before they are flushed
1250347
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt
Pattern(s): 
so elem.sourceline above in the error message should work
the equivalent library that you should be using is lxml
lxml is a wrapper on very fast c libraries libxml2 and libxslt and is generally considered superior to the built in ones
1250347
elementtree	libxslt
Pattern(s): 
lxml is a wrapper on very fast c libraries libxml2 and libxslt and is generally considered superior to the built in ones
it luckly tries to keep to the elementtree api and extend it in lxml.etree
lxml.etree has an attribute sourceline for all elements which is just what you are after
1251093
rtsp	sdp
Pattern(s): 
you can have a look at the live555 library that implement such a stack in c++
rtsp is only used to start the streaming
it gives you an sdp description of the real streams
1251449
multiton	singleton	multiton	singleton
Pattern(s): 
much like how the singleton class has a static variable to hold the single instance the multiton is often implemented with a static array or map of instances depending on how you want to access the instances - arrays only allow for numerical access but by using a map you could provide string keys to your instances making them named
i believe that you want some form of the multiton pattern
the multiton pattern is a variation on the singleton pattern but that allows for n instances of an object
1252077
jsf	wicket	jsf	seam
Pattern(s): 
i think that jsf2.0 and webbeans are the next step
it s not correct to say the seam is the next step of jsf. seam doesn t have to use jsf as the view layer
it can also use wicket or gwt
1252077
jsf	wicket
Pattern(s): 
it can also use wicket or gwt
however when used with jsf it does a great job of simplifying it
you have less xml config than standard jsf and i often forget that jsf doesn t have things like a conversation context or parameterized method calls in el
1252242
qdatastream	qbytearray	qdatastream	qbytearray
Pattern(s): 
this supports extracting all the basic c++ types and can be created wth a qbytearray as input
i haven t tried this myself to see if it works but it looks from the qt docs like you want a qdatastream
this supports extracting all the basic c++ types and can be created wth a qbytearray as input
1252686
sdl	clutter
Pattern(s): 
i know you tagged as c++ however pygame python is a great library for creating 2d games which also supports an opengl context
pygame is built on sdl
clutter is a new opengl based gui library with bindings for perl python c# c++ vala and ruby
1252756
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
somewhere in that path a device will be discarding packets it considers too large
udp is a very bad idea for what you are doing
you would be better off using tcp
1253188
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 
truncation is error truncation allowed but number of characters must be returned so caller knows
strcpy - again
most people agree that strcpy is dangerous but strncpy is only rarely a useful replacement
1253619
xsl-fo	xslt
Pattern(s): 
xslt printing xml why css is better than xsl-fo
i am well aware that there s a big debate going on between css and xsl-fo supporters and both sides have valid and good points
here s the best brief argument for xsl-fo that i ve seen so far xsl-fo provides a more sophisticated visual layout model than html+css. formatting supported by xsl-fo but not supported by html+css includes right-to-left and top-to-bottom text footnotes margin notes page numbers in cross-references and more
1253619
xsl-fo	xslt
Pattern(s): 
here s the best brief argument for xsl-fo that i ve seen so far xsl-fo provides a more sophisticated visual layout model than html+css. formatting supported by xsl-fo but not supported by html+css includes right-to-left and top-to-bottom text footnotes margin notes page numbers in cross-references and more
in particular while css cascading style sheets is primarily intended for use on the web xsl-fo is designed for broader use
you should for instance be able to write an xslt style sheet that uses formatting objects to lay out an entire printed book
1254989
bash	zsh
Pattern(s): 
maybe the zsh-lovers package can help at least its title of tips tricks and examples for the zsh is suggestive
my default shell is bash so take this with a grain of salt
start with etc profile and see how it sources bash-specific files
1255876
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
it is working very well
the solution i ended up using was to make a new class modulepage that inherited page
in the oninit it would check an abstract properties i added ixmodule to see if that that module was turned on or off if it was on the page will display and if it is not the user is redirected to another page
1255876
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
in the oninit it would check an abstract properties i added ixmodule to see if that that module was turned on or off if it was on the page will display and if it is not the user is redirected to another page
each page in each module has to be change to inherited modulepage and then just specify the ixmodule value
it is working very well
1256062
stdio	gets
Pattern(s): 
pretend you never heard of gets
where the language ends and the implementation begins stdio is part of the standard library conio.h is not stuff like that
the difference between undefined and implementation-defined behavior and why things like x x++ are undefined
1257145
background-repeat	background-image
Pattern(s): 
each-box the background image is positioned and repeated separately for each box of the inline element
this means that an image with background-repeat no-repeat may be repeated multiple times
-moz-background-origin in mozilla applications like firefox the -moz-background-origin css property determines the background positioning area the origin of a background-image
1257709
webclient	httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 
if that is the issue you ll probably need to refactor to use the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes instead on webclient and configure a more reasonable timeout
webclient does not support user-specified timeouts and iirc has a default timeout of 100 000 msecs 100 seconds
try waiting for 100 secs and see if you get any exceptions
1257716
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
2 functional programming in general
haskell is a great language for that although i am still a very beginner in it - i think it might be one of the most elegant ones
ocaml might be another path to explore
1257761
goto	break	goto	break
Pattern(s): 
you can use goto to break out of any number of loops
of course goto is often considered harmful
using break and goto can make it more difficult to reason about the correctness of a program
1257866
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 
but these sorts of things really are the last resort.
build for x86 and run valgrind cachegrind against the code for proper performance profiling
or texas instrumentation ccstudio has a sweet profiler
1257979
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
so far mysql does not support this feature
postgresql 8.4 microsoft sql server and ibm db2 are examples of rdbms brands that support cte syntax
oracle also has a proprietary extension to sql syntax that supports recursive queries
1260219
stdout	fflush
Pattern(s): 
in the c faq
most likely stdout is line buffered
your program does not call fflush or send a newline so the buffer does not get written out
1260589
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 
if you really want to find out if a float is an integer then subtracting the nearest integer and seeing if the absolute value is less than some epsilon 0.00001 is a decent bet
floating-point arithmetic is fraught with peril in any language
on my box printfn f 0.9999999999999 1.0 prints 1.000000 hopefully that will help steer you in the right direction
1261738
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
the problem with md5ing it is that md5 is very sensitive to small changes in the input and it sounds like you want to do something a bit smarter.
you want to perform an image hash
since you didn t specify a particular language i m guessing you don t have a preference
1262272
rpm	yum
Pattern(s): 
running pypi installations as a side effect of rpm installation is evil as it won t support proper uninstallation uninstalling your rpm will remove your package but leave the dependencies behind with no proper removal procedure
i think it would be best if your python dependencies were available as rpms also and declared as dependencies in the rpm
if they aren t available elsewhere create them yourself and put them in your yum repository

xna	slimdx
Pattern(s): 
if you don t want to be stuck at directx 9.0c support i suggest you take a look at slimdx which is a similar concept to xna but maps to both directx 9 and 10
the target audience is by and large the hobbyist game development community but there are a lot of things professional developers can use xna for as well including the fact that it is one of the easiest ways to get a game onto the xbox live system albeit in a category separate from live arcade xna is a managed library that is essentially a wrapper like managed directx which was the first managed library over directx
it is clamped to directx 9.0c because it is cross platform compatible with the xbox 360 which is obviously stuck at that version since it has static hardware that will not ever change until a new xbox console is released of course at the moment microsoft is marketing xna very heavily for xbox development but they are also allowing commercial pc games to be produced with it although there are no easy automatic distribution and payment models like xbox live arcade on the pc platform as of yet
1262351
xna	slimdx
Pattern(s): 
it is also a really good tool to fast prototype a game if you need to present an idea to anyone for funding or just to see what your ideas really look like on screen
overall xna would be a good place to start learning directx game development as most of the concepts carry directly from one to the other
if you don t want to be stuck at directx 9.0c support i suggest you take a look at slimdx which is a similar concept to xna but maps to both directx 9 and 10
1262469
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
the default visibility is protected which is similar to protected in java and that generally works well
you d have to specifically declare a variable as public for it to be directly accessible outside the class
this apple documentation has further details about variable scope and visibility
1262523
buildroot	uclibc
Pattern(s): 
and getting the toolchain this way might not be quite as exciting and compiling it yourself.
i ve had good luck using buildroot to build toolchains and libraries for cross-compiling linux
buildroot uses the lightweight uclibc c library rather than glibc so it might not work for your purposes
1263122
queue	fifo
Pattern(s): 
a list can insert and remove anywhere which is not what a fifo structure is suppose to do and a deque can add and remove from either end which is also something a fifo structure cannot do
this is why you should use a queue
now you asked about performance
1264595
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 
when the user taps next or previous remove the previous view and load the view you need based on your question type using -addsubview on the view controller s main view and keep track of which subviews is currently showing
trying something like this where multiplechoice view and openendedview are uiview outlets in your quizcontroller connected to the views you designed in ib
you may need to mess with the position of your view within the parent view before you add it to get it to display in the right place but you can do this with calls to -setbounds -setframe and or -setcenter on the uiview
1264881
processors	hyperthreading
Pattern(s): 
t1 will become the entire core for its use and does not get preempted by t2-t11
there are multiple relation possible depending on your system architecture for single processors case the relation is 1 n where n is the number of threads
everything will be run on that single processors for multi processors multi core hyperthreading case the relation is approximately p n where p is the number of processors however the thread exectution becomes a multi-dimensional scheduling problem
1264881
cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	affinity	affinity	processors	affinity	hyperthreading
Pattern(s): 
everything will be run on that single processors for multi processors multi core hyperthreading case the relation is approximately p n where p is the number of processors however the thread exectution becomes a multi-dimensional scheduling problem
your operating system s thread scheduler will make effort to distribute the threads among the available processing units based on runtime characteristics used cpu cycles blockedness user preferences affinity thread s serving the active window and other properties
for example if you have 1 intensive computational thread and 10 i o thread with lots of waits the os scheduler will most likely assign t1 to p1 and t2-t11 to p2 and power down the rest of the cores for energy saving and cache-redistribution to favor p1
1268321
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing	implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
2009-08-12 15 27 02.080 flipswitch 1756 20b so you need do define initwithcapacity in your subclassing i would recommend to not extends nsmutablearray there is no need just make a class that has a mutable array in it
you problem is that you are not implements abstract methods of nsmutablearray superclass that need to be implements it says - nsmutablearray initwithcapacity method only defined for abstract-class
define - sdmutablegrid initwithcapacity
1268799
codeigniter	kohana
Pattern(s): 
it s also worth reading the docs as well
even though they aren t as good as codeigniter s they still contain a lot of useful information
however if you want to get the most from the framework i recommend you invest a couple of hours looking through the code of the classes that you use kohana orm and if you re feeling brave database
1271407
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
the default value of n is 600. increasing this value can result in more inline code at the cost of compilation time and memory consumption
decreasing usually makes the compilation faster and less code will be inline which presumably means slower programs
this option is particularly useful for programs that use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with c++. inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters which may be specified individually by using --param name value
1273149
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
you can use the trygetvalue method instead of the indexing to avoid this dictionary s has a containskey method that can help deal with the previous two problems
dictionary is probably the closest
system.collections.generic.dictionary implements the system.collections.generic.idictionary interface which is similar to java s map interface
1273612
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
remember_to_call_base is declared in the protected section of base if it was in the private section derived won t be able to reference it at all
when there s only one level of inheritance you can use the template method pattern where the public interface is non-virtual and calls a virtual implementation function
then the base s logic goes in the public function which is assured to be called
1273705
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	wicket
Pattern(s): 
on top of that you have things like converters and validators which you add to components globally or even as a cross cutting concern using some of the phase listeners wicket provides
some relevant differences as i see them tapestry uses a semi-static page structure where you can work with conditionals and loops to achieve dynamic behavior
wicket is completely dynamic
1274639
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
miguel
moonlight currently is made up of a few components mono runtime cross platform works on many platforms including powerpc and osx graphics engine cross platform video engine cross platform browser gate currently only supports firefox windowing system integration currently only supports x11 there have been discussions about writing more browser gateways for new browsers but so far it has not been a priority
if moonlight were to be ported to the mac a gate to safari would be necessary
1275295
aptana	rubymine	aptana	rubymine
Pattern(s): 
it also doesn t lock up when you check out a different branch using git i tried rubymine and i liked it better particularly the rspec integration but not enough better to buy a license
i don t really use the code completion much so i don t have the problems you describe but i don t think aptana is any better
rubymine is better at that stuff so if that s important to you give it a try
1276783
lift	wicket
Pattern(s): 
the starting with lift pdf is a shorter introduction the mailing list is high volume for me but a great source of information you may also want to take a look at motivation and influences of lift seaside s highly granular sessions and security rails fast flash-to-bang django s more than just crud is included wicket s designer-friendly templating.... listed on to see if they match what you want
using lift for web development in scala has some positives active supportive responsive community
the framework is designed for scala rather than happens to be compatible with scala
1276783
lift	wicket
Pattern(s): 
as nick partridge pointed out in his answer there are other frameworks
as i don t know what you want or expect of a framework i can only point you at some lift resources which may help you make up your mind there s an open source lift book a snapshot of which was published as the definitive guide to lift which you can find at search for master.pdf on that page
the starting with lift pdf is a shorter introduction the mailing list is high volume for me but a great source of information you may also want to take a look at motivation and influences of lift seaside s highly granular sessions and security rails fast flash-to-bang django s more than just crud is included wicket s designer-friendly templating.... listed on to see if they match what you want
1279388
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
if you want a performant lisp try common lisp -- it can be compiled to machine code
haskell is my current preference as a performant high-level language
i ve also heard very good things about ocaml but haven t personally used it much
1279632
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 
for the second one i would concatenate a partial xml file with any binary file on the filesystem
hex editor seems a little too-much for me

1279812
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
again since ntfs is wonky about captialization you can t simply copy the saved version into the directory and rename it
the nt filesystems is more than a bit wacked when it comes to capitalization it remembers the initial capitalization but thereafter ignores any changes
all of which means that you re going to have to take some drastic steps in the repository
1281258
actionscript	mxml
Pattern(s): 
without knowing the specific framework you ve implemented or providing us with more code in terms of the context you are trying to perform this action in it is difficult to give a more specific answer
your actionscript class needs a reference to the display list in order to add your component to the stage
mxml is simply declarative actionscript so there is no difference between creating your instance in actionscript or using the mxml notation
1281258
actionscript	mxml	actionscript	mxml
Pattern(s): 
mxml is simply declarative actionscript so there is no difference between creating your instance in actionscript or using the mxml notation
your function could be changed to or if your actionscript does not have a reference to the display list than you cannot add the custom component to the display list
adding an mxml based custom component is no different than adding any other displayobject to the display list is the same as both the sprite and the startsplashpage are extensions of displayobject at their core
1281778
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	clearinterval
Pattern(s): 
clearinterval is a global function as well so you can call it from any other function nested in any movie clip as long as you can get access to the interval s id p2 in your case so if you have some like you can have a separate function like if that function is nested in some clip you can always use the dirty all _root as in absolute path clearp2 lives in a nested clip far far away from _root of course you can use relative paths as well the idea to keep in mind is to make sure you can access the interval s id where you need it clearinterval is global
the whole thing with setinterval is scope
clearinterval is a global function as well so you can call it from any other function nested in any movie clip as long as you can get access to the interval s id p2 in your case so if you have some like you can have a separate function like if that function is nested in some clip you can always use the dirty all _root as in absolute path clearp2 lives in a nested clip far far away from _root of course you can use relative paths as well the idea to keep in mind is to make sure you can access the interval s id where you need it clearinterval is global
1282287
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
the bottom line is that x64 bit executables use more memory than x32 bit executables
i think the best answer would be a comparison in x86 bit x64 assembler when your x32 bit program registers a variable for example an integer 5 the code is equivalent to this push 5 to understand things better push x is a shortcut to those registeres are 32 bit 4 bytes long which is the size of a pointer in any 32 bit programming language
in 64bit code however the size is twice bigger and so are registers.our register esp exists in x64 executables but its not widely used as it is in x32 executables
1282687
accurev	cvs
Pattern(s): 
most other enterprise scms are about 3 4 of the way to the right
eg accurev mks starteam users can typically view the repository + branch tree in a variety of powerful ways but can t configure system itself as flexibly as cc
this is probably a good thing cvs is on the far right as described earlier
1285161
int	double
Pattern(s): 
i don t know i ve virtually never programmed floating-point arithmethic but i doubt that because double is native precision supported by hardware whereas i don t know about float
float is slower than int
short may be slower than int because the cpu uses int natively and needs to truncate results to make them short
1286537
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
if you a string with a single byte use the same method passing an offset pointer into the array and a length of one
the string is printing the int because that s what you re putting into it i int
c is the token for chars
1286591
unix	solaris
Pattern(s): 
and then fails back to emulation -- check the quality of such emulation also check how this stuff works on windows -- as far as i know that there is no in-shared-memory mutexes in win32 api generally named objects should be used so check what is supported and how
this is quite hard job for unix oses you can use pthread condition and mutex with setpshared argument
note it is supported well under linux 2.6 solaris but it does not supported freebsd and cygwin don t know about mac os x for unixes you may also use named semaphores but i don t know the support level of them for windows there are some events.
1287201
memset	malloc
Pattern(s): 
if you try after you free it there are no guarantees that it hasn t been allocated again
for instance you can use memset for that
free doesn t guarantee that the memory will be cleared because c doesn t guarantee that malloc will return initialized memory
1287201
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
free doesn t guarantee that the memory will be cleared because c doesn t guarantee that malloc will return initialized memory
either way you have to initialize it yourself after it s been allocated so there s no point in clearing it when it s free d

1288340
perforce	cvs
Pattern(s): 
if the problem is actually branching in cvs is too painful then i think the technical solution is migrate away to cvs to something that allows more robust and easier branching and integration. in the free software world that usually means subversion
a good commercial alternative is perforce
i can say that i worked for a company which released multiple verisons of software to many customers and often cross-integrated changes from one branch to another
1290249
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
Pattern(s): 
quoted from the link argumentexception path is an empty string
argumentnullexception path is null
filenotfoundexception the file cannot be found
1291740
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
if tempstr is not a null terminated string then strlen tempstr is undefined undefined means that it s meaningless and dangerous a bug and shouldn t be used the strlen function isn t valid except when it s used on a string that s already null-terminated
this is a pointer value tempstr this is another pointer value which points to 5 elements beyond the tempstr pointer value tempstr + 5 this is an int strlen line therefore this is a pointer value which points to strlen line elements beyond the tempstr pointer value tempstr + strlen line and this is dereferencing that pointer this is what i think correct if i am wrong
it s ensuring that the chars at index 20 of tempstr immediately beyond the auto_answer_call 1 chars is null it s ensuring that the string is null-terminated
1292807
post	get
Pattern(s): 
get is only desirable for those cases where the parameters can be expressed as a meaningful uri
roy fielding would likely approve of using post in this situation but you d have to ask him
in general most applications that involve user-supplied data being supplied to the server are not safe
1293055
emacs	textmate	emacs	aquamacs
Pattern(s): 
there are also the mac-specific latex authoring programs texshop itexmac2 texmaker lyx this is somewhat non-standard as it abstracts slightly over latex and has its own file format .lyx texmacs this has the great feature of being written in scheme there is a mac-specific latex back end called mactex
i use ii2 to manage latex software for the back end and i have used both textmate it has a very nice latex bundle and emacs with auctex as front ends
you can get a nice baked-in latex experience in emacs by using the aquamacs distribution i can t use it because i have a non-english keyboard with no aquamacs-specific mapping
1293860
salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
furthermore it does not reveil your prefix salt string nor that you are using uniqid under the hood
without knowing the salt it is very hard consider it impossible to guess the next id
in summary i would disagree with the commentor s opinion and would always prefer the md5 -ed output over plain uniqid
1294288
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
then you would do simple conversions in one pair and save yourself to store the value twice
as a general rule of thumb you should not put any code in a getter that has side effects
also the only side effect that code in a setter should have is the change of state in the object the setter refers to
1294555
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 
if you are still trying to understand the basics of programming then you probably should keep your focus on learning the basics and building personal projects tutorials first though it can t hurt to check out a copy of the code base to experiment with on your own machine
also note that cvs is only one of many vcs version control systems in use
svn and git are two other popular options but they all are relatively easy to learn -the main thing is to know how to create something worth versioning
1294912
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
this provides a level of safety - you know you won t break a client s project because somebody else changed something underneath you but it s very easy to upgrade at any time to the new version
versioning in svn is trivial - so i wouldn t let this be an issue
it s also safer from a business perspective since you have a very clear paper trail of what version was used with a given deliverable of a client project which has many benefits in terms of billing tracking testability etc
1295286
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
any other value is converted to true . in a context where bool operands are not allowed but integral operands are the bool will be converted to an integral type
when the int result is stored in a bool variable it will be converted to bool
therefore you will be able to use + and as boolean or and and and you can use | and also
1295440
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
can be called to upgrade your settings from the previous versioning
possible duplicate settings.settings file keeps getting reset my answer from that question applies here i believe settings.settings files are saved based on the current versioning number basically as a feature where settings are not saved between differing versioning of the same program on a machine
assuming you re incrementing the versioning number automatically when compiling 1.0
1295517
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql does not support native array datatype
in postgresql you would be able to do the following which would give you a native php array

1296563
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
i ve seen mysql databases with millions of rows that worked just fine and mysql is not a heavyweight in database land
ms sql server postgresql db2 progress openedge almost anything will do if you create proper indexes
things like ms access and possibly sqlite may fall apart when you put a lot of data in them
1298377
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
if that loops can run in worst case n times then the procedure has o n n m time complexity
update i missed something so the code that executes in the for-loop has o m+m time complexity
of course o m+m o m and the final complexity is o n n m
1299023
opera	google-chrome
Pattern(s): 
form widgets buttons textboxes textareas fieldsets and dropdowns are different across browsers and platforms
opera for example uses its own vista-esque skinning of form controls and each skin is different
google-chrome seems to use its own stuff too
1301096
actionscript	haxe	avm2	neko
Pattern(s): 
personally i d suggest you use haxe .
a very nice and expressive language that allows you to compile to avm1 or avm2 bytecode virtual machines for flash player 6-8 and 9-10 neko bytecode neko is a very fast and lightweight virtual machine suitable for writing web servers daemons or desktop apps javascript source code actionscript 3 source code php source code c++ source code using neash you can use flash player api with c++ most notably the display graphics api which is very easy to use java source code for android currently prealpha but demo looks good .
you use a single language to write servers be it http or tcp create rich clients be it javascript or flash target smartphones either flash smart phones or iphone through c++ well still not optimal but progress is being made and in near future android .
1301938
csla	.net
Pattern(s): 
of course its not a large scale project but its a perfect start
csla does not follow the ddd paradigm
the above book .net domain-driven design with c# by tim mccarthy wrox press is really good one
1302601
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
the biggest reason for that is if you have multiple applications that use the same libraries and want to upgrade to a new versioning for one app you can do that without affecting the rest of them
this of course is especially important if the new versioning of the library introduces a breaking change that would then have to be fixed in all your applications rather than just the one that needs the new versioning

1303063
hash	md5	hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
md5 is always 32 hex digits but an arbitrary substring of it or any other hash has the proper qualities of a hash equal values produce equal hashes and the values are spread around a bunch
you can make any hash you like shorter by simply truncating it
md5 is always 32 hex digits but an arbitrary substring of it or any other hash has the proper qualities of a hash equal values produce equal hashes and the values are spread around a bunch
1303309
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
but the stl has not changed since it was made official. the new additions for tr1 are currently not officially available but will be part of the new standard
though you can grab them via boost
which is another set of libraries you should look at
1304213
short	base
Pattern(s): 
most of what you want to know is described at the mercurial wiki s mergeprogram page
the short version is your typical choices are set the hgmerge environment variable to point at the merge tool you want
or add the following to your .hgrc the key is that a merge tool needs to take three arguments the base revision your local changes and the changes from the other branch
1304285
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
that s all well and fine if you re using ram to store an object because ram is r andom a cess m emory and is therefore suited to the job
when you need to store your object on a medium that is not traditionally random access for instance disk or you need to transfer an object over a stream medium such as the network then the object needs to be converted into a form that is suitable to the relevant medium
this conversion process is called serialization because the structured object is flattened or serialized making it more amenable to being stored for the long term or transferred over the network
1305454
java.util.date	simpledateformat
Pattern(s): 
when you format a date object into a string for example by using simpledateformat then you can set the time zone on the dateformat object to let it know in which time zone you want to display the date and time if you want the local time zone of the computer that your program is running on use df.settimezone timezone.getdefault
as jon skeet already said java.util.date does not have a time zone
a date object represents a number of milliseconds since january 1 1970 12 00 am utc
1306837
pure-virtual	base-class
Pattern(s): 
when a pure virtual method exists the class is abstract and can not be instantiated on its own
instead a derived class that implements the pure-virtual method s must be used
a pure-virtual isn t defined in the base-class at all so a derived class must define it or that derived class is also abstract and can not be instantiated
1307603
integer	unsigned	integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
i m not sure i would call this phenomenon overflow but it is a common mistake to assign a small negative integer to a variable of unsigned type and wind up with a really big positive integer
this trick is actually exploited for bounds checking if you have a signed integer i and want to know if it is in the range 0 i n you can test which gives you the answer using one comparison instead of two
the cast to unsigned has no run-time cost
1308510
vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
one of the best tutorials on how to do this is eric carter s article writing user defined functions for excel in .net
if you additionally want your code be hosted via vsto then i am virtually certain that you are required to use a vba wrapper in this case
see paul stubbs article how to create excel udfs in vsto managed code where he uses a vba add-in to expose vba udfs which in turn call his managed udfs written in vsto
1308510
vsto	add-in	vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
see paul stubbs article how to create excel udfs in vsto managed code where he uses a vba add-in to expose vba udfs which in turn call his managed udfs written in vsto
to be honest though for excel udfs i would simply avoid the use of vsto
vsto is a great designer for managed com add-in allowing you to easily add ribbon controls and the like
1309557
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
mercurial is quite easy to install on windows with tortoisehg for shell integration if you want it and i believe bazaar is as well
i d go with mercurial over bazaar if i didn t know either and was going to pick one simply because it s more widely used
this so question is about git mercurial bazaar on windows
1309963
profiling	debugging	profiling	debugging
Pattern(s): 
ten layers seems like an aweful lot we have a quasi soa app all services are exposed internally the messages that go across them are consumed almost entirely by a single client application that typically consists of only 4-5 layers since it s all about the client experience in our world we can use ants on the client running a debugging build and see the cumulative time it takes to go down all layers and back up--very few of our bottlenecks have been outside of client code
it sounds like a good fit for a blend of profiling ants performance profiling is a solid product but there are other paid and free alternatives and integration performance tests

1310235
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
it s a cleaner syntax when your access to the properties doesn t need any special behavior or validation
it s similar in function to so it saves a fair amount of code but leaves you the option later to modify the accessor logic if behavior or rules need to change

1310515
svg	vml	client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
austin apache batik is a server-side svg renderer
or use client-side svg
it should have no problems displaying and manipulating 100 text strings and is supported in much the same browsers as canvas is and ie supports vml which provides similar functionality
1310515
svg	vml
Pattern(s): 
it should have no problems displaying and manipulating 100 text strings and is supported in much the same browsers as canvas is and ie supports vml which provides similar functionality
austin apache batik is a server-side svg renderer

1311780
post	get
Pattern(s): 

number +num then in you php page change the post to a get. post allows you to send large amounts of parameters options around but unless your numbers are going to be more than 140 characters long this will make no difference
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable
1311780
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable
however it is a very very small stretch to do the same thing with post variables so security should not depend on posting rather than getting
there s nothing wrong with using post except that you don t seem to be able to get it to work easily
1313755
mousemove	mouseup
Pattern(s): 
then we register temporary mousemove and mouseup event listeners
mousemove is a tight function optimized for speed
simply set the top left position of the avatar the clone relative to e.pagex and e.pagey normalized event object parts
1314094
int	chars	int	double
Pattern(s): 
consider the following code snippet here the value of c is promoted first to short explicitly then to int implicitly
the value of i will always be an int
as for chars and short becoming int and float becoming double that refers to the default types for implicit function prototypes
1314534
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
Pattern(s): 
edit my usual steps for storing data in a database and then retrieving it are call the database data escaping function pg_escape_string mysql_escape_string etc to escape each incoming _get variable used in your query
note that using these functions instead of addslashes results in not having extra slashes in the text when stored in the database
when you get the data back out of the database you can just use htmlspecialchars on any outputted data no need to use stripslashes since there should be no extra slashes
1314757
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
it s very deliberate
as the person that implemented both i can tell you that the reason is that by passing the string through as-is to postgresql and odbc the pdo driver code for those databases does not need to be updated as the underlying library adds new features
since mysql does not have its own connection string parsing code we invented a mechanism for passing data in to the underlying mysql function calls which have a very specific api with fixed parameters
1315004
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
the two official java gui apis are swing and awt
awt is usually used by applets early ones anyway
it consists of heavyweight components
1316209
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
roy osherove s book the art of unit testing is a good introduction
when it comes to frameworks nunit has been around for a long time but it has some inherent issues
if you already have visual studio professional or team system there s a built-in unit testing framework commonly known as mstest
1316745
httphandler	httpmodule
Pattern(s): 
a httpmodule can handle individual events through the request lifecycle without overriding all of the standard behaviour
by using a httphandler you re overriding the whole web forms mechanism for handling requests system.web.ui.page implements ihttphandler
in your machine-level web.config file you ll find rewriting the url to default.aspx won t achieve much because your web.config overrides that default handler mapping and says that your httphandler should be called to handle all urls including default.aspx
1317131
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
so the fact that it s firefox that is launched and not google-chrome is normal
if you want to launch google-chrome you will have to use something else than
using selenium rc in interactive mode with something like this and using the getnewbrowsersession command not correctly i get the list of browsers is supports so i m guessing you should be able to launch google-chrome using instead of
1317710
mvp	presenter
Pattern(s): 
in general there s not much difference and often the line between them is blurry
martin fowler has a page on ui design patterns in which he defines and then talks about mvc mvp and other patterns
to summarise the differences controllers in the mvc have more control over the ui and handle events while a presenter in the mvp is more passive and just presents information through the ui
1318765
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
you can make your changes to those files and commit them as normal using svn - svn simply uses the .svn dirs to detect whether anything has changed and to generate the diffs to send to the repository
perforce won t affect any part of that - as long as you can make it ignore the .svn dirs

1319665
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
finally create a view like this the currently logged in user will see a set of records in the user_document table that are only the records that they have permission to see
in postgresql this is a fairly common approach to your dilemma
while i ve not tried it in mysql sepecifically it may be worth considering
1320022
hash	salt	hash	hmac
Pattern(s): 
hmac essentially rolls a secret key known only by your server into the hash so even someone who knows the algorithm can t generate a hmac that will be recognized as valid without knowing the key
just using a plain old hash is trivially bypassable because the attacker can generate valid hash of their own data and all the salt in the ocean won t fix that
even if you used a session id instead of storing meaningful values you still would have to be careful that an attacker couldn t predict another valid session id and send that to you instead thus hijacking the other user s session
1320637
rank	max
Pattern(s): 
if you are using oracle something like this will work step 1 find out max value of userid in your table select max userid from tbl_userid let this number be m step 2 find out the max value of rownum in the foll query select rownum from all_objects step 3 if the max value is greater than m then you can use the foll query to list your unused user ids select user_id from tbl_userid where user_id not in select rownum from all_objects if max value returned by step 2 is less than m you can tweak your query to the following repeat the union all until you get max rownum m if you are using sql server kindly let me know
there is no direct equivalent of rownum pseudocolumn in sql server but there are workarounds using the rank function

1320978
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
ocaml is weaker even when just looking at parallelism given its underlying architecture
both haskell and clojure have better stories here imho
that said once you get one fp language you ll be able to carry the fundamental principles to other languages pretty easily and they might be useful in the future
1323270
jar	war	jar	war
Pattern(s): 
make the war project have a dependency on the jar project and the jar project have a dependency on aspectjrt
the jar dependencies you want to exclude can be specified as scope provided so they will not be included in the build or excluded by configuring the jar dependency to exclude those transitive dependencies see the transitive dependency exclusion section of the dependency mechanism documentation for details
when the war is built any compile-scoped dependencies and their transitive dependencies will be bundled into the war s web-inf lib directory aspectjrt will be included as well
1324990
merb	ruby-on-rails
Pattern(s): 
there are the autogenerated api docs at h ttp www.merbivore.com documentation current doc rdoc stack index.html but those are also horrendously incomplete most methods have grossly incomplete or nonexistent documentation that doesn t for example list what options are available in an options hash. there are tons of blog posts on various merb features but the vast majority are horrendously out of date and no longer applicable to current merb
if you do go with merb resign yourself to spending hours reading the minimally commented test suite and source code yourself to figure out how to get things done
you ll get a deeper understanding of the library that way anyway at the cost of some upfront screen time reading code. ruby-on-rails by contrast is a relatively stable target with extensive tutorials and documentation but it s all going to be obsolete in ruby-on-rails 3 when it s merbified
1325163
actionscript	haxe	actionscript	haxe
Pattern(s): 
haxe is an open source language driven by a quite small but active community haxe is a platform indepented language .
targets are flash player 6-8 and 9-10 bytecode or actionscript 3 source code javascript source code php source code nekovm bytecode or neko source code nekovm is a lightweight and extensible vm suitable for both server developement and desktop apps c++ source code android java source code is currently being worked on this means that as a web developer you can write both rich clients as well as servers in the same language .
the same code can be later reused for desktop mobile apps haxe is a very expressive and powerful language featuring first class functions anonymous functions and methods which are the same in haxe and closures as well as enums with parameters much like algebraic types that allow the use of functional approaches good type system including generics structural subtyping etc
1327014
converter	multibinding	converter	multibinding
Pattern(s): 
i would check the binding s comprising your multibinding in isolation and ensure they are correct
dependencyproperty.unsetvalue is passed into the converter when a binding is valid but does not have its value set yet
i would check the binding s comprising your multibinding in isolation and ensure they are correct
1328221
xslt	xquery
Pattern(s): 
xslt is good at document simplification but it s just missing too many basic features to be sufficient on its own
having jumped whole-heartedly on the linq-to-xml bandwagon i d say that it has less overlap with xslt that might seem at first glance
and i d positively love to see an xslt 2.0 xquery 1.0 implementation for .net
1331704
free	realloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 
probably the most efficient way would be to use length getindexes and initwithindexes length messages plus the realloc function to grow shrink the buffer
don t forget to release the old index path after getting its indexes into the buffer and before alloc king and init ing withindexes length the new one and to free the buffer when you re done
also don t forget that realloc frees the old buffer for you so you only need to free the last buffer.
1331913
strtod	malloc
Pattern(s): 
however since we re working with a file stream here you may have much better luck with fscanf to do the conversion for you
all of these functions are in the standard library except strtod which is c99-specific so it s in there if you re lucky
if you don t know how to use any of the functions named there it should be easy to find manpages for them either on your system section 3 man 3 malloc or the internets malloc 3
1331967
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
sorry
i ve always been impressed with postgresql
it s traditionally had a more complete feature set in terms of acid compliance support for advanced queries etc. than mysql it has solid windows odbc drivers and its documentation scrupulously points out any areas in which it deviates from the sql standard
1331967
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
it s traditionally had a more complete feature set in terms of acid compliance support for advanced queries etc. than mysql it has solid windows odbc drivers and its documentation scrupulously points out any areas in which it deviates from the sql standard
all databases it seems deviate in one respect or another but postgresql is the only one i ve seen that makes sure you know when you re doing so. i haven t tried the usage scenario you describe but i ve had no problems running it on linux and accessing it from both windows odbc and linux clients
i don t have any experience with firebird
1332398
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
Pattern(s): 
htmlspecialchars and htmlentities do not convert all of these characters ergo you cannot make your query safe by using these functions
to that end addslashes does not make your query safe either
other smaller downsides include what the other posters have already mentioned about mysql not always being used for web content as well as the fact that you are increasing the amount of storage and index space needed for your data consider one byte of storage for a quote character versus six or more bytes of storage for its entity form
1333065
junit	powermockito	junit	mockito
Pattern(s): 
from version 1.1 powermockito also has basic support for mockito
the test order in junit is intentionally undefined this is not a maven issue and it s probably just luck that your tests were running ok up until now
sal s answer addresses your question directly however forking the jvm on each test for large test counts can hugely increase your build time
1333879
ncover	partcover	ncover	partcover
Pattern(s): 
you can check partcover as an alternative
ncover is a commercial product now
you can check partcover as an alternative
1334903
qstring	qmodelindex
Pattern(s): 
the downside to this solution is that you lose the value that currentindexchanged emits but you can query the qcombobox for its index from changed
expanding on troubadour s answer here s a modification of the qsignalmapper documentation to fit your situation in the handler function changed qstring position note that a qstring is a pretty clumsy way to pass this information
a better choice would be a new qmodelindex that you pass and which the changed function would then delete
1335916
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
i think you need to convince yourself why on a case-by-case basis it is beneficial to use an interface because there is an overhead in adding an interface
on the other hand to counter the argument against interfaces because you can simply use inherited inherited has its draw backs one of them is that - at least in c# and java - you can only use inherited once single inherited
but the second - and maybe more important - is that inherited requires you to understand the workings of not only the parent class but all of the ancestor classes which makes extension harder but also more brittle because a change in the parent class implementation could easily break the subclassing
1337871
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
for performance single table inherited is usually best
from a good database design point of view joined table inherited is better
joined table inherited enables you to have foreign keys to subclassing enforced by the database it s a lot simpler to have non-null constraints for subclassing fields
1337871
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
joined table inherited enables you to have foreign keys to subclassing enforced by the database it s a lot simpler to have non-null constraints for subclassing fields
concrete table inherited is kind of worst of both worlds
single table inherited setup with declarative looks like this to make it joined table inherited you ll need to add to the subclassing
1338533
websphere	ibm
Pattern(s): 
the problem is explained in better detail at the following link ibm websphere webcontainer throws a filenotfoundexception when a request is received for a static file which does not exist on the file system
and the solution is explained at this link in this case setting the com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokefilterscompatibility value true websphere setting up custom properties for completeness sake i ll put how to correct this problem here -in the administrative console click servers and under servers click application servers -click on the server to which the custom property is to be applied -under configuration and container settings click web container settings and under web container settings click web container -under configuration and additional properties click custom properties -in the custom properties page click new -in the settings page enter the name of the custom property to be added in the name field and the value to be set for the custom property in the value field
note that some properties are case sensitive
1338712
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
just buy a bit more ram
postgresql has a richer set of abilities and a better optimizer
its ability to do hash joins often makes it much faster than mysql for joins
1339162
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
that way your script .bat ant maven whatever you want can be run with a simple click on the external tools menu
you can indeed associate an external tool to ant since the ant ui as provided in eclipse comes with a first-class ant build-file editor including syntax highlighting content assist templates and content formatting
this editor is automatically associated with files named build.xml and can be associated with other file names from the associations preference page
1340553
titlebar	window	width	height
Pattern(s): 
i can use his example as a basis to hook and replace my mdi child window frame drawing
the problem with this approach is that you either have to pick a titlebar width and stick with it and not respond to global theme adjustments that change the titlebar height or you have to take many different bmp snapshots at different sizes
for my purposes it is probably fine to just stick to one thickness and ignore user theme adjustments
1341082
xom	xerces	xom	xerces	jdom	xom	jdom	xerces	jdom	xerces
Pattern(s): 
it doesn t have a dependency on xerces though at least it doesn t need the xerces distro it works alongside the xerces that s packaged into the jre
the best lightweight alternative is in my opinion xom but jdom is still a very good api and i see no reason to replace it
it doesn t have a dependency on xerces though at least it doesn t need the xerces distro it works alongside the xerces that s packaged into the jre
1341371
background-repeat	margin
Pattern(s): 
the background will always be as large as it can be but you can stop it from repeating itself with background-repeat
background-repeat no-repeat
secondly the background does not go into margin-area of a box so if you want to have the background only be on the actual contents of a box you can use margin instead of padding
1342576
nsstring	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
Pattern(s): 
nsdata one is similar
category which adds md5 sha1 hashing to nsstring
nsdata one is similar
1343117
irc	telnet
Pattern(s): 
start with the telnet class create a new descendant to implement the specific commands you want to provide
the good thing is that the irc protocol is well documented

1343148
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
in majority of cases you will be able to map your domain classes to your tables with minimal or no changes stuff like different class table or properties column names is easily resolved via appropriate mappings
associations inherited is quite flexible etc... here s a link to hibernate annotations documentation
on a separate topic names like resturantcustomerfacade and resturantorderfacade are rather strange for domain objects
1345967
sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 
it may be removed if you want all the types included in the query
this query works if the ordering by which you prioritize the types can be done using sorting either alphabetically or numerically
if so using min or max together with grouping by is the simplest and most efficient solution
1346581
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
its very suspicious to see subclassing not calling their parent
imo the default decision should always be to call the superclass and then handle any different behavior
this is for all of the reasons that you mention it may be needed now but if not it may be needed in the future
1348076
copying	overwrite
Pattern(s): 
update default template to list models if user has view permission i modified the default template in contrib admin templates admin index.html
this could also be handled by copying the file to the local templates directory instead
i made changes in both so i have a copy if a later upgrade overwrite my changes
1348658
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
however it s worth pointing out that the maven super pom.xml configures central to have snapshots disabled so maven shouldn t ever check for updates for snapshots on central unless you ve overridden that in your own pom.xml settings
you can configure maven to use a mirror for the central repository this will redirect all requests that would normally go to central to your internal repository
in your settings.xml you would add something like this to set your internal repository as as mirror for central if you are using a repository manager like nexus for your internal repository
1350875
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
it is similar to how normal extension can add methods except the subclassing is only coupled by a reference which means that any superclass can be used
the cor pattern can modify an existing behaviour which is similar to overriding an existing method using inherited
you can choose to call super.xxx to continue up the chain or handle the message yourself
1350893
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
in this case the int values you gave will be converted to double
in both of your examples one list contains one number that is an int last 1 in the first case and 2 as the first element of the second list the rest of the numbers are doubles. therefore the inferred type of the list elements will be anyval which is the first common supertype of them so your outer list will become list list anyval
if you also try it with scala 2.8 then it should use numeric instead of anyval as it became the supertype of both double and int
1353844
qmodelindex	qstandarditemmodel
Pattern(s): 
to get to the functionality you would like you need to add child structures to the rows that you have already built up
you might have missed it but the qmodelindex class has a parent field this helps build up an hierarchic structure
you will probably well served by taking the qstandarditem and qstandarditemmodel classes
1354863
oncreate	ondestroy
Pattern(s): 
if you want to save state for reuse on any application start not just when your app is restarted after a screen rotation you re on your own
oncreate will be passed a null bundle when the application is starting
oncreate will be passed a non- null bundle if the application is restarting due to some previous system-required ondestroy such as the default case when the screen is rotated
1355745
pentaho	olap
Pattern(s): 
olap is non-relational or rather it s more of an application layer or optimized data structure that can live on a relational database
you probably want to look at pentaho - specifically mondrian

1358931
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
also if a directory is changed or deleted then you simple change and or delete the responsible function
you can write one function that will go through you re entire folder structure too though i wouldn t recommend it for ease of administration and code decoupling
there is no technically right way to do it
1359507
firefox	safari	firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
i d guess safari and opera also support this property
firefox uses the w3c-compliant textcontent property
i d guess safari and opera also support this property
1360578
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
there s a method to updating each of these numbers major number change means that the new versioning is incompatible with the old one and any dependent of the prior versioning will require code changes to upgrade to the new package
minor number change means that the new versioning is backward compatible with the previous versioning but has significant enhancements over the previous versioning
revision number is updated whenever a bugfix is applied to the build such that it doesn t bring a compatibility change or introduce newer features
1360662
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
one way to do so is just to take the pointer to where your object is stored in the memory and write every byte as it is to a file
since that representation is very specific to your programming language and how it represents objects in the memory an improvement would be to convert your object into a string representation which has a certain well known structure like xml or json so that you can a transfer it easier b store and restore it easier c since everybody knows how the format is defined any other programs can read your object too so putting you object into a database is just another form of serializable too
deserialization means that you can load restore that object again from where you saved it to
1361826
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 
the irony is that instrumentation is not required to do profiling coverage analysis as .net has an api for this
for some obscure reason however the visual studio coverage analysis and profiling does not use this api.
third party products such as the profilers dottrace and ants or coverage analysis tools such as ncover use the api approach and thus have no need to tamper with the assemblies themselves
1361919
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
Pattern(s): 
if you want a more sophisticated definition of matching than looking for an equal string you ll need to loop on the array yourself and perform your desired test on each object in the array one at a time
also be aware that isequal isequaltostring comparisons are case-sensitive foo is not equal to foo
if you want case-insensitive or locale-aware comparisons you ll need to loop on the array yourself and use one of nsstring s other comparison methods
1362908
unicode	ucs
Pattern(s): 
the first one is basic latin u+0000 u+007f encoded like ascii the second is latin-1 supplement u+0080 u+00ff encoded like iso 8859-1 and so on
unicode is a standard specified by the unicode consortium
the specification defines unicode s character set the universal character set ucs and some encodings to encode that characters the unicode transformation formats utf-7 utf-8 utf-16 and utf-32
1363485
sharepoint	spsite
Pattern(s): 
it is almost always better to use dependency injection to provide an spsite or spweb reference for your class to use perhaps through the constructor
that way your class has no disposal concerns it just consumes the sharepoint context
that said if you wish to proceed with this pattern implementing idisposable is the correct approach
1363582
gridview	repeater
Pattern(s): 
see scott mitchell s why i don t use datasets in my asp.net applications for some details about datareader performance - as long as you aren t optimizing prematurely it s quite good advice. instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater
i m not sure whether you meant the gridview control or just a conceptual grid - the basic architecture would be the same for a gridview then add a handler to the repeater.itemdatabound that checks if the child data reader s current record matches
if it does manually render your detail data for that master record
1363670
wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 
this is my personal pov i ve created extensions to both of them and i think joomla s way of structuring extensions is more complicated
i think the wordpress documentation is better too
just a simple comparison in wordpress you just write a bunch of php files inside a folder use some action hookers to common actions in wordpress and you re done
1364702
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
it is ok for the repository to have some logic pertaining to where or how to save the data but it would be best for that to be encapsulated in a common area when possible
for example if you were to have person objects and needed to save to different tables according to gender you could do this using inherited if person is woman save here.
or properties on the object if person.gender gender.female save here.
1367563
ienumerable	ilist
Pattern(s): 
if ilist has all the methods you need then use that
if ienumerable has everything you need then you could be even more generic and use that instead

1368708
agile	sprint
Pattern(s): 
technical debt being something that doesn t immediately add business value that is sometimes an important thing to use to prevent some problems as there may be problems with a particular architecture and so part of a sprint may be spent doing a re-arch that has to be communicated so that if there is a sprint with little to demo this is why
i don t know if the idea of a self-organizing or self-managing team is part of agile but it has been a bit of a challenge for me to have enough faith and trust in my co-workers that things will work out fine
the professionals that are the rest of my team know what has to be done are reasonable honest people with integrity to just get the work done and not be jerks about getting things done
1370570
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
oracle has a sys_guid function
postgresql has a uuid type
mysql has a uuid function
1370892
strdup	strncpy	strdup	strtok
Pattern(s): 
there are some c string functions available in the standard c library
strdup - duplicate a string strtok - breaking a string into tokens
beware - this modifies the original string. strcpy - copying string strstr - find string in string strncpy - copy up to n bytes of string etc there is a good online reference here with a full list of available c string functions for searching and finding things
1371893
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 
in comparing two words for example the most important feature is the base character such as the difference between an a and a b. accent differences are typically ignored if there are any differences in the base letters
case differences uppercase versus lowercase are typically ignored if there are any differences in the base or accents. punctuation is variable
in some situations a punctuation character is treated like a base character
1372182
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
consider this class it could be rewritten as if the initializer can throw a checked exception all constructors must declare they can throw it
the outer braces mean that you re making an anonymous subclass the second braces are the object initializer
the initializer is run before the class constructor but after any super calls and therefore also after any superclass initializers
1372310
openssl	crypto++
Pattern(s): 
the algorithm is very simple as you can see from the php code
openssl is so prevalent nowadays
i don t see any reason to use crypto++ for common crypto applications like this
1372456
post	put	post	put
Pattern(s): 
put is mostly used to edit existing entities
i would definitely go for post as each time you post your data a new email will be sent created
put is mostly used to edit existing entities
1372564
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
it has it s own tortoisebzr but it isn t as good as some of its cousins so i recommnend the excellent bazaar explorer instead
one of the great things about bazaar is it s flexibility and the ease with which you can change workflow or include another developer in a project that started off solo
a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial
1373055
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
p 3 means go to the location p dereference the value there move three past it and fetch the chars there
a and b are both arrays of int
a 0 is not a memory location containing a memory address it is a memory location containing an int
1373404
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 

don t forget to compare a properly optimized for-loop if you really care about performance
some variant of duff s device if the arrays is sufficiently long and prefix --i not suffix i-- although most compilers will probably correct that automatically.
1373617
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
there are thousands of web pages devoted to this very topic
the simple answer is that postgresql is better for both features and security
however mysql is much more popular so is more likely to be directly supported by a random application especially web applications
1373943
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
Pattern(s): 
you probably also need a companion objectinputstream subclass does the same by overriding resolveobject object
write an objectoutputstream subclass call enablereplaceobject and then override replaceobject object
you probably also need a companion objectinputstream subclass does the same by overriding resolveobject object
1374694
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation
i personally find postgresql a lot easier to maintain than several other database
not as easy as mssql
1376340
multiplying	add
Pattern(s): 
in the calculation of zcircular note fft y n which is matlab syntax for padding out the y signal with zeros up to n before calculating the fft
this might be considered inefficient in memory usage but compare the speed linear convolution 4096 multiplying adds of 64 each 262144 multiplying adds circular convolution 2 ffts of 4096 + 1 complex multiplying of 2 4096 elements + 1 inverse fft 3 4096 log2 4096 + 4096 6 172032 assuming 6 operations for the complex multiplying basically the nlogn speed of the fft even when you need three of them beats the n m convolution operation unless m is very short
edit add speed estimate for 2d case it s worth adding that for 2d data the speed advantage is magnified
1376408
post	get
Pattern(s): 
data for gets is sent over the url query string
data for post is sent separately
some browsers have a maximum url length i think internet explorer is 2048 characters and if the query string becomes too long you ll get an error
1378670
or-operator	and-operator
Pattern(s): 

there is already an accepted answer but i like to mention that the or-operator is also called default-operator because it doesn t return a boolean but instead the left or right hand argument
same goes for the and-operator which is also called guard-operator
1378820
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
i ve heard better things about git recently heck the spring guys are using it and that often speaks volumes but we are on subversion ourselves so it s all i can comment on
perforce is quite heavy weight esp for a small team
i d strongly consider svn or git for good solid well supported vcs then use the available tooling and best practice all free from your friendly local internet to support features you need
1379497
operands	scalar	operands	scalar
Pattern(s): 
they differ in how the operands are evaluated as well as whether or not they operate on arrays or scalar and operator and | or operator can operate on arrays in an element-wise fashion
and || are short-circuit versions for which the second operands is evaluated only when the result is not fully determined by the first operands
these can only operate on scalar not arrays
1382558
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
any person with access to the stored hash can re-submit it to the server and gain access to accounts
in simple terms if the submitted hash which is the same as the submitted hash were to leak via any other vulnerability within the application via sql injection for instance then the application has a vulnerability where in it protects the passwords inadequately
if the underlying vulnerability must be fixed then it is necessary to treat the submitted hash as a password in clear text which should then be hashed with a salt preferably before comparison with a stored hash

factors	mean
Pattern(s): 
not a trivial task i reckon
this is possible w o any wait if you actually split the execution stack up to the for-loop you execute on the calling thread after the for-loop you finish on the last queue thread whether this will work or not depends on many factors and i can t say w o knowing more about the caller context if is possible to suspend its execution on the calling thread and resume it on a queued thread
btw by exit thread i do not mean an abrupt thread abort but a gracious return and the entire calling stack is prepared to hand over execution context to the queue thread
1384024
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
if you don t want the user to be able to find out what your page is really doing server-side code is probably the only option
anything client-side like html or javascript can and will be nosed into obfuscated or not
and nobody likes it when you tinker with context menus
1384595
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if you want to add the syntax for multiple users ire and curses is on a better track
is a unix shortcut that means the currently logged-in user s home folder which is typically something like
you should be able to find that folder by executing cd mkdir -p .vim syntax cd .vim syntax the mkdir command creates the directory if it doesn t already exist
1384699
mako	genshi
Pattern(s): 
-
as the mako homepage points out mako s advantages are pretty clear insanely fast instantly familiar to anyone who s handy with python in terms of both syntax and features
genshi chooses interpretation instead of ahead-of-time python code generation according to their faq that s for clarity of error messages and an arm s length approach to python by using xpath for selectors xinclude instead of inheritance etc so it might be more natural to people who know no python but are very competent with xml
1384699
mako	genshi	mako	genshi
Pattern(s): 
genshi chooses interpretation instead of ahead-of-time python code generation according to their faq that s for clarity of error messages and an arm s length approach to python by using xpath for selectors xinclude instead of inheritance etc so it might be more natural to people who know no python but are very competent with xml
if python programmers i suggest mako for speed and familiarity
if xml experts that are uncomfortable with python genshi might be a better fit for arm s length from python approach and closer match to xml culture
1385686
boost	allocator
Pattern(s): 
it stores a c-style string after all
boost just says not to store objects which may throw exceptions
so if you allocate memory you just have to be able to handle the case where allocator fails
1387133
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
yeah javascript s objects don t have classes and chainable constructors like that
it has its own model of prototypes which can be quite confusing but doesn t actually deliver the proper potential of prototype inherited because it s still tied to constructor-functions which look like class constructors but aren t really
unfortunately this isn t truly creating a subclassing
1387189
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 
then it processes operators first exponentiation then multiplication and division together and finally addition and subtraction together
because well-formed input is expected as specified in the challenge it doesn t check for the addition operator explicitly since it s the last legal operator after all the others are processed
the calculation function lacking golf compression would look something like this some amount of compression would probably make this function easier to read
1387511
median	max
Pattern(s): 
this would be called an online median selection algorithm although wikipedia only talks about online min max selection
here s an approximate algorithm and a lower bound on deterministic and approximate online median selection a lower bound means no faster algorithm is possible
if there are a small number of possible values compared to n you can probably break the comparison-based lower bound just like you can for sorting
1388552
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
to do this download the source of python and do a . configure --prefix opt assuming you want to install it to opt which is where most install non system dependant stuff to the reason why i say this is because some other system libraries may depend on the current versioning of python
another reason is that as you are doing your own custom development it is much better to have control over what versioning of the libraries or interpreters you are using rather than have a operating system patch break something that was working before
a controlled upgrade is better than having the application break on you all of a sudden
1391094
short	base	short	base
Pattern(s): 
hence the virtual function isn t really virtual yet - it won t be untill base completes and derived is processed
also doing this would break the open closed-principle which in short reads classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
you are by altering the base static initialization trying to modify its behavior rather than extending it
1391566
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 

since auto implemented getter takes the same name for the property and the actual private storage variables
i think the point being said is that use the auto implemented instead of field so that you can change it in the future if in case you need to add logic to getter and setter
1391631
irssi	mirc
Pattern(s): 
you re not likely to get a standard cohesive behavior across irc clients...ansi escape codes are processed by more of the old-fare staple unix clients like irssi and mirc sometimes does its own thing
in my python irc bot i can get bold to show up in irssi using x02sometext x02 which shows up like this is x02some text x02 this is some text as for colors i believe you re looking for x03aa bb where a is the foreground color and b the background color what you d type in after ctrl+k
not 100 for sure though
1394287
return-value-optimization	nrvo
Pattern(s): 
here is a good article about nrvo in visual c++ 2005
in two first cases return-value-optimization optimization will take place
return-value-optimization is old feature and most compilers supports it
1397627
wxpython	win32gui
Pattern(s): 
one hard uphill slog separately on each and every single platform
if you re up for a serious challenge deeply familiar with vpython reasonably familiar with qt and acquainted with the underlying window-level architecture on all platforms you care about and with a minor in wxpython the place to start is mientki s amazing contribution
he s actually working well below wxpython s level of abstraction and in terms of win32gui calls win32con constants plus a finite state-machine clocked by a wx.timer at 100 milliseconds though he does admit that the result from the latter frankenstein surgery is.
1398788
int	double
Pattern(s): 
double is just a c# keyword working as alias for the class system.double the most common thing is to use the aliases
the same for string system.string int system.int32 also see built-in types table c# reference

1399957
cpu	hyperthreading
Pattern(s): 
when it s running as a multi-threaded aplication you can use the system s performance-monitoring tool to see whether locks are a problem
assuming that your threads would lock instead of busy-wait then having 100 cpu for several threads is a sign that locking isn t a problem
conversely something that looks like 50 total cpu utilitization on a dual-processor machine is a sign that only one thread is running and so maybe your locking is a problem that s preventing more than one concurrent thread when counting the number of cpus in your machine beware multi-core and hyperthreading
1400026
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
for fast bulk processing in simple cases consider also the array module -- the fromstring and tostring methods can operate on large number of bytes speedily and the byteswap method can get you the other endianness native to non-native or vice versa again rapidly and for a large number of items the whole array
python s int has the same endianness as the processor it runs on
the struct module lets you convert byte blobs to ints and viceversa and some other data types too in either native little-endian or big-endian ways depending on the format string you choose start the format with or no endianness chars to use native endianness and native sizes -- everything else uses standard sizes for native for little-endian or
1400676
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
internet explorer has certain keys that can t be overridden and certain keys which - even when overridden - still executes default behavior--like the f11 key which switches to full-screen mode and the f1 key which opens up a help-window
google-chrome does not allow you to use key-events at all
firefox is the most benign but still sketchy--like internet explorer
1401186
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
is due the codedom limitations while loops can t be declared using codedom and for loops are seen as the more general form as an iteration loops
this is a pretty loose reason to choose this other than the fact that the for-loop implementation can be used both for normal code and codedom generated code
that is it can be more standard
1401765
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
Pattern(s): 
unfortunately it doesn t offer a text console interface but the serial port can be connected to a local pipe file and that can probably be worked with just as well
you can also use virtualbox instead of vmware
the virtualbox sdk allows you to directly control the keyboard the mouse the serial port and the parallels port of the guest without the virtualbox guest tools installed
1402777
concave	convex	concave	vertex
Pattern(s): 
if positive this vertex is convex and protects much of the interior
if negative this is a concave vertex that excludes much of the exterior
now eliminate the least valuable vertices
1403012
agile	sprint
Pattern(s): 
the problem is when architects and or developers begin to believe that a particular methodology or technology is a golden hammer. that is when things become religious and religion and reason do not play nicely together
oh and by the way agile does not necessarily mean you don t use some of the acronyms you mention or some framework that implements them
those decisions are usually made far in advance of implementing the sorts of things that developers have come to associate with agile user stories sprint etc
1403346
cpython	ironpython	cpython	ironpython
Pattern(s): 
numpy s starting to get feasible thanks to ironclad but not production-level as numpy is from ironpython as witnessed by the 0.5 version number for ironclad c
scipy is huge and sprawling and chock full of c-coded and fortran-coded extensions i have no first-hand experience but i suspect less than half will even run much less run flawlessly under any implementation except cpython
ironpython should make it easier via .net approaches but cpython is not that far via com implementation in win32all
1403346
jython	pypy
Pattern(s): 
one way or another or even on the jvm via jython or in peculiar environments via pypy python is surely an awesome language whatever implementation s you pick for a given application
- note that you don t need to stick with one implementation though you should probably pick one version -- 2.5 for maximal compatibility with ironpython jython google app engine etc
2.6 if you don t care about any deployment options except cpython on a machine under my own sole or virtual control
1403548
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
the book has an example of serialization and deserialization of an abstract class but it s hand-written also more info could be found in a draft book called scala.xml
i don t know if an arbitrary object graph could be serializable and deserialized to from xml using built-in scala language features and libraries but since there are some native support for xml in scala i ll mention them
more detail could be found in ch
1408260
powerpc	i386
Pattern(s): 
file -b usr bin atrm setuid mach-o universal binary with 3 architectures usr bin atrm for architecture x86_64 mach-o 64-bit executable x86_64 usr bin atrm for architecture i386 mach-o executable i386 usr bin atrm for architecture ppc7400 mach-o executable powerpc so then it is just a matter of using find and filtering appropriately
something like this should find all binaries on the system that have a powerpc subsection
powerpc only is a little more difficult
1408299
pthreads	fork
Pattern(s): 
your server process can fork and answer queries without recreating the tree. writing a daemon is not trivial but very well documented at least for c
you should have no trouble translating this to php using the pcntl and pthreads extensions

1408592
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
when main_table has a foreign key to t0 it s like saying main_table must have a reference to some entity that is payable but any object descending from that superclass is okay to use
the type column is just a trick to make sure that a given t0.id can be referenced only by one subclass table at a time
it s kind of optional if you can rely on your application logic to insert a given child row into only one of the subclass tables
1410034
tostring	string.format
Pattern(s): 
string.format is a destructive algorithm which means you can t always go back
create a new class inheriting from string where you add a member that keeps track of the and the override tostring and modify a little your code
if it becomes too tricky just create the same class but not inheriting from string and modify a little more your code
1410869
set	bag
Pattern(s): 
some workaround to overcome this issue 1º conversion pattern by using a encapsuled bag collection plus your desired set or list exposed as a property 2º use manytoone instead of onetomany 3º caching - when applied because of depending on your requirements your configuration can increase or decrease the performance of your application
see here 4 sql constraint - if you want a collection that behaves like a set you can use a sql constraint which can be applied to a column or set of columns
see here
1412487
post	get
Pattern(s): 
and the data string then make a get web request to the url
if the form s method is post then the data is submitted in a different area of the web request
take a look at this page for the c# code
1412628
notsupportedexception	argumentexception
Pattern(s): 
this looks like a similar situation
i d go with notsupportedexception
while argumentexception looks fine it s really expected when an argument passed to a method is unacceptable
1412628
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	invalidoperationexception	notsupportedexception
Pattern(s): 
while argumentexception looks fine it s really expected when an argument passed to a method is unacceptable
a type argument is a defining characteristic for the actual method you want to call not a real argument. invalidoperationexception should be thrown when the operation you re performing can be valid in some cases but for the particular situation it s unacceptable
notsupportedexception is thrown when an operation is inherently unsupported
1412855
profiler	xperf
Pattern(s): 
throwing in random sleeps is rarely a good idea speaking from experience here yes i ve done this and yes i ve fixed this later and neither is speculating on sources of performance problems particularly in a multi-threaded environment
visual studio 2010 beta1 has a great profiler that is perfect for understanding what s causing the slowdowns if it s within your application hazim shafi s blog walks through how to use it
you can also look at the xperf tool which is available in the windows performance toolkit you have to use the platform sdk installer but you only need to install that node so it s actually pretty fast
1413369
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
you re best off writing
i would think converting a bool to an int is undefined
however i don t believe its appropriate to write out that special case explicitly in your function either otherwise your function is incongruent with the way .net implicitly treats ints and boolean
1415882
subclass	superclass	subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
you want to pass all the existing arguments onto the superclass s method but want to ensure that your class keeps working even if the signature changes in a future version
another reason you might want to use and is if you re extending an existing method in a subclass
you want to pass all the existing arguments onto the superclass s method but want to ensure that your class keeps working even if the signature changes in a future version
1416090
mef	prism
Pattern(s): 
mef is part of the .net framework 4.0 as well as the next version of silverlight
we currently ship mef for .net 3.5 on codeplex
as far as prism with mef the challenge at this point is you need to write a bunch of code as prism does not yet have implementations of the services necessary to talk to mef one option is to use the mef unity integration layer we have in mef contrib mefcontrib.codeplex.com
1416152
virtualenv	setuptools
Pattern(s): 
at the moment afaik virtualenv is not supported with python 3 because among other things setuptools the magic behind easy_install is not yet supported on python 3 although there is work in progress towards a solution for that
btw many people use doug hellman s virtualenvwrapper to simplify use of virtualenv

1416392
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
so you could have a dictionary map hashtable whatever it s called in your language that maps a type to another dictionary
the second dictionary maps a second type to the right comparison function for those two types
the general comparewith function would use that data structure to look up the right comparison function to call
1416623
ocp	principles
Pattern(s): 
so indeed the open closed principles refers only to stable ready for compile and use entities
i never heard of ocp being that
maybe you are refering to something else but the ocp i know says a module class must be open for extension but closed for modification meaning that you shouldn t modify the source code of the module to enhance it but the module or object should be easy to extend
1416636
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
you should convert it to number for example using the unary plus operator you could alternatively use also you are using a for..in loops to iterate over orders if orders is an arrays you should use a normal for-loop that is because the for...in statement is intended to be used for iterate over object properties for arrays it may be tempting to use it because seems to work but it s not recommended since it will iterate over the object properties and if you have extended the array.prototype those properties will be also iterated in addition to the numeric indexes
another reason to avoid it is because the order of iteration used by this statement is arbitrary and iterating over an arrays may not visit elements in numeric order and also it seems to be much more slower than a simple for-loop
if iteration order is not important i personally like iterating backwards
1417633
xfs	btrfs
Pattern(s): 
ext3 seems to always write back deleted files no matter how small they are or how soon they are deleted
xfs does not always do so which can result in much better performance for applications which use short-lived temporary files if you have enough ram
i suspect that the modern linux filesystems ext4 btrfs do this too
1419094
implements	sealed
Pattern(s): 
also declaring protected members in a sealed class gives you a compiler warning
so you ve implements it correctly. calling gc.suppressfinalize this from within the finalizer is not necessary for obvious reasons but it cannot harm
having a finalizer is essential when dealing with unmanaged resources because they are not freed automatically you have to do it in the finalizer with is called automatically after the object has been garbage collected
1419304
gitolite	gitosis
Pattern(s): 
its code can be found on github when i first wrote this answer it didn t support gitweb or git-daemon integration but it does now
the gitolite project offers this functionality
it s a rewrite of gitosis in perl
1420966
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
Pattern(s): 
if you don t get it right you face the same sort of cross-site-scripting issues as if you failed to use htmlspecialchars in your html-generating php both of these will give you problems if your names contain apostrophes or backslashes
this is one of the few places where addslashes can actually be the right thing for once
also you should be aware that javascript files can be included by a script tag on another domain that would normally be denied access to your pages under the javascript same origin policy
1420987
sctp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
future versions of this specification may mandate that clients support sctp.
sctp requires more design within the application to get the best use of it
there are more options than tcp the sockets-like api came later and it is young
1422599
pop-up	dialog
Pattern(s): 
you want the modality to be local to the jinternalframe that popped up the modal dialog
first you need to understand that there are really 2 parts to a modal pop-up that can be approximated by something of your own creation
1 the code that sets the modal pop-up blocks until the pop-up closes and 2 the background does not respond to gui events while the modal pop-up is visible
1423015
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
despite or as a consequence of its alien outlook stl is revolutionary library
and a library like boost despite its small size when compared to some complete frameworks like java or .net apis is a massive repository of excellent code offered to you to study
just because you find some new feature strange or alien don t underestimate it
1423772
ckeditor	nicedit
Pattern(s): 
xinha - which i ve not really used but it seems to be a fairly robust package
ckeditor and tinymce are both fine editors
i d also add to the list nicedit - which is very easy to integrate but has a few drawbacks -- mostly that the editable area is in a div not an iframe so you can end up with some css leakage
1423852
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
checked limits it to checkbox radio button that are selected within the previous group
if you want to avoid this altogether mark one of the radio button as checked in the html code which would guarantee that one radio button is always selected

1423894
mvp	presenter	mvp	presenter
Pattern(s): 
in any case it should be starting to become clear that a presenter is an elaborate middleman
under different circumstances you might be tempted to refactor a middleman out but here its is intentional to keep logic out of the view where it is harder to test avoid direct dependencies between the view and the model at times i ve also seen the model used for mvp triad communication
the benefit of this is the presenter s don t need to know each other exist
1424762
actionlistener	changelistener
Pattern(s): 
additemlistener edit it is unlikely you want to use a changelistener as it fires multiple times per click
an itemlistener fires only once per click. see here edit2 just to expand on this an actionlistener on a jradiobutton will fire every time a user clicks on it even if it is already selected
if that s what you want fine but i find it annoying
1425299
put	get
Pattern(s): 
i suggest you get 10 numbers only as these can be removed from the 1-25 complete sequence to produce a set of 15
in other words drawing 15 to put in is the same drawing 10 to take out.
next you need to assert the uniqueness of the sets
1426775
put	get
Pattern(s): 
both ati and nvidia are offering beta versions of their opencl drivers but ati s supports only cpu computation and nvidia s requires signing an nda to get
simply put opencl has not been around long enough for comprehensive examples like these to have been developed and demonstrated
that said gaining access to nvidia s opencl drivers is not difficult
1427267
watij	webdriver	watij	webdriver
Pattern(s): 
webdriver has a python api too
you could use watij if you re into java and want to automate internet explorer
alternatively you can use webdriver and also automate firefox
1427865
jar	war
Pattern(s): 
if the 3rd party jar is defined as a dependency in your war project it will automatically be bundled into the web-inf lib folder of the war when it is packaged by the war plugin
any class in the jar would then be on the classpath and therefore available to be referenced in your spring configuration
also note that if the 3rd-party jar is a properly-defined maven project it s dependencies will be defined in its pom
1428924
feof	getchar
Pattern(s): 
you have to test something against eof such as the result of a getchar call
one way to test for the end of a stream is with the feof function
if feof stdin note that the end of stream state will only be set after a failed read
1429197
folder	directory	prop	each
Pattern(s): 
you could also have specific folders for different eclipse versions so each developer wouldn t be forced to upgrade if something changed in the .settings or .project file between versions
i ve played with the idea with subversion of having a myproject_eclipseproj folder that only contains the the eclipse project files and directory with an svn externals prop that pulls in all the myproject files directory
so the layout would be the myproject folder would be pure code no eclipse contaimination
1430199
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
emacs used to be the only editor of the two that was programmable and while vim has a lot of weird levels to its programmability with the addition of python and ruby bindings and more i forget vim is also programmable in most ways you d care for
i use vim and i m fairly happy with it

1430200
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
both are however a topic of religious discussions among the programmer and superuser community users and in that respect both are excellent for starting flame wars if put in contact in the same sentence question
vim better as a simple editor fewer keys required for simple tasks more active scripting community - internal language vimscript one central repository of scripts plugins color schemes .
also extensible in python ruby can be made portable emacs has some problems with that emacs non modal by default most of today s editors have taken this approach
1430200
vim	emacs	vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
also extensible in python ruby can be made portable emacs has some problems with that emacs non modal by default most of today s editors have taken this approach
though there is evil-mode which emulates vim behavior
more powerful language for extending it elisp is a full blown language and in emacs you can practically redefine everything
1431606
firefox	safari	firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
they will also work in both 32 and 64-bit safari
assuming your code makes no assumptions about what browser it s running in the same npapi-code should work in all browsers i ve seen npapi plugins that dynamically resolve xul related functions in the blind faith that npapi is used only by firefox despite it being the standard plugin format for more or less every non-ie browser
plugins like simbl misuse macos apis designed for a distinct but important purpose to arbitrarily inject their own code into the safari address space -- when people use these being mislead into believing it s safe safari becomes substantially less stable and frequently stops working after major updates in an extreme case the leopard blue screen of death was because of logitech using ape to do something similar to simbl
1434200
puts	gets	puts	gets
Pattern(s): 
it just gets printed to the terminal as the return value of the last statement similar to that cryptic output after you assign the proc to s
s does not return a value as sepp2k points out in the comment puts returns nil so nil automatically becomes the return value since that is the last statement in the proc
it just gets printed to the terminal as the return value of the last statement similar to that cryptic output after you assign the proc to s
1434257
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql is the only system of the major four that does have allow an easy way to generate arbitrary resultsets
oracle sql server and postgresql do have those connect by recursive cte s and generate_series respectively

1434331
rubygems	bundler
Pattern(s): 
i actually didn t really agree with him before i read it now i do
if you look at the comments you will see the author say this the point i was not trying to make is that rubygems is bad or that people shouldn t use it
i use rubygems and think it s a critical piece of ruby s success i just don t have the line require rubygems anywhere in my library s source code because it s not necessary or convenient and makes it hard impossible for other environments like bundler rip gae debian hand rolled etc to use the library without rubygems which is often important
1436057
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
validation can and should occur in the view first
this can readily be done client-side using jquery libraries
but the data must still be validated server-side after the user submits and if there are still problems with the data you must still provide an explanation to the user
1436480
jtree	jtable	children	parent
Pattern(s): 
i was able to mock up a quick example of the outline tree table in eclipse with the org-netbeans-swing-outline.jar imported to my project in about 30 minutes i am slow at typing i create a treenode to hold the boolean s that will interoperate well with the jtable s built-in checkbox rendering mechnanism
the netbeans rowmodel is the key to making this a table instead of a simple jtree here is the finished albeit simplistic product alt text i have updated the setvaluefor method to iterate over a node s children and set the checkboxes as selected or deselected when a parent has been modified

1436515
profiling	instrumentation	profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 
oh and yeah my app crashes sometimes during cpu sampler which i believe has to do with instrumentation
i got it to work only with my development provisioning profiling which is not my distribution profiling
i also made sure i have the same provisioning profiling in project and target and turned on get-task-allow in entitlements.plist it sometimes still doesn t work and then i restart xcode unplug plugin my iphone clean the target and run instrumentation from xcode via start with performance tool this is by the way with xcode 3.1 sdk 3.0. hope this gets less painful with sdk 3.1 which i m downloading now
1436670
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup
Pattern(s): 
a flag should be set when the mousedown occurs
if the flag is set and mousemove occurs then change the position of the div according to the mouse position
unset the flag when mouseup occurs
1436743
ckeditor	jwysiwyg
Pattern(s): 
jwysiwyg is one based on jquery
ckeditor is one with more options
tinymce - javascript wysiwyg editor is also another option
1438610
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
this means the processors would need to work harder but it has a lot less memory to read
the cpu is a fast resource
compared to the cpu memory is slow
1440607
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
without more information the complete stack trace - cut out the lines referencing your own project name if you need but no others and the code which does the serialization and deserialization it is impossible to get further insight into the problem
by the way no comment or answer thinks that you serializable a hashmap and want to deserialize myclass it isn t really possible - you can t decide what class you get when you deserialize
i think you are misunderstanding the comments
1441997
clang	llvm	clang	llvm
Pattern(s): 
if you really need the dynamic functionality to be compiled to machine code your best bet is probably going to be using clang llvm
clang is the c objective-c front end being developed by apple and a few others to make online dynamic recompilation perform well
llvm is the backend clang uses to translate from a portable bytecode to native machine code
1441997
clang	llvm
Pattern(s): 
llvm is the backend clang uses to translate from a portable bytecode to native machine code
be advised that clang does not currently support much of c++ since that s such a difficult language to get right

udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented
the thing to keep in mind about udp broadcasts is that a broadcast message is confined to the broadcast domain
in short if you have computers that are separated by a layer 3 device a router then broadcasts are not going to work because the router will not transmit broadcast messages from one broadcast domain to another
1443181
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
using dialogs will have the same effect
i can also see a problem in your logic regarding the fact that you want your superclass to be calling the constructor of its children which of course can be any type
i recommend you rewrite it like the following it is not a nice idea to expect the superclass to know the parameter to be used in the init of its subclassing since it is really hard to ensure that all the constructor will be the same maybe the animal dialog window takes diff parameters
1444501
hash	md5	hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
highest probability still remains md5
the hash seems to contain only hexadecimal characters each character represents 4bits total count is 32 characters - this is a 128-bits length hash
standard hashing algorithms that comply with these specs are haval md2 md4 md5 and ripemd128
1444988
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
Pattern(s): 
and always provide an explanatory text for your exceptions you will appreciate them some sad day
personally i d like nullpointerexception to only happen by accident so something else must be used to indicate that an illegal argument value was passed
illegalargumentexception is fine for this
1445694
many-to-one	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 
replacing one-to-one with one-to-many is pretty much never a good idea
you can replace it with unique many-to-one but there are other possibly better options

vim	textmate
Pattern(s): 
not sure if you were referring to vim s own tabs there or pining for textmate s
it s unclear what vim version you re using but it s had tabs since at least 7.0 which seems to be installed everywhere i look lately and they re awesome
tabe opens a new one short for tab edit so tabe for empty or tabe path to file for opening a file in a new tab you can move between adjacent tabs with gt gt and there s a bunch of other tab-related nav commands too as you might expect from vim help tabs my workflow for large projects tends to involve a bunch of tabs each with between 1 and 3 windows depending on what sort of context i need
1447194
jmeter	soapui
Pattern(s): 
however soapui is not good for regression and load testing
next step we load the xml into jmeter
it can drive load from multiple machines and we can easily stress our servers to the limits
1447922
clearinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 
from statechangehandler function
and don t forget to clear the interval using clearinterval intervalid
the difference between setinterval and settimeout is that settimeout triggers expression only once whereas setinterval keeps triggering expression again and again unless you tell it to stop
1448102
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
java actually uses the term map as well as dictionary -- map was added later when they realized dictionary should have been an interface but since the name was already used they had to come up with a new name. table has the disadvantage that it can easily be confused with the database term
dictionary is the standard computer science term
complaining that a real world dictionary isn t the same as the abstract data type is like complaining that a heap isn t literally a disorganized pile of stuff or that a queue doesn t involve people waiting in line to buy tickets
1448395
daemons	systemd
Pattern(s): 
however every syslogd i know will allow you to specify logfiles on a per-facility basis so you can have your first application log to second one to and so on
furthermore newer syslog daemons like syslog-ng allow for splitting messages to different files by evaluating the message against a regular expression write log strings which have railsapp_1 in them to var log railsapp_1.log and so on
so configure your syslogd appropriately and you are done the gory details of changing that configuration should be asked on serverfault.com if your systemd s man pages don t help you doing it.
1448845
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
instead make the sprite static in the subclassing and then use the method structure described by laurence
it s not possible for it to be static in the superclass
that static variable in the superclass is shared effectively a singleton by all the sub classes
1448859
tinyxml	xerces	pugixml	rapidxml
Pattern(s): 
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42
here is an excerpt from pugixml documentation the main features are low memory consumption and fragmentation the win over pugxml is 1.3 times tinyxml - 2.5 times xerces dom - 4.3 times 1
exact numbers can be seen in comparison with existing parsers section
1450998
rational-numbers	fractions	rational-numbers	zero	int	double
Pattern(s): 
i will by zero
the reason for the exception is that an int does not hold rational-numbers basically fractions
so trying to parse 0.3 to a int is nonsense. a double or a float datatype can hold rational-numbers
1451846
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
python and c# generators allow yield to be placed only inside the body of a generator
common lisp although does not have native continuations allows to create delimited continuations using cps transformers like cl-cont
so generators in common lisp can be written in pretty much the same way as scheme generators
1452840
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 
the second approach is more efficient on modern graphics hardware because it allows you to draw multiple different sprites from one large texture by specifying different u v coordinates to select each individual sprite from the composite sheet
because u v coordinates can be streamed along with vertex data to a shader this allows you to draw a large group of sprites much more efficiently than you could if you had to switching textures which means changing shader state for each poly
that means you can draw more sprites per millisecond and thus get more on screens
1453713
vtk	paraview	vtk	paraview
Pattern(s): 
i would recommend some small scale experiments using either paraview or the python vtk bindings to see if you can create a reasonable visualization of your simulations
vtk is a pretty powerful toolkit in that it offers reasonably efficient implementations of a wide variety of visualization algorithms
to see some of what vtk can do i recommend checking out paraview
1454360
textmate	textwrangler
Pattern(s): 
hope this helps
textmate is good choice
other than that crea text textwrangler nvu pagespinner are also alternatives
1455967
cookiemanager	urlconnection
Pattern(s): 
before java 6 there is no cookiehandler implementation in the jre you have to write your own
if you are on java 6 you can do this cookiehandler.setdefault new cookiemanager
urlconnection s cookie handling is really weak
1457040
post	get
Pattern(s): 
this is usually done in tandem with automated unit testing but doesn t have to be
this blog post is a decent introduction to unit testing and code coverage using xcode
the section on gcov which only works with code generated by gcc by the way explains how to get xcode to build instrumented code that can record how often it has been executed
1457077
teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 
when necessary we use nant
we switched from cruisecontrol.net to teamcity primarily because of ease of configuration
teamcity also has more features but the main reason was that a nice web ui is simpler to use than xml configuration files
1457077
teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 
teamcity also has more features but the main reason was that a nice web ui is simpler to use than xml configuration files
edit most tasks teamcity will do out of the box
when necessary we use nant
1458417
division	subtract	division	subtraction
Pattern(s): 
this allows greater flexibility in the timing of the application of each digit to the operation like for instance deferring the application of the secondary digits of the divisor a x 1 until after a partial quotient is created from the prior step s division by a 1 which in turn allows them to be applied as a product subtraction rather than a division operation
this appears to be a clever transformation of the long division algorithm
the clever parts seems to be that they are only using the division operation for the first digit a1 and avoid having to use the other a x s in the same way by applying them in the next step by subtract their product against the partial quotient from the interim remainder
1460000
salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
if i remember correctly this is precisely how wordpress handled this issue
a great way to update the passwords while also making them more secure is to change to using a salt sha1 for passwords
a sha1 is harder to create a collision against and it also has a different string length to md5
1461325
put	get
Pattern(s): 
the accept header on that get is now of course a separate concern from the update atomicity
one way out of your conundrum is to have a successful put return a 204 no content
that way the client s accept header is irrelevant to the issue of whether the update is performed
1463254
clang	llvm
Pattern(s): 
you can find clang in developer usr bin
you could try using clang -fsyntax-only instead especially if you re using 10.6 xcode 3.2
clang llvm has much better separation between the parser and the other parts of the compiler chain
1463254
clang	llvm
Pattern(s): 
clang llvm has much better separation between the parser and the other parts of the compiler chain
you can find clang in developer usr bin

1464720
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
when the app launches for the first time use fast enumeration to run through the folder and what ever it finds in that folder it copies into the documents folder
handling folder within folder is slightly more complex add recursion maybe
this way you don t have to worry about zip or tar nor to keep a directory of files to install
1467462
qlistwidget	qwidget	qlistwidget	qitemdelegate
Pattern(s): 
if you want to display custom dynamic content or implement a custom editor widget use qlistview and subclass qitemdelegate instead
each item in a qlistwidget can be represented by a qwidget of your choice rather than the default rendering text
you can set this by calling qlistwidget setitemwidget
1468102
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
plus it implements boundary checking boost array at
try boost array instead of plain arrays
it provides stl-compliant interface around fixed-size arrays so it can be used inside stl containers
1468102
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
it provides stl-compliant interface around fixed-size arrays so it can be used inside stl containers
plus it implements boundary checking boost array at

1468415
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
some source control solutions like svn does not require you to check anything out
others like perforce and vss lock the files locally and require a checkout
i find ide integration to be very important when a checkout paradigm is used
1469346
tex	sweave
Pattern(s): 
for me a new compilation pipeline is as simple as adding a file called sweave.engine to library texshop engines which contains the following sweave is now a selectable method of compiling a document inside texshop
i can set it to be the default for a document by adding the following tex hash-bang to the top of the file hitting cmd-t will typeset the document- the pdf automatically pops up in a separate window
texshop also incorporates synctex technology so a cmd-click in the rnw source will highlight the corresponding output in the pdf window and a cmd-click in the pdf window will highlight the corresponding input in the rnw source
1469799
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
perhaps you meant this instead the chars pointer h can be put anywhere in memory the compiler linker loader desires and it can change each time
you then get that memory address stored in x with possible loss of precision if your pointer data types have more bits than your int
however the chars h will always be the same value assuming you re using the same underlying chars set - obviously it will be different if you compile it on an ebcdic platform like system z uss
1469938
set	bag
Pattern(s): 
because core data represents a to-many relationship using a nsset a collection of distinct elements not a nscountedset a set that can contain duplicate elements also known as a bag
and because a set is an unordered collection therefore appending does not make sense as it does instead for an array or list
core data correctly does not allow repeated elements stored in the same to-many relationship therefore the framework uses a nsset which enforces distinct elements while nscountedset allows duplicate elements
1471660
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
it s astronomically unlikely that you d see two ascii-only reasonable-length passwords that have the same md5 hash but it s not impossible
md5 is a bad hash to use for passwords it s fast which means if you have a target hash it s cheap to try lots of passwords and see whether you can find one which hash to that target
salting doesn t help with that scenario but it helps to make it more expensive to try to find a password matching any one of multiple hash using different salt
1471668
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
reversing md5 is actually considered malicious - a few websites offer the ability to crack and bruteforce md5 hashes - but all they are are massive databases containing dictionary words previously submitted passwords and other words
there is a very small chance that it will have the md5 hash you need reversed
and if you ve salt the md5 hash - this won t work either
1472890
codeigniter	kohana
Pattern(s): 
if you re still researching frameworks take a look at kohana
it s basically a lightweight rewrite of codeigniter written for php5

1473742
extjs	mootools	lodash	underscore.js
Pattern(s): 
underscore.js a javascript utility library offers _.contains list value alias _.include list value both of which use indexof internally if passed a javascript array
some other frameworks offer similar methods dojo toolkit prototype array.indexof value mootools array.indexof value mochikit findvalue array value ms ajax array.indexof value extjs ext.array.contains array value lodash is _.contains prior 4.0.0 ecmascript 2016 array.includes value notice that some frameworks implement this as a function while others add the function to the array prototype

1473930
webclient	httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 
the webclient is a very dumbed down wrapper for httpwebrequest
webclient is great if you just doing very simple consumption of services or posting a bit of xml but the tradeoff is that it s not as flexible as you might want it to be
you won t be able to get the information you are looking for from webclient
1474861
webclient	webrequest
Pattern(s): 
however the built-in webclient has a major drawback you have almost no control over the webrequest that is used behind the scene cookies authentication custom headers...
a simple way to solve that issue is to create your custom webclient and override the getwebrequest method
you can then customize the request before it is sent you can do the same for the response by overriding getwebresponse
1476402
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
even though you have overloaded equals with a more specific overload enumerable.contains ends up calling because the classes properties is really backed by a
is implemented by calling and i think that this defaults to calling the equals method inherited from system.object - that is not the one your mock overrides but the one that takes a system.object as input
perusing the implementation of in reflector it seems as though it has a special case for types implementing so if you add that interface to your class it already has the appropriate method it may behave differently
1477655
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
you can use malloc free for any type of data not only null terminated strings
yes it works free does not care where the null termination is
or even if there is one
1477669
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
this technique is known as key strengthening
using a salt is absolutely required because otherwise an attacker can use existing precomputed tables to simply look up hash for all short or dictionary passwords your users have used
you can try this yourself take the md5 of a very bad short or dictionary password and do a google search for the result - most likely you ll get a hit somewhere
1477867
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
change your output directory to your web-inf classes folder
project properties java build path default output folder assigne the module dependencies
project properties java ee module dependencies they will be copied to the web-inf lib folder where eclipse looks for the tag lib definitions too
1478149
prepare	execute
Pattern(s): 
see
sorry prepare statements in mysql are session-global
according to a prepare statement is also global to the session. and there s no other way besides prepare statements to execute dynamic sql in mysql 5.x
1478660
post	get
Pattern(s): 
be sure to use the -full parameter
it has some good examples of usage including this one you might also want to check out this powershell eventing quickstart blog post
note that some of the cmdlet names have changed get remove-psevent is now just get remove-event
1479827
subclass	superclass	subclass	accessor
Pattern(s): 
in some cases the sdk will handle this behavior for you
suppose you have a subclass of uiviewcontroller called myviewcontroller
then if you access myviewcontroller.view before you call loadview then the superclass accessor is smart enough to call loadview for you and viewdidload immediately thereafter
1480214
imperative	declarative	imperative	declarative
Pattern(s): 
if you for whatever reason need to change you re page content around using the declarative approach gives you more leeway to do so without requiring a recompile
that does not mean the imperative approach is useless
there are times when it is not possible to apply handlers declarative
1480534
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
this can actually be superior because stl implementation is free to optimize based on some inner knowledge - for example in msvc std vector knows that it can use swap instead of copy constructor for std tr1 shared_ptr and does just that avoiding constant refcount changes
boost ptr_vector is the way to go if you can have boost
it should work for your scenario - if it does not then something else is wrong so please post the error message
1481852
error-handling	exception-handling	error-handling	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
but the statistic says that programmers pay less attention to exception-handling handling so you must test them thoroughly
in linux kernel 80 of bugs in drivers are in error-handling code
exceptional handling is the source of many errors and you surely should test all the exception-handling paths
1483549
int	chars	atoi	strtok
Pattern(s): 
keep in mind that the strtok only expects one space between each field on the line although that could be recoded to handle multiple spaces or even any amount of white space
i ve kept that bit simple since the code was already getting a little big - the atoi function is used to convert the individual word on each line into int
if you want error checking on those i d call your own variant which also checks that all chars in the word are numeric
1483727
spaces	linefeed
Pattern(s): 
upon experimentation it seems that form feeds carriage returns and back-spaces are not counted as spaces
demonstrating interpretation of control characters as white spaces
ascii 8 is backspace 9 is tab 10 is new line linefeed 11 is vertical tab 12 is form feed 13 is carriage return
1484071
children	parent	children	parent
Pattern(s): 
the parent closes the write end of the pipe and arranges to read from the the read end
the issue here with multiple children is that the capacity of any given pipe is finite and quite small - typically about 5 kib
consequently you need to ensure the parent reads all the pipes completely bearing in mind that the children won t be able to exit until all the data has been read strictly all but the last buffer full has been read
1484476
boost	stl	boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
it s probably easier and more well documented than figuring out how to use the version your stl implementer has hacked together
boost has a library for this
it s probably easier and more well documented than figuring out how to use the version your stl implementer has hacked together
1485463
atexit	main
Pattern(s): 
and in some other module
i don t know how ugly the following looks but i post it anyway - the basic idea is to register function pointers like what atexit function does
of course atexit implementation is different in the main module we can have something like this .
1485568
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
if you didn t mean reverse engineer but actually reverse then yes the passwords are protected by the complexity of reversing the hash function or guessing a password that matches a hash value
good hash functions makes this very hard
in general this is true but when it comes to securing passwords by storing them as hashes you should still assume that the attacker has full access to the hashes and design your system accordingly by choosing an appropriate hash function and using salt
1487038
wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 
my experience is that it is entirely too bloated to be considered less than obese let alone light
i ve heard nothing good about wordpress
joomla has a good reputation but it also has the reputation of having a higher learning curve i ve never spent real time with it
1487262
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
probably filteredcollection should not implement the collection interface because it does not obey the usual contract for collections
the collection that you inherited from has a certain contract
users of the class and that includes the class itself because it can call its own methods assume that subclassing obey the contract
1487556
pexpect	subprocess
Pattern(s): 
since the subprocess you re running most likely buffers its output differently when it s outputting to a terminal vs
anything else as that s the normal behavior of the c runtime libraries you need to trick it into believing it is outputting to a terminal rather than to your program and that s what pexpect achieves by building a pseudo-terminal via the lower-level pty module
i m actually amazed that wexpect was able to do much the same on windows yet while occasionally imperfect it does also appear to work
1489095
qtableview	qstyleditemdelegate
Pattern(s): 
if that is not enough or if it s not possible you should subclass qstyleditemdelegate and reimplement its paint method
as to grid lines qtableview has the gridstyle property

1490106
nunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
i ve never used mstest
we ve been using nunit for years and have seen no reason to change
mstest is supposed to have tight integration with team suite which since your company has already paid the outrageous fee for that is a point in its favor
1490106
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
mstest is supposed to have tight integration with team suite which since your company has already paid the outrageous fee for that is a point in its favor
nunit comes with less vendor lock-in and has a rich api
as serg10 pointed out the assert.that syntax is particularly powerful and elegant
1490547
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
however because value is private the anonymous class can not access the instance variable of its superclass
as there is no variable called value visible to the anonymous subclass of test5 the compiler looks for an alternative in the next scope
in this case the next scope belongs to the static main method
1490943
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 
you can use the base method or completely define a new method. if you call the base method this must be the first statement inside the method
the equals method compares two objects or the object passed in as a parameter with the object on which the method is called
the gethashcode returns a code that is unique for each different object
1493119
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
this means you can do one of two thngs simply mix your resources with your .java files in the same source-path create a separate source-path just for your resources call it res for example and keep your .java files and your resources separate
the classes folder is not a good place to store your resources it is supposed to be a pure output folder
if you need non-classes on your classpath you simply need to put them somewhere on the source path eclipse will copy them to the classes directory
1493536
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
you would have to tell eclipse to exclude the other directory such as developmentbuilds as they are not source code
you might find you re better off conforming to eclipse s expectations and creating a source folder which contains your main package folder

1494028
post	get
Pattern(s): 
here s an article on async pages if you re not familiar
here s another post that is useful
in a nutshell you split page processing into three stages 1 set up for long-running operations 2 kick off long-running operations to get your expensive data 3 asp.net will call your page_prerendercomplete handler once all long-running operations are complete
1494124
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 
that s o n instead of o log n which according to your lights would be significant -- but a linear search that moves found elements to the front may well outperform a more complicated balanced tree depending on the application
on the other hand note that even if log n is not likely to exceed 50 a performance factors of 10 is really huge -- if you re compute-bound a factors like that can easily make or break your application
if that s not enough for you you ll frequently see factors of log n 2 or logn 3 in algorithms so even if you think you can ignore one factors of log n that doesn t mean you can ignore more of them
1494238
post	get
Pattern(s): 
get is for data retrieval and should have no side effects beside that
and post is for sending data not retrieving them

1494239
post	get
Pattern(s): 
moreover in case of multpart form-data encoding which is required for file uploads but in this case get request is not an option anyway post will be more verbose
so are post
they re equally compact
1495421
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
from simon willison s a re-introduction to javascript
here we are setting up two variables. the assignment in the middle part of the for-loop is also tested for truthfulness - if it succeeds loops continues
since i is incremented each time items from the arrays will be assigned to item in sequential order
1496866
qtabwidget	qmouseevent	qcursor	qmouseevent
Pattern(s): 
populate a qmenu as needed and call qmenu exec at the position of the qmouseevent you re handling
easy way but possibly not precisely what you need connect to the currentchanged signal of your qtabwidget in the slot which is connected to the signal create a qmenu and populate it as needed finally in the slot which is connected to the signal call qmenu exec qcursor pos this will get a function called whenever the tab is changed not necessarily clicked and spawn a menu at the current mouse position
complicated way which exactly does what you describe call qobject installeventfilter on your qtabwidget so that all the events on your qtabwidget are redirected to your own object
1497801
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
when you add 1 to a pointer it moves you along by the sizeof the type pointed to in this case the sizeof a chars which is evidently 4 bytes in your system
then you re dereferencing it and treating the result as an int d which gives you the a765 i mentioned in my comment to unwind
when you dereference it and treat it as a chars you correctly get 5
1501771
post	get	hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
it s quite fun to do and you ll get to learn about all the attacks and other interesting things
well as your post is general let me state a few general things md5 sha-0 sha-1 are all broken hash and you should not use them for any cryptographic purpose use sha-2
you should generally use well-known and documented approaches to derriving keys from passwords you don t mention what language please say which one you are using
1501908
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
when you included the html and content into the xcode project file you probably dragged the file s over to the project side-bar and were asked whether to recursively create groups for any added folders or to create folder references for any added folders. the default is the first one which means xcode creates a yellow folder in your project but it ll ignore the directory hierarchy on disk when time comes to generate the output bundle
if you choose the second option then the folder is blue and if you look in your output bundle you ll see that the whole folder hierarchy has been replicated
the first works for simple web pages where everything is at the same folder level and you can use the method you list above to load it
1502206
robocopy	xcopy
Pattern(s): 
if you have two drives you can just use xcopy or use xxcopy for one drive xxcopy
robocopy is a great tool.
when you have a job it can handle
1502646
fflush	gets	fflush	gets
Pattern(s): 
the line that gets reads will be a very short one consisting of just that newline
don t use fflush stdin since that is not guaranteed by the standard to work
instead you can just read characters in a loop until you ve skipped the newline there are also some other problems with your code among them that you really shouldn t use gets at all since it doesn t check that the line you read actually fits in the variable
1504388
free	malloc	free	calloc
Pattern(s): 
also make sure not to mix c- style memory management malloc calloc free with c++ style memory management new delete
in legacy code often both are mixed but things allocated with the one can not be free with the other
all of these errors will usually not be recognized by a compiler
1505225
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
the representations of the numbers 2 and 3 the values of x and y as double are 0x4000000000000000 and 0x4008000000000000 respectively as calculated by the ieee-754 floating-point conversion calculator
on little-endian machines anything x86-based the d modifier grabs the next 4 bytes off the stack and interprets them as an int
so when you pass the float 2 it gets converted to a double as 0x4000000000000000 which in little-endian is 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40
1506079
toolchain	binutils	toolchain	newlib
Pattern(s): 
this is a free interpretation based on these two guides but i had to change versions and apply some patches to get it to work
first some basic stuff sudo apt-get install flex bison libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev autoconf texinfo build-essential then i created a place to store the toolchain change cj.users to whatever is good for you
binutils apply patch to tc-arm.c according this info action view gcc newlib wget ftp sources.redhat.com pub newlib newlib-1.17.0.tar.gz wget tar -xvzf newlib-1.17.0.tar.gz cd newlib-1.17.0 then i would like to apply the patch with something like this but it did not work patch -p1 -i .. newlib-1.14.0-missing-makeinfo.patch so i opened it manually and edited line 6651 according to the patch

x86	64bit	x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
this of course assumes you are running on a 64bit machine
it has been a while since i tried this but i believe that the bitness of the process that calls the assembly determines whether it will be jited as x86 or x64
so if you write a small console application and build it as x86 and another as x64 running one or the other will cause other assemblies loaded into the process to run as 32 or 64bit
1508042
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 
providing easy access to links to raise text size and or access to some high contrast stylesheet options is also a good idea
non-mouse users there are a huge number of conditions that can prevent one from being able to successfully mouse it took a few years for me and my brain which is somewhat unreliable when it comes to spatial relationships to pick up the skill
for these people keyboard access is really helpful i don t work in the web space so i m not sure if there are standard keys to use but these are communicated by screenreaders and tooltips so having any is better than none
1509806
abstract-class	superclass
Pattern(s): 
an abstract-class may contain some implementation that is useful to all subclasses but not be complete it needs to be completed in some way in the subclasses
where the interface lets you use polymorphism on several classes abstract-class also lets them reuse code
another difference is that a class can only have one superclass but implements many interfaces
1510424
abstract-class	superclass
Pattern(s): 
and
surprisingly many examples explanations given here do not provide good arguments for using an abstract-class
merely putting common fields methods in a superclass does not require it to be abstract
1510807
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
so a pom.xml configured like this should do the trick
i m not sure but i think that the maven archiver which is mainly used by plugins to handle packaging can be configured to achieve this
about the element the maven archiver reference says whether the generated archive will contain these two maven files the pom.xml file located in the archive in a pom.properties file located in the archive in the default value is true
1512914
strlen	strtok
Pattern(s): 
edit ok if strlen is the only function allowed you can first find the length of your source string then loop through it and replace all non-letter characters with null - basically that s what strtok does
then you need to go through your modified source string second time advancing one token at a time and find the longest one using strlen

1512923
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
an abstract class is only to be subclassing inherited from
in other words it only allows other classes to inherited from it but cannot be instantiated
the advantage is that it enforces certain hierarchies for all the subclassing
1512923
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
as one of the similarities to abstract class it is a contract that is used to define hierarchies for all subclassing or it defines specific set of methods and their arguments
the main difference between them is that a class can implement more than one interface but can only inherited from one abstract class
since c# doesn t support multiple inheritance interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritance
1513025
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
a versioning policy is also recommeded but it needs team-wide adoption to work
a little esoteric but we ve been hit by this - if your assembly is strong named and contains configuration data you can break code by changing the versioning number
unless you upgrade app|web.config when you upgrade assemblies if a full binding path is used say to reference a type the new assembly will fail to load
1513398
django	turbogears
Pattern(s): 
bfg and bobo go the other way around and are minimalistic frameworks but with easy access to the zope toolkit and all the functionalities of zope
and although django is making many of the same mistakes zope2 did they are also fixing them much faster so i completely expect much of this discussion to be moot in five years because i expect every single python web framework to use wsgi+webob+repoze+deliverance+buildout as a base by then
but even then i d go for frameworks where i can use the zope component architecture and zodb but that includes not only the ones made by the zope community but also for example turbogears
1513444
int	double	nsinteger	double
Pattern(s): 
#endif from the docs therefore you can write it as you are receiving an error because you are declaring bvalue as a pointer to an nsinteger yet trying to initialize it with a double value
an nsinteger is not an object type it is simply a typedef for an int or long dependent on whether your application is 32 or 64-bit #if __lp64__ || target_os_embedded || target_os_iphone || target_os_win32 || ns_build_32_like_64 typedef long nsinteger
#else typedef int nsinteger
1515142
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
the spring database classes are a good example
while i don t have any numbers i don t believe that try-catch has any significant impact on performance not that i have seen
i think that if you don t run into many exception-handling the performance impact will be basically nothing
1516729
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
also as i ve been adminished in prior posts md5 is not secure
aes or bcrypt are more secure ways to hash today

1516835
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 
it s a low-footprint window manager designed to meet those criteria and it s what many folks in that minimalist embedded space are using
my employer uses it on cell phones configured so that only one app at a time is visible to the user and the foreground app takes up the whole screens with no window borders
but you can use it other ways too - nokia uses it for their maemo-based network tablet
1517670
haskell	ocaml	ocaml	rust
Pattern(s): 
for some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is java c c++
other languages offer some form of type inference the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable ocaml haskell scala kotlin the main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage
examples c c++ java rust go scala dynamically typed languages a language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values and not named variables fields etc
1518110
arraylist	linkedhashmap
Pattern(s): 
there s also a combined data structure the linkedhashmap which offers fast access to arbitrary elements as well as predictable ordering
however it s worth noting that arraylist and hashmap are only two implementations of the list and map interfaces respectively
there are other implementations of each that might be more suitable for more specific requirements
1519618
jobs	cron
Pattern(s): 
so yes it could be done
and no i do not think it should be done if not for a giant project needing very custom handling of daily jobs
in general cron is secure fast mantained known to system administrators well accepted already running and available at cheap hosting companies that give no command line or system access
1519660
plone	buildout
Pattern(s): 
for every server involved you get more single-point of failures
but if it s private packages that should not even be listed on pypi or packages only useful as a part of a large system like plone it s another matter
then you want easy___install and buildout etc s to look for eggs on your server
1519720
translation	globalization
Pattern(s): 
using the built-in globalization methods is a lot of work because you have to manually create each globalized form and then manually replace all the text with the translations and this task pretty much requires the programmer to be fluent
the method i mention is done programatically and doesn t require the programmer to be fluent in the translation languages

1519976
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
as an example your classes might be set up as follows as long as figure.draw is virtual meaning its implementation can or must be overriden by a subclassing you can execute triangle s draw behavior even if the object is being used as a figure
in your case lsp would mean that all behavior inherited from figure should be appropriate for a square or triangle
so you wouldn t want to have setters for figure.side1 side2 and side3 because those wouldn t make sense for a square
1521292
post	get
Pattern(s): 
make sure you re capturing the login token usually a cookie and sending it back
post vs
get this is obvious but make sure you re using the same http method that a real browser does
1522862
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
you should also be able to store a uuid in any 16 byte char field though i haven t tried this specifically on mysql or others
the best way is to use randomly generated uuids uuid datatypes are available natively in some databases such as postgresql sqlalchemy has a native postgresql uuid datatype for this purpose - in 0.5 its called sqlalchemy.databases.postgres.pguuid
you should also be able to store a uuid in any 16 byte char field though i haven t tried this specifically on mysql or others
1523290
memcmp	strcmp	memcmp	strcmp
Pattern(s): 
strcmp is for null terminated strings
you might want to try memcmp instead
strcmp is for null terminated strings
1523383
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
if you re trying to drive edits through the ui you shouldn t need to mess with that
your experience with tttableviewcontroller is also going to be a little different than you might expect because it does not inherited from uitableviewcontroller
unlike most iphone tutorials that have the table s view controller also implement the uitableviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource protocols three20 implements them through separate classes you are expected to set the controller s datasource properties with a model instance and the controller creates its own delegate in the createdelegate method which you can override
1523894
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 
the original poster s code should work as-is this will remove v and any views it has attached to it as subviews leaving behind containerview and any siblings of v
try this another thing i just noticed from the uiview class document - see the last sentence removefromsuperview unlinks the receiver from its superview and its window and removes it from the responder chain
void removefromsuperview discussion if the receiver s superview is not nil this method releases the receiver
1524790
128bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 
as i understand it this should have been 128 bit on 64bit platforms but for compatibility portability reasons in gcc has standardised on a 64bit width
see also u int128_t and this discussion on gcc s 128bit integer support

1526003
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
except in ie due to a bug.
a radio button has no innertext it is an empty element
if you have a parent which contains the text you want then you could use if you have a label element associated with the radio then you could do note use checked to see which checkbox radio is currently selected
1528145
gif	png
Pattern(s): 
chrome frame is a plugin for ie that renders the page using the chromium engine from google
gif does not support alpha transparency
png works in all modern browsers whereas alpha transparency is not supported in ie6 natively
1529562
httpcontext	httpmodule
Pattern(s): 
that is just the right place to put it and instantiating the object in an httpmodule is also appropriate
the cast really shouldn t be much of a problem but if you want to get away from that i d highly recommend an extension method for httpcontext for this.
this is exactly the kind of situation that extension methods are designed to handle
1530814
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
php and its session mecanism is executed on the server-side
so to do anything related to a php session you have to go to the server doing a full http request -- you cannot stay on the client-side
doing an ajax request is a way of going to the server -- works fine
1531652
bids	ssis
Pattern(s): 
if the account that is running the package doesn t have sufficient rights on the target folder or object then this kind of error could be raised by ssis
you wouldn t see this error in bids if your personal account has sufficient rights to access the file location
do you receive this error when logged into the server that runs the code using the credentials of the sql server agent
1531834
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
for example the following pom.xml sets the property and then uses the property to save the maven version to the project jar s manifest
the build-helper-maven-plugin can do this
check out the build-helper maven-version goal it sets a property containing the current version of maven maven.version by default
1533806
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
for all passwords still using md5 -- in the login process where you verify a user s entered password temporarily store the user s submitted password in memory no security issue here as it is already in memory somewhere and do the usual md5 hash compare with the stored hash
-- if the correct password was given matches the existing hash run the temporarily stored password through the new algorithm store that value update the new field to identify that this password has been updated to the new algorithm
of course you would just use the new algorithm for any new users new passwords.
1533905
strdup	malloc	strdup	calloc
Pattern(s): 
so as others also explained you have to know the length of the string you want to allocate and then add 1 to store the terminal 0 c implicitly use to put at the end of strings
but to do what you want copy a string and allocate necessary space it will be more simple and more efficient to use strdup that does exactly that a malloc and a strcopy
you should also not forget to free space you allocated yourself using malloc calloc strdup or any other allocation function
1534229
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
Pattern(s): 
btw if you know the size of your input a more efficient method would be to use a charbuffer and fill it by using reader.read you ll have to pay attention to the return method and use it in a loop
i don t know clojure so i can t tell if you have some detail wrong in your code but using stringbuffer and appending the input line by line is the correct way to do it well using a stringbuilder initialized to the expected final size if known would bring significant but not dramatic improvements
if you run out of memory then maybe the content of your bufferedreader is simply too large to fit into your memory and there is no way to have it as a single string - in that case you ll either have to increase your heap size or find a way to process the data one small chunk at a time
1535381
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
it has been around for longer
charlie poole is active on nunit open source and has a good history of good updates
vs2008 has mstest integrated inside it
1535638
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
this section tells us that we create a message digest of the message to be signed s mime says that implementations have to understand at least md5 and sha1 message digests so you would use sha1 as the interoperable option with best security and encrypt it with the signer s private key
as long as the signing device is happy to take a sha1 hash from you and encrypt it with the signer s private key then you can do all the rest of the signature generation yourself
you d then take the multipart signed mime object and encrypt it as per the s mime specs and then sign the whole ball of wax again sign-encrypt-sign mode so that ultimately you have multipart signed object where the first part is an application pkcs7-mime object which when decrypted by following pkcs #7 contains another multiplart signed object where the first part is a mime object representing the original email or just the body
1536441
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
the reason is that during deserialization the constructor isn t invoked and therefore isn t run so b stays null
if you manage to serializable an instance of a which has then you get a npe
the reason is that during deserialization the constructor isn t invoked and therefore isn t run so b stays null
1536718
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
in fact i don t see why would you want to get a value of a properties which has not been set previously
for obvious reasons you cannot set the value if there s neither set accessor nor backing field

1537389
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
Pattern(s): 
google-chrome and safari identical behavior uses arrow over the button but your defined cursor over the rest
opera works perfectly
note that there are several workarounds using different techniques that will come around this problem
1537619
nexus	artifactory
Pattern(s): 
artifactory has ldap support while nexus has it only in paid version
on the other hand free ldap plugin for nexus is available on google code
the most complete comparison
1539576
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
deep down a request that you handle in asp.net was started with a socket
if your hardware device is sending udp it should be it s a lot easier to handle both in your client program and on the device itself receiving that data is trivial
tcp is not much harder
1539600
instances	transient
Pattern(s): 
the problem arose because of the lifetime settings of controller classes because the default lifetime policy in castle is singleton a weird default if you ask me
it seems that because the controller instances is only created once in the application s lifetime the parameters get stuck on their first values
setting the lifetime to transient solved the problem in my case
1542541
webclient	httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 
of course you can roll-your-own communication using httpwebrequest webclient or even sockets
using webclient is probably best if you want to go with rest on the server
keep in mind that some things that are normally possible in rest such as using put and delete http verbs are not possible in browser plugins such as flash and silverlight due to browser restrictions
1543704
post	get
Pattern(s): 
of course remember to only merge if possible and only if it makes sense to do such a thing
post has always been troublesome for me also.
personally when i i try to do a post things get complicated
1545598
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
one database with multiple tables is the way to do
if you want a database server i ve recommend postgresql
mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with
1546740
terminate	timeout
Pattern(s): 
if you need them to be more or less precise you ll have to keep your main thread the one that received client request free from work and have it signal submitted job parts by flipping a flag when timeout is reached and return immediately
you ll have to check said flag periodically and terminate your execution once it s flipped
pool will then reclaim the thread
1546911
post	get
Pattern(s): 
get puts the entire request in the query string
that means if that s a request the user wants to do again some time say it s a search page or a link to a specific blog post it can be bookmarked
the downside is that the query string can only be so long and it can lead to users bookmarking parts of a url they shouldn t
1547615
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
they might be derived from a dictionary or lists of common phrases or passwords 123456 for example
a rainbow table is different to a dictionary though - it is a reverse lookup for a given hash function so that if you know a hash you can identify a string which would generate that hash
for example if i knew your password had an unsalted md5 hash of e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e i could use a rainbow table to determine that 123456 hashes to that value
1548174
arp	udp
Pattern(s): 
what was happening in my case and i assume your case is that your java code is sending out udp packets from an ip address that is in the same subnet as your destination addresses
when this is the case the linux machine will perform an arp lookup to translate the ip address into the hardware mac address
since you are blasting out packets to many different ips the local arp table fills up quickly hits 1024 and that is when the java exception is thrown
1548174
subnet	packets
Pattern(s): 
since you are blasting out packets to many different ips the local arp table fills up quickly hits 1024 and that is when the java exception is thrown
the solution is simple either increase the limit by editing the files i mentioned earlier or move your server into a different subnet than your destination addresses which then causes the linux box to no longer perform neighbor arp lookups instead will be handled by a router on the network

1549854
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
answers isinstance caters for inherited an instance of a derived class is an instance of a base class too while checking for equality of type does not it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes aka subclassing
normally in python you want your code to support inherited of course since inherited is so handy it would be bad to stop code using yours from using it
so isinstance is less bad than checking identity of type s because it seamlessly supports inherited
1550637
id3v2	id3-tag
Pattern(s): 
id3v1 is always at the end of the file so is useless when streaming
id3v2 is located at the start so may be more accessible
i ve never read the id3-tag but i suspect that if you cache the first few hundred kilobytes of the file somewhere as it loads open that cache with audiofileopenwithcallbacks and then read the kaudiofilepropertyid3tag with audiofilegetproperty you may be able to read the id3 data if it exists
1551187
internationalization	localization
Pattern(s): 
in a serious application you would not have your format string hard-coded -- or if you had it would be in some form such as where the _ comes from gettext or similar i18n l10n frameworks
the point is that such an application or reusable modules that can happen to be used in such applications must support internationalization aka i18n and locatization aka l10n you want your application to be able to emit hello paul in certain countries and cultures hola paul in some others ciao paul in others yet and so forth
so the format string gets more or less automatically substituted with another at runtime depending on the current localization settings
1551247
clang	llvm
Pattern(s): 
you might also encounter incompatibilities or bugs
clang is a very young project
llvm-gcc gcc s front-end with llvm s back-end
1551330
equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 
this applies in general not only for strings
when comparing for equality you should use equals because it expresses your intent in a clear way
compareto has the additional drawback that it only works on objects that implement the comparable interface
1552786
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
except in init methods and the dealloc method it s good practice to always use your accessor
the main benefit especially on the mac with cocoa bindings is that using your accessor means free kvo notifications
the reason why people declare properties for every single instance variable is most probably that all of their instance variables are things they want to expose as properties
1554330
srp	principles	srp	ocp
Pattern(s): 
steven bohlen has made a short series of web casts about them at dimecasts.net
this is not .net specific but the most important i think is the solid principle. robert martin aka unclebob has a nice reference here . i will quote the most important section srp the single responsibility principles a class should have one and only one reason to change
ocp the open closed principles you should be able to extend a classes behavior without modifying it
1554489
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt
Pattern(s): 
parsing results parsing resutls
if speed is a requirement have a look at lxml
lxml is a pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt c libraries
1554741
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
this could indicate component rules violations in a minor upgrade specifically the addition of a component in a newer versioning looking like the removal in your older versioning - see heaths s commentary though it appears the should force a major upgrade
you might also try working in a sample project starting from a base versioning that has a single feature single component and single file with shortcut
if relevant add another component and file to the upgrade versioning
1555534
jar	manifest.mf	jar	war	war	manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 
following files are not included in the signature meta-inf manifest.mf meta-inf sig- meta-inf .sf meta-inf .dsa meta-inf .rsa it doesn t know anything about war
if you sign the war it will be treated as jar so all the rules will apply
it s perfectly legal to have a meta-inf in the root of war
1557484
rsa	aes
Pattern(s): 
there must be a secure way to distribute trust anchors out-of-band
also note that rsa is incredibly slow compared to symmetric ciphers
real protocols generate a content encryption key for a symmetric algorithm like aes then use an rsa public key as a key encryption key to encrypt the content encryption key for the message recipient s
1557708
gh-unit	ocunit
Pattern(s): 
xcodeunittestgui which is fairly immature but works and provides a gui for ocunit based tests disclaimer -- this is my project
gh-unit is a great framework and is actively maintained
it has a gui
1560687
quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place
Pattern(s): 
both however are in-place sorting algorithms which means they don t use any extra memory when sorting
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n
quicksort uses a pivot element for its sorting and mergesort divides conquers
1561245
pbkdf2	hash
Pattern(s): 
so my recommendation of bcrypt stems from the assumptions 1 that a blowfish has had a similar level of scrutiny as the sha-2 family of hash functions and 2 that cryptanalytic methods for ciphers are better developed than those for hash functions
it should suffice to say whether bcrypt or sha-512 in the context of an appropriate algorithm like pbkdf2 is good enough
and the answer is yes either algorithm is secure enough that a breach will occur through an implementation flaw not cryptanalysis
1561397
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if you do that is_writable will correctly tell you whether the directory is writable or not
if contains your file path do this then use to determine if the folder is writable
i hope this helps someone
1561947
ant	cruisecontrol
Pattern(s): 
the greatest advantage i see in hudson is that pretty much anybody can use it while launching a parametrized build with cruisecontrol or a batch file is still scary for a lot of people
usually i tend to write all my build scripts with ant because it s portable insert a couple of parameters and i invoke them from hudson
hudson gives your scripts a great visibility everything can be seen on the front page and they are self explanatory
1562002
tostring	string.format
Pattern(s): 
with an istringable you would only need to add that to your generic type-constraint or derive your interface from it to require it s usage on implementing objects
if the benefit you find in overloading tostring is for the debugger you should start using system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute
as for needing this implementation for converting objects to strings via string.format and or console.writeline they could have deferred to the system.convert.tostring object and checked for something like istringable failing over to the type s name if not implemented
1562078
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
if your data has a salt value incorporated prior to hashing the rainbow table approach probably won t be practical anyway
md5 is a one-way hash
it cannot be decrypted
1562930
integer	unsigned	integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
finally try to avoid use of unsigned integers as they are not cls compliant
if you need positive only integer that has the upper limit of the uint32 it is better to use an int64 instead
unsigned integers are usually only used for api calls and the like
1563345
dateadd	datepart	dateadd	datepart
Pattern(s): 
a simple +7 should fix it dateadd dd - datepart dw convert varchar createdate 101 + 7 convert varchar createdate 101
your dateadd function is actually finding the saturday of the previous week for 10 13 2009 it s returning 10 10 2009 for 10 7 2009 and 10 8 2009 it s returning 10 3 2009 etc
a simple +7 should fix it dateadd dd - datepart dw convert varchar createdate 101 + 7 convert varchar createdate 101
1564486
bonjour	jmdns
Pattern(s): 
jmdns - jmdns provides easy-to-use pure-java mdns implementation that runs on jdk 1.4 and higher jivedns - jivedns is a fork of the defunct jmdns library used for multicast dns service discovery and registration. it itself has not seen an svn update in over 2 years
i m also curious to find the best cross-platform dns-sd zeroconf bonjour dns self discovery library exists out there
it does sound like apple s dns-sd dnssd.jar is the official java library that requires native library support on windows linux etc but works out of the box on mac osx
1565640
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
this is why statements 2 and 3 fail
in other words private limits methods variables to the context of a class or subclass in which they are defined
inherited passes private methods to the subclasses and can therefore be accessed with an implicit self
1565640
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
which behaves similarly to java accessors that are not given a visibility eg public private protected by changing the private in spy to protected all 6 of your statements work. protected methods can be called by any instance of the defining class or their subclassing
either explicitly or implicitly called on self are valid statements for protected methods so long as the caller is either the class of the object responding to the call or inherited from it
as for statement 4
1569957
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
as for escaping int values - i generally cast the incoming value as an int and that typically removes the problem of rogue chars and invalid inputs if the string is not-numeric your safe value will be 0
edit i should mention that simply relying on the fact that the database field is an int is not secure in anyway and without escaping or casting the inputs before you create the query you are opening yourself to sql injection

1570615
openssl	libcrypto
Pattern(s): 
if you do that will add a -lcrypto to the linker command and the linker will resolve that by looking for a dynamic library first which it will find in usr lib - exactly what you don t want instead put the full path to the library in other linker flags step 4 build
openssl has a very permissive license so just link it into your app as a static library
you should then still be able to use the sscrypto framework or you can just call the openssl libcrypto routines directly

subclass	abstract-class
Pattern(s): 
class calendar is an abstract-class for converting between a date object and a set of integer fields such as year month day and hour
class gregoriancalendar is the only subclass of calendar in the jdk. it does the date-to-fields conversions for the calendar system in common use
sun licensed this overengineered junk from taligent - a sobering example of how average programmers screw up
1571786
memcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 
since you are able to debug the source try setting a breakpoint before the memcpy occurs and verify that the arguments to memcpy all match up or
there are two very likely explanations you are using memcpy across overlapping addresses -- the behavior of this situation is undefined
if you require the ability to handle overlapping addresses std memmove is the equivalent tool
1571786
memcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 
if you require the ability to handle overlapping addresses std memmove is the equivalent tool
you are using memcpy to copy to from memory that is inaccessible to your program
from the code you ve shown it looks like 2 is the more likely scenario
1572688
onmouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
Pattern(s): 
to edit it see the js and html just tag edit on the end of the url
updated so it looks like if your mouse is no longer over the element on which onmouseup is bound it won t see the mouseup event
makes sense when you stop and think about it but when the mousedown event happens over the element we expect as ui users for it to know when it was released even if it isn t over the element
1574145
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
Pattern(s): 
a bonus is that every mac has a svn server built-in so it makes it an even more attractive option
xcode supports subversion cvs and perforce
i haven t used perforce but i can say that the cvs support is awful
1575395
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
of course if your simulation is i o bound then you will see sluggish i o regardless of core usage.
on my dual-core machine the total number of processes is honoured if i do then i only see one cpu in use at any given time
the process is free to migrate to a different processors but then the other processors is idle
1576650
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 
i ll be interested to see what someone who knows better says
i suspect this is an issue with the way typedef interacts with the encode method
i believe that typedef remains a pure c keyword and really only happens to work with objective-c types usually because they happen to be implemented as struct
1576650
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 
i believe that typedef remains a pure c keyword and really only happens to work with objective-c types usually because they happen to be implemented as struct
as a result when you typedef nsnumber to nsnumberbool it works fine for method calls and dot syntax properties but assuming my theory is correct breaks encode which can t tell that nsnumberbool and nsnumber are the same type
i ll be interested to see what someone who knows better says
1577142
matlab	simulink
Pattern(s): 
but then such a file is propably called by matlab simulink in the first place
calling c from matlab is what you want to do if you write your own s-functions or extensions to matlab
the choice between c and c++ is yours
1577309
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
also how much wood would a woodchuck chuck.
public inheritance means that everyone knows that derived is derived from base
protected inheritance means that only derived friends of derived and classes derived from derived know that derived is derived from base
1578836
tabs	tabpanel
Pattern(s): 
tabcontainer properties activetabchanged event - fired on the server side when a tab is changed after a postback onclientactivetabchanged - the name of a javascript function to attach to the client-side tabchanged event cssclass - a css class override used to define a custom look and feel for the tabs
see the tabs theming section for more details
activetabindex - the first tab to show height - sets the height of the body of the tabs does not include the tabpanel headers width - sets the width of the body of the tabs scrollbars - whether to display scrollbars none horizontal vertical both auto in the body of the tabcontainer tabstripplacement - whether to render the tabs on top of the container or below top bottom
1579042
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
if this is what you want then your design must assign responsibility by decomposing things into the part the superclass is responsible for and the part the subclass is responsible for
the golden rule is to encapsulate property_b so that the subclass provides part of the implementation but not all of it
it s hard to say precisely what s supposed to happen when you have two classes and you re asking about allocation of responsibility
1579266
internationalization	translation
Pattern(s): 
the views will need to all be translation still by you
there is a code igniter guide for this here ci wiki internationalizing the language class internationalization and the template parser class unfortunately no web framework will solve this for you it can only make it easier
content will be replicated in the languages etc
1580160
put	get	put	get
Pattern(s): 
if you wanted to use post and _files i think the closest you could get would be to point upload_tmp_dir at a ramdisk
the put option is cool
if you wanted to use post and _files i think the closest you could get would be to point upload_tmp_dir at a ramdisk
1581805
cgbitmapcontextcreate	cgimageref
Pattern(s): 
then you can create a cgimageref from the bitmap context and save it
unfortunately cgbitmapcontextcreate is a little picky about the format of the data
it does not support 24-bit rgb data
1581842
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
you re using polymorphism the way it is supposed to be used
my interpretation of prefer composition over inherited is roughly that if you don t need polymorphic behavior then you should use composition instead of inherited
with the itriggerable approach you re not solving the problem of having to write a subclassing for every new event
1582763
pthreads	fork
Pattern(s): 
example in my other answer
linux osx actually pthreads programming any language that have pthreads calls general scheme setup a socket.
fork close 0 close 1 not necessary dup2 will close it too.
1583888
strcpy	malloc
Pattern(s): 
you could make your code much shorter and readable by having it be something like this the +1 in the malloc line is so that the end-of-line character gets a space
strcpy copies an entire string not simply a character
also strlen returns the length of a string
1585779
median	minimum
Pattern(s): 
plugging that into the formula there on the page you get in this case the actual minimum number of required comparisons is also six
if you re in doubt that the task of finding the median is as hard as finding k lowest values you may refer to knuth s taocp volume 3 excercise #2 after 5.3.3 chapter

1586275
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
but all is not lost
this fake non-existing file name or folder name contains a hidden file that looks something like s-1-5-21-2703390745-3900912742-210389625-1000 yours will be different
it s one of two reliable ways to find out whether a certain filename is actually a virtual directory of the recycle bin the other way being delete a file through shfileoperation explained here and check whether it appears in the folder you have note i don t know what the hidden folders are on other win32 versions you l have to experiment a bit
1586318
mktime	strtotime	mktime	strtotime
Pattern(s): 
you probably want strtotime
mktime does not work that way
you probably want strtotime
1586488
spaces	linefeed
Pattern(s): 
i also hope that the names of your fields are fake as both name and value are access reserved words and should be avoided in object names at any level in access jet ace
if your fields alow zero-length strings and can have white spaces in them here s one solution i m assuming you re writing your sql to execute in access itself as trim and len are access vba functions both are provided by the access expression service using vba so this wouldn t work via odbc or oledb
now that ignores other kinds of issues in those fields such as tabs or cr linefeed characters
1587191
goto	break
Pattern(s): 
sometimes though i do this the idea is that i get a guaranteed free of bar plus i get a clean two-level break out of the switch via return
goto
this is one of the very few places where goto is the appropriate tool and is usually the argument presented why goto isn t complete evil
1587230
profiler	vtune
Pattern(s): 
for pc vtune is a great profiler
i think vs2008 has a built in profiler but i haven t looked into it
otherwise measure functions and large pieces of code with performance counters
1588505
maven	m2e
Pattern(s): 
the m2e plugin is not really needed for neither clover-maven nor clover-eclipse but it s nice when working with eclipse and maven
i m using the clover-report along with the automated site generation by maven
for that you just have to add the clover plugin to your poms reporting section as describes here
1589395
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 
and from the default property checks whether type t implements the system.iequatable t generic interface and if so returns an equalitycomparer t that uses that implementation
otherwise it returns an equalitycomparer t that uses the overrides of equals and object.gethashcode provided by t
i don t believe it will use gethashcode at all though
1589727
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
we also have many of these and want to deploy them all together hassle free
for this we have created a 2-layer maven setup individual maven projects that either download or contain as system scope depends the 3rd party lib in question and osgify these using the apache felix bundle plugin one container project that has a dependency on all of these small projects and makes an assembly of them using the core assembly maven plugin
this pom.xml also uses the copy-dependencies goal of maven to make sure everything is in place
1590074
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
using that feature you could calculate the md5 in few lines need to import java.math.biginteger java.security.messagedigest and java.security.nosuchalgorithmexception
to calculate sha1 hash is almost the same check this blog post about the creation of variables that can be evaluated at report run time

1590087
ant	maven	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
maven does address some things that aren t addressed implicitly by ant but with some up front planning ant is the much more flexible better documented and the less buggy tool
if you decide to go the ant route make sure to define a structure for your projects figure out your dependency system use one
i think you will ultimately be much happier than with maven as you won t spend crunch time trying to fix your build system.
1590927
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
edit you can override the distributionmanagement in your pom.xml but it would be better to modify it in the parent pom.xml and release this new version in your enterprise repository if this is a definitive change
about repositories inside a profile declared in the settings.xml the documentation says repositories are remote collections of projects from which maven uses to populate the local repository of the build system
it is from this local repository that maven calls it plugins and dependencies
1593428
ready	each
Pattern(s): 
since you say you don t want to change properties the whole time i d also strongly suggest using property sheets vsprops
this way you create an empty project add the property sheets you want and you r ready to go
no more fiddling with properties and each project uses the same set
1594619
zero	decimal-point
Pattern(s): 
followed by an optional digit string
if the digit string is omitted the precision is taken as zero
this gives the minimum number of digits to appear for d i o u x and x conversions the number of digits to appear after the decimal-point for a a e e f and f conversions the maximum number of significant digits for g and g conversions or the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string for s conversions
1595536
mef	prism
Pattern(s): 
prism fills a broader scope in some respects but is also really limited to gui applications
mef is just doing one thing dep
injection but geared to be more general purpose for any type of application
1595743
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
this can be achieved using inherited along with the template method pattern calling abstract or virtual methods in a base class which are overridden in subclassing to achieve the desired new behavior but it s more often demonstrated using composition using the strategy pattern encapsulating the variant behavior in class and passing it to the closed type to be used in determining the overall behavior achieved
from your example it appears you were thinking more along the lines of trying to achieving ocp through inherited but starting with a base report formatter to establish the interface with subtypes to indicate different types of formats for a given report is actually a good start toward showing ocp through composition
what s needed to demonstrate ocp with a composition-based approach is a class which consumes the formatters .
1596379
scons	automake
Pattern(s): 
it takes compiler-independent description of build tasks as input and generates native makefile autoconf s makefile.in visual c++ project bcc makefile etc.
scons is an open source software construction tool that is a next-generation build tool
think of scons as an improved cross-platform substitute for the classic make utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf automake and compiler caches such as ccache
1596379
scons	automake
Pattern(s): 
think of scons as an improved cross-platform substitute for the classic make utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf automake and compiler caches such as ccache
in short scons is an easier more reliable and faster way to build software
make project make project is a bash script that makes project skeletons
1597420
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
any application code that uses stdout or stderr will therefore appear in the usual log4j log files
i suspect the loggingjobhistory plugin is writing stuff to stdout which is poor practice but not terribly surpring the quartz codebase isn t exactly top notch

1597428
boost	allocator
Pattern(s): 
in that case nobody ever needs to delete the object since the object will be automatically deleted when the last reference to it goes away
check out boost s shared_ptr class for details on this
i highly recommend reference counting as a way of managing memory allocator in c++ since it automates away 99 of the potential errors programmers make when managing memory
1597598
post	get
Pattern(s): 
usually only the get method is used while creating ajax apps
but there are several occasions when post is necessary when creating a ajax request
this could be for several reasons
1598077
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
for example here is a syntactical-sugar version either version has the drawback that the constructor function cannot be inherited as it is in many languages
so even if your subclass adds nothing to the construction process it must remember to call the base constructor with whatever arguments the base wanted
this can be slightly automated using apply but still you have to write out so a common extension is to break out the initialisation stuff into its own function rather than the constructor itself
1598077
subclass	inherited	subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
if you are dealing with large numbers of subclassed instances prototypical inherited may serve you better
also calling a method of the base class is slightly annoying as you can see we have to remember what the method was before the subclass constructor overwrote it or it gets lost
also because there is no inherited here the instanceof operator won t work
1599236
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
however that practice is currently discouraged because significant additional code is required to reliably catch a stack overflow exception-handling and continue program execution
starting with the .net framework version 2.0 a stackoverflowexception object cannot be caught by a try-catch block and the corresponding process is terminated by default
consequently users are advised to write their code to detect and prevent a stack overflow
1600496
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
in the end it all boils down to readability and that s a somewhat subjective matter even though most people probably agree on most examples readability factor
as you have noticed a for-loop is just a more compact way of saying while its syntax is flexible enough to allow you to do other things with it i try to restrict my usage of for to examples that aren t much more complicated than the above
otoh i wouldn t use a while loops for the above
1601339
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 
some more low-budget php deployment optimizations using a more efficient web server like nginx to handle static file serving and then reverse proxy app requests to a separate apache instance implement php with fastcgi on top of nginx using something like php-fpm getting rid of apache entirely
this may be a great alternative if your apache needs don t extend far beyond mod_rewrite and simpler apache modules
if you prefer a more high-level do-it-yourself approach you may want to check out scalr code at google code
1601661
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
essentially the code is checking that the conversion to double is reversible and therefore that the double can store the exact value of the int
simple solution could be something like if x is an int and so on for long etc
double x will convert x from an int to a double
1601661
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
double x will convert x from an int to a double
the int then converts it back again
so int double x converts form an int to a double and then back
1601783
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
if your integer consume less than 52 bits then it should be convertible without problem to ieee 754 double
i assume i know for sure in case of java but not c# and lazy to check that int is 32 bits and long is 64 bits
so for sure int can fit in double without any problem both sign and unsign
1602386
interpreted-language	forth	interpreted-language	forth
Pattern(s): 
as others have mentioned forth is an interpreted language that has been used in a number of embedded environments as well as in quite a few bootloaders
interpreted-language can definitely be used in realtime environments
not all implementations of forth are interpreted though
1602680
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
will require a string to be converted to an int which is not allowed
the + operator will translate to and i + s will return a string which cannot be assigned to an int
this cannot be allowed for a similar reason that c + s returns a string which you are trying to assign to a chars
1602824
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
hashes are commonly used to store passwords to prevent them from being viewed
a hash is simply a one-way function that will take a string or data source and create an encrypted looking string
there are various hashing algorithms the most popular is md5 but there are many others
1602981
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
a hash is also a one-way function which means that there isn t a function to reverse or undo a hash
as well re-applying the hash f f x isn t going to product x again
the details a hash function can be as simple as add 13 to the input or complex like a cryptographic hash such as md5 or sha1
1604152
arduino	avr-gcc
Pattern(s): 
particularly those who might not otherwise have access to more sophisticated controllers that require more complicated tools. 3
i d look at the arduino platform it s a very simple platform for building things exactly like this on top of it and from wikipedia arduino is a physical computing platform based on a simple open hardware design for a single-board microcontroller with embedded i o support and a standard programming language
1 the arduino programming language is based on wiring and is essentially c c++ several simple transformations are performed before passing to avr-gcc . 2 the goal of the arduino project is to make tools available that are accessible low-cost low capital investment flexible and easy-to-use for artists and hobbyists
1604301
allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
i don t recall the details right now but i know that scott meyers discusses this problem at length in effective stl item 10 be aware of allocator conventions and restrictions
however you can have templated allocator that are very similar with the differences between the allocator being encapsulated in the allocator type and use different instantiations of the allocator template each template instantiation is a different type
again my recollection is that meyers discusses this pretty clearly
1604758
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
Pattern(s): 
you can put any logic you need to within this method using the repeateritemeventargs parameter to access the data item you bound to your repeater
personally i wouldn t use a datagrid control since it restricts your control over your output and they ve been replaced by the newer gridview listview controls although datagrid is not obsolete so feel free to use it if you want
you may want to consider using the alternatives but you aren t required to do so
1604800
sfx	zipfile
Pattern(s): 
the sfx exe is also a regular zipfile that you can read and extract with winzip or other zip tools including windows explorer compressed folders
the sfx composes with the other zip features including winzip aes encryption - so you can encrypt the thing and only allow unpacking for someone who knows the password
zip64 for very large archives
1605399
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
it doesn t make any difference if you use multiple databases or the same one the table cache for myisam has the safe effect
the same thing may happen for other engines but i think the effect is much less pronounced innodb doesn t lose its cache when closing a table but it s still not free

1608516
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
git has submodule support
i haven t seen anything like sub-respositories or sub-modules for bazaar unfortunately

1610079
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
consider
i have always preferred to omit the get on my getter as you do with rate instead of getrate
but overloading for the setter does not seem like a very good idea to me since the name rate doesn t convey that the object is being mutated
1610095
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
you p invoke globalmemorystatus for that as usual the sdf has it already wrapped in a more friendly object model as well
cpu usage is a different animal altogether
on the pc you have a nice processors register that gives you easy cheap access to the cpu usage
1610563
interpreted-language	compiled-language
Pattern(s): 
advantages of interpreted-language interpreted-language give programs certain extra flexibility over compiled-language
features that are easier to implement in interpreters than in compilers include but are not limited to platform independence java s byte code for example reflection and reflective usage of the evaluator a first-order eval function dynamic typing ease of debugging it is easier to get source code information in interpreted-language small program size since interpreted-language have flexibility to choose instruction code dynamic scoping automatic memory management disadvantages of interpreted-language an execution by an interpreter is usually much less efficient then regular program execution
it happens because either every instruction should pass an interpretation at runtime or as in newer implementations the code has to be compiled to an intermediate representation before every execution
1611630
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
it doesn t apply universally
every compiler uses some heuristics to determine whether the function should be inline or not but normally every compiler uses its own ones
so to say that a loop will have some universal effect on inlining is not correct
1611630
inline	inlining	inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
there s absolutely nothing in your function that would somehow fundamentally preclude inlining
most modern compilers can easily inline this function if they deem it reasonable or if you force them to do it
yes some compilers offer non-standard declaration specifiers or compiler options that will actually force the inlining override the heuristic analysis except for a number of situation when the inlining is truly beyond the capabilities of the compiler
1611630
inline-functions	inlining
Pattern(s): 
yes some compilers offer non-standard declaration specifiers or compiler options that will actually force the inlining override the heuristic analysis except for a number of situation when the inlining is truly beyond the capabilities of the compiler
for example many modern c c++ compilers normally can t inline-functions with variable number of parameters variadic functions
it also commonly believed that recursive function can t be inlined
1611781
free	realloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 
from the manpage for realloc return value upon successful completion with a size not equal to 0 realloc returns a pointer to the possibly moved allocated space
if size is 0 either a null pointer or a unique pointer that can be successfully passed to free is returned
if there is not enough available memory realloc returns a null pointer and sets errno to enomem
1613391
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
int is usually 16 or 32 bits chars is usually 8 bits etc
let s pretend that on our system int and int are 16 bits
for each argument the stack pointer is decremented -- by sizeof argument and the argument is copied onto the stack
1613831
filtering	grouping	filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 
if the current node is equal to the first node of the grouping that has the right value the test succeeds and something gets printed otherwise nothing happens
xslt 1.0 with this input i get a brief explanation of the part of the stylesheet that does the heavy lifting the first part is obvious - it s just there to make sure that a filtering string was passed in
the second part is plain muenchian grouping with a little twist
1613831
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 
kdescription indexes elements by their text value which means that nodes with the same text but a different accompanying will be returned by the call to key
we need to filtering them out
if the current node is equal to the first node of the grouping that has the right value the test succeeds and something gets printed otherwise nothing happens
1614751
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
if you are worried about git and binary performance you may want to read so git or subversion for binary files the middle para of this blog post about binary file deltas during clone
i don t know if there is something for perforce though it is unlikely since perforce is a commercial product
it d probably be reasonably straightforward to port flashbake to svn
1615135
gdi	direct2d	gdi	direct2d
Pattern(s): 
the underlying implementation has changed quite a bit as i recall most hardware acceleration was removed in vista and put back in in a new form in win7 but it won t magically be transferred to direct2d no
if your application is written to use gdi then it will continue to use gdi
the underlying implementation has changed quite a bit as i recall most hardware acceleration was removed in vista and put back in in a new form in win7 but it won t magically be transferred to direct2d no
1615571
viewdidload	dealloc
Pattern(s): 
the viewdidunload method is called in the event of a memory warning and your view controller s view is not onscreen
subsequently loadview and viewdidload will get called again on demand
the dealloc method as normal is called when your object s retain count reaches 0
1616710
subtract	add
Pattern(s): 
in this case a is the same as 97 and g is 103
since the alphabet is contiguous within the ascii character set subtract a from your value gives its relative position
add 1 if you consider a to be the first instead of zeroth position
1618109
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
server variants of windows x86 give you more address space both by using the 3gb 1gb split and by using pae to allow the use of your full 4gb of ram
linux x86 uses a 3gb 1gb split by default
a 64bit os would give you more address space even for a 32bit process
1618597
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
my application can be deployed on top of any previous versioning
various clients have various deployed versioning
when they upgrade my application supports upgrade from any previous versioning
1618621
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
but i hope this somewhat generic analysis and suggestions still help
udp does not guarantee that a given packet was actually received so encoding whatever you transmit as a difference from last time is problematic -- you can t know that your counterpart has the same idea as you about what the last time was
essentially you d have to build some overhead on top of udp to check what packets have been received tagging each packet with a unique id -- everybody who s tried to go this route will agree that more often than not you find yourself more or less duplicating the tcp streaming infrastructure on top of udp.
1618932
udp	tcp	udp	tftp
Pattern(s): 
for more information check out the rfc for the tftp protocol which uses this strategy. finally if possible you may want to consider using tcp instead
udp unlike tcp is not a reliable protocol
it provides no built in mechanism to ensure that the packets arrive in the proper order or even arrive at all
1619220
openssl	libcrypto	openssl	libcrypto
Pattern(s): 
the libcrypto documentaton on the des_ functions describes what is available
the openssl library provides reliable source code for 3des and many other cryptographic algorithms
the libcrypto documentaton on the des_ functions describes what is available
1620732
filesystems	xfs
Pattern(s): 
best practice is to format the ebs volume with a filesystems that allows freezing such as xfs
this allows you to get a consistent snapshot flush mysql s memory to disk freeze the filesystems snapshot and then unfreeze
the whole process takes less than 10 seconds but can take longer when the db is in heavy use
1621273
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
yahoo s network supports combo-handling
google s supports ssl
check out the yui dependency configurator select google as your cdn and change the base url to https
1622230
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
if the access is by a field access expression e.id where e is a primary expression or by a method invocation expression e.id
. where e is a primary expression then the access is permitted if and only if the type of e is s or a subclass of s
this is to allow a type to access members relevant to its own inherited tree without defeating encapsulation of other classes
1623035
strdup	malloc
Pattern(s): 
note you should probably check your call to malloc for failure and return appropriately
the man page for strdup should explains exactly what your function should be doing

1623273
lisp	scheme	lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
its scheme definition translates almost symbol for symbol
the common lisp hyperspec doesn t define an unfold function but you can certainly write your own
its scheme definition translates almost symbol for symbol
1623334
multiplying	multiplication
Pattern(s): 
binary operator multiplication is only applicable to arithmetic types
in your example you declared a variable struct of type struct struct and then tried to multiplying it by something
this just doesn t make any sense
1624015
strtol	atoi
Pattern(s): 
the behavior is the same as except that atoi does not detect errors
strtol in locales other than the c locale other strings may also be accepted
for example the thousands separator of the current locale may be supported. g_ascii_strtoll converts a string to a gint64 value
1624627
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
you can fix this by providing your own xslt file that gives a specific rss- xhtml transformation so that all browsers will display the same result
well rss is just a schema for the encoding of syndicatable information - it doesn t give any display semantics at all
the reason it seems to work is that ie has a builtin transform to html for rss feed as does safari so they convert the rss into something more human friendly

filewriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 
however if you will be writing to the same file many times the above has to open and close the file on the disk many times which is a slow operation
in this case a buffered writer is better notes the second parameter to the filewriter constructor will tell it to append to the file rather than writing a new file
if the file does not exist it will be created. using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer such as filewriter
1625263
printwriter	bufferedwriter	printwriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 
if the file does not exist it will be created. using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer such as filewriter
using a printwriter gives you access to println syntax that you re probably used to from system.out
but the bufferedwriter and printwriter wrappers are not strictly necessary
1628877
uiview	uipagecontrol
Pattern(s): 
a perfect example is apple s sample code demo here
to expand on coneybeare s brief description there is no special control that does the pages it is simply a uiview within a uiscrollview with code to lock the scrolling to certain spots pages
the uipagecontrol is simply a display of which position the scrollview is currently locked to
1629863
short	base
Pattern(s): 
however since you come from a c++ java background you will probably find the c# syntax more familiar than vb.net
the short answer is that it doesn t matter
in terms of features the .net framework provides the base class library the run-time environment etc
1630015
powermockito	jmockit
Pattern(s): 
oh jmockit supports this too package playtest
powermockito seams to be able to mock system classes
your other option assuming you are not unit testing the 3rd party api is to create a for facade the 3rd party api that has a nice easy mockable interface and have your test classes use this rather than the real thing
1630381
lisp	scheme	ocamllex	ocamlyacc
Pattern(s): 
lex and yacc are used for specifying syntax and grammars for example and they compile to c
there are ports for other languages such as ocamllex ocamlyacc and many other similar tools. as a special case new lisp dialects are often built on existing lisp implementations since they can piggyback on most of the same infrastructure
writing a scheme interpreter can be done in scheme in under a page of code at which point one can easily add new features
1630987
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
if you ever wrote anything more complex in the mysql stored procedure language you will know how painful it is
pl postgresql is actually a nice language + you can use many other languages
mysql doesn t have sequences so if you need them you have to roll your own
1631005
initializer	eigenclass
Pattern(s): 
now we re equipped to understand your original example
inside foo s initializer method self refers not to the class foo but to some particular instance of foo
its eigenclass is a subclass of foo but it is not foo
1632226
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
to convert the float to a integer in a bitwise fashion or it with 0x0 results in int -1 bool false -adam
the result of this script is int 268435455 float 4043309055 int -1 float 4294967295 bool true php converts hexadecimal numbers larger than 31 bits into floats as an integer is signed and can therefore only hold 31 positive bits
hexadecimal numbers are unsigned so the conversion makes sense
1632231
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
this means that two numbers that were really different could end up equal when converted to double -- and the result will be that incorrect number that s not necessarily equal to either of the original inputs
if your implementation provides a 64-bit int type you may get a different incorrect answer by using fmin or fmax
your 64-bit integers will be converted to double which will at least usually have a significand that s smaller than 64-bits
1633377
apache	nginx	apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 
nginx fcgi is the fastest but its a bit of a headache
i d have to say that apache mod_wsgi is probably the most manageable of the setups i ve used
nginx fcgi is the fastest but its a bit of a headache
1633851
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
from that point forward clients broadcast udp packets directly to the other users
typically game engines send udp packets because of latency
the fact is that tcp is just not fast enough and reliability is less of a concern than speed is
1633894
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
i ll take any declarative constraints at the database level that i can get to have atleast some safety net mysql unfortunately falls short on that
postgresql has the added benefit that it can run significantly more algorithms using more advanced data-structures in the database
most of our large projects have a few cases where mysql will hit its limits
1635860
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
from the jquery form plugin api documentation ajaxform prepares a form to be submitted via ajax by adding all of the necessary event listeners
it does not submit the form
use ajaxform in your document s ready function to prepare your form s for ajax submission
1635906
kate	gedit	kate	geany	kate	geany
Pattern(s): 
there s also scintilla and geany
kate is a pretty good editor i ve always preferred it over gedit
there s also scintilla and geany
1636266
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
if in a web server of some sort tell us which one so we can find the logs for you
all your prints will got to stdout which is presumably connected to a browser given your html output
however die writes to the stderr stream
1638667
bazaar	git	bazaar	fossil
Pattern(s): 
see it should work across all the platforms you listed as well
i use git myself but am familiar with hg bazaar etc
fossil is the only one i ve seen that is self-contained
1639328
scheme	racket	scheme	racket
Pattern(s): 
update plt scheme is now known as racket which also has opengl bindings
plt scheme includes opengl bindings in 2 forms one that matches the c api and one that s more scheme like in usage
update plt scheme is now known as racket which also has opengl bindings
1640421
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if you had another subclassing it would be called last
take this example class rottenbanana public banana the inherited chain is now rottenbanana - banana - mybase the constructors of this class will be called starting at mybase then banana and then calling rottenbanana

1640452
gridview	repeater
Pattern(s): 
you could use a repeater however my preference is the new in 3.5 listview
yeah don t use the gridview
a gridview is used to display tabular data
1641034
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
first chars is a valid number mov dh 0 mov dl al sub dl 0 push dx
cumulative value kept on top of stack moredigits mov ah 01h int 21h pop cx
in case of premature exit want the stack as expected... cmp al je donewithdigits cmp al 0 jb printerror cmp al 9 ja printerror mov dh 0
1642573
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
with udp it s slightly different
you basically just throw a packet out there with a destination address and it may or may not arrive - that s the u in udp unreliable
you shouldn t be lulled into thinking the connection of tcp results in all packets taking the same physical path
1644409
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
when dealing with already constructed classes you could be dealing with the declared type of the object or any of its subclassing
that s what inherited is useful for
constructor are always called on the specific type eg new string
1645190
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
although this answer was reviewed by thomas pornin if any of the security professionals out there find something wrong please do comment or edit this wiki answer
since questions about salting hash come along on a quite regular basis and there seems to be quite some confusion about the subject i extended this answer
a salt is a random set of bytes of a fixed length that is added to the input of a hash algorithm
1645190
hash	salt	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
a secret salt is not a salt it is called a key and it means that you are no longer computing a hash but a message authentication code mac
computing mac is tricky business much trickier than simply slapping together a key and a value into a hash function and it is a very different subject altogether
the salt must be random for every instance in which it is used
1645300
identifier	ambiguous
Pattern(s): 
an identifier is an unlimited-length sequence of java letters and java digits the first of which must be a java letter
an identifier cannot have the same spelling unicode character sequence as a keyword 3.9 boolean literal 3.10.3 or the null literal 3.10.7
as for why this decision was made probably because this simplifies parsing avoids ambiguous grammar allows introduction of special syntax in a later version of the language and or for historical reasons because most other languages have the same restrictionsimilar restrictions
1645314
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
these guides should help you get started with bazaar bazaar in five minutes bazaar user guide
bazaar has just a .bzr directory at the top level
it also works on all platforms natively git is still somewhat hokey on windows
1646999
post	get
Pattern(s): 
the usage documentation contained in this post is now applicable to vanilla acts_as_audited
i ve changed the links in this post to point there
get the official repository because mine won t be updated with upstream patches
1647200
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
you need to know the pros and cons of each before you make a decision on which one you use for any particular application
innodb supports fk s supports transactions uses a large memory buffer for operation supports row level locking but has a much higher maintenance cost -- you really need to tune your memory usage configure your table files etc
myisam has a bunch of special column features that innodb doesn t like full text indexes spatial columns i m pretty sure this doesn t work with innodb very fast for primary read append use cases table locks for updates deletes but not for inserts also typically has faster inserts caches indexes in memory key buffer but relies on the os to buffer the actual data pages for example i d use innodb for things like ecommerce user databases or anything that i want to use transactions in
1648516
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
don t use any deterministic value for this
this of course implies that you need to store it in the database along with the hash password
unix systems traditionally even store the hash in the same field as the password the salt is a fixed-length prefix of the password
1650403
nexus	artifactory
Pattern(s): 
i would not recommend artifactory
the free version of nexus is perfectly fine for a dev team of less than 20 in less than three groups
if you have more users than that do yourself a favor and pay for the sonatype release
1650660
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
this is a very general approach in that instead of you could be using any strictly-bool predicate of interest
for example if you have a bunch of int and want to know how many of them have 3 as the first digit of their decimal representation sum str abs x .startswith 3 for x in a b c d e works fine too
don t be queasy about summing boolean python boolean are sharply defined as a subclass of int with exactly two instances which have peculiar str repr but otherwise behave exactly like the plain ints 0 and 1
1650677
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
contains unique codes or not
the for-loop given would remember the last object in the list with a given code which would mean a hash is not the solution
for small stable list sizes simply converting the list to an arrays of objects would show a performance increase on top of some better readability
1651640
gdi	direct2d	gdi	direct2d
Pattern(s): 
apparently direct2d which wpf uses for antialiased text output always gives precedence to foreground text color over background color when doing subpixel antialiasing
on the other hand traditional gdi cleartype seems to always give precedence to dark colors over bright ones
thus with bright letters and dark backgrounds cleartype text becomes thinner but direct2d text remains of the same size pixel-wise
1651965
std	ostream
Pattern(s): 
from the ostream header file on endl this manipulator is often mistakenly used when a simple newline is desired leading to poor buffering performance
std endl is basicly so just use r n instead and omit the flush
it s faster that way too
1652265
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 
if no part of it is visible it will not trap touches because it s off in undefined space having tea with the square root of negative one
the uitableview is handling the hits because the b uiview is not in the responder chain at all
you need to make b-uiview a sibling of a-view instead of an invisible and inactive subviews
1652665
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
so when an executible loaded there would be a loader piece that would check the processors and a few bytes of control data in the object and if the two matched then the executible part of the object could be loaded straight away but if not then the byte code for that object would have to be recompiled and the executible part updated
so it s not just in time compilation - it s on program install or on cpu changed compilation. the loader part would be very short and sweet it would be in 386 code so it wouldn t need to be compiled
it would only load the byte-code compiler if it needed to and if so it would load a compiler object that was small and tight and optimized for the detected architecture
1652810
int	double
Pattern(s): 
by default a double value contains 15 decimal digits of precision although a maximum of 17 digits is maintained internally
in your example the value of i is 6.89999999999999946709 which has the number 9 for all positions between the 3rd and the 16th digit remember to count the int part in the digits
when converting to string the framework rounds the number to the 15th digit
1654667
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 
there is no cumulative error
one approach is not to try to compute the time by repeated addition of this 0.1 seconds constant but to keep a simple integer clock-tick count
this tick count can be converted to a fixed-point time in seconds as needed usually using a multiplication followed by a division
1654926
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
more registers since the 64bit architecture has a large number of registers most function parameters and the return value can be passed using registers
in the x86 abi with some calling conventions one or maybe two parameter could be passed via registers and the rest have to be pushed onto the stack
with a common calling convention like cdecl not a single parameter or return value is placed in a register
1655364
git-rev-list	git-diff-tree
Pattern(s): 
i agree that it s annoying not to see those documented in the man pages or in the --help output
in this case the git-log help states the command takes options applicable to the git-rev-list command to control what is shown and how and options applicable to the git-diff- commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown
in this case you ll find the -m option under git-diff-tree ... -m by default git-diff-tree --stdin does not show differences for merge commits
1656236
valgrind	memcheck
Pattern(s): 
the tool adds its own instrumentation code to this and hands the result back to the core which coordinates the continued execution of this instrumented code
so basically valgrind provides a virtual processor that executes your application
however before your application instructions are processed they are passed to tools such as memcheck
1656477
wxpython	pyqt	wxpython	pyqt
Pattern(s): 
other good option is pyqt which will give you consistent look on all platforms
i think wxpython is pretty good though i am not sure what you mean by support on mac os x is fairly limited but i have been porting a wxpython app www.mockupscreens.com to mac and it wasn t that difficult with few tweaks some ui elements may not come up as you expected as wxpython uses native ui elements which can be an advanatage or disadvantage based on your requirements
other good option is pyqt which will give you consistent look on all platforms
1656719
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
however these techniques tend to have diminishing returns with respect to the number of pipelines in a processors before stalls become inevitable
in practice no cpu manufacturer makes more than 4 pipelines in a single core
multi-core has nothing to do with any of these techniques
1656728
cpu	processors	cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
modern consumer processors since the powerpc pentium are pipelined and superscalar
a core2 cpu is capable of running the same code that was compiled for a 486 while still taking advantage of instruction level parallelism because it contains its own internal logic that analyzes machine code and determines how to reorder and run it what can be run in parallel what can t etc. this is the essence of superscalar design and why it s so practical
in contrast a vector parallel processors performs operations on several pieces of data at once a vector
1657577
testdriven.net	partcover	testdriven.net	partcover	ncover	testdriven.net	ncover	partcover	ncover	partcover
Pattern(s): 
but as far as i know there is no visual studio integration for partcover
personally i like ncover along with testdriven.net for visual studio integration
partcover is a good alternative too
1657802
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
notice that the limit for the first loops is different. distance between two points is probably sqrt x1 - x2 2 + y1 -y2 2
you don t want to double count any segment so your algorithm should be a double for-loop
the outer loops goes from a to m you don t need to check n because there ll be nothing left for it to connect to each time looping from curpoint to n calculating each distance
1658267
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
out of supported options i recommend using proxy models and enforce class-specific constraints through validation in overloaded save methods of subclassing
i think you re describing single-table inherited
it is not currently supported in django
1658556
maven	cobertura
Pattern(s): 
additional nightly builds with more detailed reporting enabled
whole team is notified about failed builds yeah they complain about getting too many mails sometimes if something breaks the chain and all 30 submodules get build failures when the maven repository is unreachable code-coverage tools yes
maven cobertura and sonar
1659358
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
to compensate for this python comes with wrapper classes that mimic the behavior of these built-in datatypes userstring userlist and userdict
using a combination of normal and special methods the userdict class does an excellent imitation of a dictionary. in python 2.2 and later you can inherited classes directly from built-in datatypes like dict
in reality today you probably want to subclassing dict rather than userdict
1661462
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
Pattern(s): 
the code is hosted on github
asihttprequest is a great framework for http requests
from the asihttprequest site asihttprequest is an easy to use wrapper around the cfnetwork api that makes some of the more tedious aspects of communicating with web servers easier
1662330
spaces	delimiter	spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 
otherwise i would use split on the string with as the delimiter and then count the size of the array that split returns
if you re satisfied with a not-quite accurate solution you could simply keep a running count on the number of spaces characters within the text and assume that it is equal to the number of words
otherwise i would use split on the string with as the delimiter and then count the size of the array that split returns
1662363
nltk	lingpipe
Pattern(s): 
i can t really comment about whether nltk or lingpipe is best suited for this task although from looking at the answers it looks like there s quite a few other resources written in java
one advantage of going with nltk is that python is very accessible as a language
the other advantage is that the nltk book which is available for free offers an introduction to both python and nltk at the same time which would be useful for you
1662517
post	get
Pattern(s): 
bottom line once you get over a handful of customers you need to start thinking about automating your operations and your deployment as yet another application to itself
update this post highlights the negative effects of branching per customer

1664063
typedef	typename	typedef	typename
Pattern(s): 
dependent type information is easier to describe setint iterator and should you ever change your mind suppose you went to a hash_set instead of a std set is effectively updated immediately due to the typedef they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode i m sure there are more i m not thinking of..
typedef s are mostly notational convenience but they do have a bunch of benefits declaring function pointer types for callbacks --notoriously hard to get right when spelled out completely
dependent type information is easier to describe setint iterator and should you ever change your mind suppose you went to a hash_set instead of a std set is effectively updated immediately due to the typedef they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode i m sure there are more i m not thinking of..
1664088
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 
in open source not really
as a point of comparison junit was basically going nowhere for years
then java got annotations junit got competition testng and it is suddenly moving along again
1665043
pascal	delphi
Pattern(s): 
anyway i like this language though i havn t done any serious programming with it
searching the keyword pascal filtering the results with programming language pascal you ll find a bunch of applications of pascal if not enterprise level at least serious programmer s level
with so many open-source and cross-platform ides libraries i think pascal is still alive except the popular delphi dialect and could do practical tasks.as the results implies pascal could do operating system compiler cross-platform library desktop-programming.so it seems that pascal at least could do a lot of serious tasks if not too pratical to make moeny back instantly
1665411
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 
if the minimum is below zero or very high to the point where it would waste too much memory you can just use a minval to adjust the indexes another o n scan to find the minimum value and then just use i-minval instead of i for array indexes
and even if the range from low to high is too expensive on memory you can use a sparse array
you ll have to sort it o n log n and search it for updating counts also o n log n but that s still better than the original o n 2
1666156
nunit	mstest	xunit.net	specflow
Pattern(s): 
specflow is using the same definition format gherkin like cucumber but you can write your step definitions in .net
it basically generates unit-test classes nunit mstest xunit.net etc. from your feature files so you can use the same unit test execution engine like you do with the real unit tests
this way it is also easier to integrate the bdd functional tests to the integration build
1666241
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
you could try adding a salt to the hash for a bit of extra complexity
this could be sent as a value to the flash game add it as a parameter to the flash object in the html and include that in the hash verification code
you could send some kind of session id or random number so it s always different
1668235
hash	salt	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
salt are used to prevent collisions whereas we are specifically looking for a collision in this instance
a cryptographically secure hash would work
sha512 or sha256 would be ok however i would use a fairly secret salt that is not stored along with the cards to prevent any sort of rainbow table attack
1669137
flac	speex	flac	aiff	flac	ogg	speex	aiff	speex	ogg
Pattern(s): 
by the way audiere can also play certain audio files mp3 wav aiff mod s3m xm it by itself
ogg vorbis flac speex with external libraries not just pure generated tones
one possible downside is that there is a slightly audible click as you start or stop an individual tone
1670151
clang	llvm
Pattern(s): 
you can even pull in clang as well to work in c parse trees note that clang has incomplete support for c++ currently but is written in c++ itself for example you could write a self-modification core in c++ to interface with clang and llvm and the rest of the program in c
store the parse tree for the main program alongside the self-modification code then manipulate it with clang at runtime
clang will let you directly manipulate the ast tree in any way then compile it all the way down to machine code
1670355
dynamic-languages	first-class
Pattern(s): 
so these elements of the programming language and the programs also are first-class objects they can be manipulated as such
dynamic-languages has nothing to do with dynamic typing
dynamic-languages means that the elements of the programming language for example via meta classes and the meta-object protocol and the program its classes functions methods slots inheritance ... can be looked at runtime and can be modified at runtime
1671179
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
when the application starts up or every hour or so we make a get request to our webserver
versioning 2.1.1.1 the script checks the database and compares the versioning
if the versioning is different upgrade is send back to the utility other wise good if the utility receives upgrade it sends the users to a predetermined url to download the newest versioning of the utility
1672168
nunit	moq
Pattern(s): 
it will take more effort from you to do unit testing in a web forms application though
nunit is well established alive project and widespread
moq on the other hand uses latest language capabilities is easy to use and is also used by the community
1672221
stringbuilder	stringwriter
Pattern(s): 
looking in reflector it looks like the encoding of stringwriter is a private static variable so all stringwriter instances will have the same encoding
if you can do that this code works for me if you must use stringbuilder for a good reason perhaps you might consider omitting the xml declaration and adding it in your code before the atomformatter.writeto call
alternatively you could write your function to accept an arbitrary stream and create an xmlwriter on that using a memorystream or filestream when you aren t planning to write directly to the response.outputstream
1672260
hmac	md5
Pattern(s): 
even if you made the recommended changes you would still be in violation of cwe-602
the cryptographic system you are using is very similar to an hmac but yours implementation is less secure
the md5 algorithm is a broken however your mac is immune to the prefixing attack to generate hash collisions because the beginning of the your secret
1672260
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
the md5 algorithm is a broken however your mac is immune to the prefixing attack to generate hash collisions because the beginning of the your secret
the attacker must be able to control the beggaring of the string in order to create a hash collision
tamperdata is a very useful hacking tool to modify capture replay traffic that comes from the browser
1672424
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
Pattern(s): 
other browsers do not but if they did setting a mouseleave listener on window or document would do the trick
a gentleman named ken snyder comes to the rescue on a mouseover the relatedtarget property references the node from which the pointer came
on a mouseout the relatedtarget property references the node to which the pointer went.on any event the scope is the node to which the event is attached.when the relatedtarget is a not child of the currenttarget a mouseover event is equivalent to a mouseenter event and a mouseout event is equivalent to a mouseleave event
1673862
awt	swing	composite	command-pattern
Pattern(s): 
decorator pattern bufferedinputstream can decorate other streams such as filterinputstream abstractfactory pattern for the awt toolkit and the swing pluggable look-and-feel classes java.lang.runtime#getruntime is singleton buttongroup for mediator pattern action abstractaction may be used for different visual representations to execute same code - command-pattern interned strings or cellrender in jtable for flyweight pattern also think about various pools - thread pools connection pools ejb object pools - flyweight is really about management of shared resources the java 1.0 event model is an example of chain of responsibility as are servlet filters
iterator pattern in collections framework nested containers in awt swing use the composite pattern layout managers in awt swing are an example of strategy and many more i guess

1675559
put	get
Pattern(s): 
using post get is usually best if you just have one page talking to one other page submission of a form
if you have a bunch of data that will be shared by several pages the best way to do it would probably be to put them in the session
if you need those values to stick around after the user leaves your site and comes back later then you might want to use cookies
1676735
trie	tree
Pattern(s): 
edit there is one problem when storing c strings in pt
this trie is designed to store binary data but you are interested only in getting the whole bytes. make sure you are storing common part of the prefix only if its size in bits is multiple of 8
for a wrong example you have key in your tree 0xc0 0xa5 and you are looking fro 0xc0 0xa6. your traversal will stop when the common part 0xc0 0xa but you are interested in taking only 0xc0
1676749
xsl-fo	xslt	xsl-fo	xslt
Pattern(s): 
you can generate rtf and pdf directly via xslt but to do that you need to know rtf and pdf pretty intimately and pdf in particular is as a cs professor i knew used to say extremely non-trivial
the two technologies i ve used to produce pdfs xml - xsl-fo - apache fop formatting objects processor - pdf
advantages if you understand html and xslt creating output with xsl-fo is not a lot harder than creating html with xslt software is open source
1677768
memcmp	strcmp
Pattern(s): 
looks like once it has pv1 and pv2 which were coerced to now are just compared byte-by-byte because they are coerced to
is that what happens with memcmp pretty much
the main differences differences between memcmp and strcmp are strcmp will stop once it sees a null 0 and perl allows scalars to have embedded null s memcmp often runs just a little bit faster than strcmp but aside from that you re going to get the same results
1678697
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
if it s just displaying a page that allows you to edit something then get is fine
if it s actually changing something then post is the correct semantic thing to do and you have to deal with the fact that the markup is a bit bloated
the practical problem with get requests that modify data is that they might get followed by mistake - think bookmarks back forward buttons many browsers display a warning if you try and re-submit a post request this way search engines following links etc
1680049
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
Pattern(s): 
i don t know if sharpziplib can be convinced to do that
i do know that if you use dotnetzip and use the normal zipfile class and save to a seekable stream like a filesystem file you will get a zip that does not have bit 3 set
if the theory is correct it should open with no problem on the mac every time
1680956
base	fractions
Pattern(s): 
this is because by our very definition for the blue set is that it is a base 10 mantissa exponent representation and a double is a base 2 mantissa exponent representation
any value represented as base 2 mantissa and exponent 1.00110101001 x 2 -11101001101001 means take the mantissa value 1.00110101001 and multiply it by 2 raised to the power of the exponent when exponent is negative this is equivilent to dividing by 2 to the power of the absolute value of the exponent
this means that where the exponent is negative or where any portion of the mantissa is a fractions binary the number cannot be represented as a decimal mantissa and exponent and vice versa
1681374
super	self
Pattern(s): 
the pyside examples are available here git clone git gitorious.org pyside pyside-examples.git i think the problem may have to do with your call of super mymainwindow self .__init__ parent try qtgui.qmainwindow.__init__ self parent instead
i know it seems like it is the same thing but i ve ran into similar problems with super using pyqt4 and from what i can tell nokia s pyside has the same troubles
it has something to do with weather the python owns the parent or it s owned by an underlying c++ object
1682067
rtp	bittorrent
Pattern(s): 
you should probably look at something like the bittorrent protocol or a subset of it since you apparently don t need peer-to-peer but you can use it as a one-to-many protocol if you want
rtp is not directly designed for reliable block transfer
while you can shoehorn stuff on top of it to implement a reliable transfer protocol using rtp as a lower layer this is stuffing a square peg in a round hole
1683331
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
the file lzmabench.cpp in this directory contains a whole cbenchprogressinfo class including a callback for progress information
for example in the folder cpp 7zip compress lzma_alone there s a quite complete reference implementation of lzma
the file lzmabench.cpp in this directory contains a whole cbenchprogressinfo class including a callback for progress information
1686221
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
for example suppose you have a business logic class that uses a data logic class to retrieve data from a data source and then process it
by creating an interface for the data logic class which it then inherited you could create a mock fake instance of that class based on the interface and inject that into the business logic class you re unit testing
the mocked instance can be defined so as to expect certain method properties calls throw exceptions at certain points return valid outputs etc etc
1686663
wan	subnet
Pattern(s): 
just because two ips do not live within the same subnet does not mean they have high latency between them
just because two ips happen to live within the same ip range does not mean taht the have low latency consider two ethernet segments linked by a wan bridge across a 64 kbps line
maybe unlikely in this day and age but i have certainly worked with networks where links like that were common
1686835
ready	each
Pattern(s): 
in your case it s better to write a single function if the 2 arrays have different length you can add a check before appending to bdy
ready fn is a special function in jquery that can be written in one or many blocks
if written in many blocks each block can not access others variables
1687560
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
this table will be generated by a batch work and will contains childid the id of a category ancestorid the id of its parent grand parent .
all ancestors category it means that if you have 3 categories 1-propeller 2-aircraft 3-wood then the ancestor table will contain childid ancestorid 1 2 1 3 2 3 this means that to have all the children of category1 you just need 1 query and you don t have do nested query
by the way this would work not matter what is the depth of you category hierarchy
1687594
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
as always measure your performance first before making any optimizations
if performance is a major concern then you may want to look at optimizing the serializable of the session content
serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state
1687594
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state
from msdn magazine session state uses a custom serializable mechanism to convert the session dictionary and its contents to a binary blob before storing the data in an out-of-process store
the serializable mechanism has direct support for .net framework primitive types including string boolean datetime timespan int16 int32 int64 byte char single double decimal sbyte uint16 uint32 uint64 guid and intptr
1687949
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
however i ve found that it s much nicer to use an existing framework -- they re set up to allow you to easily add tests see success failure and run tests automatically
nunit is fine or really anything will do
mstest is ok if you have a version of visual studio that comes with it
1688500
comparator	comparable
Pattern(s): 
if you did this each esamemedico would be inserted according to its natural order and you wouldn t have to perform any sorting yourself
if you want to change the ordering of the list you can use the collections.sort method that takes a comparator as an argument
based on your code you seem to have some confusion between the comparable and comparator interfaces
1689447
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
also most ides have support for creating the minimum pom.xml which is just a few lines anyway
besides doing the dep-mgmt maven will compile the sources run all test cases and package the whole thing as jar file for you with no extra configuration
that s the default
1689697
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
some of the issues i remember and still fight just like ant it has a magical syntax that can be hard to understand
if you re familiar with any you may forget that but lots of ant tasks are terribly documented
the same is true for maven
1689987
codeigniter	kohana
Pattern(s): 
kohana a fork of codeigniter is worth checking out if you are still looking for a good php framework
in my opinion it is much better than codeigniter

1691369
put	get
Pattern(s): 
the business layer should be able to just ask the data layer for all instances of a model without caring about the specific query that is going to be used to get that data
put sql queries in the data layer
for a query like whether you make that a class method of the model itself or a method of a model manager object is a matter of style
1694035
expander	togglebutton	expander	grid
Pattern(s): 
explore the generated visual tree at runtime using vs.net debugger or a tool like mole to see if the togglebutton is present in the visual tree as the first child of the grid
the default template for treeviewitem uses a togglebutton not an expander try a separate with one child to see if it works
if it does incrementally change both until you find the problem
1694401
webclient	httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 
here s the timheuer version
webclient is a simpler implementation doing get requests really easily and get a response stream
httpwebrequest is great for when you need a bit more granular control over the request need to send headers or other customizations
1695048
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
1.0 is a double so it make 1.0 n a double division that you want
try because 1 is an int and n is an int so 1 n is an int division which return 0 when n is not 1 and throw error when n is 0
1.0 is a double so it make 1.0 n a double division that you want
1696721
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
you could consider using floor instead and keeping the number to be rounded in a double
as others have said the cast to int won t work with large numbers
you could consider using floor instead and keeping the number to be rounded in a double
1696806
codeigniter	cakephp
Pattern(s): 
i ve used cakephp for several projects and it s pretty nice once you get used to it
i picked that over symphony codeigniter and zend but that was a while ago so those might have had substantial improvements

1697007
iprincipal	iidentity
Pattern(s): 
there is a user class which is essentially a user profile and has properties such as string username string hashedpassword timezoneinfo timezonepreference etc as well as a logon string password method
the logon method of my user class does things like update the failedlogonscount property or temporarylockoutliftedatutc property and so forth depending on whether or not hashing the passed in password succeeds against the one stored or it returns a non-persisted object that implements iprincipal which is a standard .net interface
in this sense i distinguish between the user s profile the user class and their authentication authorization tokens non-persisted classes that implement iprincipal and iidentity so that they can participate in the various and thread.currentprincipal schemes used throughout the .net framework
1697241
try-catch	exception-handling	try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
now look at these the first and second try-catch blocks are exactly the same thing they simply rethrow the current exception-handling and that exception-handling will keep its source and the stack trace
the third try-catch block is different
when it throws the exception-handling it will change the source and the stack trace so that it will appear that the exception-handling has been thrown from this method from that very line throw e on the method containing that try-catch block
1698013
nsbuttoncell	nstablecolumn
Pattern(s): 
in nstableview and nsoutlineview you can specify the cell class that gets used for each nstablecolumn or even for each individual element if you want to go that far
you can use nsbuttoncell nstextfieldcell and even nstokenfieldcell
the documentation on setdatacell has more of the details
1698260
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
in most c implementations those that run on 32-bit pcs anyway a chars is an 8-bit int
an int is a 32-bit int
when you add or subtract two chars s and the result is more than 8 bits it will wrap around to some other value but this process is reversible
1698767
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
if you use an unbound checkbox to populate a date field you re using it like a command button
i would suggest that a command button makes more sense
but that might not even be necessary -- it depends on what is triggering the need to enter the current date
1699154
ws-trust	ws-federation
Pattern(s): 
i believe jboss and wso have implementations that might be useful
this problem has been largely solved by ws-trust at least for soap-based web services anyway
ws-trust is a well-defined protocol for validating and exchanging authentication tokens and can be used in cross-enterprise scenarios with protocols such as ws-federation that are built on it
1699154
ws-trust	ws-federation
Pattern(s): 
ws-trust is a well-defined protocol for validating and exchanging authentication tokens and can be used in cross-enterprise scenarios with protocols such as ws-federation that are built on it
one example scenario is to have the clients request a token from the ws-trust server then include that token in the soap header to the web service host
the flip side is to include something simple like usernametoken in the request to the host and have the server-side delegate authentication to the ws-trust server
1699411
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
use this code to have absolute url for a link
ssl works on site level not on folder level
once you install ssl certificate your website could be accessed using https protocol like so
1699474
csla	.net	csla	.net
Pattern(s): 
also there s a two-part dotnet rocks tv screencast with rocky himself on the topic rocky lhotka on csla .net 3.5 part 1 rocky lhotka on csla .net 3.5 part 2
rocky lhotka s csla framework is widely used and praised as a great way to start your business objects
it s available for .net silverlight and windows ce
1701116
webrat	cucumber
Pattern(s): 
this is usually what makes sense to me when i define my stories since i don t have really in mind the code i am going to write. so i am testing the final result with cucumber - views using simulated or automated browzer then i use rspec to test any code i write in the controllers and models
thus in your case when a user enters an invalid telephone number then they get a message saying invalid telephone number i would use webrat to check that the user get the invalid telephone number message in the view
i would use rspec to test my controller action and model
1701438
textmate	aptana	textmate	radrails
Pattern(s): 
but aptana has a quite good support of rails development with the radrails plugin
on mac there s textmate
for ruby or any other development it s a dream to use
1702083
versioning	upgrade	jython	pypy
Pattern(s): 
even minor-release upgrade don t happen instantly in most large projects and organizations
for example app engine is still using python 2.5 apparently upgrading its specialized sandboxed python runtime and all it relies on is not a zero-effort proposition so they prefer to keep putting their energy towards adding engine features instead -- so i believe are implementations such as jython and pypy i think ironpython s in the process of migrating to 2.6 but the current production versioning is still 2.5
totally new projects starting today should seriously consider starting with python 3
1702529
httpwebrequest	networkcredentials
Pattern(s): 
another option is to build the authorization header yourself on the initial request
the credentials set on httpwebrequest will only be passed through http s authorization header via basic digest or ntlm
so if your web service is protected with ws-security the networkcredentials will probably not be passed on to the authentication scheme at all because ws-security doesn t operate at the http level
1702920
folder	dir
Pattern(s): 
as phil mentioned directory.delete fails if it is regardless of permissions see bottom of msdn.microsoft.com en-us library in addition unable to remove read-only attribute from folder microsoft says you may be unable to remove the read-only attribute from a folder using windows explorer
in addition some programs may display error messages when you try to save files to the folder
conclusion always remove all dir file attributes diffrent then normal before deleting
1704952
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
to be completely clear - https is http on top of tls ssl
the tls ssl connection is made first and then http uses it just like it would use an unencrypted transport

1706281
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 
c and c++ programmers can usually spot the missing buffer size check when using strcpy
use strcpy and check the buffer size by hand
strncpy is a little safer but dangerous in other way
1706481
dlsym	dlopen
Pattern(s): 
your loadsharedlibrary can be a wrapper around dlopen
you getfuncptr function can be a wrapper around dlsym
what you can do is write code around the dl functions to make it robust - like do some error checking
1707038
emacs	textmate	emacs	gedit	textmate	geany	textmate	gedit	gedit	kdevelop	geany	kdevelop	geany	gedit	qt-creator	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
actually the veracity of the previous statement doesn t really matter just use a tool you re productive with and ideally a right one for the job
here is a quick choice list emacs vi m multi-languages i m sure they are still used for c c++ development gedit multi-languages advanced text editor very good for rails can be pimped to mimic textmate geany another text editor based on the gtk2 toolkit eclipse netbeans intellij idea java oriented but with nice support of c c++ and php groovy grails rails monodevelop for .net development support a bunch of languages qt-creator for.
qt development anjuta kdevelop c c++ ides for gnome and kde respectively code blocks cross platform c++ ide as you can see gnu linux doesn t mean coding in a 80 columns shell potentially opened through ssh
1707133
kate	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
i won t call kate an ide that s what kdevelop is for
kate is just a really good editor

1709080
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
if there is a server-side component to your application then you ll need a servlet container
if your application is completely client-side and does not need to communicate with a server for data purposes then you can use any web server
gwt compiles to static javascript files so you can use apache or any other web server to serve up the static files
1709367
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
if you re a software developer who insists upon using spaces where tabs belong i ll insist that you re a slob - but whatever - in the end it s all compiled
on the other hand if you re a web developer with a bunch of consecutive spaces and other excess whitespace all over your html css javascript then you re either clueless about client-side code or you just don t give a crap
client-side code is not compiled and not compressed with iis default settings - pointless whitespace in client-side script is like adding pointless thread.sleep calls in server-side code
1710256
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
project- properties java build path source tab select excluded click click next to the exclusion patterns section on the bottom add the .svn folder and any others that do not need to be copied to the output directory
add the .svn folder to the excluded list for your source folder
project- properties java build path source tab select excluded click click next to the exclusion patterns section on the bottom add the .svn folder and any others that do not need to be copied to the output directory
1711218
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 
edit debian has python2.6 only in experimental see here
you could also take the source package from ubuntu

1712532
division	modulo
Pattern(s): 
hopefully your compiler supports long long int or __int64 both of which are 64-bits
after converting the contents of the struct to a numeric type the division proceeds directly as with any division
after performing the division you will need to store the result back to the timeval probably making use of the remainder after division or modulo x y
1712946
hex	binary	hex	binary
Pattern(s): 
multiply that by the space difference between binary 20 and varchar n and i think you ll find it s not a significant savings
personally i would prefer the hex representation because at least i can type it in a query if i m doing some ad-hoc operation during development or writing a unit test to validate password related operations
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc
1712946
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc
my bottom line is that the hex representation would be more convenient during the development cycle

1713436
put	get
Pattern(s): 
by putting your business logic under models it will lead you to unit test easier because models is not coupled with http methods or processing
as for django the best place to put business logic is inside models
the view should be clean from business logic and should only be used to get the data to be displayed presented on template or in other words let the view be used for view logic only
1713452
awt	swing	awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
people who have suffered swing would tell you note but all this only applies if you have enough time and a spare job
there are too many gui toolkits for java since the awt debacle
even swing has been seriously downplayed by critics they have thier reasons though
1715405
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	onnewintent	oncreate	ondestroy
Pattern(s): 
what i do to see what s going on i implement dummy functions for all the different states of each activity so i always now what s going on same for onrestart onstart onresume onpause ondestroy if the above back-button wasn t your problem implementing these dummies will at least help you debugging it a bit better
that s probably why oncreate gets invoked every time instead of onnewintent which would only be called if the activity is already existing
for example if you leave your activity via the back-button it gets destroyed by default
1715589
with-statement	continue
Pattern(s): 
this version will work in any 2.x version of python and fixes both the problems i discussed above this is the best general form for older versions of python
as suggested by steveha using with-statement is now considered best practice
if you re using 2.6 or above you should write it this way with open filename rt as f for line in f if line.startswith # continue # process line here with-statement will clean up the file handle for you
1716315
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
make stdout unbuffered
stdout is buffered so will only output after a newline is printed
to get immediate output either print to stderr
1716324
stderr	fflush
Pattern(s): 
or you can set stdout to unbuffered
you can fprintf to stderr which is unbuffered instead
or you can fflush stdout when you want to
1716621
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
will now print everything in the stdout buffer edit from andy ross s comment below you can also disable buffering on stdout by using setbuf setbuf stdout null
the stdout stream is buffered so will only display what s in the buffer after it reaches a newline or when it s told to
you have a few options to print immediately print to stderr instead using fprintf fprintf stderr i will be printed immediately
1716751
arp	tcp	arp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
retransmission in tcp occurs when an ack is not received within a given time
if the arp reply takes a long time or is itself lost you might be getting a retransmission even though the device waiting for the arp reply is queuing the packet
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time
1716751
arp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time
this implies that reuse of the arp is not causing it to stay refreshed which is possible behaviour that would be helpful in your situation
how long does the arp reply take
1719024
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 
we solve this for nhibernate by overriding 2 methods of the object class. gethashcode and equals gethashcode basically returns a unique hashcode based on an object s state. equals compares two objects for equality like this basically gethashcode concatenates the object type and the name of the tag as a string ie app.domain.tag|nameoftag and generates a hashcode for that string equals then compares the gethashcode result for the first object with the gethashcode result for the second object to test for equality
if you do this with the two objects we defined above the two hashcodes will be the same and therefore the comparison for equals will be true
when nhibernate tests the two objects for equality in its inner-workings it will determine they are the same and it should solve your problem
1722033
width	height
Pattern(s): 
adding them is done in exactly the same way as you add any other component
you can use the helper methods of the box class to create such components box.createhorizontalstrut int width creates an invisible fixed-width component
box.createverticalstrut int height creates an invisible fixed-height component
1723585
queue	fifo
Pattern(s): 
here are the results this works great for functions like this but it doesn t work with the stl copy because the stl is stupid
queue does not allow iteration through its elements
from the sgi stl docs a queue is an adaptor that provides a restricted subset of container functionality a queue is a fifo fifo data structure
1723609
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
the file versioning is also important for windows installer when you upgrade an existing versioning over a previous one
file versioning are only used for display purposes whereas the assembly versioning plays an important part in the .net loading behaviour
not quite
1727499
prng	random
Pattern(s): 
if you manage the generator correctly you never get a repetition for the lifetime of the system and therefore there is zero risk of a collision
but it is important that you use a prng not a true rng and that you pick a prng that has the right properties
from what i can tell the random class offers a prng with a cycle length of
1728892
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
at this hash size the weaknesses in md5 are pretty irrelevant since the best known attacks on md5 take roughly 2 32 computations while one can generate a collision in even an ideally secure 32-bit hash in around 2 16 computations since by merely choosing random inputs you have 1 in 2 16 chance of a collision so after roughly 2 16 random guesses you ll probably have found a colliding pair of inputs
the odds of a collision in a n-bit hash are around 1 in 2 n 2 due to the birthday paradox - so about 1 in 2 16 in this case
if for some reason you were referring to using 32 bits of the hex encoding of course that would only be the first 16 actual bits so then the odds of a collision would be about 1 in 2 8
1729074
passenger	thin
Pattern(s): 
if it is going to be a relatively low traffic site mongrel or thin provides a simple easy to manage way to deploy the application
for higher traffic sites where you need the smart queuing and process management of something like passenger it is a very good solution
as for fastcgi you probably want to use that as a last option
1729290
pascal	delphi	pascal	delphi
Pattern(s): 
hopefully with the next version of delphi it is possible to build datasnap servers for the linux platform
remobjects sdk supports free pascal
and free pascal is a delphi compatible pascal compiler for amongst others linux platforms
1729498
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
Pattern(s): 
learn vb6 if you have to deal with legacy application or one of the microsoft office applications that still use vba
even then the syntax between vb.net and vb6 is close enough to make the transition easy
the situation is similar to the family of c langauges like c c++ c# java etc
1732320
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
here s how you now have a classpath object named maven.classpath which contains all the maven dependencies defined in the pom.xml file
all you need is to put the maven ant tasks jar in your ant s lib directory
maven makes your build process dependent on your network connection
1732350
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
it sounds like you re possibly trying to derive from a class or use a properties just to avoid typing as much - that s a bad idea
inherited is for specialization not to make names easier to reach just have a using directive using system.web.security
and then you can use roles.xxx wherever you want in that code
1732475
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt
Pattern(s): 
native elementree supports a limited subset of xpath although it may be good enough for your needs
use lxml
lxml uses the full power of libxml2 and libxslt but wraps them in more pythonic bindings than the python bindings that are native to those libraries
1732510
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
that ought to at least get you started
i d start with recommending reading steve yegge s post on is weak typing strong enough then his post on dynamic languages strike back
that ought to at least get you started
1732886
profiling	debugging
Pattern(s): 
many more see list in project build options 2. has decent source code browser with necessary stuff syntax highlighting based on multiple programming language supported source code file statistics like code lines comment lines blank lines- good for kloc statistics of code 3. has a decent debugger in it to step break analyse the code and data for debugging cons 1. per se i did not find any problems to point but found some glitches in code generation using this and at times faced some problems in executing the generated executable
2. the profiling tool is not so detailed and that great
3. there isnt a tool which gives a call graph caller-callee relation
1734012
nant	psake
Pattern(s): 
psake powershell based - very promising fake for the adventurous minds who love f# i still use msbuild since it s the format of csproj files but for specific stuff i shun building logic in xml no custom msbuild tasks
nant as a project is dead or on life support last release was 0.86 beta 1 two years ago
it was basically cut short by the release of msbuild
1734730
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
while the virtual machine ensures that private fields can not be modified at least if a security manager is present there is no such protection for serialized data
presumably because it forces the developer to think about how serializable has to occur
if so how is it initialized after deserialization
1734730
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
if so how is it initialized after deserialization
moreover implementing serializable has security implications
while the virtual machine ensures that private fields can not be modified at least if a security manager is present there is no such protection for serialized data
1734747
icomparable	compareto
Pattern(s): 
compare example ordering person by age sort usage equality example for identifying person by id
the icomparable defines order less than greater than
the method defined by it is compareto with which you can determine the order between two elements
1734992
lseek	ftell	lseek	fseek
Pattern(s): 
then you can map only part of a file at a time on 32-bit machines
open lseek to the end of file getting the size of file using tell and then allocating memory accordingly would work well as suggested above
unless there is specific reason to do it fopen fseek ftell is a better idea portable staying within the c standard library
1735047
post	get
Pattern(s): 
update to get messages changed after 2009-11-10 15 00 to get products changed after 2009-11-10 15 00 to get all in one table with nulls in columns which do not apply to message or a product
find common things to message and product for example they are both type of a post so you can have something like post table has columns common to all post
message and product tables have only columns specific to each one
1735142
xml-rpc	json-rpc
Pattern(s): 
xml-rpc defines a simple mechanism to specify the arguments and response using xml
soap is a much advanced version of xml-rpc
json-rpc lets you specify the procedure arguments and return values using json javascript object notation
1735350
subclass	abc
Pattern(s): 
if our something method in the abc base class above has a relaxed precondition that permits any integer then all subclasses of abc must also permit any integer
a subclass greenabc is not allowed to add an additional precondition to the something method that requires the parameter to be a positive integer
this would violate the liskov substitution principle requiring more
1736292
std	ostream
Pattern(s): 
the fact is cout is an instance of std ostream which has a lot of functionality built into it which is necessary for interoperability with other classes that overload the iostream operators
edit anyone that says printf is always faster than std cout is simply wrong
i just ran the test code posted by minjang with gcc 4.3.2 and the -o2 flag on a 64-bit amd athlon x2 and cout was actually faster
1736308
cout	cin
Pattern(s): 
besides that it seems normal at least for me that cout is slower than printf because it does more operations
based on my experience in programming competitions printf is faster than cout
i remember many times when my solution didn t make it before the time limit just because of cin cout while printf scanf did work
1736308
cout	cin
Pattern(s): 
i remember many times when my solution didn t make it before the time limit just because of cin cout while printf scanf did work
besides that it seems normal at least for me that cout is slower than printf because it does more operations

1736529
teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 
i haven t tried this recently so do a quick spike first to make sure it works in your environment. alternately it s probably possible and likely elegant in windows powershell 2.0
the automated build part can be done in multiple ways - tfs teamcity what we use cruisecontrol.net etc
that in turn could call a build script in nant again what we use msbuild etc
1738710
phpstorm	aptana
Pattern(s): 
when i was working with codeigniter netbeans would code complete for my static methods in models where aptana wouldn t
since my posting of this jetbrains has released phpstorm and has your rapid fire intellisense as well as even better type hinting
it is absolutely superior to all others imho
1738793
turing	algol
Pattern(s): 
perhaps i have worded this version of my response such that i do not get deleted or voted down to -3.
c++ templates have been shown to be turing powerful
although not a formal reference here s a place to look in that regard i will venture a guess as old as a folkoric and concise cacm proof showing that algol in the 60 s could not be reprsented by a cfg and say that c++ cannot therefore be correctly parsed only by a cfg
1739231
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
for firefox there s an extension called firebug that has dom manipulation a js console and more
webkit used in safari and google-chrome has a built-in web inspector that includes a js debugger along with a dom outline and manipulation tools and a js console

1739895
addition	modulo	addition	modulo
Pattern(s): 
the first modulo gives you a value from -359 to 359
the addition bumps that up to something between 1 and 719
the second modulo brings that back to the range you want 0 through 359
1740756
salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
regarding point 2 using your own salt is straightforward and fully compatible with the auth module and an already existing database
regarding point 3 using a per user salt uniqid by default is not overkill
especially with md5 which is broken for security purposes and where finding collisions is already practical with today s technology
1741199
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
this would be pretty rare ime
i agree that it s occasionally necessary but where possible you should make the document type have appropriate abstract functionality to allow the specialization to be done through inherited rather than the caller having to treat it differently
i would only use the enum approach if different subclassing may share document types but withotu wanting to share an inherited hierarchy
1741976
width	height	width	margin
Pattern(s): 
how would the browser interpret dimension 200px would it mean just 200 width or would it mean 200 x 200px
given we work in a 2 dimensional space then there will only ever be 2 attributes namely width and height
compare this with margin that has four possible parameters
1742153
flot	jqchart
Pattern(s): 
jquery google charts 1.0 jquery chart plugin version 0.1 jqchart tuftegraph
6 jquery chart plugins for your app flot flot is a pure javascript plotting library for jquery
it produces graphical plots of arbitrary datasets on-the-fly client-side
1742977
toolbar	tabs
Pattern(s): 
then you just have to keep a global map of bhos to tabs and a pointer to which is the active tab based on windowstatechanged events
note you can write a toolbar instead of a bho that does the same thing
just depends on if you want ui or not
1743708
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
if not keep the files who have the same file size version and compute their md5 sha1 whatever-you-prefer hash
if the hash is the same you re definitely in presence of the same assembly twice
since assemblies generally aren t very large at most a few megabytes the hash computing should be fast enough
1743929
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 
if you re looking to attract experienced developers you may want to consider using mailing lists just because everyone else does and developers don t want to register for another forum
also mail clients typically have sophisticated filtering that developers can use to filtering out messages and find only the messages that are important unlike what you find in phpbb
if you re just anti-mailman use a google grouping which integrates nicely with other google tools
1744154
simple-html-dom	domparser
Pattern(s): 
no matter how much better their use is for the rest of mankind
simple-html-dom is good but i found it a bit buggy and it is is quite memory heavy will crash on large pages. i have never used querypath so can t comment on its usefulness
another one to try is my domparser which is very light on resources and i ve been using happily for a while
1744378
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
lets say that your program first reads an int with cin x and then a line with getline cin cmdline
the user types an int followed by the enter key
the cin x will read the int but the enter key interpreted as a newline chars will be left in the input buffer
1745125
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
unless the page with the form has https you can make no guarantees about where that form is submission to
it may not actually submit to an https page are you expecting your visitors to view the source or something may have inserted some malicious javascript to redirect the form to somewhere else
however if the form is also https then you know that it hasn t been tampered with
1745311
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
furthermore you should definitely subtract 1 from the number of query managers or else it means you re not properly keeping track of how many query managers you have in the first place
the -1 you see in most code is there because the upper bound of a delphi for-loop is inclusive
loops variable will start at the lower bound and loops will continue running until the variable passes the upper bound
1746127
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
one is system.int32 and the other is yourclass.int32
if you really want to name your property int don t do this you can use the verbatim operator from msdn the prefix enables the use of keywords as identifiers which is useful when interfacing with other programming languages
the chars is not actually part of the identifier so the identifier might be seen in other languages as a normal identifier without the prefix
1746480
freebsd	linux
Pattern(s): 
it s worth reading
i ve been a fan of freebsd for over 15 years after learning about it from admins that were running an isp i worked at
freebsd is legendary for its stability has lots of documentation huge ports collection and it even allows running linux binaries
1746480
freebsd	linux
Pattern(s): 
freebsd is legendary for its stability has lots of documentation huge ports collection and it even allows running linux binaries
i built three servers for my latest project using freebsd and couldn t be happier

1747061
printwriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 
the main reason to use the printwriter is to get access to the printxxx methods like println
you can essentially use a printwriter to write to a file just like you would use system.out to write to the console
a bufferedwriter is an efficient way to write to a file or anything else as it will buffer the characters in java memory before probably depending on the implementation dropping to c to do the writing to the file
1747087
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
of course there are limits to what flowdocument can do so it may not work for your scenario
an extremely flexible option is to create a custom panel that lays out its children in a wrappanel style but does by fitting rectangles and before it starts it marks out any area overlapped by the panel s own siblings as unavailable
such a panel would be used like this this panel would be implemented as follows in arrangeoverride schedule a dispatcher.begininvoke callback to do the actual arranging and report full size used in the callback get rectangles representing all my siblings bounding boxes in my parent s coordinate space
1747092
printwriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 
it would be nice to see bufferedwriter get the same abilities at some point.
printwriter gives more methods println but the most important and worrying difference to be aware of is that it swallows exceptions
you can call checkerror later on to see whether any errors have occurred but typically you d use printwriter for things like writing to the console - or in quick n dirty apps where you don t want to be bothered by exceptions and where long-term reliability isn t an issue
1747128
printwriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 
there is no printreader you have to choose another reader implementation according to the format of your input
printwriter just exposes the print methods on any writer in character mode
bufferedwriter is more efficient than according to its buffered methods. and it comes with a newline method depending of your system platform to manipulate text files correctly
1747128
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 
bufferedwriter is more efficient than according to its buffered methods. and it comes with a newline method depending of your system platform to manipulate text files correctly
the bufferedreader permits to read a text from file with bytes converted in characters
it allows to read line by line
1747999
quicksort	radix-sort
Pattern(s): 
with 2.5m integers in the range 0 0x0fffffff my implementation of radix-sort is about 4 times as fast as your implementation of quick-sort
. a.out quicksort time 0.39 secs radix time 0.09 secs good 2000
evil 0
1748270
atomic	compare-and-swap
Pattern(s): 
if you need something more complicated testing one bit and then setting a different bit you ll have to use the standard compare-and-swap cmpxchg instruction in a retry loop
if you mean testing and modifying a bit as a single atomic operation then the bit test instructions bt bts btr and btc can all be made atomic by using the lock prefix
if you mean testing a bit atomically and then setting a bit atomically as separate operations you can test the bit using a standard atomic read and modifying the bit can be done using lock or lock and lock xor instructions
1748722
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
they are used to represent truth values although other values can also be considered false or true
in numeric contexts for example when used as the argument to an arithmetic operator they behave like the int 0 and 1 respectively
the built-in function bool can be used to cast any value to a boolean if the value can be interpreted as a truth value see section truth value testing above
1748769
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
without the permission of root admin the user cannot craete any folder or directory in root file system
the folder needs admin access

1748935
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
md5 is probably good enough not to worry about collisions if they would only occur accidentally .
but if you ve got security or money at stake and someone could plant a bad file with the same hash as a good file you shouldn t rely on it
personally i d probably just read both files comparing each byte - for a one off comparison both the hashing and this approach will require reading the whole file when they re equal
1751135
bibtex	latex
Pattern(s): 
wish i would have had this in college too as manual formatting of refs always took me a long time and it was annoying as all hell
you should google bibtex mla since bibtex handles references and biblographic information
my first google turned up which shows an mla formatted style that looks correct i was an english major p i wish i would have known about latex in college edit this site looks awesome put in the isbn number and then you can export straight to the bibtex format
1751207
salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
i know the older one old_password in 5 and up is definitely insecure
of course all passwords should always be stored with a salt for further obscurity
example there is also the md5 function but with the rise of colossal rainbow tables it s not 100 reliable as a way of completely obfuscating stored passwords
1751404
division	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction
Pattern(s): 
e.g
there are different instructions for multiplication and division for signed integers
although addition and subtraction remains the same read the wikipedia link and you ll understand
1752167
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
do you have this in your web.config if you do.
this essentially breaks all client-side validation
it s important to note that server-side validation does not automatically keep your page from processing
1752794
post	get
Pattern(s): 
with get there is a commonly agreed on limit of about 1-2 kilobytes depending on browser and server limitations
with post there is no technical limit in the browser but usually one on the server side - see apache s limitrequestbody php s post_max_size and so on

1753040
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
the purpose of the salt is not to be secret
it s purpose is to be different for each hash random and long enough to defeat the use of rainbow tables when an attacker gets his hands on the database
see this excellent post on the subject by thomas ptacek
1753088
atexit	main
Pattern(s): 
obviously this is all rather hackish proceed carefully
atexit is processed by the c c++ runtime crt
it runs after main has already returned
1755526
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 
i ensure that we only apply these rules to textboxes all other input elements behave normally
opera already does a pretty good job of what i was trying to achieve so i don t enforce my rules in that browser - otherwise the user would have to press enter twice
tested in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3.5.5 google-chrome 3.0 safari 4.0.4 opera 10.00
1756183
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
here is a bit of a contrived example there is a loops in the generator that runs from 0 to n and if loops variable is a multiple of 3 it yields the variable
during each iteration of the for-loop the generator is executed
if it is the first time the generator executes it starts at the beginning otherwise it continues from the previous time it yielded
1756222
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
also always use a salt code with your hash
a side note after time has passed using hardened hash is far better than using a plain speed-based hashing function
i.e. hashing over a few hundred iterations or using already proven hashing functions such as bcrypt which is mentioned below i believe
1756971
button	checkbox	button	checkbox	onclick	onchange
Pattern(s): 
one comment of balusc might confirm my assumption in case of radios checkbox the change event is in certain browsers only fired if you click 2 times
try use another event like onclick from tldoc of selectbooleancheckbox onchange is javascript code executed when this element loses focus and its value has been modified since gaining focus. and onclick is javascript code executed when a pointer button is clicked over this element. yesterday was a similar question
one comment of balusc might confirm my assumption in case of radios checkbox the change event is in certain browsers only fired if you click 2 times
1757017
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
i would suggest that you add a test at the start of each of your handlers to skip any processing of files which you don t want to process
the filesystemwatcher watches for changes to all files and folder within a folder including files and folder within sub-directories
if you want to ignore changes to your log files for example it might be a better option to move the log directory to a folder which is not within the path that you are watching
1758303
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
just something to be aware of if you have downstream builds depending on this artifact
the build helper maven plugin attach-artifact goal will tell maven that a particular file should be added to maven s list of artifacts for that project
setting the packaging to pom.xml is the correct thing to do in this situation
1758303
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
setting the packaging to pom.xml is the correct thing to do in this situation
note that if you are running the install goal then your zip file will also be copied to the local maven repository but it will be renamed according to maven conventions
just something to be aware of if you have downstream builds depending on this artifact
1758933
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
to prevent reuse of this urls we are using lighttpd and its mod_secdownload that allows you to generate a hash that is valid for the specified amount of time
nginx has x-accel-redirect and apache has mod_xsendfile
if you decide to implement a separate lightweight web server there are other benefits as well mainly lower memory consumption while serving static files and faster response times
1759166
post	get
Pattern(s): 
if you are asking how do you post and reuse the same view as a get and run javascript only on the post than the short answer is you don t
you will want to use a different view for the post that has the additional javascript that needs to be run
you can reuse most of your view code through partial page views
1759830
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
so you may be out of luck unless you upgrade to gcc-4.3 or higher
check if your gcc versioning has -wshorten-64-to-32
be prepared for a deluge of possibly spurious double - float conversion warnings if you use floating-point in your code
1760014
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
this should run into an exception or an infinite loops because the first loops makes sure that there is still a top variable that isn t null and then it directs it to the second loops that goes from 0 k
there are a few issues with this the brackets should be better formatted the first look lead me to believe a mismatch your check for the null case should be in the middle of the for-loop you need a method to check to make sure that there is an item that you can pop
as the other answer states there is an off by one error if you wish to pop up to k items then the condiction should be i k
1760924
atomic	interlocked
Pattern(s): 
you ll want something like this pshared- goo 14 pshared- atomic.setbit_release without a write barrier here in the producer you have no guarantee that the hardware isn t going to get to the atomic store before the goo store has made it through the cpu store queues and up through the memory hierarchy where it is visible even if you have a mechanism that ensures the compiler orders things the way you want
in the consumer if pshared- atomic.compareandswap_acquire 1 1 v pshared- goo without a read barrier here you won t know that the hardware hasn t gone and fetched goo for you before the atomic access is complete
the atomic ie memory manipulated with the interlocked functions doing stuff like lock cmpxchg is only atomic with respect to itself not other memory
1761228
pbkdf2	hash
Pattern(s): 
you can see other standard names for secret key factories in the java crypto architecture standard names documentation
pbkdf2 is a function defined in pkcs #5 used to derive key material from a password
pbkdf2 requires a pseudo-random function and in this case a message authentication code based on the sha-1 hash is used mdash
1763557
jstl	trinidad
Pattern(s): 
uel - you didn t ask but it s important - unified expression language - the set of rules for your # .. expressions
jsf-api are the interfaces and classes in javax.faces jstl is a standard set of tags used primarily in jsp - most of them are replaced with jsf-tags btw facelets is a presentation and templating framework like jsp myfaces is an implementation of the jsf standard
the other possibility if jsf ri reference implementation trinidad and tobago are component libraries - some goodies that aren t included in the default set of jsf components jsp is the alternative to facelets or vice versa which is as well a presentation framework
1765255
.htaccess	httpd.conf
Pattern(s): 
your main httpd.conf has likely set a default for the allowoverride directive to none
this is a restrictive set of permissions that improves performance and security but it means that apache completely ignores any .htaccess files
you need to enable allowoverride for your serving directory either in the main apache config file or inside the virtualhost directive
1765938
many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 
we had the same situation as you and went with a many-to-many design to store one-to-many data against a future date when we d need to store many to many
over time it mutated into imho a hideous kludge as what hindsight shows to have been individual many-to-many relationship requirements came in and for generally reasonable reasons quick work-arounds were implemented
now that we ve reached the point where we have to build it out not only do we have to refactor the system as we planned we have to unravel and account for all the interim kludges as well
1766808
gentoo	ubuntu
Pattern(s): 
be warned gentoo is not a drop dead simple distro to use ubuntu -- you have to understand a bit about how the os works -- but it does provide an excellent developerment environment
as nick stinemates mentioned gentoo is an excellent distro for developing java
it is one of the few distros that i know of that has a very active java maintainer group and almost everything that people use regularly is already packaged
1767044
ilist	icollection
Pattern(s): 
what is slightly inconsistent is that the generic ilist t interface has an isreadonly property inherited from icollection t whose semantics are therefore different from the non-generic ilist.isreadonly
i imagine the designers were aware of this inconsistency but were unable to go back and change the semantics of the non-generic ilist for backwards compatibility reasons
to summarize an ilist can be variable-size
1767222
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
if this is sitting in a data template the datacontext of the border element will be the contained object and the border trigger will fire when highlighted property of the content assuming content is a class with a highlighted boolean property is true
if your content is an int and you want the trigger to fire when it is greater than zero you will have to use where the greaterthanzeroconverter is a suitable value converter

1767552
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
anyway hope this proves useful for another spriter to be
edit after a bit of additional testing this in fact only happens in mozilla firefox platform independent
safari and ie interpret multiple references to the same image and make a single request while firefox appears to make a unique request for each image linked to via css
1767552
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
safari and ie interpret multiple references to the same image and make a single request while firefox appears to make a unique request for each image linked to via css
i realize its probably not specificly understood as a bug but in an era where browsers are competing for being labeled the fastest -- seems like a potential improvement for firefox

1768086
inherited	properties	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
a static method cannot rely on context can t rely on a specific instance of a class can t rely on the this keyword therefore this would not be a static method this would be an example of a static method but there s absolutely no sense in making getname static because as the name implies it must rely on an object instance to determine what the name properties is you should have more generic helper functions like parsing functions such as date.parse as static methods and define instance methods in the prototype as they re more efficient than defining in the constructor
the difference is in the latter example you re creating a static method which is not inherited if example is a constructor function
by defining properties in the prototype properties of a constructor function and creating objects with the new keyword the newly created objects inherit the prototype of the constructor and thus have access to those methods
1768520
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 
perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn
perforce non-free offers a lot of features and tools
i heard google uses it
1769144
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
i believe safari and chrome do too
the regular expression engine in firefox compiles some not all
regular expressions to machine code
1771577
appfuse	spring
Pattern(s): 
add spring security to your project with just one line of code
my notes on appfuse and roo appfuse is a fully working template application project
traditional dao - service - controller architecture easy to get started with maven archetypes great documentation and tutorials not really up to date
1774432
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
i use this to double the size of arrays the high-water mark
find the closest 32bit unsigned int that is larger than x
i use this to double the size of arrays the high-water mark
1774881
accessor	properties	inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
so you ll find yourself checking the call tree more often than usual to check which implementations are applicable to the code you are working on
so all these properties accessor that would have been inline will be real calls now
thx to inlining simple properties will not add real overhead at runtime
1776094
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
the project directory is available as
try to use relative pathes where applicable so that you can copy or move your project folder without breaking the post-build action

1777077
magento	oscommerce
Pattern(s): 
other options to consider are oscommerce bigcartel cubecart ablecommerce
magento magento is certainly the market leader at the moment
their software offers the basic products customers sales product categories tags reviews and adds some excellet additional features such as being able to control multiple websites search engine friendly urls by default customer newsletters and a huge selection of payment options
1777391
googletest	gmock	googletest	gmock
Pattern(s): 
once i have regaled him with the joys of gmock at accu 2010 i hope he ll embrace it -
googletest is very similar in usage to xunit
gmock is by far th best mocking framework for c++
1777759
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
but the benefit is that it will ensure that each insert will keep its integrity
innodb maintains referential integriry
myisam does not
1777876
folder	dir
Pattern(s): 
readme says its python 2.5 so you need python 2.x series i have created a folder c test i have downloaded all files from css-py svn to c test so c test css and c test uri folders exists now
i have downloaded ply s tar gz file and extract only ply folder into c test css so c test css ply folder exists now
i have created test.py in c test with the content from css.parse import parse print dir parse and i run it and the results is like this without import errors hope this helps
1778066
strstr	substr	strstr	substr
Pattern(s): 
if s2 is within s1 it returns a pointer within s1 to the beginning of the substr otherwise returns null
many c runtime libraries contain the function strstr const char s1 const char s2
if s2 is within s1 it returns a pointer within s1 to the beginning of the substr otherwise returns null
1778916
hash	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
government applications will be required to move to the sha-2 family of hash functions by 2010. 8 i think one major problem with it is that there are rainbow tables of md5 hashes all over these days so bare md5 is very susceptible to brute forcing
consider it a useful tool for minor obsfucation and sanitizing complex data sets but it is not a truly secure hash any more
there may be special hoops that you can jump through like both using a salt and performing nested md5 hashings to make it more secure though i m no cryptographer
1779580
operands	decrement	operands	decrement
Pattern(s): 
however i m not sure that the evaluation order is defined so you might have to move the decrement outside the expression
this only works if the first operands is larger than zero but at least it s short and confusing
however i m not sure that the evaluation order is defined so you might have to move the decrement outside the expression
1779946
plpgsql	plpython	plpgsql	plpython
Pattern(s): 
external languages are used when you need some functionality like access to net access to filesystem - what i know - people usually use a combination of pl languages - sql plpgsql plperl or sql plpgsql plpython
plpgsql is very well integrated with sql - the source code should be very clean and readable
for sql languages like pljava or plpython sql statements have to be isolated - sql isn t part of language
1782787
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
Pattern(s): 
in your case this means that there will never be any use for case insensitive get id
quoting note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal
1782787
equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal
the behavior of a sorted map is well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals
it just fails to obey the general contract of the map interface
1782818
showwindow	postmessage
Pattern(s): 
null iswindowvisible wkb postmessage wkb wm_deskband_clicked 0 0
the showwindow function is implemented similarly but it will also start the keyboard if it is not running
update it seems that this inter-process messaging is disallowed in windows vista 7
1782986
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
in your case you don t want to do exactly the same thing to each element - and thus a foreach loops is not the right tool for the job
trying to hack it into doing this is silly just use an explicit iterator in a classic for-loop

1783640
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
in other words as your inherited properties have a different meaning than the properties you get from interfaces you have to access them differently
therefore you could access through reflection like this since class inherited is different than interface compliance it seems logical to access them differently

1784556
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
however i just want to let you know that calling html.renderpartial inside a loops is not efficient
asp.net mvc - for-loop inside renderpartial or outside renderpartial changing it to something like below would be better

1785126
entities	entitymanager
Pattern(s): 
if the entity does not become detached because its entitymanager is closed all changes done to the entity are reflected to the database when the session is flushed closed and the transaction commited
from the java ee tutorial the state of persistent entities is synchronized to the database when the transaction with which the entity is associated commits
edit for clarity and explanation so there are three distinct modes that an entity could be in during its lifecycle unsaved the entity has been instantiated but persist has not been called yet

photoshop	fireworks
Pattern(s): 
don t know if you can keep most of the eye-candy in photoshop and then assemble reamble versions with ease using fireworks
i ve checked the jsx photoshop object model and you can access layercomps but there is no magic function to save from one file to another
something like this could be written to disk from file1.psd for example then loaded into file2.psd
1786935
vim	emacs	vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
emacs requires more contortions and hurts my hands
this will sound stupid but i use vim because the keyboard shortcuts are mostly one finger at a time if not you can shift with one hand and key with the other and i map esc to something easier
emacs requires more contortions and hurts my hands
1786996
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
they are both very powerful and they are both quite capable of doing most anything you want
that said over the years i ve tended toward vim because i find that it s harder for me to get lost in it s user interface when i can t remember what i m doing
i have also noticed over time that emacs is a little more touchy when it comes to tty settings
1787965
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
so it won t overflow a 9-byte string buffer
see each directive is composed of one of the following...an optional non-zero decimal int that specifies the maximum field width
s matches a sequence of bytes that are not white-space chars
1788318
post	get
Pattern(s): 
i guess you can pass any partial download entity you get from your web framework
adding to paxdiablo post tar is a very difficult and complex file format despite its apparent simplicity
you can check basic constraint but if you have to support all the possible existing tar dialects you are going to waste a lot of time
1788559
textinput	textfield
Pattern(s): 
picture of this issue can be viewed at view screen shot
steps to reproduce textinput creates dynamically as mention in the creation when we exceed the limit it shows error my red color border and the same time if you delete them by del key when it come to the given acceptable limit automatically become to green soon
leave from the field and change values of another textinput this is just a textinput this is a form there are some more form elemets then come back to value exceeded textfield by shift+tabs and remove the additional entered numbers when you come to green soon your value is accepted
1788727
actionscript	haxe	actionscript	haxe
Pattern(s): 
long answer haxe
short answer no actionscript 3 is client-side since flash is client-side technology
long answer haxe
1792370
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	greenplum
Pattern(s): 
check out
you ll find that postgresql works a lot better for nearly any workload olap especially than mysql
greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases
1793219
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 
a loop isn t really appropriate here because the settimeout function is asynchronous
a system of callbacks is best for a finite number of runs and a setinterval system is best for an unknown amount of runs
to me your number of runs should be the number of elements in your jquery object the ones that are currently going through your .each i would suggest that you do something like the following generalized example of your question generalized since i don t have access to your dom
1793698
textblock	itemscontrol	textblock	itemscontrol
Pattern(s): 
in the inner itemscontrol you can simply bind like this - now you can bind the inner textblock s text property to an appropriate property of what ever objects are found in the ruleengineparts collection
first of all i don t think the datainput label control is needed here a simple textblock with a binding on its text property would work just as well without the extra baggage
in the inner itemscontrol you can simply bind like this - now you can bind the inner textblock s text property to an appropriate property of what ever objects are found in the ruleengineparts collection
1794378
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
instead of you could write personally i think a getproperty is a poor candidate for throwing exception-handling just for all this extra boilerplate required
you have to put a try-catch around each statement
there is no continue like there is in on error .
1794474
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
Pattern(s): 
it can be read back in use an objectinputstream
using an objectoutputstream you can write the object directly into the file
this writes the object obj out to the file
1794930
valgrind	callgrind	valgrind	callgrind
Pattern(s): 
valgrind is a superb method for finding memory leaks and the callgrind extension makes for a good profiler
note i just learned that valgrind now also works on mac osx
however callgrind and kcachegrind haven t been updated since 2005
1795070
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	direct2d	direct3d	direct2d	direct3d	gdi	direct3d	directwrite	gdi	directdraw	gdi	direct2d	gdi	direct2d	gdi	directwrite	directdraw	direct2d	directdraw	direct2d
Pattern(s): 
direct2d is designed to be fast with support for hardware acceleration through compatible graphics cards
it provides high quality immediate rendering of 2d graphics while maintaining interoperability with gdi gdi+ and direct3d directdraw
internet explorer 9 and firefox will use direct2d and directwrite for better performance
1795899
int	double
Pattern(s): 
where orientation is a radian double value
you may want to round the result since int is a brutal way to convert to int
if you want to pick a point x y that is atleast distance d from point px py then you know that the hypotenuse squareroot x-px 2 + y-py 2 is less than d 2
1795967
preorder	postorder
Pattern(s): 
annotate these functions which some information on how they should be applied
a preorder function should be applied from top to bottom first transform the root of the expression tree then recurse
a postorder function should be applied to an expression after it has been recursively applied to subexpressions
1796989
bash	subshell
Pattern(s): 
but then bash does not claim to be posix compliant
this is a feature of the bash shell
the bash manual entry states this clearly each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process in a subshell
1797373
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
haskell is the obvious one here
in particular if you want batteries included you want the haskell platform
ocaml fits this category as well
1797747
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
from the comments it seems that the second and third methods of event handling are valid in both as1 and as2
the syntax of handling events are different actionscript 3 actionscript 2 actionscript 1 you might find this page helpful migrating from as2 to as3 as3 way of adding a new children is new followed by addchild it used to be createmovieclip and createtextfield methods earlier - not sure about exact version though
earlier if you had the name property of a child you could access the child from the parent using parent.childname even if the parent class didn t have a property called childname
1799041
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
consider a much more familar such relationship - here mysubclass inherits dosomething from superclass
the above though is broken because the superclass doesn t have a default constructor
also parameterised constructor of superclass is not inherited by subclassing
1799165
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 
you do have to be careful because if foo was say an integer integer division would be performed and then the result would be stored in halffoo
i think it is good practice to always use floating-point literals 2.0 or 2
wherever you intend for them to be used as floating-point values
1799202
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 
this behavior should be used with caution as unintended consequences can arise
data can be lost when floating-point representations are converted to integral representations as the fractions components of the floating-point values will be truncated rounded down
conversely converting from an integral representation to a floating-point one can also lose precision since the floating-point type may be unable to represent the integer exactly for example float might be an ieee 754 single precision type which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly while a 32-bit integer type can
1799830
std	ostream	std	ostream
Pattern(s): 
use std count to count the number of elements which is equal to some value or std count_if to count the elements which satisfies some predicate if you just want to copy the contents of a container to an ostream object like std cout use std copy instead if you need the return value from each invocation of the function use std transform std transform is also overloaded so it works for binary functions as well as unary functions
std for_each isn t designed for that
use std count to count the number of elements which is equal to some value or std count_if to count the elements which satisfies some predicate if you just want to copy the contents of a container to an ostream object like std cout use std copy instead if you need the return value from each invocation of the function use std transform std transform is also overloaded so it works for binary functions as well as unary functions
1802349
opencv	emgucv
Pattern(s): 
you should probably go with emgucv which is a much better c# wrapper for opencv
it is actively developed and is compatible with opencv 2.0 and has a wider community surrounding it and the documentation is good enough that you can easily get face detection working pretty quickly

1802548
expression-blend	silverlight
Pattern(s): 
i also believe the component is not available any longer
expression-blend is almost entirely written in c# wpf
there is also at least one text editor component under development not sure if it is already available from a commercial third party actipro which is supposedly going to be available in silverlight and wpf versions
1803354
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 
imho its much better to give the user - paging - intelligent filtering possibilities instead of showing million of results and then in case of cdo connected data objects the filtering happens on the server using their new query-api
indeed sorting is not possible for a virtual-treeviewer whether you use a istructuredcontentprovider or a lazy one as noted in this thread you will have to do the sorting yourself in your model
the underlying assumption is that the elements might not even be in memory
1804525
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 
complexity o lg lg x |multiplication| - generating and iterating over l takes lg lg x iterations and multiplication is the most expensive operation in an iteration
you can do better than repeated division which takes o lg x |division| time
essentially you do a binary search on powers of 3
1804868
teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 
also you ask about a maven replacement - it won t handle dependencies like maven does
for continuous integration and creating builds teamcity is nice and free for smaller operations up to 3 build agents
it s powerful supports nant and friends msbuild out of the box and it s best feature is ease of use and configuration
1807404
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 
the closing delimiter possibly followed by a semicolon must also be followed by a newline
you have spaces after eod
as stated in the manual it is very important to note that the line with the closing identifier must contain no other characters except possibly a semicolon
1808604
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
set up three fields old password new password new password again then check if the first field after md5 hashing is equal to the stored one in the db
if it is hash the second field and store it
only if the second and third is equal
1808748
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
you re using md5 hashes but if you look at the linked articles you will see that md5 alone is not enough and one can easily pick most of your passwords back if they have your database
for a quick test just throw an md5 hash into google and you will see that unless your password is really wicked you will get it back
for a better approach you d need the md5hash and a salt for each password but i m better pointing you to read the linked article enough with the rainbow tables what you need to know about secure password schemes than trying to explain it here
1809263
ocp	principles
Pattern(s): 
if you are that concerned about the open closed principles on your startup routine go with decentralizing it
but your adherence to ocp can be dialed down in exchange for the value of all your bootstrapping done in one place
another option would be to have the bootstrapper scan certain assemblies for registries assuming automapper has such a concept
1809283
config	ini
Pattern(s): 
you can load the config from a simple array from an ini style file or from an xml document
whichever you choose the config object is the same so you can switch storage formats freely
zend_config objects can also be merged depending on your application this may be useful a server config then a per site installation config
1809753
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
this is necessary if the class is in a header file that different source files are going to use so the language tries to be helpful
inline is also a hint to the compiler that the function could usefully be inline but despite the name that s optional
the more sophisticated your compiler is the better it is able to make its own decisions about inlining and the less need it has for hints
1810235
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
it s easier to check that they are truly symmetric
i also try to abstract the versioning handling directly in my serializable framework + a few other things because dry should be adhered to on error-handling to ease error-detection i usually use a pair of markers special bytes to separate one object from another
it allows me to immediately throw during deserialization because i can detect a problem of desynchronization of the stream ie somewhat ate too much bytes or did not ate sufficiently
1811677
inline	inlining	inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
in project options under delphi compiler - compiling - code generation turn code inlining control to auto
be aware though that this should only be on a release build since inline code is difficult to debug
also you said that you don t mind making your program larger as long as it gets faster but that often inlining makes it slower
1812067
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
one limitation in mysql to be aware of is that a single table cannot be over 4gb in size using the myisam database engine
innodb does not have that limitation that i m aware of

1812275
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
then check the affected_rows
if no rows were affected then check the hash
if the hash is different then presumably the query failed to update due to the md5 check
1812538
logarithm	modulo
Pattern(s): 
output 6 16 26 36 46 obviously this will take a long time if the modulo is large
more information is on the discrete logarithm page
note no efficient classical algorithm for computing general discrete logarithms logbg is known
1812932
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
however the reverse is not true
writing data into the array member of your union and then reading it as an int can potentially create a trap representation and lead to undefined behavior
the potential danger exists even if your chars array has sufficient length to cover the entire int
1812932
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
the potential danger exists even if your chars array has sufficient length to cover the entire int
but in your specific case if int happens to be larger than the int you read will cover uninitialized area beyond the end of the array which again leads to undefined behavior

1817840
super	self
Pattern(s): 
since super cls cls .do_your_stuff is called inside b.do_your_stuff you end up calling b.do_your_stuff in an infinite loop
in python3 the 0-argument form of super was added so super b cls could be replaced by super and python3 will figure out from context that super in the definition of class b should be equivalent to super b cls
but in no circumstance is super cls cls or for similar reasons super type self self ever correct
1819248
int	double
Pattern(s): 
now change your program to assign that value and print the result thats the max value an unsigned int can hold shown in base 10 representation
now do that for long s shorts and any other int value you re curious about
nb this approach will not work for floating point numbers double or float
1819602
min	max
Pattern(s): 
if you have little experience with a specific developer one of my fondly regarded previous managers would ask the developer himself to do the estimate and set the initial deadline a third of the distance between that developer s min and max challenging the developer to beat it
if you are estimating for a specific developer and you know your estimates are generally accurate for that developer then the min value is the logical deadline initially
in the course of the project you will adjust deadlines according to circumstance
1822328
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
you can generally do more on the data side to improve locality of reference protect against false sharing two frequently-used pieces of data that will try to use the same part of the cache while other parts remain unused
edit to make some points a bit more explicit a typical cpu has a number of different caches
a modern desktop processors will typically have at least 2 and often 3 levels of cache
1823380
glut	sdl
Pattern(s): 
there are lots of tutorials around the web to help get you started
doing some opengl with glut is a good place to start in my opinion as it allows you to do both 2d and 3d graphics
if you want another layer to help you with various parts of game programming keyboard and mouse events sound etc.. you can use sdl with opengl
1826126
temporary	tablespace
Pattern(s): 
if the temporary tablespace you want to shrink is your default temporary tablespace you may have to first create a new temporary tablespace set it as the default temporary tablespace then drop your old default temporary tablespace and recreate it
afterwards drop the second temporary table created. 3 for oracle 9i and higher you could just drop the tempfile s and add a new one s everything is described here in great detail
see this link it was already linked but maybe you missed it so here it is again
1829218
post	get
Pattern(s): 
see for an explanation of the various http request verbs
run the -d option means that the request will be made with post
this is because by following the link above you are by default issuing a get request
1829364
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
indeed for lazy languages this simplistic approach can even get you the best complexity possible for the k smallest greatest sorted with maximum minimum as a special case if your sort is lazy enough
quicksort works well in this scenario whereas the default sort in haskell merge sort doesn t compose quite as well as it does more work than strictly necessary to return each element of the sorted list
as this post on the haskell mailing list notes lazy quicksort is able to produce the batch of the first k smallest elements in o n + k log k total time 1 while lazy mergesort needs o n + k log n total time 2 for more you might like to read this blog post
1831872
subobject	instances
Pattern(s): 
upcasting to base2 modifies the pointer so that it points to the memory location that can be directly be interpreted as a base2 instances so the contents of a pointer memory location of type base2 pointing to an object of type derived will not coincide with a pointer of type derived into the same object
at this point if a virtual method from base2 is called the system must perform some magic to recalculate the correct position of the implicit this argument that is handed into the derived method_from2 virtual method that must point back to the whole derived object and not just the base2 subobject

1834444
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 
in this case though colcodelist is supposed to be different when values are equals
this means that in cases where you want 2 objects to be considered equals they are more likely to have different hash codes which is incorrect
take that out of the gethashcode method and everything should work
1837668
internationalization	translation
Pattern(s): 
you can then update text by clicking on it
you can also use the locale internationalization stuff
a handy tool is the inline translater - this can be turned on via system - configuration - developer - translation inline
1840515
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
i ve used and liked both
postgresql is an excellent open source database that can be used with java python ruby .net and more
you can easily find lots of comparisons of postgresql versus mysql
1840694
ilist	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
Pattern(s): 
so realistically in this instance returning ilist or iqueryable has no significant difference
one of the most important aspects when thinking of sql and linq is that returning ilist means that the query has been executed
returning iqueryable keeps open the option of deferring the sql execution later so you could potentially build on the query outside of this method
1841819
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
you might check out a standard password hash such as crypt on unix systems
this allows for you to change out the hash algorithm and can even support versioning
but again a simple hash + salt is good enough for most applications
1843149
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
the list implementation heap2 1 i assume that heap2 1 is supposed to check whether its sole argument is a list representing a heap stored as an array or ahnentafel list
if so then assuming a zero-indexed list the children of a node at index i are found at indices 2i + 1 and 2i + 2
as a result a parent node is not necessarily stored right next to its child nodes
1843547
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 
as dan pointed out below testng did this originally
junit 4 provides very useful annotations
here s a tutorial illustrating the usage of annotations to define tests
1843987
invokelater	invokeandwait
Pattern(s): 
invokeandwait same as above but the actual thread blocks until the runnable was executed after pending events by the edt that is the command following the invokeandwait will only get started after the submitted runnable was executed
invokelater runs the runnable in the event dispatch thread which also is used for updating the gui
your sleep is blocking this thread so the gui also does not get serviced no updates can be done till you return from the invokelater code
1844068
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
major upgrade can be implemented as in this answer
it does about the same as your sample code except that it makes use of preprocessor variables to keep the versioning consistent between the product element and the upgradeversion element
it also prevents downgrades
1846939
profiler	visualvm	profiler	visualvm
Pattern(s): 
all java profilers that i ve ever seen support this including visualvm which comes with recent jdks in the bin directory
fortunately that does not matter since java has always well for a long time anyway supported remote profiling the profiler can run on a different machine than the jvm being profiled and get its data via the network
all java profilers that i ve ever seen support this including visualvm which comes with recent jdks in the bin directory
1848647
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
it s one of the reasons that old-style classes should be avoided multiple inherited with diamond-like patterns just doesn t work sensibly with them while it does with new-style
the crucial difference between resolution order for legacy vs new-style classes comes when the same ancestor class occurs more than once in the naive depth-first approach -- consider a diamond inherited case here legacy-style the resolution order is d - b - a - c - a so when looking up d.x a is the first base in resolution order to solve it thereby hiding the definition in c
while here new-style the order is with a forced to come in resolution order only once and after all of its subclassing so that overrides c s override of member x actually work sensibly
1848647
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
while here new-style the order is with a forced to come in resolution order only once and after all of its subclassing so that overrides c s override of member x actually work sensibly
it s one of the reasons that old-style classes should be avoided multiple inherited with diamond-like patterns just doesn t work sensibly with them while it does with new-style

1848720
many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 
update this isn t nhibernate magic but there s nothing to stop you from using a join class that is private or otherwise hidden and then exposing the properties of the join class from your main classes
as far as i know many-to-many is only used for using a typical two column join table
given that you want to add properties to the relationship you would be better off mapping it as two separate one-to-many relationships with a join class well it s more than that because it has its own properties but you know what i mean
1848762
int	double
Pattern(s): 
that is dbl_max or approximately 1.8 10 308 if your double is an ieee 754 64-bit double
it s an int
it s represented exactly
1849578
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	timsort
Pattern(s): 

if the answer is yes it switches from quicksort to heapsort
timsort combines merge sort with insertion sort and performs very well on sorted or reverse-sorted data and on data that includes sorted or reverse-sorted subsets
1851332
wordpress	joomla	wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 
besides joomla you can also look into other cms but i d say joomla fits best to the criteria you mentioned
wordpress was originally a blogging engine and that s what is still mostly is
drupal is another great free php cms but if you want ease-of-use then joomla wins over drupal
1851789
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
update i put together a simple example
what i usually do is to add a dummy child node wherever there may be children that should be loaded in a lazy manner
this will make the parent have the plus sign and then you can add code to the afterexpand event where you do the following check if there are are exactly one child and if that child is the dummy node you can use the tag property to identify the dummy node if the dummy node is found launch a search to get the children and add them to the parent node finish it off by removing the dummy node
1852384
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 
here are some wikipedia references one s complement two s complement binary hexadecimal signed number representations
hex is easy
simply separate into 4 bit groups and convert each group to decimal
1853219
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 
because some critical applications will require guarantees of speed performance heapsort is the right way to go for such cases
one of the major factors is that quicksort has better locality of reference -- the next thing to be accessed is usually close in memory to the thing you just looked at
by contrast heapsort jumps around significantly more
1853219
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 
by contrast heapsort jumps around significantly more
since things that are close together will likely be cached together quicksort tends to be faster
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is
1853586
turing	decidable
Pattern(s): 
wikipedia defines them as follows a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set also called a decidable recursive or turing computable set if there is a turing machine that given a number n halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set
a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or turing computable function if there is a turing machine that on input n halts and returns output f n
in this context a recursive function does not mean a function in a programming language that calls itself
1853738
floating-point	fractions
Pattern(s): 
you should store the numbers in string form or as scaled integers
if it s absolutely important that the numbers be stored in the form they were in the file don t use floating-point values
not all fractions base-10 values can be represented exactly in binary
1853738
floating-point	fractions
Pattern(s): 
not all fractions base-10 values can be represented exactly in binary
for details you should consult the article what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic pdf link
you should store the numbers in string form or as scaled integers
1855250
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
using chars for int is really only useful when you have a lot of numbers a large array and you need to conserve space
another con i can think of is that as far as i know modern processors do all their math in full int generally 32 bits
so dealing with a chars usually means pulling a single byte out of memory filling up with 0 s in transferring to a register doing something with it and then squeezing only the least significant bits of the result back into memory
1855254
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
this means that when calculations on other types are performed although the calculation itself will take the same length of time depending on the available instruction set extra work may have to be done to read inputs and to coerce calculation results into the target type sign-extending zero-filling shifting masking to avoid unaligned memory accesses etc
this is why c defines types and operations as it does - the size of int is not mandated by the standard allowing compiler authors to make it correspond to a machine word and expression evaluation is defined to promote smaller int types to int greatly reducing the number of points at which results must be coerced to some target type
valid reasons to use chars for storing int values are when the space really matters that much not as often as you might think and when describing some external data format protocol that you are marshalling data to from
1856450
nginx	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
so what you have to do instead is use a server module such as for lighttpd which implements the upload_progress view for you on the server
or for nginx

1856558
expression-blend	silverlight
Pattern(s): 
as silverlight is kind of platform independent and as it s model is similar to wpf i predict wpf is going to rule at least for next 6 7 years if not a decade
i believe and hope ms would make things much more easier for the programmers so that learning curve would be shortened or delegated to gui artiists using expression-blend
hope i answered your question
1857438
accurev	svn
Pattern(s): 
it integrates svn with bugzilla and imposes rules such as in order to commit you have to enter a message in order to commit you must have entered a bugzilla id that is in a valid commit state. .
and so on you can build your own rules to your heart s content accurev seems to be marketware to me .
lousy gui client .
1857438
perforce	accurev
Pattern(s): 
you have to pay for it
ah yes if you do use it i hope that you do not have to replicate your server between some place in the us and some place in india perforce is more robust but it is not very easy to administer
in any case it is a superior product in comparison to accurev
1858633
voip	sip
Pattern(s): 
the software is not too difficult to develop
i would recommend you shop around for components and just integrate because voip is rather complex
here is a link for sip communicator in java which supports voip

try-catch	exception-handling	try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
the sound advice is never call code that could throw an exception-handling in cleanup code such as destructors and any function that might be called from a destructor such as cleanup close or release_something
the original poster also queries the performance of try-catch
early in the adoption of c++ exception-handling exception-handling handling code was reasonably expensive
1859033
virtualenv	setuptools
Pattern(s): 
setuptools distutils distros can include scripts that will be installed to usr bin so that s how you can include your runapp script
if you re not familiar with virtualenv i suggest you take a look at that as well
it is a way to create isolated python environments it will be very useful for testing your distro
1859178
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
you could use sorteddictionary which is also idictionary providing a custom icomparer and get o log n lookup time instead of o 1 that dictionary ideally can provide
you can use custom equality comparisons with dictionary by providing an implementation of iequalitycomparer
however dictionary is a hash map and needs a mapping from every key to the same integer hash which makes it less useful in your case
1859178
dictionary	map	icomparer	idictionary
Pattern(s): 
however dictionary is a hash map and needs a mapping from every key to the same integer hash which makes it less useful in your case
you could use sorteddictionary which is also idictionary providing a custom icomparer and get o log n lookup time instead of o 1 that dictionary ideally can provide

1860817
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
there is a finite amount of numbers that can be stored in a double variable and 33222221 is not one of them
when you attach a debugger and inspect the values you will see that the value of d is actually 33222220.999999996 which is correctly truncated to 33222220 when converted to int
there is a finite amount of numbers that can be stored in a double variable and 33222221 is not one of them
1861465
short	base
Pattern(s): 
ln val is the natural log that is inverse to e val
my calculator says that b is about equal to -0.0021202920156806272577911119053782 or perhaps -0.0021 would work best in short
if you want to solve this for other exponent base use exponent logarithm identities in the same fashion to solve for any other base and to change the base of the logarithm to ln log in js or log log math.log10e in js
1861922
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
so you ll have to weight the pros and cons but inlining is not one of the cons
as others have already pointed out the compiler is free to do as it likes and if the functions are big it will most likely not inline them
however there are other reasons why you might not want too much code in the header files
1862146
trac	bugzilla	trac	mantis
Pattern(s): 
see for example bugzilla and mantis which eric seppanen elaborates on more in his answer
trac integrates very well with subversion and is great overall
i have it running on 2003 and 2008 server
1862152
viewmodel	caliburn
Pattern(s): 
you might take a look at caliburn
it has a system for handling this where a viewmodel is aware of all sub view models and this enables it to automatically chain things forward
in particular there is an interface called isupportcustomshutdown i think that s what it s called that helps mitigate this problem
1862916
assemblyinfo	csproj
Pattern(s): 
transformed all file references to links pointing to the original sources
copied and modified each assemblyinfo file to contain uses of internalsvisibletoattribute with a strong name
modified each csproj file so that the snk file reference is a relative path removes the need to copy the snk file to each project i first did all of this manually but then realized that this can be automated in a straightforward manner
1863484
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
the question is why considering their erased signatures are not override-equivalent
when compiling class derived the compiler actually emits two methods the method printarg derivedarg and a synthetic method printarg basearg which overrides the superclass method in terms even a virtual machine ignorant of type parameters can understand and delegates to printarg derivedarg
you can verify this by throwing an exception in printart derivedarg while calling it on a reference of type base and examining the stack trace as for finding this in the java language specification i first missed it as well as it is not as one might expect specified where overriding or the subsignature relation is discussed but in members and constructors of parameterized types 4.5.2 which reveals that formal type parameters of the superclass are syntactically replaced by the actual type parameter in the subclassing prior to checking for override equivalence
1864012
textmate	bbedit
Pattern(s): 
it s a tad bit pricey less so than bbedit but more than xcode which is free but it s a really nice editor just the same
if you re stuck on pre-snow leopard you might try using textmate as your editor
it will automatically insert matching braces and supports versions of os x back to 10.4
1865524
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
one way to perform what you need is to make the else clause part of the for-loop
beware that an else in a for-loop is tricky
the else part of a for-loop executes at the end of loops only if no break was called in loops
1866710
sequence	permutation
Pattern(s): 
then you use bijective bit operations then when you output your list you iterate x from 0 to m-1 and output l p x only if p x is actually n
a true unbiased random solution can be constructed by fixing a cryptographically strong block cipher aes and a random key k and then iterating the sequence aes k 0 aes k 1 ... and outputting the corresponding item from the sequence iff aes k i n
this can be done in constant space the internal memory required by the cipher and is indistinguishable from a random permutation due to the cryptographic properties of the cipher but is obviously very slow
1866788
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 
windows in-box defragmentation does not. thus a fat file id can change over time
renaming a file in the fat filesystems can also change the file id but only if the new file name is longer than the old one
in the ntfs filesystems a file keeps the same file id until it is deleted . you can replace one file with another file without changing the file id by using the replacefile function. however the file id of the replacement file not the replaced file is retained as the file id of the resulting file
1870093
datamapper	activerecord
Pattern(s): 
the database schema is always ignorant of the objects that use it. since it s a form of mapper 473 data mapper itself is even unknown to the domain layer
the datamapper pattern is intended to provide a layer that allows the domain object model to diverge from the schema
activerecord unifies the object model and the relational database structure
1870856
wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 
from personal experience i also know joomla but i m not sure whether i d recommend it to get started with - it tends to be a bit dirty on the code side sometimes
wordpress is successfully used as a cms by many
look around on so what systems people are happy with
1871889
nullpointerexception	indexoutofboundsexception
Pattern(s): 
unknownhostexception filenotfoundexception a variety of syntax error exceptions indexoutofboundsexception authentication failures etc. etc
in general i feel nullpointerexception is much maligned because traditionally has been associated with code that fails to follow the fail fast principle
that plus the jdk s failure to populate nullpointerexception s with a message string really has created a strong negative sentiment that isn t well founded
1872444
qtkit	quicktime
Pattern(s): 
nssound supports m4p i assume that it is using quicktime to do it but it definitely sucks at large sound files
playback quality problems and performance problems qtkit can play m4p but only if you are not starting from xcode or the gdb
it looks like this is a protection mechanism
1874256
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
it will fail horribly if any of your input chars fall outside the range a-
the second line assembles a 2 byte array from the leading and trailing byte of the int
decoding could be done in a similar manner with the steps reversed
1875095
prng	random
Pattern(s): 
however this does not rule out schemes where the algorithm receives new random bits from the environment as it goes
there might be say a prng that reads its initial state lazily and yet is guaranteed not to repeat
suppose we do have a perfect shuffling algorithm
1875697
addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
Pattern(s): 
the problem is that if you want the sum of the digits of a large number not modulo anything the tricks from number theory run out pretty quickly
adding up the digits of a number doesn t mesh well with addition and multiplication with carries
it s often difficult to promise that the math does not exist for a fast algorithm but in this case i don t think that there is any known formula
1876763
put	get
Pattern(s): 
some are even incapable of performing operations sometimes even load operations on unsuitably-aligned data - in order to work on such data it has to be loaded into two registers and then a series of bit shifts and masks need to be performed to get a usable value and then it needs to be put back
think of it like storing half of the int in each of two buckets and needing to put them together to use it rather than simply storing the whole int in one bucket
in your case the initial bftype likely needs to be aligned to a 2-byte boundary while bfsize likely needs to be aligned to a 4-byte boundary
1877652
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
chars is just silly
int is a good start but 64- or 128-bit reads would probably perform far better still

1877889
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql is the only major system which lacks a way to generate it
postgresql implements a special function generate_series to do that while oracle and sql server can use recursion connect by and recursive cte s accordingly

1878053
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
it contains 5000+ items
it sounds a little weird to display such a long tree on one page but in fact with collapse expand it s much more intuitive than separate pages and since we re offline download times are not a problem parsing times are though but google-chrome is amazing
- the search function provided with modern browsers firefox and google-chrome anyway have two big problems they only search visible items on the page and they can t search non-consecutive words
1879220
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
for example if the pointer variable goes out of scope immediately after free there s not much reason to set it to null
most of the responses have focused on preventing a double free but setting the pointer to null has another benefit
once you free a pointer that memory is available to be reallocated by another call to malloc
1881052
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
the gain with this approach is that you don t have to mess with extends the service handler but also the part of truncating the object would be easier as your javascript object is readliy at hand
you can iterate it stringify subsets of it check their length or use wahtever mechanism you like to implements smart truncating obviously whatever means of truncating json you want to use you ll have to know your data to be able to decide what can safely be removed without breaking key functionality in the request
if truncating cannot be done you d have the option of displaying an error message without even having to hit the server
1881182
ejml	jama
Pattern(s): 
jama is a basic linear algebra package for java
it provides user-level classes for constructing and manipulating real dense matrices. or the efficient java matrix librar y efficient java matrix library ejml is a linear algebra library for manipulating dense matrices
its design goals are
1883586
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 
that said here is the relevant chunk of the build-depends used to build the rgl package which provides on opengl device for r on debian
as ubuntu uses the same settings for their build of the package you should really bet set libgl1-mesa-dev | libgl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev | libglu-dev libpng12-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev x11proto-core-dev the | means alternative so you can use the mesa-based packages or ones matching your graphics card like the various nvidia- packages
just grab some opengpl examples from somewhere and try it
1884693
prepare	pdostatement
Pattern(s): 
the cost of creating a pdostatement with prepare is low anyway
what you may want cached are the results returned from the same sql query either raw or built by prepare and this is a feature of your dbms mysql for instance not php

1885560
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
the purpose of using a salt is to defeat dictionary attacks
if the attacker knows that you use a single salt for all member accounts then he can create a single set of pre-calculated hash values from dictionary words using your salt
md5 is not a very strong hash function
1885917
jquery	scriptaculous
Pattern(s): 
edit it might also be a conflict between jquery and prototype and or scriptaculous
jquery tries to avoid conflicts with other libraries but only so much of this can be controlled
ensure jquery is loaded before the other scripts and add jquery.noconflict
1887931
zoo	xts	zoo	xts
Pattern(s): 
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point
because these rolling functions often apply with time-series data some of the newer and richer time-series data-handling packages already do that for you the zoo has excellent documentation that will show you many many more examples in particular how to do this with real and possibly irregular dates
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point
1888362
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 
in your example w treats any sequence of non-keyword letters as a words too
edit the setting for virtualedit will influence this too you must have it unset because line-final punctuation is being skipped by w add some whitespace to the end of the line to see the difference
if you set the cursor will be able to stop one space beyond the end of the line and line final punctuation won t ever be skipped
1888746
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
.net 2.0 to 3.0 or 3.5 - a lot of upgrade were introduced here but not very many if any breaking changes since the last two upgrade were based on the same basic framework
you can live with the 2.0 versioning without upgrading to any of the other two
so if the symfony upgrade is similiar i would wait for a little while
1890437
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
a memory corruption leads us to reach for the error inside the destructors
but in the real project the base destructor is in fact public and virtual
or could have been protected and non-virtual in this example since base was not used
1892394
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 
and object oriented way is forcibly needed when states are to be maintained apart from abstraction grouping etc. if the requirement is pretty simple i would stick with functional than to object oriented programming
the standard functions filtering map and reduce are used for various operations on a list and all of the three functions expect two arguments a function and a list we could define a separate function and use it as an argument to filtering etc. and its probably a good idea if that function is used several times or if the function is too complex to be written in a single line
however if it s needed only once and it s quite simple it s more convenient to use a lambda construct to generate a temporary anonymous function and pass it to filtering
1893180
innodb	myisam	innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
you can find the engine like if you try to create a foreign key on a myisam table it will silently discard the references and pretend to succeed
on testing the foreign keys are not created on my machine using this syntax but they are when i use this create statement an easy way to see if foreign keys exist on a table is show create table bugs_products or you can query the information schema also check you re using the innodb storage engine
the myisam engine does not support foreign keys
1893638
freebsd	linux
Pattern(s): 
all servers are nix-like freebsd os x linux but not all run apache
my freebsd mirror runs xshttpd somebody most knowledgable must be dedicated maintainer for a long time
fix problems update do migrations etc
1894278
quicksort	shellsort	quicksort	timsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	shellsort	mergesort	timsort
Pattern(s): 
oh and there s dobosiewicz sort aka comb sort which stands to bubblesort as shellsort stands to insertion sort nothing especially efficient but still worth mentioning
natural mergesort is different enough from plain mergesort to be worth mentioning separately just like quickersort is enough of a variation on quicksort to be worth mentioning but even more so
python s timsort which ned s answer mentions is based on natural mergesort btw
1894845
jar	war	jar	war
Pattern(s): 
persistent units can be packaged as part of a war or ejb jar file or can be packaged as a jar file that can then be included in an war or ear file
if you package the persistent unit as a set of classes in an ejb jar file persistence.xml should be put in the ejb jar s meta-inf directory
if you package the persistence unit as a set of classes in a war file persistence.xml should be located in the war file s web-inf classes meta-inf directory
1896729
multiplying	division
Pattern(s): 
it will only be the closest representable approximation to a number with only two decimal places
in order to get two decimal places multiplying the number by 100 floor it then divide by 100
and note that the number you will return will not really have only two decimal places because division by 100 cannot be represented exactly in ieee-754 floating-point arithmetic most of the time
1896962
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
source
standard way is but you ll find these functions can simplify things a lot usage in a stackoverflow greasemonkey script to show all questions on page regardless if they re ignored or not don t worry if the for-loop looks weird in that it skips every other element
the specifics of stackoverflow s dom layout with extra nodes between questions aren t important here. as to document.getelementsbyclassname it returns an arrays of dom elements with the specific class as you would suspect
1898066
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
these are generally implementation details that are not part of the abstraction
subclasses can not access these fields and so i wouldn t consider a private member to be part of the subclass has-a relationship
in terms of the java language when a subclass is created the superclass is also constructed either implicitly or explicitly
1898940
goto	break
Pattern(s): 
but sometimes a goto is just fine when it avoids complexity such as extra flag variables to break out of multiple nested loops
goto is still considered harmful
somehow i have collected four down votes
1900049
goto	break
Pattern(s): 
other languages like vb.net maybe others too allow to do exit for exit while break and things like these that also unstructure the code and i think should be avoid
goto usually is evil because it lets you build unstructured code
with the usual loops you can build good structured code easy to follow because it is structured
1900190
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
since it s actually a loops that calls your anonymous function in each iteration exiting those functions will not exit the calling function as well
returning true and false here is actually corresponding to the continue and break of the for-loop repsectively
you re gonna need to set a boolean flag then return false break and then return the value of your boolean flag after the each
1901102
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if so i would just use hg serve in each project directory one at a time of the old machine and hg clone projectname to clone the changes onto the new machine
edit if you re looking for a way to back up without sharing the repos publicly you could get a dropbox account and clone a copy of each repo to the dropbox folder on your local machine
whenever you push changes they ll get synced up to dropbox automatically
1905967
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
that is no longer the case
transactional support now exists through innodb one of the available storage engines
myisam supports data integrity through essentially autocommit and atomic operations a different route and sometimes less effective but not nothing
1906738
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
it is a list whose type element could be a or a superclass of a does not exist in that case except object
therefore you can add a objects to it or any subclass of a such as b or c

1907143
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 
d
goldberg s what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic describes the effect and the reasons in detail and also how to calculate an upper bound on the error and how to reason about the precision of more complex calculations
when adding a float to an integer the integer is first converted to a float by c++ so two floats are being added and error is introduced for the same reasons as above
1907151
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
to clarify thank you semaj the compiler can choose to treat a variable declared chars as unsigned chars
this does not happen for an int
an int is always signed but with chars you can not be sure
1907927
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
you can also take the opportunity to process your fulltext content differently for example by applying trivial stemming since mysql doesn t implement that itself
postgresql has its own built-in fulltext stuff based on the operator
it s not quite up to sphinx s speed but way way ahead of myisam fulltext in features eg
1908601
ffmpeg	libavformat
Pattern(s): 
libavformat and libavcodec are c libraries so i would use c or c++ if you want to interface directly to them
there is this python wrapper for ffmpeg that looks promising but i haven t tried it
you can download the compiled ffmpeg libraries as well so you shouldn t have to build them yourself
1908785
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
not sure about hsqldb but in many dbms chars is a little faster
for lookups if the dbms is smart then you can use an int value to get closer to your uuid
for example add an int column to your table as well as the chars 36
1908987
lxml	elementtree
Pattern(s): 
the recommended approach in modern python is elementtree
the same interface is also implemented faster in third party module lxml but unless you need blazing speed the version included with the python standard library is fine and faster than minidom anyway -- the key point is to program to that interface then you can always switch to a different implementation of the same interface in the future if you want to with minimal changes to your own code
for example after the needed imports c the following code is a minimal implementation of your example it does not verify that the xml is correct just extracts the data assuming correctness -- adding various kinds of checks is pretty easy of course this produces your desired result given your sample input
1909776
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mouseup
Pattern(s): 
the mouseup event is binded when the user clicks mousedown this forces it to fire when the user lets go of the mouse button no matter how much it s moved
this is a pattern i use alot works generally very well on all things relating to mousemove
the mouseup event is binded when the user clicks mousedown this forces it to fire when the user lets go of the mouse button no matter how much it s moved
1911215
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
in this context mysql databases are analogous in function to postgres-schemas insomuch as postgresql lacks off-the-shelf cross-database functionality that mysql has
conversely postgresql has applied more of the specification implementing cross-table cross-schema and then left room for future cross-database functionality
mysql aliases behind the scenes schema with database such that create schema and create database are analogs
1911947
jstl	taglib
Pattern(s): 
writing raw java code in a jsp file is considered bad practice
replace that sorry for the word nasty stuff by jstl and el
the core taglib supports pretty much of all what you need
1912508
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
you create subclassing that must implement the same interface as your abstract class and will inherit some base implementation you may have defined in your abstract class
abstract classes are only useful if you use inherited
you create subclassing that must implement the same interface as your abstract class and will inherit some base implementation you may have defined in your abstract class
1914152
inline-functions	inlining
Pattern(s): 
also if you are doing a lot of i o how you manage it will make a big difference
but if you are curious about the compiler internals it will fold constants but it will not inline-functions or unroll loops
inlining functions is a hard problem in a dynamic language
1915139
agile	metrics	agile	metrics	agile	sprint
Pattern(s): 
more sophisticated combination of metrics should be used refer to books on software testing
in general if you practice scrum or any other agile methodology you should follow the time-boxing principle and avoid extending delaying your sprint
in particular code coverage metrics alone is not enough to estimate the test readiness status of your application
1915258
rational-numbers	floating-point
Pattern(s): 
with arbitrary precision binary floating-point numbers you can divide by powers of 32
as a corollary to jason s answer if you can map your strings to rational-numbers such a mapping is very straightforward
if code c is the ascii code of the character c and is the i th character in the string s just sum like follows this maps the empty string to 0 and every other string to a rational number between 0 and 1 maintaining lexicographical order
1915949
command-pattern	memento
Pattern(s): 
also an additional note is that because it doesn t require you to have reciprocal commands to undo something that was previously done it means that any potentially one way functions such as hashing or encryption which can t be undone trivially using reciprocal commands can still be undone very simply by just rolling back to an older snapshot
also as pointed out command-pattern which is potentially less resource intensive so i will concede that in specific cases where there is a large object state to be persisted and or there are no destructive methods and where reciprocal commands can be used very trivially to reverse any action taken command-pattern may be a better fit but not necessarily it will depend very much on the situation
in other cases i would use the memento pattern
1918180
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
this directory reference is left undefined which is not a problem for lit.exe
in the application installers i then alias the application bin folder like this as a result the applications have their dependencies in their own bin folder and remain isolated from each other
there is a trade-off of course you gain stability because your application always runs against the exact version of the dependencies it is tested against
1918617
post	get
Pattern(s): 
in get the complete query string all parameter names and values and separators together is usually limited to 2048 characters but you can better adhere an officious limit of 256 chars
in post it is dependent on server configuration
often this defaults around 2gb
1920070
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
data can be ordered many ways on such a tree unordered there is no relationship between a parent and its nodes
heap a node is bigger than or smaller than all of its children ordered one child is designated smaller and the other larger
all values smaller than the root are to one side all values larger to the other
1921825
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 
rubinius for example uses truly concurrent native threads now instead of truly concurrent green threads
also since then several new ruby implementations have emerged such as blueruby tinyrb ruby go lightly red sun and smallruby. similar for python cpython native threads no true multithreading pypy native threads depends on the execution engine pypy can run natively or on top of a jvm or on top of a cli or on top of another python execution engine
whenever the underlying platform supports true multithreading pypy does too. unladen swallow native threads currently no true multithreading but fix is planned jython jvm threads see jruby ironpython cli threads see ironruby for haskell at least the glorious glasgow haskell compiler supports true multithreading with native threads
1924297
nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception
Pattern(s): 
the name of the class should reflect that
you should validate that the parameter callback to queueuserworkitem is not null to avoid nullreferenceexception in the loop in threadmain fail fast
you should throw an objectdisposedexception if queueuserworkitem is called after dispose has already been called
1924623
stdout	fflush
Pattern(s): 
of course if cout output is intermixed with stdout the buffer fflush defeat the purpose an increased buffer size
you can further improve the performance of printf by increasing the buffer size for stdout setvbuf stdout null _iofbf 32768
any value larger than 512 and also a a multiple of the system i o buffer size is an improvement the number of calls to the operating system to perform i o is almost always the most expensive component and performance limiter
1926245
codeigniter	kohana	codeigniter	kohana
Pattern(s): 
info kohana is gnerated from codeigniter
codeigniter support now all php4 php5. for jquery i m work with jquery and codeigniter in all my projects all it s good and it s fine to use jquery with codeigniter
info kohana is gnerated from codeigniter
1926836
factories	presenter
Pattern(s): 
your presenter goes unchanged next the autofac container setup now in your page you can in two lines of code resolve the presenter by first getting the factory and then calling the factory to do the resolution for you
the way to solve passing what i like to call data parameters when resolving dependencies in autofac is by using generated factories
update this question discusses the same problem and my article shows how you can avoid large amounts of factory delegates
1926836
factories	presenter
Pattern(s): 
update this question discusses the same problem and my article shows how you can avoid large amounts of factories delegates
the solution to your problem will look something like this first declare a factories delegate thath only accepts the data parameters public delegate ifoopresenter foopresenterfactory ifooview view
your presenter goes unchanged next the autofac container setup now in your page you can in two lines of code resolve the presenter by first getting the factories and then calling the factories to do the resolution for you
1927793
crossover	mutation
Pattern(s): 
from that site start generate random population of n chromosomes suitable solutions for the problem fitness evaluate the fitness f x of each chromosome x in the population new population create a new population by repeating following steps until the new population is complete selection select two parent chromosomes from a population according to their fitness the better fitness the bigger chance to be selected crossover with a crossover probability cross over the parents to form a new offspring children
if no crossover was performed offspring is an exact copy of parents
mutation with a mutation probability mutate new offspring at each locus position in chromosome
1929177
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
instance constructor sets the value to 7
serializable is unaware of the static variable and it is ignored
deserialization is unaware of static variable and it is ignored
1929790
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	onreadystatechange	onload
Pattern(s): 
in these browsers only the onload listener is useful to detect the end of a script loading the onreadystatechange is not needed
in firefox safari and google-chrome the onreadystatechange handler nevers gets called
i created a short test case creating a dynamic script with only the onreadystatechange handler set i performed the test on a local file in firefox 2 firefox 3 firefox 3.5 safari 3 safari 4 and google-chrome 3 and got similar results here the logs recorded in firefox 3.5 fri dec 18 2009 17 53 58 gmt+0100 mozilla 5.0 windows

onreadystatechange	onload
Pattern(s): 
u
en presto 2.2.15 version 10.10 test for script.readystate behavior started added script with onreadystatechange handler test1.js start test1.js start of closure test1.js end of closure readystatechange loaded readystatechange loaded these different behaviors indicate that onreadystatechange is not a reliable way to detect the end of a script loading in opera
since opera also supports the onload listener this other mechanism should be used instead
1931036
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
uh if you talk about boolean then yes not or are it...
if you mean bitwise xor of two int then each scheme has it s own name if any since it s not in any standard
for example plt has these bitwise functions including bitwise-xor
1931389
valgrind	memcheck
Pattern(s): 
if i had to detect such loads on an intel platform i think i would have to modify valgrind to treat unaligned loads as errors
such a modification is not trivial but valgrind was designed with the idea in mind that users could create new tools
i think a simple modification to the memcheck tool would detect your unaligned references
1932236
des	rsa
Pattern(s): 
prior to 1997 exporting crypto of any sort from to any country was a very dicey thing to do and carried severe legal penalties
this was especially true in france which for a time outlawed all non-governmental uses of crypto even very weak 40-bit des
although france has loosened up a bit they still seem to behind most other developed countries in understanding that a their citizens have a valid right to privacy and b there s not much they can do to stop it in a world where 4096 bit rsa is available all over the net
1932371
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
to make inlining possible in the absence of unusually clever compilation and linking facilities the definition and not just the declaration of an inline function must be in scope 9.2
an inline especifier does not affect the semantics of a function
in particular an inline function still has a unique address and so has static variables 7.1.2 of an inline function
1935264
memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects
however memcached has the following benefits faster than the disk or re-running query
scales to multiple servers
1935913
comparator	icomparer
Pattern(s): 
similarly with the sortedlist -- you need only supply a suitable icomparer that performs the comparison you need and use reverse for back to front iteration
sounds like what you want is either a priorityqueue with the priority being a pair or simply a sortedlist with a custom comparator
here s an implementation of a priorityqueue that could be adapted to your needs
1936096
profiling	debugging	xdebug	runkit
Pattern(s): 
counter-retort 2 unfortunately most standard php functions don t use exceptions for reporting errors which makes structured exception handling much less useful finally made it in php 5.5 operator overloading retort in php you can use runkit extension to emulate the same feature counter-retort in php you have to use runkit extension to emulate the same feature swig integration threading retort python have global interpreter lock so it s not really parallel with .
as statement to deal with resources that need closing reliably and concisely an excellent profiling retort xdebug a debugging and profiling extension that supports both php4 and php5 is extremely popular lots of high-level data types lists tuples dicts datetimes numpy arrays etc. retort php had spl types which is included in php5 as a standard library differentiation between arrays lists and associative arrays dictionaries
retort php array is more flexible
1937823
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 
one list here and some tablet like dell s latitude xt2 xfr are also ruggedized
iphone or android could be used as a touchscreen platform but there s not a lot of screens real estate

1938319
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
can you post the relevant html from your submission page
youre assuming it works just like if you submit a form to a plain php page then that page renders to the browser
this is not what happens
1938431
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
as for the ie7 inherited question check this so post on ie7 css inherited problem update using k prime s sample code here s the test i did on ie7 vs ie8 ff3.5 html ie7 output ie7 ie8 ff3.5 output ie8 ff3.5 so well ie7 failed the inherited test for this one
refer to the w3c s specification for inherited value
excerpt the inherited value can be used to strengthen inherited values and it can also be used on properties that are not normally inherited
1938519
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 
tracking state is a higher level function -- that is left to the server or client separately
these work-arounds are hackish for a reason http is meant to be primarily stateless
stateful http is impossible because it isn t really http anymore it s something totally different
1938844
verilog	vhdl
Pattern(s): 
the latter lists books and contains a free tutorial
learning verilog is very far from high-level languages
the syntax has been inspired by c yes but designing electronics be it using vhdl or verilog is very different from writing software
1940388
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
it s when you use redirect that it causes a response to be sent to the browser causing it to make a get request which is where it loses the request attributes for the original request because the get is an entirely new request
if you use forward then control stays within the servlet container the request attributes are retained and the request remains a post
it s when you use redirect that it causes a response to be sent to the browser causing it to make a get request which is where it loses the request attributes for the original request because the get is an entirely new request
1941029
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 

if you encounter such clashes in semantics or naming within an inherited hierarchy you should re-evaluate your design
in most cases straight subclassing is not needed and creates a for too tight coupling
1942779
int	boolean	int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
you may or may not be able to port apps depending on what they use as boolean literals
in mysql true and false map to 1 and 0 int values
it looks like the pg boolean type uses string literal notation
1943256
short	base
Pattern(s): 
many have found it easier to use a much slower add-on templating engine like smarty but for those purists among us who demand fast rendering and a pure code base php is the only way to write templates
the only valid argument against the use of short tags is that they aren t supported on all servers
comments about conflicts with xml documents are ludicrous because you probably shouldn t be mixing php and xml anyway
1943933
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
if you want a hash function to serialize something to disk you might consider the kepler project s implementation of md5 hashing for lua
the hash function is not exposed
by hiding the hash function the lua designers reserve the right to change it out from under you
1945822
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 
you probably want to use viewwillappear or viewdidappear
viewdidload is only called when the view is first instantiated
if you re not recreating the view controller each time you ll only get it called once and called again if you get a memory warning and the view is nil d out
1946968
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate
it seems a bit strange to totally forbid the use of something like a for-loop
there s an interesting article here that covers a lot of the performance differences between the two loops
1947902
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
Pattern(s): 
i found that on google-chrome safari and opera many special keys don t get passed through to ajaxterm including backspace the arrow keys ctrl+c ctrl+h home end etc
opera is even worse when you press shift the keypress gets translated into p so you can t type capitals
these things are showstoppers for me
1948272
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
it is definitely typing in which an object s current set of methods and properties determines the valid semantics rather than its inheritance from a particular class or implementation of a specific interface
you don t explicitly specify an interface that your type must inherited from to instantiate the template
it just needs to have all the features that are used inside the template definition
1948470
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
md5 is pretty widely available
the fastest hash function will be however though the hashing will be mighty fast you will suffer performance elsewhere
what you want is to try several hashing algorithms on actual data and see which one actually gives you the best performance in aggregate on the actual data you expect to use if the hashing or lookup is even a performance bottleneck
1950028
integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 
a floating-point number specifies a fractions of the frame s height
an integer specifies the maximum number of lines
nil means do not resize the minibuffer window automatically
1951182
webrat	cucumber
Pattern(s): 
the sequence of events is roughly cucumber runs your feature when the i am on the home page step is reached it invokes webrat to make the request to the controller webrat constructs a request and sends it to the controller step fails because the request does not have an accept-language header apparently webrat does not add this header when it builds the request
however webrat gives you a workaround the header method with which any header can be set for the duration of the request
so to make this work add a step that puts in the header run this step before you visit a page and webrat is no longer confused
1951706
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
Pattern(s): 
for instance the g1 is a mdpi class device 160dpi but its screens density is actually around 180dpi
the droid is a hdpi class device 240dpi but its screens is 265dpi
bitmap scaling is based on the density class only
1951887
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
serialization deserialization this sort of serialization does not really fit into a get set property so you will most likely want to override the saveviewstate and loadviewstate methods of your user control page and add the serialization deserialization logic within these
you could serializable your xmldocument to an xml string and save that string in the viewstate
serialization deserialization this sort of serialization does not really fit into a get set property so you will most likely want to override the saveviewstate and loadviewstate methods of your user control page and add the serialization deserialization logic within these
1952238
hide	show
Pattern(s): 
once the element is selected different jquery functions can be executed on that reference. the show function makes the control element visible
similarly you can use hide to hide the element

1952851
abc	isinstance
Pattern(s): 
hence isinstance acquires a new meaning - it just checks for declared type compatibility which is a good way to go in python
take the following example if the object doesn t satisfy what you expect you just throw a typeerror but if the proper abc has been registered your check is unuseful
on the contrary if the __iter__ method is available python will automatically recognize object of that class as being iterable
1952998
uploadify	swfupload
Pattern(s): 
as files are completed they are removed from the queue it also allows you to specify which file types the user is able to download they can only see the ones you choose
uploadify is also another great multiple file uploader
it was built off of swfupload and they added new features to it
1953893
ant	maven	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
and that structure tends to reflect back a bit to the source layout as well. here is a page that details project structures for java projects in general they don t agree very much with what i wrote above and for j2ee projects in particular maven projects maven is a very versatile project build tool
personally my build needs are nicely met by ant which roughly compares with nmake
maven on the other hand is complete-lifecyle build management with dependency management bolted on
1955275
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
your first snippet is for a wsgi interface with the web server and is the recommended method for integrating django with apache
very good resources including examples to help you set this up correctly can be found in the official django docs how to use django with apache and mod_wsgi and the mod_wsgi docs integration with django the second snippet with addhandler line is for fcgi
this is the kind of interface that is more typically used to interface django with the lighttpd and nginx web servers
1955655
srp	ocp
Pattern(s): 
the ocp specifically states that the type should be open for extension but closed for modification - that sounds like a good fit in your case because this would be a way to ensure backwards compatibility
the srp is also very helpful here because it means that if a class does only one thing and that thing becomes obsolete it doesn t drag along a lot of other problems
it can just be left to die on its own
1955764
freebsd	linux
Pattern(s): 
popular os gets better support on optimization of compilers libraries etc
for example freebsd is tier 2 platform for ghc that means ghc may release new versions even if it cannot run on freebsd
and some programing languages are only available on windows or linux
1957116
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc realloc or valloc function or if the space is deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behaviour is undefined
any use of a pointer that refers to free space causes undefined behaviour

1957820
super	self
Pattern(s): 
class a object def __init__ self pass class b a def __init__ self super b self .__init__ class c b def __init__ self super c self .__init__ if you now instantiate you see that the class type is not redundant -- super self .__init__ inside b.__init__ would not really work
what you do is that you manually specify in which class the method calling super is an this is solved in python 3 s super by a hidden variable pointing to the method s class
two links with examples of super and multiple inheritance things to know about python super 1 of 3 python s super is nifty but you can t use it
1957862
stdout	fflush
Pattern(s): 
you should add an fflush stdout after this to make sure the output appears before scanf is called
by default stdout is line buffered on many systems so the prompt may not appear before your program waits for input
printf please enter the base to convert to
1959001
freemarker	velocity
Pattern(s): 
there are few alternatives you may try like freemarker and velocity
afaik freemarker is a emerging as good template library
its lightweight than jsp
1959842
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 
disclaimer special needs may render these idioms less useful but i have found them to be very clear and maintainable
simplest case points state is private not only to the compilation unit but also to the event_handler. special cases may be handled separately from the main switching using whatever construct deemed necessary
more complex case when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly
1962025
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
however you could do that if you wanted to by doing because hello world is also a pointer a chars pointer to be precise so the above applies
can you explain why we are allowed to assign x int problem3 in the above code because problem3 is a function pointer the memory address of a function and all pointers can be cast to int
no
1964836
allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
this is the reason that boost.pool uses only one pool technically it uses a different pool for each type
i.e. your allocator are not allowed to have any non-static members in the general case
if you re making a video game and you know that your stl implementation does not have this problem then don t worry about this -- however there might still be some issues with list splice and std swap on containers
1966116
3ds	lighting
Pattern(s): 
i recalculate normals on cpu only when vertices or triangles changes which occurs only when working in one mesh not in whole scene. it is not solution that i wanted but in real world it is better than previous approaches
i cache whole geometry into separate normal and vertex array indexed drawing cannot be used because i want flat shading similar problem to smoothing groups in 3ds max
i use simple gldrawarrays and for lighting vertex shader that is because i want in triangle mode different color for selected triangle and another one for unselected and there is no array of materials i didn t found any one
1966926
int	double	range	max
Pattern(s): 
they are either 16 bit or they are double they cannot be both
however assuming that this is 16 bit unsigned data normalised to 1.0 so the values range from 0.0 s 1.0 then all you need to do to expand them to 8bit int values is to multiply each sample by 255
if the range is not 0.0 s 1.0 but 0.0 s max then either way there is no quantisation function other than one you might write yourself
1967394
woodstock	trinidad
Pattern(s): 
those component libraries adds just that extra on top of the basic implementation often with more skinning capabilities richfaces icefaces and or ajaxical stuff richfaces icefaces trinidad and or more enhanced specialized components tomahawk primefaces
also note that woodstock is buggy and already dead since a year or two
don t use it
1967867
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
given that rss is stateless it doesn t know when you last requested the feed and therefore couldn t provide which items in the current feed are new or not compared to the last time you queried the feed
simply storing the slug for the rss item should be enough for a simple comparison to determine what is new or not
also you have the publish date and a few other items that generally don t change
1969842
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if your document processing library requires a java.io.file for manipulation only then store the document from the database into a temp file start the processing and read it back into the database
storing information within the web application folder does not always work
some application servers do not expand the deployed war file and hence there is no working directory for a web application
1970066
joomla	phpbb	moodle	phpbb
Pattern(s): 
registered users in joomla will be replicated to phpbb too and vice versa you have to setup jfusion configuration to decide which system is the master
i ve been using jfusion with a moodle and joomla installation and it s working pretty well
to integrate your forum to your joomla installation you have a fast implementation in your top menu create a link and change it s menu item type to wrapper
1970179
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
there s a reasonable comparison over on wikipedia
innodb is a fully acid compliant database engine and therefore offers support for transactions etc
as such it can therefore be slower than the myisam database which tends to be optimised in a different direction
1970179
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
as such it can therefore be slower than the myisam database which tends to be optimised in a different direction
therefore if you need transactions innodb or another rdbms such as postgresql is the obvious choice
there s a reasonable comparison over on wikipedia
1970232
tostring	string.format
Pattern(s): 
by the way you should only use string.format if you re combining multiple values
in your case you should call the tostring overload
also your format string is needlessly long
1970413
matlab	simulink	matlab	simulink
Pattern(s): 
for instance you can use simulink to design a drive-by-wire control system for an automobile then use either real-time workshop or targetlink to generate c code that will run on the car s ecu
matlab alone may not have a lot of obvious applications for other fields but matlab has many add-on toolboxes that greatly extend its capabilities
for instance you can use simulink to design a drive-by-wire control system for an automobile then use either real-time workshop or targetlink to generate c code that will run on the car s ecu
1970801
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
for instance innodb can do row-level locking while myisam only supports table-level locking
this particular feature can give innodb a significant advantage under load that involves many concurrent updates to different parts of the same set of tables
so you cannot really generalize
1971133
jstl	taglib
Pattern(s): 
jstl provides pretty everything you need in the core fmt and function taglib
just let the method throw it and use the jstl c catch to handle it
that said the jsp is the wrong place to do the validations
1971499
zoo	xts	zoo	xts
Pattern(s): 
notice how xts treats this differently
here s how you could use the lag function with zoo and panel series data lag forward by 1 lag backward by 1 as dirk mentioned be careful with the meaning of lag in the different time series packages
notice how xts treats this differently
1972294
automake	autotools
Pattern(s): 
for your usage what you would probably want to do is create a configure using autoconf that takes options like --enable-debug and --enable-dedicated to set options for generating your makefile
you could then port your makefile to automake or you could simply turn your makefile into a makefile.in with a few variables that autoconf will fill in when generating the makefile
while the gnu autotools system is very complete and supports a lot of platforms it is a bit baroque
1975270
rbac	acl
Pattern(s): 
in zend framework acl this could be like this to be honest it s been some time i ve actually done this in zend_acl since i m creating my own system
i think a basic rbac system is as simple as just using a permission system
note that the term role in rbac is something that might limit implementation
1976481
bytearrayoutputstream	bufferedinputstream	bytearrayoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
Pattern(s): 
to improve performance you can wrap the response.getoutputstream in a bufferedoutputstream beforehand and the inputstream in a bufferedinputstream and use a buffer
here s a basic example which can be invoked by a form like this that said do in no way use bytearrayinputstream bytearrayoutputstream as some here may suggest
those are namely backed by a raw
1977388
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
hr forgive the edit -- pulling out all of the tricks i know this can be compressed to 356 chars is a special perl variable along with and that can only take on integer values
using it eliminates the need to use the int function

1977751
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
i have seen chilkat s java zip library mentioned before as a way to get this to work but have never used it
if java.util.zip still behaves as this post describes i m not sure if it is possible with the built-in classes
i have seen chilkat s java zip library mentioned before as a way to get this to work but have never used it
1978185
heroku	engineyard	heroku	engineyard
Pattern(s): 
you may want to look into engineyard cloud which will soon have production jruby support
heroku does not support jruby unfortunately
you may want to look into engineyard cloud which will soon have production jruby support
1978389
pop-up	dialog	width	height
Pattern(s): 
some developers also create a mask to hide or inactivate the rest of the page while the pop-up is visible - and to make it act as if it were a modal dialog
to do this create another div with a background color usually black or white then set the opacity to something like 50 - 70 - then set its zindex higher than anything else on the page but lower then the pop-up and set its position to absolute its top and left to 0 and width and height to match the page

1979121
super	extends
Pattern(s): 
you extends a jframe so you get a jframe
super is always called implicitely before your own constructor unless you call super ... or this ... yourself
this needs to be the first call in your own constructor
1980610
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
and with your connection you really ought not use variables like strings generally - this should be written as furthermore you ve got a few more problems in and around your delete-logic
for instance i pointed out already that your button will be known as once it is registered on the server
likewise your checkbox having an id value of will simply be known as on the server
1980712
activemq	rabbitmq
Pattern(s): 
activemq and rabbitmq will
not all the messaging systems can support very large queue sizes - though activemq does not all the messaging systems survive a hard broker stop without loosing messages activemq will - without you having to use transactions
and if you are going to use open source - always look at the community - activemq is the most active community of any open source message vendor - and it s also apache - which means diversity and no reliance on any single developer or vendor for delivery
1982432
datamodel	relational-model
Pattern(s): 
conceptual datamodel is really requirements analysis from a data centric point of view
logical datamodel is generally the application of a specific datamodel to the requirements discovered in conceptual datamodel
relational-model is used far more than any other specific model and developers need to learn relational-model for sure
1982432
datamodel	relational-model
Pattern(s): 
you can t build good sql tables if you misunderstand relational-model
physical datamodel is generally dbms specific and doesn t need to be learned in much detail unless the developer is also the database builder or the dba
what developers do need to understand is the extent to which physical database design can be separated from logical database design and the extent to which producing a high speed database can be accomplished just by tweaking the physical design
1982994
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
i used virtualbox when it only had linear destructive snapshot reversion -- i understand that vbox has improved but vmware still has it beat for snapshot capabilities
also if you re debugging in a vm vmware has extensions to record a vm s execution for debugging as well

1984736
post	get
Pattern(s): 
the deviceiocontrol method with the ioctl_disk_get_drive_layout_ex control code can be used to get this information
here is a post with a sample console application to do what you re asking for

1984931
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
since the folder is the same on the emulator you can use that to get the folder path
if you know the application package you can cd directly to that folder
eg cd data data com.yourapp this will drop you into a directory that is read writable so you can change files as needed
1984931
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
eg cd data data com.yourapp this will drop you into a directory that is read writable so you can change files as needed
since the folder is the same on the emulator you can use that to get the folder path

1985247
vim	emacs	vim	jedit
Pattern(s): 
both vim s and emacs coding satisfy these requirements. modeline generator here is a simple modeline generator which generates modelines for vim emacs and jedit
vim vim has a concept called a modeline
a modeline is a specially formatted line either withinin the first or last 5 lines of the textfile which allows you to setlocal local variables
1985247
vim	jedit
Pattern(s): 
the have to sit within the first or last 10 lines and look like this jedit also uses the shebang line as a fallback for mode detection
komodo edit there is a plugin called komode pun intended which adds modeline support to komodo edit it also understands a limited subset of vim modelines
others a lot of other editors also have either their own variants of this or support one of the above usually vim
1986457
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
it definitely leads to odd situations such as multiple catch statements that have the same logic as you would expect when things are distinguished by type but that is a limitation of the language
in this case the functionality that inherited adds is in regards to the catch statement which can distinguish by type
normally distinguishing subclassing by type is considered a bad practice but exception handling is well an exception
1986486
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
private bytes are also not exclusively physical memory
they can be paged to disk or in the standby page list no longer in use but not paged yet either
working set refers to the total physical memory ram used by the process
1987651
accurev	cvs
Pattern(s): 
both systems are a little hard to get your head around especially if you re used to cvs
for my two cents accurev is the better product
the streams are a very powerful tool for managing development vs
1987845
haskell	scheme
Pattern(s): 
in lisp and scheme the closure stores the locations of the free variables
in haskell and ml the closure stores the values of the free variables. an anonymous function is a more general concept and need not be restricted to a simple binding and body
for example in smalltalk a block represents an anonymous function but the body of a block is a sequence of statements so it is definitely not the same as a lambda expression
1989291
datamapper	activerecord	datamapper	activerecord
Pattern(s): 
fowler himself says activerecord is mainly to be used ...for domain logic that isn t too complex...if your business logic is complex you ll soon want to use your object s direct relationships collections inheritance and so forth. these don t map easily onto activerecord
fowler goes on to say that for more serious applications with complex domain logic the datamapper pattern which does a better job of separating the layers is preferable
this is one of the reasons that rails upcoming move to merb has been generally seen as a positive move for rails as merb makes use of the datamapper pattern in addition to activerecord
1989455
gif	png
Pattern(s): 
png gif
the gif image format does not support alpha transparency
gif supports 24-bit rgb
1990469
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
instead these users will see a regular corner
you can get started using firefox and any of the mozilla family of browsers
apple s webkit web browser engine also supports rounded corners making them available in the safari and chrome web browsers the iphone and other devices running webkit
1991276
gmp	bigint
Pattern(s): 
although i recommend writing your own bignum for practice if you are really stuck you can take ideas from the code of already implemented bigint libraries
for a serious implementation something like gmp is the obvious choice
but you cana also find small bigints coded by other people when solving similar practice problem online abednego s bigint.cpp
1991330
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
the real benefits are that you are able to work within the context of an actual word document and not having to compromise by creating rtfs etc
the java versioning is not currently as fully featured as the .net versioning but the main core functionality is there and they are pushing very hard to have a feature equivalent versioning soon
also if you purchase the java versioning you get a years free upgrade support as the new releases are created

ant	maven	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
there s some overlap with what maven does but ivy is much more lightweight and doesn t do as much
ivy is an ant extension for managing external libraries during the development process giving you a way of adding them to your classpath bundling them into your application build etc
there s some overlap with what maven does but ivy is much more lightweight and doesn t do as much
1993901
arp	icmp
Pattern(s): 
then you can either user icmp ping standard ping or arp ping to list all the valid ip addresses
arp ping is much reliable in a subnet setting
2 you can nmap to list all the hosts nmap -nsp 192.168.10.1 254 | grep host
1994238
free	strdup
Pattern(s): 
unlink might be able to go much earlier in the code or right before the close call--depends on if you want people to see the output your playing with--i usually put the unlink directly after the mkstemp call--this prevents the kernel from writing the file back to disk if the tmp directory is disk backed this is less and less common thanks to tmpfs
also you ll want to free tmpname after you unlink to keep from leaking memory
the strdup is necessary as tmpname is modified by mkstemp
1995147
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
Pattern(s): 
a sqlconnection should really be treated as a unit of work - you create it when needed and dispose of it when finished
a sqldatareader is not even a unit of work - it is a throwaway object for which there is absolutely no reason to keep at a global level
even if you implement a singleton as others have apparently suggested you are setting yourself up for a huge amount of trouble later
1995378
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 
if you are on fat ntfs in case-insensitive mode essentially any time it s being used under windows or hfs+ in case-insensitive mode and have two files foobar and foobar then git will see two distinct files but the filesystems will only see one which will cause all kinds of problems
git will checkout say foobar and then checkout foobar which the filesystems sees as simply replacing the contents of foobar but leaving it in place
now to git it appears that foobar has been replaced with the contents of foobar and foobar is gone
1995555
salt	md5
Pattern(s): 
it should be a fixed value stored someone that is preferably unique to the plain text being hashed
the most secure would be to use a cryptographically secure random number generator to produce a salt which is then stored along side the password
if you created a salt which was an md5 of the password then it would have to stored alongside the hashed and salted password value which means you have an unsalted hash which is vulnerable to precomputed lookup tables unless you plan to calculate it every time which is a small performance hit
1995555
hash	md5	hash	salt	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
if you created a salt which was an md5 of the password then it would have to stored alongside the hashed and salt password value which means you have an unsalted hash which is vulnerable to precomputed lookup tables unless you plan to calculate it every time which is a small performance hit
by taking a sha hash of an md5 hash you re reducing the possibility of the plain text values as there s a finite number of md5 hash values as they are fixed length
this would mean that a rainbow table lookup might have a greater chance of success than a truly random salt
1996082
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave
Pattern(s): 
use mouseleave instead see it here documentation here
mouseout is the wrong event - it is triggered when you hover over a child element
use mouseleave instead see it here documentation here
1997606
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
it converts the string to floating point using strtod and checks to see if there is any more input after it
to distinguish between float s and int s is trickier
a regex is one way to go but we could just check for floating chars of course a more streamlined way to do this is to return the type of the value and the value together
1999558
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
someone recently ranted in his blog about how terrible maven is and the debate goes on and he much much prefers rake
here s just an idea ant is really not such a bad tool
you may also want to take a look at rake
1999901
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
in mainstream oo languages the subclassing inherits all the features of the superclass and may override any superclass methods
i remember an example where the difference between generalization and inherited really made sense a square is a rectangle
that comes from their definitions in mathematics a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles a square is a polygon with four equal sides and angles at design level there is a generalization relationship between the square and the rectangle
1999956
entity-relationship	entities
Pattern(s): 
these tables correspond to relationships in the entity-relationship entity-relationship model
the entity-relationship model is useful for conceptualizing a schema and understanding the requirements but it should not be confused with a database design
the tables that represent entities from an entity-relationship model should have a smiple pk
2000959
expression-blend	silverlight
Pattern(s): 
edit to show attaching this behavior in c# code-behind remember to include the microsoft.expression.interactivity.layout namespace with your using statements
handling the mouse events and implementing drag and drop yourself will certainly work but depending on what you are trying to do you may be able to leverage expression-blend behaviors
the microsoft.expression.interactions dll includes some useful basic behaviors triggers and actions to be used in silverlight and wpf
2001275
vsto	add-in	vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
you could however expose a class in your project to com and have it called from a vba add-in that is called back from the application.onkey event
how to create excel udfs in vsto managed code calling a .net component from a com component i know that this is a lot to digest but hopefully this can get you going
overall i would recommend a managed com add-in to handle your user-interface functionality
2001853
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
it can t be cast to the subclassing
to explain a bit further you can only cast up the inherited tree which is to say an object can only be cast as the class type it was created as any of its superclass or any interface that it implements
thus a string can be cast as either a string or an object
2002223
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
Pattern(s): 
i would try pulling the apk off of the emulator or device and check it s md5 versus the file on the server to make sure that the bits are being written out correctly
this may not be the core problem but i don t think you want to wrap stream in an objectoutputstream since that is used for object serialization
it could be that it is adding extra data to the file so it can be deserialized with objectinputstream
2004857
gcj	javac
Pattern(s): 
otherwise use update-alternatives to configure which package supplies your java and javac commands update-alternatives --config java update-alternatives --config javac source
this message is your clue gcj has been detected as the current java virtual machine. that means your system java is still the gcj version not the sun version
if you don t need gcj for other things you can remove the package apt-get remove or apt-get purge
2004891
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
that s only the surface of what emacs allows
i m sure vim has similar capabilities

2005404
url.action	actionlink
Pattern(s): 
so i d just opt to use url.action again
there is an overload of url.action that takes your desired protocol http https as an argument - if you specify this you get a fully qualified url
here s an example that uses the protocol of the current request in an action method htmlhelper html also has an overload of the actionlink method that you can use in razor to create an anchor element but it also requires the hostname and fragment parameters
2007641
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
there are a few more cases where this is not feasible because the alterations must be made very early on if they are to have any effect setting or altering __slots__
in python 3 metaclasses gain one extra little bit of usefulness a metaclass can now optionally specify the mapping object to be populated during the execution of the class statement s body by default it s a normal dictionary
this allows the order of name bindings in the class body to be preserved and used while the normal dictionary loses order which is sometimes nice when the class must have fields in a certain specific order to map 1 1 onto a c struct a row in a csv file or db table and the like -- in python 2
2008529
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
line in the appdelegate source file
this will log every time one of the synthesized accessor setters is called
this will tell you when the properties is actually been accessed or set
2009953
prepare	execute
Pattern(s): 
prepare statements explicitly tells mysql what is sql and what is data so mysql won t execute any sql in the data
you can get started with prepare statements with mysqli
as for showing the data in your php pages you can use htmlspecialchars to escape your output
2010807
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 
however you can iterate over the dictionary noting which keys map to the desired value obviously this is not efficient for large dictionaries though
yes the dictionary is basically a one way street
for example it would be possible for many keys to have the value host so there s no simple reverse lookup
2011899
put	get
Pattern(s): 

indeed put an exit or a die afer the header
it is quite easy not to follow the header redirection and to get what is executed aferwise
2011899
post	get
Pattern(s): 
it is quite easy not to follow the header redirection and to get what is executed aferwise
there is a fun post on the daily wtf and more complete on this issue that i cannot find for the time being
edit found it
2011945
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
the above code produces an output of 40+2 as the none int values as specified by the filter have been removed
you can use php function filter_var a good tutorial in the link example to sanitize int to sanitize an int is simple with the filter_sanitize_int filter
this filter strips out all chars except for digits and
2012224
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
the wording of the java language specification says each class except object is an extension of that is a subclassing of a single existing class 8.1.4 and may implement interfaces 8.1.5
and also the extends clause must not appear in the definition of the class object because it is the primordial class and has no direct superclass

2014525
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
the equivalent is font-family
so i did some quick research on font-face and found that it s -- depending on how you look at it -- either a non-standard attribute specific to firefox 3.5 or a part of the not-yet-mainstream css3
safari has partial support for css3 depending on version but i suspect that this is the cause of your undesired behavior
2014955
set	bag
Pattern(s): 
a map persists idictionary is an unordered collection that is indexed with uniques keys of a given type
a set persists iset from iesi.collections probably will use the iset that comes with the version 4 of the framework is an unordered collection that does not allow duplicates
a bag persists icollection or ilist but provides no guarantees for indexing is an unordered collection that allows duplicates
2017138
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
so what i do in linux is to install the minimal x libraries and then forward the x session to my local machine
in the server debian ubuntu instructions aptitude update aptitude install xbase-clients aptitude install xtightvncviewer test it from the client machine ssh -x remote_server squeakvm gemtools.image this will start the squeakvm process on the server but all the graphics will be shown on the local machine the xserver for this particular scenario
also if you install rfb on some of your images and start them headless you can use xtightvncviewer to connect to inside the image through the rfb server
2018574
super	self
Pattern(s): 
super sorteddict self .__init__ data on the other hand calls the parent class constructor
also in the case of multiple inheritance using super ensures that all the right constructors are called in the right order
using none as a default argument instead of a mutable ensures that those other constructors don t accidentally modify sorteddict s default argument
2018943
jar	manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 
an executable jar has a main class defined in the jar s manifest.mf file and the manifest also allows the definition of a class path to include libraries that the code in the executable jar will need
the class path definition in the manifest must enumerate every jar or folder to put on the class path relative paths are relative to the location of the executable jar - not to paths contained inside the executable jar
executable jars are launched with the -jar argument to the java executable and both the java -cp flag and the classpath environment variable are ignored
2018943
jar	manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 
your application is jared as a regular jar file named main.jar in the final jar s main folder
any libraries your code needs is placed as jar files in the final jar s lib folder
and last but not least the final jar s manifest.mf file tells one-jar what your main class is
2018945
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
Pattern(s): 
as an aside if you are still curious you might try recording the names of the threads into an array of nsstrings and then printing everything out at the end of the test code rather than logging as you go along - this will significantly reduce the amount of work done by each nsinvocationoperation
nsoperationqueue is designed to pool and re-use threads in the most efficient way possible and in this instance it seems it decided not re-using threads was the best way to go
test code has it s uses and it is possible you may have identified a corner case where nsoperationqueue does not do the most efficient thing but that doesn t mean that nsoperationqueue is always horribly inefficient when dealing with real code in real life
2020115
qobject	qwidget	qobject	qwidget
Pattern(s): 
since qwidget is a subclass of qobject tr is available in methods of qwidget but in main you have to use qobject tr in order to use the function as shown below
the translation function tr is a static method of qobject
since qwidget is a subclass of qobject tr is available in methods of qwidget but in main you have to use qobject tr in order to use the function as shown below
2021071
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
they can only be created through a xmldocument
also xml serializable works by reflection and saving all public get set properties and xmlnode and subclasses don t have properties designed for this
you can still serialize the xmlnode as a string you just can t implement it directly like i show above then you will have to do some post-processing step after xml deserialization to recreate the xmlnode
2021306
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
Pattern(s): 
therefore seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the warnings produced by -winline to appear or disappear.
one way to find out if the function is inline is to use -winline gcc option -winline warn if a function can not be inline and it was declared as inline. even with this option the compiler will not warn about failures to inline-functions declared in system headers. the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inline and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function
2021333
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
i created an abstract superclass adtesta and 25 concrete subclassing in a three-level hierarchy i expect you can guess their names
each class had a single integer field with a name corresponding to its letter - so for example class adtestg has a single int field g in addition to the b field it inherited from its immediate parent adtestb and the pkey and a fields from the top-level abstract superclass
issuing the hql query resulted in the following sql that s not very pretty and does correspond to the effective simulation of the per-hierarchy table that i hoped could be avoided
2021629
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
since google-chrome is built on webkit testing in safari will get you close but you really can t escape the need to actually fire it up and test
the only other tip is that google-chrome uses all of the special webkit css properties curved borders drop shadows etc so make use of them if and when you can

2021668
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
then you are free to use any code generator you like
ant support is part of the eclipse ide
if you prefer maven there s a nice eclipse pluging available that s what i actually use for source code generation based on jaxb javacc and xdoclet...
2021832
ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
if you re wanting to focus on development i d recommend ubuntu
ubuntu is arguably one of the most fully featured ready for the user distributions that makes system administration a snap so you can focus on the development tasks you want to tackle
if you have a linux environment that s a target for your code like say redhat or something then go with the desktop distribution that matches your target environment like say fedora for redhat gentoo for gentoo ubuntu for ubuntu server etc. otherwise all of them are suitable
2022382
implements	extends	implements	modifiers
Pattern(s): 
if you are asking about having a static method inside of an abstract class that is a different story
an abstract class is essentially as mentioned an interface and contains just a template of say functions that you must later on implements by inheriting extends the class
once you extends that class the static method does not come along with it that is by default unless the access modifiers is public protected
2022402
free	malloc	free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
so malloc 0 could return null or a valid pointer that may not be dereferenced
in either case it s perfectly valid to call free on it
i don t really think malloc 0 has much use except in cases when malloc n is called in a loop for example and n might be zero
2023448
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
tcp uses ip which is why you often see it referred to as tcp ip
udp also uses ip so udp is technically udp ip
the ip layer handles the transfer of data from end to end across different networks which is why it is called the inter-networking protocol
2023499
tinyint	boolean
Pattern(s): 
if mysql goes so far as to equate tinyint 1 with boolean it seems like the way to go
using tinyint is more standard practice and will allow you to more easily check the value of the field
i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting integer fields is faster than character fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags
2024372
queue	fifo
Pattern(s): 
your main-loop has to disable interrupts while it is popping
since disabling interrupts is like owning a lock in this context you could implement the queue as contiguous memory or ontop of a slist
the former means copying out the memory to the stack of the main-loop on pop which might be slower -- however provided your fifo has enough memory you should not have to allocate slist nodes from a heap -- which means no memory management headaches
2024421
uiview	calayer	uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 
but that let s calayer be much faster
i think what you want to do here is to have a very single simple uiview that covers the entire play area
then put each tile in a calayer and attach all the calayers to the uiview and move them around and rotate them
2024701
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
there is no way to call the new method in the subclass using a reference to the superclass
you d have to cast to to the subclass type to use the new method
you could do something like here b is a a but a is not a b so it doesn t have the pingb int method
2027533
post	put
Pattern(s): 
one note i m using log4netdash with a seriously simple set-up so have cheated and put some information in the wrong fields eg stack trace in domain field this still works for me as i don t care where the information is shown but you might want to fix this if you re setting stuff up properly if you spare time
this post helped me work out how to write my own wrapper so in return thought you might like my complete class to wrap the logger which seems to work quite nicely and actually takes just over half as much time as using an ilog directly
all that s required is the appropriate xml to set up the logging in the config file and in your assemblyinfo.cs and it should work easily
2027842
range	max	range	infinity
Pattern(s): 
almost anything you do on a real computer is o 1 on the same basis that the size of the problem is constrained by the hardware
it s usually more convenient to accept that addition is o 1 because the numbers are fixed-size but ignore that gcd is also o 1 pretend that its behaviour in the range 1 2 32 extends to infinity and analyse it on that basis
then with n the max of the two inputs it comes out o n o n subtractions each taking constant time
2028368
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
unfortunately i don t know any reasonable way to write your factory method
its not going to work in .net 3.5 and below - subclass is not of type for any t its only of type
and the generic classes do not follow the inherited of their template type is not a subclass of - they are completely different classes in c#
2028443
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
in fact the google-chrome team has mostly aimed for compatibility with safari most prominent webkit user at the time and refused features on those grounds
here s a simple javascript 1.6 feature google-chrome and v8 users like node.js won t run for each in for each variable in object statement as it is js 1.5 per j c s answer is the only version google-chrome claims to completely implement
in fact the google-chrome team has mostly aimed for compatibility with safari most prominent webkit user at the time and refused features on those grounds
2028844
agile	sprint	next	except
Pattern(s): 
if you can t get even that kind of agreement over a few weeks then your client is indeed burning money for no good reason except a tax write-off
i thought within agile especially the scrum method that the content an iteration or sprint was decided upon at the start and then the team would deliver that content in the allowed time your example of 3 weeks is a good one then you review and adjust for changes in the next sprint
no one likes to use the words fixed or signed-off to describe how a sprint works because it sounds too old school waterfall but agreement on sprint content such as a set of of user stories from the product backlog is essentially the same thing for each sprint just done more often than in non-agile projects
2030419
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
we say that the inherited relationship between a b and c is disjoint when a instances cannot be at the same time b instances and c instances instances of a supertype only appear at most in a subclassing
otherwise we say the inherited set is overlapping by default implementation of inherited in oo languages is disjoint

2030586
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
class in turn is a subclassing of module although arguably it shouldn t be because it violates the liskov substition principle but that is a discussion for another forum and is also a dead horse that has already been beaten many many times
and in you will find the definition you are looking for which class inherited from module and instances of class like integer understand
it returns true if its argument is an instance of itself
2032769
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
when compiled on my mac intel little-endian the output is integer value 2249459722 integer value 0x8614080a dotted decimal 10.8.20.134 when compiled on my sun sparc big-endian the output is integer value 2249459722 integer value 0x8614080a dotted decimal 134.20.8.10 using gcc 4.4.2 on the sparc i get a warning xx.c 4 warning this decimal constant is unsigned only in iso c90 using gcc 4.2.1 on mac - with lots of warnings enabled - i don t get that warning which is interesting. i can remove that by adding a u suffix to the integer constant
another way of looking at the problems is illustrated with the following code and the extremely fussy compiler settings shown above this fails to compile because of the -werror setting with the message remove the -werror setting and it compiles but then shows the next problem that you have - the one of not checking for error indications from functions that can fail direct operations integer value 2249459722 integer value 0x8614080a dotted decimal 10.8.20.134 indirect operations conversion failed for 2249459722 basically the sscanf function reports that it failed to convert the string to a signed integer because the value is too large to fit - see the warning from gcc 4.4.2 but your code was not checking for the error return from sscanf so you were using whatever value happened to be left in c at the time
so there are multiple problems with your code it assumes a particular architecture little-endian rather than recognizing that big-endian also exists
2032794
int	double
Pattern(s): 
consider the type of the division function that means division is defined for any two values of the same type that is an instance of fractional
int is not one of those types one definition of mean ought to cover all of and but without the rational bits and without the type annotation the type inferred for mean is because of the division by the length of the list
it turns out that int float and double are instances of the typeclass real and any real may be converted to rational and rational may be converted to fractional finally for large lists there s also a chance that we could overflow a machine double but rational gives us arbitrary precision
2034801
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
however you must specify the subclassing as dynamic or you will lose the ability to store data in an array
yes if you leave it blank it ll use the superclass default constructor which in the case of an array is actually a constructor with a default value set array numelements int 0 so by default you ll be creating an array with zero elements which i guess is probably what you want anyway
and don t forget this note from the docs you can extend the array class and override or add methods
2037048
fileinputstream	filechannel	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	fileoutputstream	filechannel
Pattern(s): 
such methods may be added in a future release
in this release a file channel can be obtained from an existing fileinputstream fileoutputstream or randomaccessfile object by invoking that object s getchannel method which returns a file channel that is connected to the same underlying file
that is with java 1.6 you can t get a filechannel without using old java.io
2038204
ienumerable	ienumerator
Pattern(s): 
foreach operates on ienumerable which requires a new ienumerator class to be instantiated
array types are special types recognized by the compiler so if the compiler already knows that the ienumerable is actually an array then it compiles down to indexed access instead which is much cheaper
this little performance tweak is simply an implementation detail however
2038541
typedef	typename
Pattern(s): 
if you know in advance that t is never a reference to avoid the reference-to-reference problem you can also do this directly if what you wanted to do is to create a reference data member your syntax without typedef was correct i do not know what you want to do exactly
you forgot typedef
the typename just says that you are going to use a typename that at the point of the template declaration is not yet known as a type
2039191
truecrypt	umount	truecrypt	umount
Pattern(s): 
truecrypt is free in both senses and it s accessible via command line parameters from your application mount before start umount before quit
you could also try to create a truecrypt file-based containter mount it and then put the dbase file inside the mounted encrypted volume
truecrypt is free in both senses and it s accessible via command line parameters from your application mount before start umount before quit
2040631
primefaces	trinidad
Pattern(s): 
myfaces trinidad is also an option as indicated by the op
primefaces have wonderful graph components
you can give them a try
2041091
persistent	transient
Pattern(s): 
each activity will have a call a savestate you ve created in your application
since this will get called a lot you will need to make it as efficient as possible ideally only writing changed data to persistent storage
you should also note that onsaveinstancestate should be used only for storing the transient state of an activity
2044021
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
assuming a smart compiler the difference should be much smaller on a 64-bit system because a 64-bit signed int - double conversion can be used to efficiently do a 32-bit unsigned conversion
edit to illustrate this if the int variables are signed should compile into something along these lines mov data eax imul ecx eax cvtsi2sd eax xmm1 addsd xmm1 xmm0 on the other hand if the int variables are unsigned cvtsi2sd can t be used to do the conversion so a software workaround is required
i would expect to see something like this mov data eax mul ecx might be slower than imul cvtsi2sd eax xmm1 convert as though signed int test eax eax check if high bit was set jge 1f if it was we need to adjust the converted addsd 2 32 xmm1 value by adding 2 32 1 addsd xmm1 xmm0 that would be acceptable codegen for the unsigned - double conversion
2044282
int	double
Pattern(s): 
don t worry about endianness either since that s a matter of bitwise representation
converting int to float can lose precision if the int value is large in absolute value
it is less likely to with double since double is more precise and can represent many more exact numbers
2044347
awt	swing	awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
sun s swing tutorial is a pretty good starting point
there s really no point in learning awt first
swing replaces a lot of awt s concepts and components but integrates many others unchanged such as layout managers
2044538
x86	64bit	x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
if you want to ensure your code works on virtually all x86 processors out there stick to the 386 instruction set if your code is 32-bit or early x86-64 instruction set if it s 64bit
historically x86 has been very backward compatible
x86-64 has thrown away some very old instructions like bcd instructions but it s unlikely that these kind of changes are going to happen again at least not until something huge as 64bit address space transition happens
2045870
int	double
Pattern(s): 
all that matters is the ranges and precisions of the types
assuming 32 bit int and ieee 32 bit floats it s possible for an int- float conversion to be imprecise
assuming also 64 bit ieee double it is not possible for an int- double conversion to be imprecise because all int values can be exactly represented as a double
2047191
restrict	shared
Pattern(s): 
are some projects closely related to shared most changes with other projects
if you have multiple developers and want to restrict them to working on certain projects customers you may have to publish to multiple repositories if the git service you are using does not allow for per-branch permissions
but the history management is the part that is best to get right

inherited	properties	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
your class does not inherited from displayobject so the stage properties does not exist for your class
even if your class did inherited from displayobject it needs to be added to the stage via addchild from a parent display object
if your class is not meant to be a display object but needs the stage object for measurements or other properties send it as an argument to the constructor
2047883
zipoutputstream	zipfile
Pattern(s): 
replace these lines with upload some files. ftp.stor new file c sms.zip
if this doesn t help then in addition try closing the zipoutputstream before you send the file with ftp
there s a chance that the zipfile has not been created yet on the file system just because the stream is still open
2048884
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	pascal	delphi	pascal	delphi
Pattern(s): 
if it is a windows server delphi is also possible but free versions are hard to get if at all nowadays
you don t name server type but free pascal comes with nearly every linux distribution nowadays as well in the freebsd ports and on mac os x x86+ppc + 64-bit of both via fink or standalone .dmg installer
for windows and dos there are normal all-in-one installers at if you want more delphi like rad editing you probably want lazarus also available for the above platforms except for dos solaris x86+sparc exist but are a bit experimental
2049361
aggregate-functions	sum	aggregate-functions	sum
Pattern(s): 
use this instead when used with over clause sum becomes the analytical function rather than the aggregate one
it does not shrink several records into one instead it returns the total value along with each record -- this is an aggregate-functions
it shrinks all records into one record and returns the total sum with q name number as select test1 0 union all select test2 22 union all select test3 28 select sum number from q -- 50 -- this is an analytical function
2049827
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
so the standard is to not show any leading zeros
you could format it as a string with leading zeros but the int itself is just a numeric representation
keep in mind that the language needs a way to represent the int to you as a series of chars and that it needs to be deterministic because otherwise it would have no way to choose
2051084
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
i would then try an approach using hibernate inheritance i didn t tested the snippet above but i m fairly convinced that your scenario can be mapped one way or the other
the is maybe superfluous but it shows the fact that the parent superclass should not be instanciated
the subclassing has no additional property so the subclassing tag is empty
2051641
multiplying	multiplication
Pattern(s): 
solving for x where i is the identity matrix and 1 l is the inverse of l so note that matrix multiplication is not commutative so is not the same in general as
you don t want to multiplying the matrixes if you want to transform one matrix into the other
you want to find the matrix you need to multiplying one by to go from one to the other
2052156
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 
to get my mysql working i simply had to do sudo chmod -rf 777 opt local var db mysql5 the attempt to do sudo -u _mysql mysql_db5 failed but i could then do mysqladmin -u root passwd the_new_password without any problem
if you don t want mysql to start automatically when you turn the machine on simply do this sudo launchctl unload -w library launchdaemons org.macports.mysql5.plist then to start stop mysql start sudo opt local etc launchdaemons org.macports.mysql5 mysql5.wrapper start stop sudo opt local etc launchdaemons org.macports.mysql5 mysql5.wrapper stop hope this helps

2052357
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
first though run the command which will edit the easy-install.pth file in that directory or you can edit the file yourself to remove the line for pyobjc 2.2
that should then revert back to the apple-supplied versioning which is installed elsewhere
if you are using another versioning of python and installed pyobjc yourself you still may be able to use easy_install to revert to it since normally easy_install does not remove previous versions when you upgrade
2053500
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
Pattern(s): 
basically each uiviewcontroller has a little stub uinavigationitem which contains metadata about how that view should be referenced inside a uinavigationcontroller
by default that metadata just falls back to the uiviewcontroller itself
assuming self is the uiviewcontroller of the view that s visible inside the uinavigationcontroller set
2053901
cos	sin
Pattern(s): 
sin ϕ dub + cos ϕ ams
cos ϕ dub
cos δλ the angle c in radians is then converted to a distance by multiplying by the radius of the earth
2054304
multiplying	modulo
Pattern(s): 
modulo is also very helpful
if you happen to want to multiplying or divide by a power of two i commend to you the c left shift and right shift operators
these work perfectly for numbers that are represented using the c types unsigned or unsigned long
2055664
set	bag
Pattern(s): 
the asset is a way to explicitly change your hasmany to a set in situations where fnh might not be able to determine it by type for example if you re exposing your collection as an ienumerable it would default to a bag and calling asset would override that
assuming your type is an iesi set then there s no difference
the hasmany call on it s own is smart enough to figure out that you want a set
2056040
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
build dynamically a new c class containing all the public properties of both a and b
you can t as multiple inherited is only for interfaces in c#
hacks i ii iii as for the dto maybe these links 1
2056590
textmate	notepad++
Pattern(s): 
i believe that notepad++ is a similar tool for windows but i am unsure if it is as customizable as textmate
on mac os x textmate provides a near perfect solution to this problem
textmate is a programming editor that offers support for hundreds of programming languages and is customizable via the bundle editor
2060117
jnetpcap	libpcap
Pattern(s): 
their last release was 2007
in contrast jnetpcap has had very recent releases
the underlying libpcap c library that they both wrap has continued to evolve so i would go with jnetpcap for that reason
2060581
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
for mysql this is achieved via appending to your query
postgresql uses separate syntax
the idea is you limit the number of results returned to the actual number you want to display
2062617
src	attr
Pattern(s): 
this certainly is a bug but not an insurmountable one
tested and works demo online -- with -- -- works with your original syntax too -- an interesting bug we know that our src value is foo.jpg yet the following fails so i was curious if jquery s interpretation of the src would be equal to the string literal source i provided in the html this makes the whole situation very strange
jquery argues that the src value is not equal to foo.jpg when you pass it in as part of the selector but it is equal to the string literal when you compare from a call to attr
2063834
appfuse	spring
Pattern(s): 
it was originally developed to eliminate the ramp-up time found when building new web applications for customers
at its core appfuse is a project skeleton similar to the one that s created by your ide when you click through a wizard to create a new web project
for the data layer jpa hibernate or another jpa provider for the middle tier spring - it is extremely powerful and provides many things like transaction support schedulling etc
2065300
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
i hadn t time to test this solution please let us know if it s working
i m not sure this is working but here is an idea based on some investigation is made in the datagrid s source code using reflector 1 create a class which inherited datagridcellspanel
this is the panel that is used internally by the datagrid in order to arrange the cells 2 override the bringindexintoview method by an empty method without calling the base method 3 set the itemspaneltemplate properties in your xaml it seems that when a mousedown event occurs at some point the bringindexintoview method of the panel is called to do the auto-scroll
2066042
reportlab	xhtml2pdf
Pattern(s): 
edit another option i d forgotten about is wkhtmltopdf
as answered by jbochi reportlab is the foundation for almost all python projects that generate pdf
but for your needs you might want to check out pisa xhtml2pdf
2066473
margin	height
Pattern(s): 
in your example this shouldn t be an issue since you know the height of the parent container
margin auto does not work for vertical alignment
you must give an exact number in px em etc
2067260
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 
it is managed by the processors and provides a way to ensure that data needed by the cpu is close at hand so that it does not have to wait for the bus to fetch it
it is totally up to the cpu to ensure that what is in main memory is the same as what is stored in the cache
the only time one really needs to worry about cache is when using dma
2067470
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
for example if was c then would be 2 since c is the 3rd chars in the chars set
then all operations would be performed on that int vector removing the necessity for a find operation on the string

2067958
interpreted-language	compiled-language
Pattern(s): 
the advantage of compiled-language is mainly speed and deeper ties with the internals of the operating system
but for most desktop apps the ease of development in an interpreted-language outweighs any small performance gains unless you are writing a cpu intensive app in which case write the cpu heavy bits in c and then call them from the interpreted-language which can handle the gui many interpreted-language offer easy escapes to c or other languages often with a nice inline syntax
i would encourage you to take a look at some examples on to see the fundamental differences between how programs come together with the languages you are interested in
2069499
multiplying	add
Pattern(s): 
but it s correct factoring in limits on ints and so forth
so using a left-shift is just a shortcut for multiplying by 2
but once you get to the highest power-of-2 under b you just add a the necessary number of times so or something close to that
2069952
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 
essentially this means x a + b + c ... x a + x b + x c .
any real number in your case 7 can be presented as a series of additions such as 8 + -1 since subtraction is really just addition going the wrong way
this allows you to represent any single multiplication statement as an equivalent series of multiplication statements which will come up with the same result the bitwise shift operator essentially just multiplies or divides a number by a power of 2
2072650
int	chars	unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 
quoting from 4.1.5 c# supports nine integral types sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong and chars
... the integral-type unary and binary operators always operate with signed 32-bit precision unsigned 32-bit precision signed 64-bit precision or unsigned 64-bit precision ... for the binary + | and operators the operands are converted to type t where t is the first of int uint long and ulong that can fully represent all possible values of both operands
the operation is then performed using the precision of type t and the type of the result is t or bool for the relational operators
2073928
base	fractions
Pattern(s): 
if the input goes to 1 we re through
the log of 1 for any base is 0 which means we don t need to add any more
if result + fractions is not greater than result then we ve hit the limits of precision for our numbering system
2074890
globalization	localization	globalization	localization
Pattern(s): 
so you can think of globalization as a strategic venue where as localization is tactical
msdn globalization vs
localization
2074906
globalization	localization
Pattern(s): 
making your software localizable localization is adapting your software to a particular local market providing translations for text messages in your software sometimes adjusting screen layout to fit longer text
globalization is making your software ready for international markets format and parse numbers dates etc
according to the user s locale handle international text .
2075264
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
these are good candidates for inlining whether it be as #define macros or inline functions
yes i know inline is only a suggestion but in this case i consider it as a reminder to the compiler. remove dead and redundant code if the code isn t used or does not contribute to the program s result get rid of it
simplify design of algorithms i once removed a lot of assembly code and execution time from a program by writing down the algebraic equation it was calculating and then simplified the algebraic expression
2075538
copying	overwrite
Pattern(s): 
your addentry function places a copy of these pointers into the list but the memory they point to is still owned by the caller it is in fact the first last and num arrays you declare in main that you then proceed to overwrite on the next iteration of the loop
what your addentry function needs to do instead of copying its input pointers is to allocate enough memory for the strings copy the inputs into that memory and retain the pointers to the copies
you will also need to make sure you free all the memory you have allocated once you are done with it
2078061
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
that directory can then be added to the web project solution
all of the references to the dlls should be made to the common folder pulled from tfs
that directory can be added to tfs as a folder
2078061
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
that directory can be added to tfs as a folder
everyone on the team will have to have the folder mapped locally with the same relative path to the solution file
the place where the minimal effort piece breaks down is that the files will have to be checked in out when compiled
2080951
post	get
Pattern(s): 
as a consequence it should be perfectly safe to resubmit a get request
post is not it is for updating information on the server
it can therefore not be assumed that it is safe to re-submit the request which is why most browsers ask for confirmation when you hit refresh on a post request
2081967
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
kernighan the k of k r wrote an understandably biased essay on pascal s limitations why pascal is not my favorite programming language
the prohibition on modifying what pascal calls the control variable of a for-loop combined with the lack of a break statement means that it is possible to know how many times loops body is executed without studying its contents
without a break statement and not being able to use the control variable after loops terminates is more of a restriction than not being able to modify the control variable inside loops as it prevents some string and arrays processing algorithms from being written in the obvious way
2082136
drive	createfile
Pattern(s): 
you are obviously already distributing this third party dll with your application so one more file doesn t seem like it is going to hurt you
standard users may not have write access to the exe and that would probably drive anti-virus nuts
and no createfilemapping and getmappedfilename definitely won t work since they don t give you a file name that can be passed to createfile
2082541
freemarker	velocity
Pattern(s): 
although velocity is really light-weight and easy-to-use it is somehow limited
i prefer freemarker for web page rendering because of large existing macro libraries and jsp inclusion support
i also recommend sitemesh for web page decoration to avoid a template file mixing content with decoration
2083832
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 
i know what gcc does but not how to use it
again man g++ info pages and other documentation is useful but the main use when you call it directly instead of through a build system will be g++ file.cpp -o name # to compile and link g++ file.cpp other.cpp -o name # to compile multiple files and link as name you can also write your own shell script below is my bin c++ simplified to incorporate cxxflags so you won t forget you can include any other option as well
now you can set that environment variable cxxflags the standard variable for c++ flags in your .bashrc or similar or redefine it in a particular session for working without a makefile which make does do just fine too
2086844
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
the information on the internet is scarce but in code it is explainable when you create your groupprincipal a context is added to it
this context is internally of a hidden type samstorectx which inherited from an abstract type storectx
each properties on the groupprincipal that you call will call isvalidproperty an internal member of samstorectx
2088075
clsid	createobject
Pattern(s): 
if it is an out-of-process object i suggest looking in the registry to see which program is registered as the server
first find the clsid by using the progid to find an entry in the registry
the progid is the human-readable string that can be used with createobject excel.application
2088075
clsid	createobject
Pattern(s): 
the progid is the human-readable string that can be used with createobject excel.application
the clsid is a 128-bit number in hex within a pair of curly braces
look at the registry entry look at the localserver32 entry underneath where is the class-id of the object
2088097
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
instead of storing a reference to the parent which you can do anyway for convenience purposes you store a reference to the left and right nodes for each given node
the entire path to a node can be determined in a single select query or conversely all the children of a node
the algorithm is harder to implement but it has performance benefits for read-heavy trees
2088188
daemons	systemd
Pattern(s): 
that s fragile mostly because of the need to determine whether a process may or may not have a breakpoint set at the crucial point of execution
alternatively you could further raise the technological stakes by having the daemons return not the password but rather the open socket ready to be wrapped in a db-api compliant wrapper
some unix systemd allow open file descriptors to be sent between unrelated processes a prereq for this approach -- and of course you d have to substantially rework the mysql-based db api to allow opening a connection around an already-open socket rather than a freshly made one
2089174
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
one reason behind developing them was exactly that the kind of visual fine-tuning you are trying to do here is unnecessarily difficult if not impossible with awt
awt is not the newest technology on the block
so unless you have a specific requirement to do work in awt i would recommend you to check out the modern replacements swing or swt - much more comfortable flexible customizable and predictable in their behaviour than awt
2089662
width	height
Pattern(s): 
then just make sure that the new font s height which is already given in points by the font size does not exceed the height of your table cell
you need to start by being able to measure the width of your text in the font that you have chosen
from the itextsharp documentation measuring text sometimes it s necessary to know the length of a certain piece of text
2090460
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
the safe way to extract a 32-bit integer from an arbitrary memory location is to declare a temporary 32-bit integer and perform a copy to it treating the source memory as a raw chars array or more generally with some function call overhead which is actually just the reverse of the memcpy you did to get the pointer there in the first place
although treating the pointer as an int is also dangerous if you re moving between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures as michael pointed out
pointers aren t always 32-bit integers
2091081
webkit	gecko
Pattern(s): 
while this is not technically related to gecko vs
webkit it is a great way to see how some of the browsers which implement the two engines are

2091108
webkit	gecko	webkit	gecko
Pattern(s): 
some other browsers using gecko include k-meleon for nix flock specialized for social networking and camino gecko in a native os x cocoa ui
to add to the other answers some things which differentiate the engines webkit is built to be suitable for a variety of environments including mobile and embedded systems
gecko includes an application-layer language based on web technologies called xul which can be used for cross-platform gui development and is employed in firefox thunderbird and add-ons for both
2091108
webkit	gecko	webkit	gecko
Pattern(s): 
gecko includes an application-layer language based on web technologies called xul which can be used for cross-platform gui development and is employed in firefox thunderbird and add-ons for both
webkit has gained popularity and helped to push a variety of new web standards most notably the drawing layer now adopted by every major engine besides trident the ie engine
gecko probably bears the greatest responsibility for reigniting browser innovation following a stagnation when netscape lost the browser wars to ie
2091344
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
so the size of the file you can handle will depend on which filesystems the hard disk has been formatted with and which operating system you are using although you are almost certainly using an operating system which can handle the upper limits of ntfs windows 2000 or above
the limit probably originates with the filesystems
fat32 has a limit of 4gb whereas ntfs has a much higher limit in the terabytes
2091807
springboard	multitasking	springboard	multitasking
Pattern(s): 
if you want multitasking just install backgrounder
springboard is a user-land application which hosts the homepage and many other services converting hid events to gsevents receiving push notification alarms etc. there aren t any framework nor kernel extensions called springboard
if you want multitasking just install backgrounder
2092338
entity-relationship	diagram
Pattern(s): 
it is from oracle and is going to be part of actual oracle installation from 11g onwards
it has a separate build modeler tool to engineer or re-engineer an entity-relationship model
other tool that may be useful that will help you more than just genereate entity-relationship diagram is schemaspy
2092732
width	height
Pattern(s): 
to have the height untouched you have to make sure the widths of the cells can hold the intented content
fixing the table width is probably something you want to try
or perhaps play around with the min-width of the table
2092812
printf	strlen	stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
the write should use strlen string + 1 so that it writes the nul terminator
your printf s are writing to stdout - but in both the parent and child you ve redirected file descriptor 1 to a pipe so that s where the printf output will go
instead of printf ... use fprintf stderr ... - then you ll be able to see the output since stderr is still pointing to your terminal
2093976
many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 
i have several other objections but the next most important one is inappropriateness
intersection tables are meant to represent many-to-many relationships
using them to represent one-to-many relationships is confusing and requires too many additional database objects for my liking
2094654
error-handling	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 
this will vary based on the matlab version you are using.
matlab versions 7.5 r2007b and newer new error-handling capabilities in the form of the mexception class were introduced in version 7.5
you can get information about the stack trace from mexception objects by creating and throwing a dummy exception-handling then immediately catching it and accessing the stack field
2095089
put	get
Pattern(s): 
then we dereference p by attaching the to the front of it to obtain the value of p
put simply means the address-of you will see that in placeholders for functions to modify the parameter variable as in c parameter variables are passed by value using the ampersand means to pass by reference
means the dereference of a pointer variable meaning to get the value of that pointer variable
2095685
pascal	delphi
Pattern(s): 
basically a delphi record is a c struct - delphi even supports the syntax to do things like have a record that can be accessed as either 4 16bit integers or a 2 32bit integers
like struct record dates back to before object oriented programming entered the language pascal era
like a struct a record is also an inline chunk of memory not a pointer to a chunk of memory
2096388
inline	inlining	inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 
as notnoop says in the comments the inlining is typically done by the jvm at execution time
java does not provide a way to manually suggest that a method should be inline
as notnoop says in the comments the inlining is typically done by the jvm at execution time
2097553
gridview	linqdatasource
Pattern(s): 
in addition i am populating the grid from a view which does not have a primary key. the solution involved 3 changes disabling updates for the linqdatasource changing the command name from update to myupdate so that linq does not try to auto-wire it setting the yieldgridview.editindex -1 prior to calling update on the updatepanel thanks for your help
after removing the updatepanel and turning off callbacks for the gridview i received the following error when clicking the update button could not find a row that matches the given keys in the original values stored in viewstate
ensure that the keys dictionary contains unique key values that correspond to a row returned from the previous select operation
2097709
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
in general any subclassing should be able to be used in any context that a base class would be
if manager s don t have .manager s then they aren t emp s and shouldn t inherited from them

2098154
folder	directory	temporary	tablespace	temp	tmp
Pattern(s): 
temporary here means that the data that is stored is temporary by nature not that the tablespace itself is temporary
think of it like of tmp directory in unix or temp folded in windows the directory folder itself is permanent but the data stored within it are temporary
reuse means do not fail if the file already exists usually used when the filename points to a raw device like unformatted disk partition to avoid os file management overhead
2102658
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
that s the kind of code that i used it for. second is that plt has a low-learning-curve scheme ide called drscheme
common lisp has a high-learning-curve emacs plugin called slime
in my experience slime is more powerful but there is enough learning required that you should probably take it into account if this is a semester-long project especially if you don t already use emacs
2103719
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
field access always completes immediately
avoid throwing exceptions from getter
do preserve previous values if a property setter throws an exception avoid observable side effects
2103731
qt-creator	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
however the next version of kdevelop looks very promising and will include these
you could also use eclipse if you wanted these features or move between eclipse and qt-creator as required
but i am very happy with qt-creator
2107549
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 
nslog the size of long long is d. sizeof long long
nslog the size of a unsigned char is d. sizeof unsigned char
nslog the size of unsigned short is d. sizeof unsigned short
2107549
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 
nslog the size of unsigned short is d. sizeof unsigned short
nslog the size of unsigned int is d. sizeof unsigned int
nslog the size of unsigned long is d. sizeof unsigned long
2107629
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
i suggest you read douglas crockford s article about prototypal inherited here he also shows how you can make javascript have look-alike inherited as in other oo languages and then explains that this actually means breaking javascript in a way it was not meant to be used
well in javascript there is no class inherited there is just prototype inherited
so you don t make a class truck and then mark it as a subclassing of automobile
2107982
folder	directory	folder	dir
Pattern(s): 
you have only one place the cd to change if you want more actions to take place in this folder -maxdepth 1 and -mindepth 1 make sure that find really only looks in the current dir and doesn t include
in the result -type d looks only for directory -printf f n prints only the found folder s name plus a newline for each hit
e voila
2108530
gridbaglayout	grouplayout	gridbaglayout	cardlayout	grouplayout	cardlayout
Pattern(s): 
a cardlayout causes the panel to always have the size of the biggest card
alternatively you could try using the new as of java 6 grouplayout instead of the gridbaglayout - it s imo much easier to use and almost as powerful

2108950
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
for example i have done a hg clone to get the source for mercurial itself and it is only 34.3 mb on an ntfs filesystems compared to the source code download which is 1.8 mb
mercurial will also make use of hardlinks if your filesystems supports it so there is little overhead if you clone a repository to another location on the same disk
one way of working is indeed to have each developer expose a public repository in which he pushes his own changes
2110677
inotifypropertychanged	icollectionview
Pattern(s): 
and so on.
in wpf you can bind not only to objects implementing inotifypropertychanged but also to dependency objects exposing dependency properties which are much more flexible than regular properties
there are also new interfaces for collections inotifycollectionchanged which allows collections to send notifications when items are added deleted or replaced icollectionview which defines how a collection is presented to the ui the wpf binding mechanism is also much more flexible than the windows forms bindings.
2112184
httpresponse	request
Pattern(s): 
if it returns an httpresponse object django won t bother calling any other request view or exception middleware or the appropriate view
it ll return that httpresponse
response middleware is always called on every response
2112319
rsa	aes
Pattern(s): 
the implementation is going to be equivalent in either language
rsa is available via third party libraries in both languages if you need asymmetric key crypto
so is aes if you need symmetric keys
2113226
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
therefore you should choose the form of loops that is most aesthetically appealing to you for most people that will be the for-each loops as that has less boilerplate code
if you are just wandering over the collection to read all of the values then there is no difference between using an iterator or the new for-loop syntax as the new syntax just uses the iterator underwater
if however you mean by loops the old c-style loops then the new for-loop or iterator can be a lot more efficient depending on the underlying data structure
2113226
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
to verify that the iterator is used underwater by the new for-loop syntax compare the generated bytecodes from the following two java snippets
first the for-loop and second the iterator as you can see the generated byte code is effectively identical so there is no performance penalty to using either form
therefore you should choose the form of loops that is most aesthetically appealing to you for most people that will be the for-each loops as that has less boilerplate code
2115956
factors	matrix	factors	matrix
Pattern(s): 
this is probably the test that your factors analysis algorithm is doing as well to see if the matrix is positive semidefinite. if you re suffering numeric problems some of the eigenvalues will probably be barely smaller than zero
try setting these entries to zero compute q d q -1 to get a new corrected c then submit that to your factors analysis algorithm
on the other hand if you find that your matrix c has truly negative eigenvalues then you know that you re going wrong somewhere in the construction of c

int	chars
Pattern(s): 
null is often used in schemas where a value is optional
it is a convenient method for omitting data entry for unknown fields without having to implement additional rules like storing negative values in an int field to represent omitted data
since the null value takes up only 1 bit of memory space they may be useful when optimising the database. using those values is much more efficient than default values chars s 8 bits and int s 16bits
2117723
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
edit when i wrote above that subclassing inherits supertype using prototypical inheritance i mean that all new instances of subclassing inherit from one particular instance of superclass not from the superclass type function itself
the difference is that when you do you are creating an instance of superclass
subclassing is just variable
2117808
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
even if you re hashing with simple salt really
second off md5 is no longer secure as a cryptographic hash function indeed it is not even considered a cryptographic hash function anymore as the forked one points out
you can generate different messages that hash to the same value
2117877
min	max
Pattern(s): 
min max width and height are accounted for as well as variable borderwidths
the only issue i m aware of is when the cursor movement is rapid and the size is within 20 pix of the min it sticks somewhat because of refresh rate
not a huge deal but i ll sort it
2118259
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
the successful collision attacks on md5 use differential cryptanalysis a tool which was designed to attack block ciphers in the first place
from a good block cipher to a good hash function there is a step which is not to be dismissed
with the merkle-damgård structure the hash function is secure if the underlying block cipher is resistant to related key attacks a rather obscure property against which block ciphers are rarely strengthened because for symmetric encryption related key attacks barely have any practical impact
2118682
wmv	ogg
Pattern(s): 
source code wise banshee does the video display from c# look here the c# source code consuming gstreamer and doing the video rendering is here the c supporting library to call into fluendo is available here for testing banshee you do not need to buy anything but your video codecs will be limited to ogg theora encoded videos
once you get fluendo s codecs you will be able to play wmv files

2118745
int	double
Pattern(s): 
the same thing happens for i 2 2 fact 2 2 2 1
it s because you re doing int division - the result of dividing one int by another is an int - since i factorial i is less than 1 for i 2 the result gets truncated to 0
you can fix this by converting the numerator and divisor to double edit for i 1 you have 1 1 which is 1 for int division and no truncation occurs
2120016
maven	m2e
Pattern(s): 
here it s debilitating because of the ide and the tools meant to make it usable fail to do so
the biggest reason maven has a bad rap is ide integration
yes i know about m2e
2120016
maven	m2e
Pattern(s): 
these hackarounds exist to try to get maven to behave inside of a tool they are not allowed to change rad 7.0
in my case the hackarounded maven builds only work inside netbeans
eclipse 3.5 with m2e chokes something horrible
2120016
maven	m2e
Pattern(s): 
eclipse 3.5 with m2e chokes something horrible
most of the devs here hate maven
they don t hate maven
2120846
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping	children	parent
Pattern(s): 
i am not copying the actual data
next i apply any sorting and filtering to the parent array perhaps by using an arraycollection wrapper and iterate through the parent copying the visible ones and their children if the parent is marked expanded to a display array
my grid them uses the display array as a simple not grouping dataprovider
2122428
fink	macports
Pattern(s): 
so in order to get g++ you ll have to use something like fink basically debian s apt system for os x darwin or macports basically openbsds ports system for os x darwin to get it
fink definitely has the right packages
on 2016-12-26 it had gcc 5 and gcc 6 packages
2123220
merb	ruby-on-rails
Pattern(s): 
look at equivalent example code - for instance look at something like a blogging engine - django has byteflow and ruby-on-rails has mephisto look at other frameworks including those using languages other than ruby and python
look at merb lift seaside cake grails and so on
and remember skill imagination and creativity are more important than framework choices
2123464
sse	avx
Pattern(s): 
of course it s far more geared towards 4-element vectors for rgba xyz type calculations than soa so will completely run out of steam when 8-way avx comes along but the general principles might be useful
you might want to take a glance at my attempt at simd non-simd vrep a templated base class with specializations for simd note how it distinguishes between floats-only sse and sse2 which introduced integer vectors.
more useful v4f v4i etc classes subclassed via intermediate v4
2123572
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
i may have gone off a tangent here by specifying the code demonstrating how to use setvbuf
#include int main void file input output
chars bufr 512
2123649
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
normally with nunit i d use a generic or parametrised fixture but i m not sure whether mstest has similar capabilities
in light of this here s how i d do this with nunit in a form that should be reproducible using any unit test framework via the template method pattern
steps define an abstract base class with all of the tests in it put in an abstract method called createstoragemanager that returns an istoragemanager or whatever interface the two dependencies implement subclass the fixture twice and provide an implementation of createstoragemanager that returns the concrete type you wish to use to run the tests
2124476
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
it shows the use of inherited when composition should have been used and how it could be refactored
inherited is pretty enticing especially coming from procedural-land and it often looks deceptively elegant
well one of the problems is that inherited is probably the worst form of coupling you can have your base class breaks encapsulation by exposing implementation details to subclassing in the form of protected members
2124476
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
the more tragic flaw however is the new subclassing brings with it all the baggage and opinion of the inherited chain
the article inherited is evil the epic fail of the dataannotationsmodelbinder walks through an example of this in c#
it shows the use of inherited when composition should have been used and how it could be refactored
2127570
notepad++	jedit
Pattern(s): 
you may also want to check out jedit i believe it offers similar functionality and may be more feature-rich for java than notepad++ is
i ve used notepad++ to do this for simple java projects and it worked quite well
here is a guide on how to do this
2127817
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
in that case you could keep the web application ignorant of the actual data and provide end-to-end encryption between the client and the final destination
no ssl provides strong encryption as it is
just make sure you force clients to use https and if you re really paranoid check if the cypher is strong enough
2128474
spweb	spsite
Pattern(s): 
for instance in your 3rd example you call spcontext.current.web
internally you can see it if you load the code in reflector it stores a reference to the spweb object and returns you the same object every time you call it
it means that different web controls in the same page use one single spsite object and one spweb object
2129706
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
not initialise temp to null since you set it in the for statement anyway
that would give you something like in order to use it to print to the standard output just use list_print stdout list
since stdout is simply a for standard output and you can also use stderr if you wish
2131491
stdout	stderr	stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 
stderr is usually unbuffered
stdout is usually line-buffered
stderr is usually unbuffered
2131782
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 
this will position the element relative to the screens no matter where the element is defined and how scrolled the page is
this would be done by switching from to

2131927
return-value-optimization	nrvo	return-value-optimization	nrvo
Pattern(s): 
if you want to return a named local variable nrvo applies instead and while it is slightly more complex for a compiler to implement it s doable and modern compilers have no problem with it
whenever compiler optimizations are enabled and in most compilers even when optimizations are disabled return-value-optimization will take place
nrvo is slightly less common but most compilers will perform this optimization as well at least when optimizations are enabled
2133585
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 
in conjunction to reed s answer i would like to point out that there is a similar thing that appears like an overloaded function realloc foo is non-null and size is zero realloc foo size
when you pass in a non-null pointer and size of zero to realloc realloc behaves as if you ve called free foo is null and size is non-zero and greater than 1 realloc foo size
when you pass in a null pointer and size is non-zero realloc behaves as if you ve called malloc hope this helps best regards tom
2133971
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
that will effectively make your schema harder to upgrade when that versioning of sql server will be released
the biggest disadvantage of text together with ntext and image is that it will be removed in a future versioning of sql server as by the documentation
that will effectively make your schema harder to upgrade when that versioning of sql server will be released
2135261
bazaar	rcs	bazaar	cvs
Pattern(s): 
it s what makes it possible to run bazaar st bazaar add and similar commands
since you describe the problem as emacs-specific it might be something wrong with the emacs mode you are using for driving bazaar
generally vc does not do what you would expect because it s designed for centralized version control systems such as rcs sccs cvs and subversion
2135593
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
the different states need to be modeled as a separate parent child inheritance tree
start with an abstract base class mystate which have as children mystate1 mystate2 and mystate3
see jeffrey s answer for an example
2135667
fitnesse	dbfit
Pattern(s): 
look at dbfit a set of fixtures designed to help with db set-up and verification
i see at least 2 types of tests that can be done with fitnesse tests or examples intended to specify domain logic or behavior
these i tend not to use with database access as this is usually not important to the purpose of the test
2135947
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
jsr is effectively a gosub it pushes the return address on the stack and invokes the bytecode at the specified offset it s usually used to implement finally -blocks so this code is probably used to jump to some string decryption subroutine i put decryption in quotes because it most likely isn t a strongly typographic decryption at work here
note that the code you post is not valid java code
the bytecode you de-compiled to get this was most likely obfuscated by some obfuscator that also obfuscates string constants the only obfuscater i use occasionally is zkm and that does something similar
2136490
atexit	main
Pattern(s): 
add a static function that checks if it is not null and if it is not null free s it
call atexit free_func at the start of the program where free_func is the static function
you can have some global setup routine caled by main where this is done
2137020
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
you need to pass the wtpversion on the command line or to configure the plugin in the pom.xml if you are using m2e then just import your project as a maven project right-click the package explorer then import.
maven projects
in both case your project should be recognized as a dynamic web module that you can run on server
2140577
ready	each
Pattern(s): 
log each request into a table and have your service poll that table to see what needs to be done
have your client poll that table to see when a result is ready possibly via ajax
this may not be appropriate for your application but is one way to handle this kind of problem
2141373
realloc	memset
Pattern(s): 
the only portable thing you can do is to set each pointer to null in a loop your primary problem is that your realloc call is wrong
realloc returns a pointer to the resized memory it doesn t necessarily resize it in-place
so you should do if you really want to know what the memset call should be you need to set to zero the memory starting at colors+colorcount and set i+1-colorcount members to zero but as i said above all bytes zero is not guaranteed to be a null pointer so your memset is useless anyway
2141406
xetex	xelatex
Pattern(s): 
prints the warning to the terminal
xetex has much better unicode support
the following run through xelatex produces é both in jobname.test and the output pdf
2141435
post	get
Pattern(s): 
you are correct that rails will trigger a sql call to get all results and then active_record should filter out the unique records
if you want to avoid that you can do the following this post has interesting analysis also with your line it is not returning unique results because you are not leveraging the relationships that you set up
you probably want to do something like good luck
2141639
gtk	xlib	gtk	vte	vte	xlib
Pattern(s): 
as for others xterm urxvt might not be the easiest thing to read for this since they ll be mapping between vt100 and xlib which is kind of low-level
an implementation that might be easier to read is vte terminal which gnome uses since it ll be mapping between vt100 and glib gtk which is probably a lot closer to what mac os x provides
good luck
2143045
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
ints chars and other ordinal types do not have method tables so there s no way to add methods or override them which is really the heart of inheritance
int is an ordinal type not a class
if you need to add functionality to int consider building an aggregate class which has an integer field and methods that expose whatever additional capabilities that you require
2143502
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
casting a double to an int does not round it ll discard the fraction part
int 99.99999 will be 99
casting a double to an int does not round it ll discard the fraction part
2145138
srp	principles
Pattern(s): 
also look into the inversion of control principles and how design changes when using ioc not necessarily an ioc container
i don t know that i d really call that type of class srp in the first place
everything dealing with foo is usually a sign that you re not following srp which is okay it s not appropriate for all types of designs
2146467
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
python 3.x docs.python.org 3 library http.client.html note https support is only available if python was compiled with ssl support through the ssl module
to verify if ssl is enabled try

2146474
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
search can safely be done with get since it won t alter anything
don t use post for search
search can safely be done with get since it won t alter anything
2148612
textinput	textfield
Pattern(s): 
the override of .childrencreated is needed to avoid attempting to set maxchars before the textinput object exists
my alternative is to use the protected textinput directly
this approach allows the maxchars property to be set in the gui builder or code just as you would for a normal textfield
2149649
valgrind	gprof
Pattern(s): 
the valgrind manual suggests using oprofile if you are on linux and need to profile the actual emulation of the program under valgrind
the problem is that you are using valgrind on a program compiled with -pg
you cannot use valgrind and gprof together
2149649
valgrind	gprof
Pattern(s): 
you cannot use valgrind and gprof together
the valgrind manual suggests using oprofile if you are on linux and need to profile the actual emulation of the program under valgrind

2150336
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
when using a subclassing of type as a metaclass the resulting class will be an instance of that metaclass as will any of its subclassing
however multiple inherited will be restricted
illustrating the differences note that when defining sub1 and sub2 no metaclass functions were called. they will be created exactly as if c1 and c2 had no metaclasses but instead had been manipulated after creation
2150336
inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
this is why i used super in the metaclass __new__ functions so each one can call the next one in the mro
certain use cases might need your classes to be of type type or might want to avoid the inherited issues in which case a metaclass function is probably the way to go
in other cases the type of the class might be truly important or you might want to operate on all subclassing in which case subclassing type would be a better idea
2151786
appkit	nsimage
Pattern(s): 
that depends on where you got the rect and where you re using it
in general core graphics and uikit use flipped co-ordinates origin upper-left positive y going down whereas appkit uses unflipped co-ordinates origin lower-left positive y going up
but it is possible to flip or unflip co-ordinates from each api and some classes such as nsimage and nsview make it very easy to do so
2152230
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
recv will only read one datagram even if there are many of them in the receive buffer and they all fit into your buffer.
remember udp is datagram oriented all operations are on those packets not on bytes.
a different scenario would be faced if you used tcp sockets..
2153138
executable	upx
Pattern(s): 
my own tool delphiunitsizes is an alternative that in addition to unit sizes also display the size of each function or class
delphi 2010 made the default executable about 30 larger probably because of rtti included in the rtl vcl units so you can use an older version of delphi for smaller exe-size
as others have mentioned upx is a great tool too the false positives by virusscanners are not that frequent in my experience
2154396
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
the general rule is quoting from effective java constructors must not invoke overridable methods directly or indirectly
the advantage is already described in the very same sun tutorial you linked to a final method cannot be overridden in a subclass
this is discussed in the lesson on interfaces and inherited
2155406
gtk	gdk	gtk	gdk	pygtk	gdk	pygtk	gdk
Pattern(s): 
it was added in gdk 2.10
if your version of gtk pygtk is recent enough key events have a attribute
it s not documented in the pygtk reference but it s in the gdk api documentation and is exposed through pygtk
2155896
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 
the mouse seems fast but in reality it isn t precise so you lose time in addition to the constant back and forth with the keyboard
vim has a long list of moving commands see help usr_03 which when mastered are faster than the mouse in most situations
# f t ...
2159769
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
with the 64-bit runtime on the mac you don t need an ivar synthesize generates one for you
note that there are numerous keywords you can use with your properties declaration to control what sort of synthesized accessor code is created such as readonly for a getter-only accessor copy atomic nonatomic and so on
more information is in the objective-c 2.0 programming language documentation
2161072
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
similarly the k is visible in the subclassing without qualifying it
there is no polymorphism here only inherited of the contents of a name space
static methods and all fields do not have polymorphic dispatch in java so can only be hidden by subclassing not overridden
2161072
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
static methods and all fields do not have polymorphic dispatch in java so can only be hidden by subclassing not overridden
the post you link to in your comments is using inherited in a somewhat unconventional way mixing it up with polymorphism
you can have polymorphism without inherited and inherited without polymorphism
2161966
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
after the laughter died down he explained that the real problem wasn t classes per se but rather implementation inheritance the extends relationship
interface inheritance the implements relationship is preferable
you should avoid implementation inheritance whenever possible
2162881
free	malloc	free	calloc
Pattern(s): 
the c++ declaration is roughly equivalent to the c declaration but in c++ you can do this and in c this is illegal unless you have a c99 compliant compiler -std c99 in gcc you can t have arrays with variable numbers of elements in c so you have to resort to calloc or malloc and do your own memory management like this in this case i m assuming that you re going to unfold your array of arrays into a single long c array of integers large enough to hold the answer so you can reduce the number of bits of memory you have to manage
to accomplish this i would use a call like in main which also means you ll have to call free mat when you re finished with it at the end of main
i m also assuming that you re unfolding the array so that you no longer have an array of arrays
2164697
feof	fread
Pattern(s): 
in pseudo code
you should never use feof it is almost always the wrong thing to do
instead use the return value of fread to determine when you have read everything - so long as it is non-zero you need to keep reading and sending
2167003
subclass	abstract-class
Pattern(s): 
and i think that there is a good reason for this too if your method in the subclass is merely an implementation of an abstract method then i think it would be correct to leave the abstract-class name in there
on the flip side if your method in the subclass is not just a simple implementation and does something more that is noteworthy enough to be mentioned in the javadoc then you should write a new javadoc on the method in the subclass instead of invoking inheritdoc

2167432
lzo	mapreduce
Pattern(s): 
for mapreduce lzo sounds a good balance between compression ratio and compress decompress speed
consider using lzo compression
it s splittable
2168008
hide	show	hide	show
Pattern(s): 
however i ve experienced making the form show again does not always work. so if you re encountering the same problem you could use something like this
making the form hide with form.hide should pose no problems
however i ve experienced making the form show again does not always work. so if you re encountering the same problem you could use something like this
2169446
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 
they could even get stuck in a state where it is nearly impossible to swipe between screens because of the widgets covering the touchable area
so the way i would recommend thinking of widgets is as a window into the key information associated with your app to jump into more details of that information by tapping on the widget and switching to the app and possibly some additional buttons to perform key operations
also as of 2.0 with the new wallpaper themes you can make the ui of the activity that the user visits from your widget sit on top of the same wallpaper as home
2170452
sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 
if you ve got a large k then the difference between o nk and o nlogn would be acceptable
you could pad them all to be the same length but there s no real reason to run a sorting algorithm to determine that a length 5 number in binary is larger than a length 2 one
you would likely get better performance by grouping the numbers by length and running your radix sort within each grouping
2170700
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
deserialization is the process of using the serialized state to reconstruct the object from the serialized state to its original state
serializable is the process of taking an object instance and converting it to a format in which it can be transported across a network or persisted to storage such as a file or database
the serialized format contains the object s state information
2171525
heapsort	in-place
Pattern(s): 
0 and any n
in theory the second one is superior to advanced versions of heapsort
in practice due to the overhead in the index manipulation our fastest in-place mergesort behaves still about 50 per cent slower than the bottom-up heapsort
2171525
mergesort	heapsort	mergesort	in-place
Pattern(s): 
in practice due to the overhead in the index manipulation our fastest in-place mergesort behaves still about 50 per cent slower than the bottom-up heapsort
however our implementations are practical compared to mergesort algorithms based on in-place merging
jyrki katajainen tomi pasanen jukka teuhola practical in-place mergesort 1996
2171732
uitabcontroller	navigationcontroller
Pattern(s): 
i hope that helps
i haven t done it with a uitabcontroller but in my uinavigationcontroller i have a point where i need to go to a regular uiview before returning back to the uinavigationcontroller
what i do when a user clicks on the screen in my navigationcontroller is simply use a this.view.addsubview with my new uiview that i want to show
2171798
gridview	repeater	gridview	repeater
Pattern(s): 
i prefer using a repeater almost every time but i can see the usefulness of the gridview
the gridview is for tabular data only and does a lot of the work for you like binding data automatically to columns
the repeater gives you more control over the result but you have to do more because nothing gets binded automatically
2171878
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
so all you can do is keep track of the class hierarchy yourself
having a common superclass makes it slightly easier because you can have the new object add its own class to a global class collection if not already present in the superclass constructor but unfortunately this will not work for abstract-class because no instances are ever created
keeping track of superclass subclassing relations for a known subset of classes is easy enough
2172461
operands	scalar
Pattern(s): 
binary || performs a short-circuit logical or operation
that is if the left operands is true the right operands is not even evaluated
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated
2172568
automake	autotools
Pattern(s): 
the user who invokes the configure script will not need to have any of the autotools installed at all
it doesn t make any sense to check for the automake version at configure time
the configure script is run long after automake and may be running on a box on which automake is not installed at all
2172876
vb.net	vb6	vb.net	vb6	vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 
here s a 2002 microsoft msdn article on how to write office add-in in vb6
alternatively you could migrate your vba to vb.net as a vsto add-in
vb.net is fully supported whereas only the vb6 runtime is now supported
2173204
free	malloc	free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
your code should look something like this calling malloc 0 is a little weird i think
yes you have to free it or you ll leak the memory
your code should look something like this calling malloc 0 is a little weird i think
2173485
pop-up	dialog
Pattern(s): 
other than that as long as all your windows come from the same domain i don t see any problems with cross-window communication as long as you have only one parent that opens all the windows and that can serve as a broker in intra-window communication the pop-up windows know only window.opener
pop-up are a delicate matter these days because of pop-up blockers
if at all possible using inline dialog boxes like jquery dialog is preferable - they all reside within one page though of course
2175178
accessor	properties	accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
for basic member access a field properties directly off the object with from there you can do pretty much anything
in particular you can get the get set accessor if you want to create a delegate or use getvalue setvalue
note that in .net 4.0 you can set properties directly on an expression but the c# compiler doesn t add any extra support for this so you d need to write your own expression by hand
2175848
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
ssl is transparent for developers you create your app exactly the same as you would for non secure server
you do need to have a ssl certificate that you can buy or generate yourself and set up your server to handle it
then depending on the protocol http or https your session will be or won t be encrypted automatically
2175860
16-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 
hope you would not hang on these questions so long since it is obsolete concept
it refers to very old concept of 16-bit memory model
32bit 64bit computers know nothing about these memory models
2176970
sn.exe	signtool
Pattern(s): 
signtool - the sign tool is a command-line tool that digitally signs files verifies signatures in files or time stamps files
sn.exe - strongname tool
allowing you to generate strong name keys for your assemblies also catering for signatures
2177226
post	get
Pattern(s): 
however storing the same data within a docdb would most likely be rather different
you d probably have something like a collection of post documents each of which would have its own author and collection of comments embedded right in
of course that s probably not the only way you could do it and it is somewhat a compromise now querying for a single post is fast - you only do one operation and get everything back but you have no way of maintaining the relationship between authors and posts since it all becomes part of the post document
2178101
int	chars	int	double	nsinteger	double
Pattern(s): 
it is possible to create a nsnumber object from a signed or unsigned chars short int int long int long long int float double or bool. among the two nsnumber can only be used in collections such as nsarray where an object is required but nsinteger cannot be used there directly
if you declare your int as an nsinteger or a c-style primitive int then what you say is true
but not if you are using the nsnumber class
2178276
width	font-size	width	height
Pattern(s): 
font-size 150 is the same as font-size 1.5em i think
i find it more useful to use em for height or width
if you use it for width then the text won t change wrap points when changing the size of your font when the user changes font size

int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
a vb6 int is now a short aka int16
a vb6 long is now an int aka int32
a vb6 boolean was an odd duck now equivalent to short where the value true is -1 and false is 0
2178324
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
a vb6 boolean was an odd duck now equivalent to short where the value true is -1 and false is 0
start by changing long in the function declaration to int that s the big one

2179548
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
instead use salt combining a static salt name of the page for example and the username of the user together with the password
a hash that takes a long time isn t better than a fast hash a hash that results in a large digest is better than a hash that results in a short digest due to brute force
using sha1 should be good enough for a normal site ie not a bank or a secret military organization
2181352
haskell	scheme
Pattern(s): 
if your primary goal is to learn a really new programming paradigm then scheme lacks some features that are very important to many functional programmers programming with pattern matching partial application of curried functions a polymorphic static type system pure functional computation if you want exciting ideas try haskell
haskell makes it a lot harder for you to program your old thoughts in the new language
instead haskell forces you to think new thoughts
2181537
free	malloc	free	malloc	free	calloc
Pattern(s): 
if the string pointers are set by malloc or calloc that is the proper way
if they are statically assigned to constants then don t free them that way and all that s needed is free primary
freeing something which was not malloc d will give the heap manager a heart seizure
2187462
directx	direct2d	directx	gdi
Pattern(s): 
however it does use the gdi for font rasterization not hardware accelerated and there is a significant performance hit try it its actually very noticable
as of directx 11 though fonts will be rendered with direct2d and be hardware accelerated
the fastest way to render text is using what s called bitmap fonts
2188556
hash	salt	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
the process of salting before hashing makes it harder to use a dictionary attack without knowing your salt
consider the following the resulting hash is now b58ad809eece17322de5024d79299f8a but alice s password is still secret
now if mallory gets her hands on the salt hash chances are she will not find the answer in her dictionary
2189123
jstl	taglib
Pattern(s): 
to learn more about jstl check the java ee tutorial part ii chapter 7
note that jstl and el are two separate things
jstl is a standard taglib and el just enables to access backend data programmatically
2189996
info.plist	ipa
Pattern(s): 
while cfbundlename is the filename of the ipa and the folder for the app on the file system whatever for example would be archived as whatever.ipa and the app would be installed on a device under the folder called whatever.app
the field that you have to change is the bundle display name cfbundledisplayname is the raw key name in the info.plist file from to your desired name
note cfbundledisplayname is different from cfbundlename
2190030
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
Pattern(s): 
in my experience svcutil.exe is quite picky about its xml structures - so don t be surprised if it barks at you with tons of warnings and or errors
the xsd.exe tool predates wcf and doesn t know anything about and
if you do use xsd.exe you ll have to switch wcf to use the xmlserializer instead of its default datacontractserializer for serializing the data contracts
2191720
nssortdescriptor	nspredicate
Pattern(s): 
any subsequent descriptors are used to further refine sorting of objects with duplicate values
see nssortdescriptor for additional information
some filtering with nspredicate is required too i have no idea if this is the most efficient method but until you have reason to believe that it is causing problems there s no need to worry the performance implications
2192386
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
you used the u specifier for printf which is an unsigned int for a unsigned chars variable that is incorrect and does not match up
that explains as you have discovered yourself that using an unsigned int or int works as there was sufficient room to hold the values on input
hope this helps best regards tom
2193351
int	double
Pattern(s): 
so use lf in the scanf and f in the printf
d means decimal int
you are using double s not int s
2195221
trie	tree
Pattern(s): 
if you mean caching the values of the keys already in the hash table that s up to the hash table
when you compare the hash map to the map also try a trie or related data structure whatever you can get off the shelf trie implementation unfortunately you may then spend a lot of time worrying about cache-friendliness
in that respect a trie is similar to the tree you already have and a hash map will probably be better-behaved than a naively-allocated tree
2196796
width	height
Pattern(s): 
more info about this behavior disclaimer yes this is my own blog and i think i did a thorough job of explaining the box model so i m putting it as reference
the reason why it s like that is that technically the width of elements is supposed to apply to the content not the container
according to the css1 specification released by the world wide web consortium w3c in 1996 and revised in 1999 when a width or height is explicitly specified for any block-level element it should determine only the width or height of the visible element with the padding borders and margins applied afterward
2197946
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 
see org.eclipse.swt.widgets.scrollbar.java at any given moment a given scroll bar will have a single selection that is considered to be its value which is constrained to be within the range of values the scroll bar represents that is between its minimum and maximum values
in the jdt java editor realm the range is strongly linked to the number of lines a source file has
adding artificial logical lines to allows scrolling past the last line would have unintended consequences on many other parts of the jdt related to displaying informations based on the line number of a source file like a compilation error red underline
2198161
packets	multicast	packets	multicast
Pattern(s): 
this is assuming of course that multicast is available in your scenario and your not talking across routing domains
simply use the hello packets contents such as ipv4 unicast address to ensure you know what you should be talking to
of course you don t need to use multicast you can just send a broadcast to 255.255.255.255 which is not a complex task and then listen for these messages
2199840
sharpmap	proj
Pattern(s): 
there is also an r-type index library -
sharpmap is a well known and used opensource collection of spatial libraries for .net commercial libraries from esri would be the most widely used
if you don t want to create indexes in the database then you will be stuck using shapefiles update i ve not used nts or jts but there is also a c++ implementation of jts at which has an active user community and i ve used on a couple of proj
2200296
verilog	vhdl
Pattern(s): 
to buy get a relatively cheap cyclone iii eval board from altera or altera s 3 this cyclone iii one with nios for 449 or this for 199 or xilinx
regardless of what charles stewart says verilog is a fine place to start
it reminds me of c just as vhdl reminds me of ada
2200296
verilog	hdl
Pattern(s): 
for a verilog book i recommend these especially verilog hdl
verilog does parallel work trivially unlike c
to buy get a relatively cheap cyclone iii eval board from altera or altera s 3 this cyclone iii one with nios for 449 or this for 199 or xilinx
2200833
maven	cobertura
Pattern(s): 
question how may we use maven to improve our overall code quality in projects
possible answer maven has several plug-ins to force meassure code quality in projects we could integrate those into our buildscripts in almost no time
checkstlye pmd cobertura xradar... examples 2 goal creating automated deployment scripts for several destination environments
2202675
range	infinity
Pattern(s): 
if you map the range as shown above in the left-to-right increasing order it will work correctly by itself
note that only the endpoints of the range are inserted into the map meaning that the memory consumption and the performance of the search depends only on the total number of range and completely independent of their total length
if you wish you can add a guard element to the map during the initialization it corresponds to negative infinity and the miss check will become simpler but that s just a matter of personal preference
2203285
installation	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
note the use of a source version of dnn for production use is not recommended additionally it is my personal recommendation to not modify the source unless you are truly willing to accept that future upgrade might not be possible due to your modifications
for the setup you will follow the standard installation process using the website folder as the root for the configuration within iis
i have an installation tutorial on my blog that you can use the specific tutorial is for 5.0.0 but the installation process is the same
2205998
codeigniter	pyrocms	codeigniter	pyrocms
Pattern(s): 
pyrocms is very very good but if you need basic applications go with my recommendations
you are probably safe with studying bambooinvoice.org and myclientbase since they are very basic codeigniter applications
i wouldn t recommended reading pyrocms code yet
2207165
subclass	inherited	subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
but i would suggest that bozho s idea is the better one - the fact that you need to do this indicates a bigger problem that probably shows inherited is not the right solution here
in the latest junit you can use the rule annotation on the subclass to inspect the test name and intercept the test run to ignore the test dynamically
but i would suggest that bozho s idea is the better one - the fact that you need to do this indicates a bigger problem that probably shows inherited is not the right solution here
2209239
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
then when you want to get the path if you have an obj with id you would say or for question in jquery i leave how you want to display up to you
new version given the code above here is the javascript that will work tested on jsbin but i can t save it because of work firewalls. change the html like this original post here is a trick using just javascript and no library
make an object with the field names equal to ids then you can reference the object to get the data using array notation
2209380
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
like of course the big catch to this is that you pretty much have to re-invent the int class
side note in my humble opinion writing n++ on an int object is extremely misleading
this relies on a feature of java called autoboxing where it converts primitives to their corresponding boxing objects -- like int to int or boolean to boolean -- automatically and without warning
2210640
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
i just upgrade to 4.0 rc1 and it seems to be working now
i think the problem may have been that i was using an older versioning of flexunit4
i just upgrade to 4.0 rc1 and it seems to be working now
2211261
multiplying	division
Pattern(s): 
edit a better implementation would properly round the division results so 134 130 and 136 140
in your move control you could adjust the left and top by dividing and then multiplying by the width of your lines it s not perfect but it it simple
of course since controls don t have a moveend event you ll have to track the mousebutton state or something similiar
2211820
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
Pattern(s): 
the rest of the elements are going to be written to and the last element that you set to zero will be overwritten if you have even number of elements
now about your realloc call this has the following problems realloc null size is equivalent to malloc size so you should replace your realloc with malloc
you don t need to cast the return value from malloc calloc and realloc
2213116
hash	salt	hash	hmac
Pattern(s): 
hmac is basically imagine that the variables username expires ip_address and a salt a random number have been stored in the httponly cookie
you extract them as well as your hash that was also in the cookie
in your script you have an additional password which is never directly stored in the cookie the security of this hash is based upon the quality of the password
2213867
subversive	javahl	subversive	javahl
Pattern(s): 
as documented get the right version of javahl
subversive is the other eclipse client for svn but for your error the solution is indeed to upgrade
as documented get the right version of javahl
2214440
calloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 
null checking omitted for clarity
the function calloc will ensure all bytes in the memory returned are set to 0
malloc makes no such guarantees
2214991
post	get
Pattern(s): 
in your case this would solve the problem because rendering the partial view with ajax form on your master should always be called as get
you ajax makes post anyway

2215853
wadl	wsdl
Pattern(s): 
xrd which has its roots in the identity community looks different
wadl web application description language wadl is a standard to describe http-based web applications typically rest web services
so wadl can be seen as a rest equivalent of wsdl 1.1
2219057
idictionary	icollection
Pattern(s): 
edit hmm idictionary does not implement icollection which is a bit of a pain
this however works albeit a hack the above approach will work for instances of dictionary however if you are testing a method that returns idictionary it might fail if the implmentation changes
my advice is to change the code to use dictionary instead of idictionary since idictionary is not readonly so you are not hiding all that much by using that instead of concreate dictionary
2221014
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
one example where i m using interfaces now is to define an object model - i ve got interfaces for various properties ihasstorage ihasprivileges ihascheezburger then the classes representing the concrete objects implement whichever and however many interfaces are appropriate for that class properties
interfaces allow you to sort of use multiple inherited
in your example it woulda allow you to put an instance of employee or manager into the same variable and then call dosomething on that variable with the method call being dispatched to the instance that is currently referenced by that variable
2221014
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
you can have the same class implement multiple interfaces and then use instances of that class in all variables of those interfaces
you couldn t use the same for abstract classes as a class can only inherited off one class at a time
one example where i m using interfaces now is to define an object model - i ve got interfaces for various properties ihasstorage ihasprivileges ihascheezburger then the classes representing the concrete objects implement whichever and however many interfaces are appropriate for that class properties
2221699
width	height
Pattern(s): 
on the first pass the jeditorpane computes its preferred height based on the assumption that its width will be unlimited so it returns the height of a single line since the text contains no line breaks. on the second pass the width has already been set constrained by the size of the first jpopupmenu and now that it knows the maximum width it can compute how tall it needs to be
so the simplest solution is just to set the width to the maximum whenever you set the text
don t worry about making it too large it will still shrink to fit the content as you will see if you change the text to hello world
2222167
freemarker	velocity	freemarker	velocity
Pattern(s): 
quite similar to velocity add some nice features
freemarker is good too
quite similar to velocity add some nice features
2222492
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
note that the logrounds parameter does not refer to the number of characters bytes in the salt which is always 16
it refers to the logarithmic base of the number of passes that the hash will take to compute
in other words it s a way to make bcrypt scale with moore s law making the function several orders of magnitude more expensive to compute if computers ever get fast enough to crack existing hashes
2223159
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
for a spring project you would typically have to add the spring dependencies in the pom.xml file and put the application context file in src main resources files in this directory are available on the class path and will be copied into web-inf classes
to build the webapp compile classes compile tests execute tests package the webapp simply run this will create a .war in the target directory to run the webapp i suggest to use the tomcat maven plugin no extra configuration is required for this basic use case
check the examples for more advanced use cases
2223217
teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 
but my thoughts are we will be so far advanced with ci by the time that happens that tfs may not cover our needs
but back to teamcity it supports vss just fine and that has worked out
as far as deployment goes i m messing around with microsoft s web deployment project add-in as well as a config in nant
2223800
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
it started in internet explorer so all versions of ie will support it
firefox has supported it since ff3
chrome also supports it and i assume safari does as well
2224405
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
methods declared without any explicit visibility keyword are defined as public
default is public
class methods may be defined as public private or protected
2224405
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
class methods may be defined as public private or protected
methods declared without any explicit visibility keyword are defined as public

2224728
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
in this example a checkbox allows multiple selections in a column
substituting a radio button and using a buttongroup would accommodate a unique selection

2225081
getattr	subclassing	getattr	setattr	setattr	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
to clarify the preferred method of telling the difference between variable types is with something called duck typing as long as the methods and return types that a variable responds to are what your subroutine expects treat it like what you expect it to be
for example if you have a class that overloads the bracket operators with getattr and setattr but uses some funny internal scheme it would be appropriate for it to behave as a dictionary if that s what it s trying to emulate
the other problem with the type a is type b checking is that if a is a subclassing of b it evaluates to false when programmatically you would hope it would be true
2225803
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
see the section on form submission for usage information
this doesn t seem to be in violation of the html form spec which states this attribute specifies which http method will be used to submit the form data set
possible case-insensitive values are get the default and post
2226683
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
the problem isn t the closure
it s the for-loop
loops only creates one variable i for the entire loops
2227259
fcntl	posix
Pattern(s): 
i believe fcntl is posix compliant so should work on windows too
with fcntl you should be able to lock a specific range of bytes
so if you seek to end and try to lock out the amount of bytes you are about to write it should be pretty fast
2228761
fiddler	charles
Pattern(s): 
also robert bak suggested that charles proxy can use the target site s certificate which i guess would be by far the best method i didn t try it as the fiddler experiment already proved enough for us
interestingly fiddler started to show https requests today
the flex app behaves like it couldn t access the server side which is probably because the response from fiddler is signed with a self-signed certificate which flash player correctly recognizes as different than the target site certificate but still the http request has been sent already and is visible via fiddler
2229256
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
if you need more than that you don t want superclass fields to be serialized override writeobject objectoutputstream and readobject objectinputstream as outlined here -
as others have made clear it s not possible for a subclass of a serializable class to be non- serializable
if what you want is for the subclass attributes not to be serialized one option is to make them all transient
2229256
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if what you want is for the subclassing attributes not to be serialized one option is to make them all transient
if you need more than that you don t want superclass fields to be serialized override writeobject objectoutputstream and readobject objectinputstream as outlined here -

2229386
valgrind	gprof	valgrind	gprof
Pattern(s): 
it records data in a file which you can analyse later using a proper gui like kcachegrind a usage example would be it ll generate a file called callgrind.out.xxx where xxx is the pid of the program edit unlike gprof valgrind works with many different languages including java with some limitations
you can use valgrind
it records data in a file which you can analyse later using a proper gui like kcachegrind a usage example would be it ll generate a file called callgrind.out.xxx where xxx is the pid of the program edit unlike gprof valgrind works with many different languages including java with some limitations
2229388
profiler	perf
Pattern(s): 
then i run my test program . my_test 100000000 then i record performance data of a running process perf record -g -p pidof my_test -o . my_test.perf.data sleep 30 then i analyze load per module then load per function is analyzed then call chains are analyzed so at this point you know where your program spends time. and this is main.cpp for the test
ideally i need an app that will attach to a process and log periodic snapshots of memory usage number of threads cpu usage well in order to collect this types of information about your process you don t actuall need a profiler on linux
1 you can use top in batch mode
2230116
hash	md5	hash	salt	hash	hmac	salt	md5	hmac	md5
Pattern(s): 
if you aren t running https then any mitm can see the salt you are sending as well as the javascript used to hash the original password so you have nothing gained
as for your concern about the possibility of hmac collisions between two salt that is probably very unlikely depending on your hash algorithm and how secure you keep your salt values
even with md5 that has had some collision attacks discovered and has a set of rainbow tables you will be ok if you keep your salt very very safe
2230297
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
a journal is basically equivalent to a transaction log in a database
it ll ensure consistency and integrity of the filesystems structures like a database does for its tables
while file.delete doesn t have any transactional code at the high level ntfs does maintain transactional integrity at the filesystem level
2230297
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 
while file.delete doesn t have any transactional code at the high level ntfs does maintain transactional integrity at the filesystem level
this may not be true for other filesystems drivers

2232186
pthreads	fork
Pattern(s): 
instead of using non-standard behavior you may use standard measures to share memory
for example the pthreads shared memory with shm_open and consequent mmap as was pointed out in comment and explained in his post by ephemient
the file descriptor will be preserved through fork
2232762
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
should better be you can extract the boolean value in your refreshview method by sending the boolvalue method to the number object unlike java or c# objective-c has no autoboxing from primitive values to objects
the bool type is just a small int type which causes the error message you are seeing because the compiler needs a pointer for the second argument to performselectoronmainthread withobject waituntildone

2232891
inherited	base-class
Pattern(s): 
they can then call the base-class implementation alone if they only want that behaviour
also you need to make sure your inherited hierarchy is flat rather than multi-layers which is generally good anyway because inherited is fragile enough without piling on the layers

2233128
primitive	reference-type
Pattern(s): 
i suggest you read up upon the stack vs the heap value-type vs reference-type since it s a very fundamental subject when programming
the datatype int is a primitive data type and hence a value-type as opposed to a reference type
this means that when you pass variable i to a function it isn t the actual variable that has been passed but instead a copy of the value
2233896
datamapper	activerecord
Pattern(s): 
the datamapper pattern is not very popular in the php world in favour of activerecord and certainly much of that favour is attributed to the fawning of ruby on rails in the php framework community although there exists one notable project -- and it looks promising
outlet orm follows the datamapper pattern although i am not sure if it would be sufficient for your needs
i have so far had no problems with it
2234113
fiddler	charles	fiddler	charles
Pattern(s): 
charles is my favorite and works great with flash and everything else http
wireshark and fiddler are other options
charles wireshark fiddler
2234646
post	get
Pattern(s): 
anyway symfony is a php framework like many others and just by going through generic design patterns using classic books such as patterns of enterprise application architecture or websites about php patterns recipes popular patterns or extensive lists you should get a good idea on the general structure
symfony is based on a lot of patterns this blog post highlights a few of them basically it s a model-view-controller mvc framework and the directories are setup like that only to organize the numerous configuration and php files that are created during a normal structured project
of course you d need to be a little bit more specific on what makes you curious about the directory structure but if you go through the documentation you ll find interesting facts about how your project will be divided
2235106
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
this construct to calculate message authenticate codes can use different hash functions
you can use sha-1 sha-256 or whatever hash function you want
and to authenticate the response to a specific request i would send a nonce along with the request that needs to be used as salt to authenticate the response
2235337
perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
Pattern(s): 
cvs is probably best avoided too
an alternative - consider getting a free source control system like svn git or mercurial or perforce or other commercial systems offer free licenses for limited use and then do anything you like to your project
you can always go back to an earlier version if you don t like the results
2235940
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
one of those features is the text-overflow property which is now in css3 and has implementations in safari and opera
however firefox still does not support this feature
for a cross browser javascript implementation of the ellipsis feature for the jquery framework you may be interested in checking out the following article ajaxian - text-overflow for firefox via jquery update since jquery is not an option you may want to check the following javascript tutorial - how to auto ellipse text javascript ellipsis or cross-browser truncate with dots ajaxian - ellipsis or truncate with dots via javascript
2237073
libs	buildpath
Pattern(s): 
a common mistake among starters is namely that they copy the servletcontainer appserver s libs into web-inf lib because they got compilation errors in the ide javax.servlet not found and so on
copying the libs is the wrong solution
you should rather have integrated the server in the same ide and configured the ide project to reference associate the server in question so that the ide will automagically take its libs in the project s buildpath
2237274
xslt	schematron	xslt	schematron
Pattern(s): 
schematron is an iso standard and provides a way of encoding business rules restrictions and validation that is not possible in xml schema
the rules are comiled into xslt and can run in any environment that can invoke xslt transformations
the schematron differs in basic concept from other schema languages in that it not based on grammars but on finding tree patterns in the parsed document
2237645
nsmutablestring	nsstring
Pattern(s): 
nsstring is immutable and can therefore not be changed
if you want to use that method send it to a nsmutablestring object

2237659
background-image	background-position
Pattern(s): 
reported to not work on ie6 7 works on ie8
if your image is purely decorative then it might be a more semantic solution to use it as a background-image
you can then specify the position of the background background-position center center
2237837
boost	allocator
Pattern(s): 
i d guess that the extremely poor performance of the class hierarchy approach is due to the need to use dynamic memory allocator and dynamic dispatch
boost any is neither fast nor especially elegant so i wouldn t consider it for this task it has other applications though

2238708
equals	icomparable
Pattern(s): 
the second is to add a constraint that b is icomparable so that a third is to require an be passed to the constructor of widgetbox then with this last option you can provide an overload that defaults to
you have a few options here the first is to use equals be careful using this option
if b does not override equals then the default comparsion is reference equality when b is a reference type and value equality when b is a value type
2240078
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
the bright side of this is that you can get a sense of separate transmissions which isn t really easy to do with tcp
yes udp just returns what data got transmitted in that one datagram
udp is not stream-oriented like tcp
2242295
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
here s a fairly straightforward one edit the mysql site lists a few options for connecting to mysql
for postgresql you want ruby-pg
it supplies your basic database connection with the ability to query it
2242618
int	double
Pattern(s): 
edit fixed some english.
while comparing int use
using and at the same time to check equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time
2242654
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
now that handles the simple case that you asked about
well it really depends but a good rule of thumb is this if you are going to repeat something a fixed pre-determined number of times a for-loop is generally best
otherwise use a while loops
2243493
filewriter	printwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 
i think in this case you could do a lot shorter see also bufferedwriter or if you want nice printing functions printwriter out new printwriter new bufferedwriter new filewriter foo.out
it is possibly that the filewriter creates its own wrapping but that class will know which way is best
in java streams and writers are wrappers so you can assemble them to your own needs by means of stacking them like you do
2245893
gwt	icefaces
Pattern(s): 
do a little bit of research but stay with what s familiar and comfortable
from my personal experiences with web front-end prototyping gwt is awesome but that s probably just because i m used to swing programming
if you ve never done any type of java programming before stick to something jsp based like struts jsf with icefaces if you want some out-of-the-box components spring stripes...i think you catch my drift
2246242
sctp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
using tcp will send a packet with the fin bit set closing the sending side of the connection but still allowing new data in the receiving direction
sctp does not have such a half-closed state and this call will initiate the sctp shutdown sequence in which the whole connection is closed
further details can be found here
2247217
strsplit	substr	strsplit	substr
Pattern(s): 
you could use substr friends
strsplit is going to be problematic look at a regexp like this it will split at the right points but nothing is left
you could use substr friends
2248503
super	extends
Pattern(s): 
extends t should be used since any instance of a subclass of t is also a t
super t should be used because an instance of t can legally be passed to any method that accepts some supertype of t
a could be used on a for example
2249811
jsf	seam
Pattern(s): 
hibernate
jsf is component-based which is a bit different paradigm from request-based frameworks
if you do plan to go the jsf route i d suggest looking at seam from jboss
2250022
google-chrome	safari	webkit	blink
Pattern(s): 
webkit was also used for the nokia browser on nokia s60 epiphany webos browser on palm pre and many more
since late 2013 google-chrome no longer uses the webkit engine from apple now using its own independent fork of it called blink except for google-chrome on ios which can only use webkit
webkit continues to be used in safari and various other open source browsers
2250895
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 
update 2 here is the code that i am suggesting and the correct way
put your code that modifies the view in viewdidappear
the view is not yet visible when viewdidload and viewwillappear are called
2251199
wordpress	vbulletin
Pattern(s): 
use memcached
hack forumdisplay.php to cache the number of users viewing that forum and then read that out from wordpress
if vbulletin is already set up to use memcached you can access the memcache object at
2252382
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 

our msbuild script runs from an x86 visual studio command prompt
it does not read the 64bit registry when using this syntax
2252617
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
you can validate input in the setter and reject it if it s not acceptable
you can instantiate the object only when needed when the getter is first called
you can change how it all works later
2253157
uiview	subviews	uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 
if it makes more sense to put the behavior into the buttons themselves they shoudl be uiresponders and as such subclass uiview and be added as subviews of your main view
the more lightweight approach is to add sublayers to your uiview s layer
use hittest to dispatch touches you receive on you uiview to the calayer instance that needs to receive it
2253157
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 
consequently the essential bit may be just how much of the behavior associated with your individual buttons should be known handled by the your main uiview
if it makes sense to have everything controlled from a central place you can put all the logic in the uiview and just use sublayers for lightweight display purposes
if it makes more sense to put the behavior into the buttons themselves they shoudl be uiresponders and as such subclass uiview and be added as subviews of your main view
2254006
entity-relationship	entities
Pattern(s): 

one-to-one relationship is a thing defined by entity-relationship model
this can be mapped into a relational model in several ways most widely used of them being creating one table with attributes of both entities
2254138
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
int works just fine as a boolean type
any int other than zero is true
false is zero
2254590
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
there are downsides - udp transmission is not reliable or guaranteed in the same way as tcp
you might consider udp for this
since you can broadcast multicast via udp it may be more suitable for this sort of application
2254966
glut	glfw	glut	fltk	fltk	freeglut
Pattern(s): 
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself
i suppose i should also point out one more alternative to glut freeglut is a free re-implementation of the glut api
2256557
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
i ve set it to run via a chron script to keep the goods handy in case the muggers get to mugging
1.0.x versioning aren t being updated any longer and it s age is really starting to show
you owe it to yourself to do a backup and plan to upgrade to 1.5 and anticipate the wonders of 1.6
2257800
sequence	permutation
Pattern(s): 
let a the first permutation
find the sequence in the collection that has the greatest overlap with the end of a
if there is a tie choose the sequence is first in lexicographic order
2258018
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
what you need to do is define it as an application folder adding a virtual directory does this by default so that s why it works
all you really need to do is right click the folder under your website click properties and under the application settings section click create
your folder will then have a gear icon off to the side denoting it as an application folder
2258316
mergetool	winmerge
Pattern(s): 
we know the file in the working directory contains the markers
it makes sense that the file we are merging to will also be this file - we also know that git mergetool makes the variable available that names that file
this is all you need to hook git up with winmerge for merge conflict resolution
2258605
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
my solution was to copy the necessary files to a libs folder adjacent to my src directory and reference that copied file instead
during compilation it should get copied into the build folder along with your project s build results and fxcop should have no issue picking it up
i think the issue is that assemblies in the gac don t get copied to your project s build folder and fxcop doesn t know how to handle non-framework gac references
2259414
maven	cargo
Pattern(s): 
i d much rather specify the war to deploy using the maven coordinates defined by our web module
this is not really the maven jetty plugin is supposed to be used the plugin deploys the war of the current module what you want to do is not supported by default
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates yes cargo can do this in a clean way
2260324
mediarecorder	audiorecord
Pattern(s): 
yes what you want to do should be possible
if you use mediarecorder the example above it will save compressed audio to a file
if you use audiorecord you can get audio samples directly
2260736
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
msvs has solution folder which is quite different thing and there isn t much sense in expressing real folder as solution folder
if you only want to look at the code in msvs without having ability to build it - i d suggest you to just add all the files from all folder into corresponding default solution folder header files source files of your project
you ll also need to gather all the referenced linux headers and expose them to msvs as vc++ include directory
2260872
width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
Pattern(s): 
this will be ineffective on ie6-7 though
form elements have traditionally had a width height that includes their padding border because they were originally implemented by browsers as os-native ui widgets where css had no influence over the decorations
to reproduce this behaviour firefox and others render some form fields select button input-type-button with the css3 box-sizing style set to border-box so that the width property reflects the entire rendered area width including the border and padding
2261868
sharpmap	proj4js
Pattern(s): 
proj4js also provides an online coordinate calculator which might help you to figure out which coordinates system the coordinates in your database are using
if you are looking for a c# framework sharpmap is great for handling all aspects of geospatial applications

2262332
cstdio	iostream
Pattern(s): 
a c++ standard draft n1905.pdf on www.open-std.org i don t have the exact link seems to indicate that it comes from c c standard output cout 27.3 standard iostream objects lib.iostream.objects 1- the header iostream declares objects that associate objects with the standard c streams provided for by the functions declared in cstdio 27.8.2
... 27.3.1 narrow stream objects lib.narrow.stream.objects istream cin 1- the object cin controls input from a stream buffer associated with the object stdin declared in cstdio
...
2263180
queue	fifo
Pattern(s): 
with queues the items come out on a fifo fifo basis just like people lining up in a physical queue
so normally you add new items to the queue s rear whilst removing items from the queue s front
from your comments it sounds as if you are not concerned about initially populating the queue
2263393
uiview	uiwindow
Pattern(s): 
that uiwindow is never subclassed and it fills the whole screen
the individual pages of user interface are uiview instances that are either instantiated in code or loaded from an xib
these also are usually not subclassed - logic goes in uiviewcontroller subclasses
2265552
ant	maven	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 
but if maven is really overkill and you just want to launch the whole build in one step use a global build.xml
you should do a global ant script calling all little ant parts through the ant ant task
edit after reading other answers you should also use maven
2266474
jdom	dom4j
Pattern(s): 
dom4j is another alternative again not genericised
i would investigate jdom as a much more usable api
element.getchildren returns a list of element objects unfortunately it s not been genericized but the api doc is clear
2267199
filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 
there is a bunch of other filesystems
if any catches your fancy there s more about it in documentation filesystems and then if you want to know more read the sources
fat is a murderer for flash-based non-wear-protected devices as file allocation table is written to the same location over and over
2267285
onclick	onchange
Pattern(s): 
when settting the checked state programatically the onchange handler never fires in those browsers
i concur with pointy that onclick is a better way to handle checkboxes if you want to avoid surprises
as far as i can see onclick triggers immediately after the user clicks it or toggles the checkbox with the keyboard
2267381
exponent	modulo
Pattern(s): 
choose your odd number n to factorize choose a natural number k search all p k so that k 2 is not congruent to n mod p to obtain a factor base b p1 p2 ... pt starting from r floor n search at least t+1 values so that y 2 r 2 - n all have just factors in b for every y1 y2 ... y t+1 just calculated you generate a vector v yi e1 e2 ... et where ei is calculated by reducing over modulo 2 the exponent pi in yi use gaussian elimination to find some of the vectors that added together give a null vector set x as the product of ri related to yi found in the previous step and set y as p1 a p2 b p3 c
pt z where exponent are the half of the exponent found in the factorization of yi calculate d mcd x-y n if 1 d n then d is a non-trivial factor of n otherwise start from step 2 choosing a bigger k
the problem about these algorithms is that they really imply a lot of theory in numerical calculus
2267836
manual	jmp	manual	jmp
Pattern(s): 
volume 2a page 3-549 in my copy of the manual has a huge pile of information about jmp
grab a copy of the intel architecture software developer s manual
as you re seeing some forms of the jmp instruction are invalid in 64-bit mode
2267841
post	get
Pattern(s): 
get.
some information from the server while post should be used to send some information to the server
after that a couple of things that can be noted using get your users can use the back button in their browser and they can bookmark pages there is a limit in the size of the parameters you can pass as get 2kb for some versions of internet explorer if i m not mistaken
2267841
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
after that a couple of things that can be noted using get your users can use the back button in their browser and they can bookmark pages there is a limit in the size of the parameters you can pass as get 2kb for some versions of internet explorer if i m not mistaken
the limit is much more for post and generally depends on the server s configuration
anyway i don t think we could live without get think of how many urls you are using with parameters in the query string every day -- without get all those wouldn t work
2267942
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
in addition you can wrap some functionality when the caller has no need access other properties methods or interfaces on the object implementing the method
in this case it replaces inherited somehow

2271760
nerdtree	netrw
Pattern(s): 
i ll try and come back to edit this answer with links to the screencasts as they become available
the nerdtree plugin gives you a collapsible project tree
personally i find that the netrw plugin is more than sufficient and this usually comes installed with vim
2273074
gprof	shark	gprof	shark
Pattern(s): 
shark configuration for command line tool
instrumented profiling such as gprof is not particularly useful unless you really just want to know about call graphs and the number of times that functions are called
much more useful for performance analysis is a sampling profiler and for this apple s shark tool part of chud is one of the best
2273957
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
both haskell and ocaml provide the lovely benefits of using an ml-family language but for most programmers ocaml is likely to offer a gentler learning curve and better immediate results
as far as multi-language integration goes combining c and haskell is remarkably easy and i say this as someone who is unlike dons not really much of an expert on either
any other language that integrates well with c shouldn t be much trickier
2274414
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
in c99 you can also use lf to signify the larger size of double but this is purely cosmetic notice that with scanf no promotion occurs and this actually makes a difference
d stands for decimal and it expects an argument of type int or some smaller signed int type that then gets promoted
floating-point types float and double both get passed the same way promoted to double and both of them use f
2274978
sequence	permutation
Pattern(s): 
proceed by calculating the minimum length of strings containing n p r and n p r + 1 distinct permutation up to n
in short this sequence is optimal because you can t make it worse somewhere in the hope of making it better someplace else
it s already locally optimal everywhere
2275666
pop-up	dialog	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
in either the system-wide library pdf services or a user s library pdf services directory you can put applescripts automator workflows or symlinks aliases to applications or folders
those items will appear in the pdf pop-up menu in the print dialog and if the user selects the item a pdf of the file will be placed in the folder or be passed to the application script or workflow

2275965
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
there is very little reason ever to extend thread or frame unfortunately there are lots of bad examples and old tutorials out there
although awt is supposed to be thread-safe it isn t really
so i suggest like swing do all the gui manipulation on the awt event dispatch thread edt
2276906
lxml.html	beautifulsoup	lxml.html	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 
this is essentially the same advice as the people who are recommending beautifulsoup except lxml is still being actively developed and beautifulsoup development has slowed
use lxml.html to parse the html into the form you want
this is essentially the same advice as the people who are recommending beautifulsoup except lxml is still being actively developed and beautifulsoup development has slowed
2277303
ecj	javac	ecj	javac
Pattern(s): 
google app engine uses the javac that comes with the jdk
eclipse has its own built-in compiler called ecj which is probably the reason you could get away with not having the jdk installed to use it
it does not use javac
2278175
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
this is why every single method and properties must be virtual
basically if there is a member doing anything with the entity nh need to know about it and tap into it. like mentioned earlier in order for nhibernate to do the magic it creates proxy classes which inherited from your entities category in your case
however if you make your entities implement an interface it will use that interface to create a proxy instead of concrete types
2278435
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
setting the instance variable directly will not impact the retain counts of any objects
using synthesize will generate standard accessor for you
the key reason to use properties is that since they are accessor they can be read and or modified from outside the class
2279405
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
and now on each of your subclass you override the getequation by specifying the constraint and as transient is not inherited by subclasses the overriden getequation will be use for the equation field mapping
here is a subclass example i haven t found better.

2280675
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp
what steven s says can be summed up as follows use udp for broadcast and multicast since that is your only option use multicast for any new apps you can use udp for simple request reply apps but you ll need to build in your own acks timeouts and retransmissions don t use udp for bulk data transfer

2280767
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
Pattern(s): 
if the uinavigationbar is simply a view you need to push a navigation item containing the title or modify the last navigation item or
the view controller must be a child of some uinavigationcontroller for the .title property to take effect
if the uinavigationbar is simply a view you need to push a navigation item containing the title or modify the last navigation item or
2281039
int	double
Pattern(s): 
so when calling sqrt 1.0 n the compiler consider you try to call test.sqrt int with a double swhich is obviously not possible
that s quite normal. by writing this code you didn t overload the math.sqrt method in any way you simply defined a test.sqrt int as an argument
then there is the question of your error message
2285756
paredit	slime
Pattern(s): 
anyway it is a nice summary of how it works
definitely take a look at it i can t live without paredit now and this file should make it very easy to start using it i believe
- in fact the c-h m combination will tell you about all keybindings active at the slime repl in clojure-mode you ll want to remember c-c c-k for sending the current buffer off for compilation and indeed in any emacs buffer
2288104
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 
if you are using testng or junit 4.7+ since surefire-555 it is possible to run tests in parallel see the parallel and the threadcount optional parameters but that s not a default
now while i m not sure if the surefire plugin behaves the same as junit it is possible to get some control by manually creating a testsuite and specify the order in which tests are executed you are however strongly advised never to depend upon test execution order unit tests really should be indeed independent
p.s. just in case there is also this request surefire-321 to run tests in alphabetical order that you might want to vote for
2288489
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
postgresql also has a much richer sql dictionary that might give problems in mysql
another major difference is the usage of schema s in postgresql
what is called a database in mysql is sort of a schema in postgresql
2288951
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
note that this value is special in that it is serializable with the object even though it is static for the reasons described above
any class that can be serializable implements serializable should declare that uid and it must be changed whenever anything changes that affects the serializable additional fields removed fields change of field order ...
the field s value is checked during deserialization and if the value of the serializable object does not equal the value of the class in the current vm an exception is thrown
2288951
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
the field s value is checked during deserialization and if the value of the serializable object does not equal the value of the class in the current vm an exception is thrown
note that this value is special in that it is serializable with the object even though it is static for the reasons described above

2289783
viewdidappear	performselector	viewdidappear	performselector
Pattern(s): 
try using performselector withobject afterdelay with a zero delay - it will call the selected method as soon as possible after control returns to the run loop and out of the uiwindowcontroller call stack
might be that uiwindowcontroller is mistakenly assuming the view is still visible when the viewdidappear notification call returns
try using performselector withobject afterdelay with a zero delay - it will call the selected method as soon as possible after control returns to the run loop and out of the uiwindowcontroller call stack
2289979
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
but this might be just lazyness in your example
you have to define an abstract method b in the base class test which makes this class abstract so you cannot have instances of it to call this method otherwise the function b is not defined in this class only in it s subclass of which the base class knows nothing and should not have to know anything
read up on inherited
2290921
icmp	udp
Pattern(s): 
if you re sending that much data expect and plan for the latency - often this means anticipating what will happen across the wire and compensating when the data comes through instead of waiting on the data to arrive
you will never beat ping commands for latency since they use icmp which is about the most lightweight option out there
typically for gaming situations udp is used primarily because of the speed involved
2293090
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 
imo it s is much more straightforward to achieve c++-like performance in ocaml than in haskell
through as already said haskell has much nicer community packages tools and support syntax features ffi probability monads via typeclasses and parallel programming support

2293801
multiplying	modulo
Pattern(s): 
another way is to implement your own rational arithmetic but you don t need to go far about it
since you know that denominators are the same for the whole array it immediately gives you all you now need to do is to sum a and b which is easy and then multiplying a and 1 a +b which is also easy
the hardest part here is to normalize resulting value which is done with modulo and is trivial
2294219
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 
as a suggestion the jquery validation plugin is extremely well-constructed a very popular amongst client-side developers
i would encourage you to consider it for if you decide to tackle client-side validation
important client-side validation is not a substitution for server-side validation
2294556
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
i suspect that it was done for documentation reasons
hashmap implements map and you can rely on that
the fact that it extends abstractmap is arguably just an implementation detail
2295609
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
to cut to the chase c# doesn t really support static method inherited - so you can t do what you ask
unfortunately it is possible to write myotherclass.mystaticmethod - but that doesn t mean there s any real inherited going on under the covers this is just the scoping rules being very lenient
edit although you can t do this directly you can do what c++ programmers call a curiously recurring template pattern and get pretty close with generics 1 here you do need to update the subclassing - but only in a minor fashion
2295887
post	get
Pattern(s): 
to insert data i would use method with attributes
this post has already a very good answer by community wiki and i also recommend to look at rick strahl s web blog there are many good post about wcf rest like this
i used both to get this kind of myservice-service.
2296303
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
this parent folder should also have svn ignore set to the following furthermore this project folder should be what goes into your trunk branches and tags directory
the my project folder definitely should be under version control
from svn s standpoint your project folder should be the parent folder that contains my project along with bin obj your .sln file etc
2299813
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
so how much memory a processes uses is really not clear
add on top of that paging out to disk let alone swap which we don t use on android and it is even less clear
thus if you were to take all of the physical ram actually mapped in to each process and add up all of the processes you would probably end up with a number much greater than the actual total ram
2301782
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
so if my understanding is correct here s how the three flags make the assembly run note it s the main assembly the program assembly that dictates this not each individual assembly for themselves on different platforms the n a for x64 assembly on x86 means that the assembly won t load and you ll get an exception if you try
also note that conflicting settings involving x86 and x64 will make your program crash at one point or another
if the main assembly is set to x86 it will run as a 32-bit process on both a 32-bit and 64bit operating system and any attempts at loading assemblies flagged as x64 will fail
2301786
many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 
in er terms there is a one-to-many relationship between process and activity
or possibly a many-to-many relationship if one activity belongs to multiple processes
for example customerplacesorder is a process
2301808
onclick	onchange	onclick	onchange
Pattern(s): 
you need to use the onchange in the select box
onclick is not a valid handler for option types
you need to use the onchange in the select box
2302020
x86	64bit	x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
the vs2005 8 debugger doesn t support edit + continue on 64bit code
choosing x86 in your release build is something you should do if you program has a dependency on a component that only works in 32-bit code
that s not uncommon there are tons of com components out there that never have and never will be ported to 64bit unmanaged code
2303425
accessor	properties	accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 
when i write a properties i use _get_foo and _set_foo for the accessor and _foo for the attribute itself
don t bother using accessor until they re necessary
converting a simple attribute to a properties is quick and easy and doesn t need modification of client code
2303676
operands	decrement
Pattern(s): 
in any case esp or rsp or just sp depending on the address size is incremented or decrement by 2 for 16 bit operations 4 for 32 bit operations or 8 for 64 bit operations
while both push and pop check the d-bit in the segment descriptor to determine the default operands size 16 or 32 64 bits it can be overridden with an operands size override 0x66
if the d-bit is 0 then ff 6 pushes 16 bits onto the stack and 66 ff 6 pushes 32 bits or 64 if it s a 64-bit segment
2304345
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
the set of possible members of a superclass is a superset of the set of possible members of a subclassing of that superclass
a superclass defines a class that has a larger set of possible values as members
a subclassing restricts the items that can be part of its class so it defines a smaller set of possible members
2305354
minimum	max	minimum	max
Pattern(s): 
once you zoom out a bit the max value is always a positive integer and the min value is always a negative integer
for each pixel on the screen you need to have to know the minimum sample value for that pixel and the maximum sample value
so you need a function that scans the waveform data in chunks and keeps track of the accumulated max and min for that chunk
2306183
pascal	delphi
Pattern(s): 
update i have tried the same trick in delphi but it does not work
the wrapper you are trying to write is possible in free pascal since free pascal supports 2 equvalent declarations for varargs external functions so instead of function pushfstring fmt pansichar pansichar
cdecl
2306456
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 
fitnesse might be a better way to go
unless there are new features in junit this is a difficult thing to do
testng can manage it with dependent groups
2306769
jsf	stripes
Pattern(s): 
also you might want to check out stripes it is also a very nice server side web framework and finally here is a very thorough and a little old comparison of most java web frameworks
i have used both struts2 and jsf extensively both are good but i would still recommend jsf
here is why
2306802
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
in particular since there are malloc calls we have to be able to handle a failure in any of those calls and free all the memory we allocated so far
to make things easier we rely on the fact that free null is no-op so we set all the pointers at a given level equal to null before we try to allocate them so that if an error happens we can free all of the pointers
other than that the function is simple enough
2307380
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 
that s what bit o notation means it means what is the order of dominant term for any sufficiently large n
but what exactly is o log n what it means precisely is as n tends towards infinity the time tends towards where a is a constant scaling factors
or actually it doesn t quite mean that
2308997
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if the object is drawable and collideable you may have common routines to handle that but no common base class so you have the class implement idrawable and icollidable
also of note in c# you can only inherited one class but multiple interfaces
an abstract class is a partial implementation of a class with reusable code for multiple subclassing
2310284
backslash	double-quotes
Pattern(s): 
you could also avoid the double-quotes and thus avoid the first interpretation bin sh -c ls 1 1 another way is to store the filename in a variable and use that value export f 1 printenv f 1 bin sh -c ls f # note that bin sh interprets f not my current shell 1 and finally what you tried will work on some shells i m using bash as for the above examples just apparently not with your shell bin sh -c ls 1 1 csh # enter csh the next line is executed in that environment bin sh -c ls 1 unmatched . i strongly suggest you avoid such filenames in the first place
you need to escape the backtick but also escape the backslash touch 1 bin sh -c ls 1 1 the reason you have to escape it twice is because you re entering this command in an environment such as a shell script that interprets the double-quoted string once
it then gets interpreted again by the subshell
2310284
bash	subshell
Pattern(s): 
it then gets interpreted again by the subshell
you could also avoid the double-quotes and thus avoid the first interpretation bin sh -c ls 1 1 another way is to store the filename in a variable and use that value export f 1 printenv f 1 bin sh -c ls f # note that bin sh interprets f not my current shell 1 and finally what you tried will work on some shells i m using bash as for the above examples just apparently not with your shell bin sh -c ls 1 1 csh # enter csh the next line is executed in that environment bin sh -c ls 1 unmatched . i strongly suggest you avoid such filenames in the first place

rar	gzip	rar	zip	gif	png	gif	ico	png	ico	mp3	wav	mp3	wmv	mp3	flv	wmv	asf	wmv	flv	3gp	asf
Pattern(s): 
it also supports gzip and deflate compression
these file types will benefit from further compression css js htm html swf xml xslt txt doc xls ppt there are some file types that will not benefit from further compression pdf causes problems with certain versions in ie and it is usually well compressed png jpg jpeg gif ico wav mp3 m4a aac wav is often compressed 3gp 3g2 asf avi dv flv mov mp4 mpg mpeg wmv zip rar 7z arj

2310396
post	get	junit	testng
Pattern(s): 
supposedly testng has better test grouping possibilities but i haven t really looked into it myself yet
if you have junit 4.7+ i recommend looking into the new feature called rules which are explained in this blog post
they might not be exactly what you want but they are probably the best you get with junit
2313968
median	minimum
Pattern(s): 
this occurs if the pivot chosen is consistently either the minimum or the maximum
ideally you want to select the median as your pivot
if finding the median directly is too costly usually this is the case if you re trying to use quicksort what s commonly done instead is to either take the median of three potential pivot elements or else just pick a random element as your pivot
2314137
put	get	goto	break
Pattern(s): 
remember while recent c++ allows for anywhere this was not always the case
the break as goto is probably the answer but i will put forward one other idea
maybe he wanted to have a locally defined variables and used this construct to get a new scope
2315847
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
if you can find the connecting code at the same level of abstraction use that
udp is connectionless but can have a fake connection enforced at both ends on the socket objects
tcp is a stream protocol what you send will be received in chunks on the other end and additionally creates endpoint sockets for each accepted socket connection the main listening socket is left untouched although you d probably need to call listen again
2316518
next	except
Pattern(s): 
a block except lambdas doesn t support return but you can skip to the next statement using next which in a rake task has the same effect of using return in a method
task foo do puts printed next puts never printed end or you can move the code in a method and use return in the method
task foo do do_something end def do_something puts startd return puts end end i prefer the second choice
2316866
exponent	addition
Pattern(s): 
but the effect of choosing a small public exponent is much greater than the effect of the faster algorithm so encryption is faster in practice
there are two factors involved in this on the one hand the public exponent can be chosen to be a small number with only two 1-bits usually 3 17 or 65537
this means the rsa encryption operation can be done with a few modular squarings and an addition
2316866
exponent	addition
Pattern(s): 
this means the rsa encryption operation can be done with a few modular squarings and an addition
this cannot be reversed if you force the private exponent to be a small number the security of the system is obviously broken
on the other hand the holder of the private key can store some precalculated values derived from the original primes
2318052
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
Pattern(s): 
they are an expensive system resource
if you are comfortable with c c++ then you should use readdirectorychangesw
filesystemwatcher is a thin wrapper around this api function
2319092
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
additional information to understand malloc free and new delete you might read chapter 13 dynamic object creation in bruce eckels thinking c++ volume 1
its a book that can be downloaded for free

2320841
kerberos	ntlm
Pattern(s): 
this negotiation attempts to use kerberos but if that doesn t work it ll fall back and use the older ntlm protocol
kerberos is a great choice if you re in a domain environment
in order to use it you ll need both your service and clients to be running under domain accounts
2321125
cos	atan2	cos	sin
Pattern(s): 
sin theta
cos theta
and that atan2 is smart enough to know which quadrant theta
2322858
required	placeholder
Pattern(s): 
the ocunit macros certainly aren t perfect but the example you used above was incredibly verbose
the macros required either 2+ or 3+ arguments
stfail is the exception and only requires 1+ arguments. the last required argument is always an optional format string for a description and any other parameters are used to substitute in those placeholder just like you d do with printf or nslog
2324318
wav	caf
Pattern(s): 
the data format could be pcm or it could be compressed in any format such as mp3 aac ulaw etc.
if you use avaudiorecorder audiofile or any of the other core audio apis you should be able to record directly to a wav file and skip the entire conversion process altogether
but if you need to convert audio files first check if the caf file is a valid file
2326559
post	get
Pattern(s): 
try comparing the two web.config files in the project one in the root and one in the views folder and see if there are any differences between them
this forum post has a potential solution to your problem sometimes intellisense doesn t show up in aspx ascx master files if there is a compilation error in the application
if you try running the site and you get a compilation error from asp.net try fixing it and then see if it works
2326689
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
hal
i create a base controller that has a virtual method sendemail mybaseviewmodel model that can be overridden on inherited controllers but has logic that looks for an email fromemail and subject in the view model and if found sets a sendmail boolean to true and also looks for an alternateemailview string in the viewmodel
i then have a custom view result that looks for the trueness of the sendmail properties and then actually renders the view or alternate view and sends the email then renders the normal view to the browser
2327301
short	base
Pattern(s): 
x the length or number of digits in whatever base doesn t matter for big-o anyway of n grows with o log n of course
if you mean to limit your question to factorials of numbers short enough to be multiplied in o 1 then there s no way n can tend to infinity and therefore big-o notation is inappropriate

2327340
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
as an interesting alternative solution you could eschew loops altogether
the for-loop solution is perfectly clear
as an interesting alternative solution you could eschew loops altogether
2327607
width	height
Pattern(s): 
there is actually an easy o 2 n brute force solution where n is either the width or the height whichever is smaller
let s assume the following works on the width since you can transpose it
one observation is that you don t need to press the same button twice - it just cancels out
2327835
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
refer to the provided link to the documentation for the details
according to the structure of your users and specialusers tables you have a table per subclass hierarchy and it is perfectly possible to map this kind of hierarchy with hibernate
first make sure that specialuser inherited from user at the object model level this is an inherited relationship not a self-reference
2328456
gentoo	debian
Pattern(s): 
klik actually automatically does this for some debian packages
rootless gobolinux and gentoo prefix are both systems in which packages can be installed to a local directory without root permissions
it s also possible to extract the contents of a .deb dpkg -x or .rpm rpm2cpio | cpio -i and you may be able to use the results with little or no modifications depending on how they were built
2329350
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 
the free and delete operators under the hood will take the pointer you were handed back up a known offset read it s header block and know to release 256 bytes back to the heap
specifically answering your question the delete operator invokes the destructor where free does not
hence the reason you don t want to mix malloc free with new delete
2329889
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
Pattern(s): 
scrypt is one of the best in that area
from the homepage we estimate that on modern 2009 hardware if 5 seconds are spent computing a derived key the cost of a hardware brute-force attack against scrypt is roughly 4000 times greater than the cost of a similar attack against bcrypt to find the same password and 20000 times greater than a similar attack against pbkdf2
that said from commonly available hash functions doing a few thousand of iterations of anything from the sha family is pretty reasonable protection for non-critical passwords
2332880
dwoo	smarty
Pattern(s): 
they are both very similar but dwoo has the advantage of not sucking major donkey balls which is smarty s main downfall
i have written an extension for the codeigniter parser library to get it to use dwoo which integrates perfectly with my template library
between the two you can make pretty powerful theme-able mvc applications
2333981
free	realloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 
the reason realloc returns a new address is because expansion of the buffer may necessitate it being moved if that current block is surrounded in the memory arena in other words it can t just expand into a free block following it
in that case a new block will be created in the arena the contents transferred from the old block and the old block free
you have to get the return value from realloc in case that happens
2333981
realloc	malloc	realloc	memset
Pattern(s): 
similarly you don t need to memset a memory chunk to 0 if you re immediately going to memcpy over it
provided you initialise temp to null you can just use realloc without testing it
that s because realloc null 7 is identical to malloc 7 - realloc is perfectly capable of starting with a null pointer
2334903
text-align	font-size
Pattern(s): 
element fill whole width of parent text-align justify works best with small font-size with slightly higher line-height - line-height is for readbility and smaller font size puts more characters in one line abstract characters-per-line width therefore gaps between words justified text looks better regarding images instead of small non changing parts of text - i tend to use as few image replacement parts as possible - i have very good results with cufón if you learn to count with it s cons i don t advice using justified text for sidebars and one-liners - it mostly seems ugly edit2 the main problem is that browsers don t know how to part your text unbreakable to un-breakable - soft hyphyen should solve this link soft hyphen overview but browser support is wild at best
text-align justify
in css but beware unlike in proffesional dtp applications or even in word html browser often do not play nicely with this - you might end having humongous gaps in your text completely destroying any typogtaphy you try to achieve in your document
2334903
width	font-size	width	text-align
Pattern(s): 
in css but beware unlike in proffesional dtp applications or even in word html browser often do not play nicely with this - you might end having humongous gaps in your text completely destroying any typogtaphy you try to achieve in your document
edit as reply to brian my experiences are following haven t tried for width because i either set width in px or not at all and let display block
element fill whole width of parent text-align justify works best with small font-size with slightly higher line-height - line-height is for readbility and smaller font size puts more characters in one line abstract characters-per-line width therefore gaps between words justified text looks better regarding images instead of small non changing parts of text - i tend to use as few image replacement parts as possible - i have very good results with cufón if you learn to count with it s cons i don t advice using justified text for sidebars and one-liners - it mostly seems ugly edit2 the main problem is that browsers don t know how to part your text unbreakable to un-breakable - soft hyphyen should solve this link soft hyphen overview but browser support is wild at best
2335270
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
ajax requests won t get you around this
if google-chrome does not recognize the url scheme it defaults to a search
this is what i see in safari alt text and in firefox alt text i believe the reason why google-chrome defaults to search is that there are special google searches that use the colon
2336140
newtype	either
Pattern(s): 
with a function you can use flip to partially apply the second argument but that doesn t work with type constructors like either
the simplest thing is probably wrapping it in a newtype wrapping with newtype is also the standard way to create multiple instances for a single type such as sum and product being instances of monoid for numeric types
otherwise you can only have one instance per type
2336574
gif	png
Pattern(s): 
also because pngs can support alpha transparency they re the only option if you want a variation of transparency other than binary transparency
the main difference is gif is patented and a bit more widely supported
png is an open specification and alpha transparency is not supported in ie6
2336582
tiff	png
Pattern(s): 
in view of the general limitation on the gif image palette to 256 colors it is not usually used as a format for digital photography
digital photographers use image file formats capable of reproducing a greater range of colors such as tiff raw or the lossy jpeg which is more suitable for compressing photographs
the png format is a popular alternative to gif images since it uses better compression techniques and does not have a limit of 256 colors but pngs do not support animations
2337440
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 
for instance they might represent it internally as vectors of words a vector space model and use that to do the search not the actual original string
and creating such a vector involves first cutting the document according to punctuation and other critters
this is a very complex and interesting subject which i can t tell you much more about
2339458
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 
for reliable stuff that can be a little slower if you use tcp make sure you do so in a non-blocking fashion select non-blocking send etc.
the big reason to use udp is if you have time-sensitive data - if the position of a critter gets dropped you re better off ignoring it and sending the next position packet rather than re-sending the last one
and i don t think any high-performance game has each and every call resolve to a call to the database
2340450
qthread	qapplication
Pattern(s): 
seperate threads execution loop prevents the qapplication loop getting cluttered with non-ui related signals and slots and therefore delaying for .e.g button click s slot execution making your application lag
note normally you always subclass qthread see qt doc for more information edit qt doc is wrong read this thread

2342597
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
javascript has prototypal inherited which can be used to recreate classical inherited
that means that inherited is from another object not a class definition
to create an object that has all the properties of another object is simple
2342929
uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 
as i said you can create calayers that exist as separate entities and add them to existing layers as sublayers for display
at some point there will need to be a uiview that hosts all of these sublayers within its backing layer in order for these layers to be seen on the iphone s screen
note that according to the uiview class reference since the view is the layer s delegate you should never set the view as a delegate of another calayer object
2343646
equals	tostring
Pattern(s): 
if you override tostring in your pocos the combobox will automatically display that value while returning the desired object with selecteditem
as stated in msdn you should also override equals in your poco so it can be found in the items collection if necessary
edit addressing your code
2344130
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
Pattern(s): 
quoted from for more detailed explanation please read the following post from mysql forums as for utf8_bin both utf8_general_ci and utf8_unicode_ci perform case-insensitive comparison
in constrast utf8_bin is case-sensitive among other differences because it compares the binary values of the characters

2344277
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
then in x64 builds set one project to build 64bit and the other 32-bit
in x86 builds set one as 32-bit and turn off the other. we ve been using this for a while and it works fine
of course you have to be careful that any changes you make to one are also made to its copy
2344830
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
Pattern(s): 
it is a handler for any exception that is not caught explicitly by the target of the thread
the default uncaughtexceptionhandler simply calls printstacktrace on the throwable to print the stack trace to system.err
however you could replace this with your own uncaughtexceptionhandler that logs the exception to log4j instead if you are using an executor framework to which you pass a runnable object its threads probably have their own catch block that prevent exceptions from reaching the uncaughtexceptionhandler
2345488
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
and indeed this is what i see in the hsqldialect of hibernate-core-3.3.0.sp1.jar so my advice is upgrade to a newer version of hibernate you are very likely using hibernate core 3.2.5 or prior
while the documentation says the next value for a sequence can be included in select insert and update statements as in the following example the correct way because simpler because not involving a table like a dumb dual table that hsqldb doesn t have would be this appeared in 1.7.2 and this his actually how hibernate handles sequences in the hsqldialect of recent versioning of hibernate core see hhh-2839
and indeed this is what i see in the hsqldialect of hibernate-core-3.3.0.sp1.jar so my advice is upgrade to a newer version of hibernate you are very likely using hibernate core 3.2.5 or prior
2346321
goto	break	goto	break
Pattern(s): 
assuming that this is not desired you have what is known as an off-by-one error. you can fix this and eliminate the temporary variable by rearranging your function as follows to avoid using a break statement you can use the following construction edit 2011 september 27 tonyk just because a language provides a feature doesn t mean that one should use it
the goto statement is a classic example of this
granted with such a simple loop there s really no difference between using a function and the break
2346321
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
in the for_each you immediately see that you will be doing something once and only once to each element
in the for-loop you have no idea
loops counter i may be changed in loops
2347196
smartsvn	tortoisesvn
Pattern(s): 
you can however try to extract log entries from caches of an svn client you were using -- as far as i know tortoisesvn caches log entries somewhere
smartsvn does that as well

2348173
iasyncresult	idisposable
Pattern(s): 
the new socket calls get rid of the need for hundreds of idisposable objects lying around
the iasyncresult interface includes an asyncwaithandle property of type waithandle
a waithandle consumes operating system resources
2349239
opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 
source mozilla firefox attempts to auto-detect the charset as pointed here this paper presents three types of auto-detection methods to determine encodings of documents without explicit charset declaration
source opera uses auto-detection too as documented if the transport protocol provides an encoding name that is used
if not opera will look at the page for a charset declaration
2349584
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
note that a hash collision is not the end of the world
when used in a hash table for instance it just means that more than one item is stored in a slot and the table code will have to traverse a little bit more to find or add the target item increasing lookup time slightly
you ll see people refer to md5 as a broken hashing algorithm when in reality it s just a poor one to use as a cryptographic hash
2349842
mouseover	mouseenter
Pattern(s): 
...of course you could eliminate the click in that case and just change the background with the mouseenter event
edit given your comment above you could do something like this this will color the background of the td when you mouseover but only if the mouse button is down
sounds like you just want to change the color when you click
2351044
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousedown
Pattern(s): 
remove both active and hot in the mouseout handler the actual important stuff i always bind to click
what i do is add a style hot in the mouseover handler
add another style active in the mousedown handler
2351247
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
that way people can customize their language to perfectly fit their needs
of course some implementations package the core lisp with a bunch of these features as libraries
at least for scheme plt scheme provides all of the above features mostly as libraries
2351247
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
at least for scheme plt scheme provides all of the above features mostly as libraries
i don t know of an equivalent for common lisp but there may be one
i m not sure i never looked for it
2352269
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
you d use directory.getfiles 192.168.0.10 shared folder
the unc path you posted 192.168.0.10 shared folder mydrive is odd
there is no drive such a share behaves as a directory
2352269
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
there is no drive such a share behaves as a directory
you d use directory.getfiles 192.168.0.10 shared folder

2352706
collabnet	svn
Pattern(s): 
i don t have experience as an svn administrator for others
collabnet works just fine
i have it running locally on my home development machine as a windows service
2352780
nginx	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 
i admire lighttpd for it s threading system but it s a nono with php. thread safe modules are a nice dream.
and nginx is really fast but it ventures off the syntax configs i m used with
lighttpd and nginx are really fast but i would only use them for static content
2353006
gif	png
Pattern(s): 
however the jury is still out on their use in general
they do appear to be especially good for small logos and icons but for large detailed images gif is largely comparable in file size and jpeg still has the best overall filesize to quality ratio and that can make a big difference to a web site s loading time
png is gaining traction as a format though and you can expect to see it being used more and more everywhere you look
2353190
memcached	apc	memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 
using apc your cache is duplicated on each server
using memcached there is no duplication accross servers whic means that memcached ensures that all servers have the same version of the data
while data stored in apc can be different on each server we generally use apc for data that has to be accessed very often is quick to generate and either is not modified often or it doesn t matter if it s not identical on all servers memcached for data that takes more time to generate and or is less used. or for data for which modifications must be visible immediatly when there is a write to the db the cached entry is regenerated too for instance we could use apc to store configuration variables don t change often are accessed very often are small use memcached for content of articles for a cms application for example not that small and there are a lot of them which means it might need more memory than we have on one server alone pretty hard heavy to generate a couple of sidenotes if several servers try to write to the same file that s shared via nfs there can be problems as there is no locking mecanism on nfs as far as i remember apc can be used to cache data yes -- but the most important reason to use it is it s opcode caching feature can save a large amount of cpu on the php servers entries in memcached are limited in size you cannot store an entry that s bigger than 1m i ve sometimes run into that problem -- rarely but it s not good when it happens
2353281
next	except
Pattern(s): 
so if we have the state this is informally a state where the only remaining command to execute is ++x the variable x has value 42 and the variable y has value -5351
we can then define transitions from one state of the program to another -- we describe what happens when we take the next step in the program
so for ++ we could define the following semantics somewhat informally by executing ++x the next command is skip which has no effect and the variables in the store are unchanged except for x which now has the value that it originally had plus one
2353995
cldc	midp
Pattern(s): 
the first configuration is the jvm and the core classes for running a virtual machine such as io collection classes dates strings ext
cldc is a configuration the other profile contains classes for that are more utilities that are built on top of this such as ui encryption persisting local data ect
midp is a profile
2354999
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 
you could also have both like so this would make it possible to use st to refer to the struct type itself and stp for pointers to st
personally i find it a very bad practice to include the asterisk in typedef since it tries to encode something the fact that the type is a pointer into the name of the type when c already provides its own mechanism the asterisk to show this
it makes it very confusing and breaks the symmetry of the asterisk which appears both in declaration and use of pointers
2357675
iboutlet	ibaction
Pattern(s): 
when you declare a property and synthesize it all you get is the accessors there is no special automatic behaviour in dealloc
also there is nothing magical about iboutlet it s just a marker for interface builder to see which properties you would like to appear in ib
it s simply an empty macro cmd-click the iboutlet keyword to see its definition #ifndef iboutlet #define iboutlet #endif same thing goes for ibaction which expands to void
2358183
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
it is also built around having all date fields grouped together so you could probably just modify this example to get what you want
this post goes onto explain how to create a composite object using zend_form_element and settings up custom decorators
it is also built around having all date fields grouped together so you could probably just modify this example to get what you want
2358750
gtk	gdk
Pattern(s): 
the gdk window is immediately hooked into the x server when it is created
i m not quite sure i understand what you re trying to do but window s in gtk are invisible by default
if you never set the visibility to true or if you explicitly set it to false it will remain invisible
2359728
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
this given with
earlier means that is false a as an unsigned int is equal to b
let s say you have a ones complement machine and you do let s say a chars signed or unsigned is 8-bits on that machine
2362672
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
this combination is called the effective pom.xml and can be printed using the effective-pom goal of the maven help plugin useful for debugging
and indeed if you run mvn help effective-pom you ll see at least the following it has the absolute url where the maven repo is for the project but maven is still trying to download from the general maven repo maven will try to find dependencies in all repositories declared including in the central one which is there by default as we saw
but according to the trace you are showing you only have one repository defined the central repository or maven would print something like this reason unable to download the artifact from any repository url.project project pom.xml x.x from the specified remote repositories central another-repository so basically maven is unable to find the url.project project pom.xml x.x because it is not available in central
2363163
equals	gethashcode	equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 
i guess your implementation of gethashcode is ok but i usually use things similar to this
assuming that the instances are equals because the hash codes are equals is wrong
i guess your implementation of gethashcode is ok but i usually use things similar to this
2363170
opera	google-chrome	opera	google-chrome
Pattern(s): 
it s all just a matter of how the browsers position themselves like i mentioned with google-chrome above
opera has always been in the lead but they ve also always had weird bugs
right now google-chrome is in an interesting position google just bought an internet video protocol company on2 and so they have the power to end the h.264 vs
2364863
tabcontrol	tabitem
Pattern(s): 
you can simply search-and-replace window in your existing code with page then replace show calls to your custom show which does the following check for previously created tabitem for this page using a dictionary if no tabitem found wrap the page inside a new tabitem and add it to the tabcontrol switch the tabcontrol to the new tabitem the contenttemplate you would use for your tabcontrol is extremely simple using a frame with navigation using frame with navigation is a very good solution for a kiosk because it implements a lot of the page switching and other functionality
however it may be more work to update an existing application this way than to use a tabcontrol
in either case you need to convert from window to page but with frame you also need to deal with navigation
2365191
bash	subshell
Pattern(s): 
the subshell runs in an entirely separate operating system process and the only way for two processes to share memory is for their code to set that up explicitly with system calls
bash doesn t do that
what you need to do is find some other way for the two processes to communicate
2370725
floating-point	fractions
Pattern(s): 
in the rare case that you have a benign number with a benign fractions part the error will be zero.
floating-point division a b is not mathematical division a b except in very rare circumstances
generally floating point division a b is a b + ε
2371550
setinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	clearinterval
Pattern(s): 
calling setinterval will return a value which can be passed to clearinterval to stop the function from being called
there is an alternative to settimeout called setinterval which will call the function you pass as argument at regular intervals
calling setinterval will return a value which can be passed to clearinterval to stop the function from being called

daemon	cron
Pattern(s): 
with both languages you could have them run intermittently via a cron job or you could have them run as a daemon which is as easy as running the script s while piping your output to a black hole such as dev null
there are two good options here php php is a server side language and if you design the frontend with some robust classes you can reuse the classes for the command-line daemon
this allows you to have a more standardized application suite which will be easier to modify in the future
2374613
jfreechart	prefuse	jfreechart	prefuse
Pattern(s): 
i would recommend checking this out unless there is some specific reason you are using prefuse
jfreechart is an excellent graphing package has a ton of documentation and is regularly updated
i would recommend checking this out unless there is some specific reason you are using prefuse
2375120
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 
a get call should not cause side effects on the server
post is when you intend to send something on the server and have it do something with it
edit the word i was looking for to describe get is idempotent
2376245
median	percentile
Pattern(s): 
when using top 50 percent make sure criteria in the query is specific for that result set from which median will be calculated
median can be be calculated in ms access using just regular queries and without vba
median is the 50th percentile
2377486
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
it provides richer tools like icons tool tips etc
which are not available in awt
also swing is meant to be portable while awt in theory will match more of the system s look and feel
2378557
x86	64bit	forth	compiled-language
Pattern(s): 
mostly this is because x86_64 doesn t just have 64bit registers it also has twice as many
x86 does not have enough registers to make compiled-language as efficient as they could be so x86 code spends a lot of instructions and memory bandwidth shifting data back and forth between registers and memory
x86_64 has much less of that and so it takes a little less space and runs faster
2378769
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
lets say rand 256 gave 255 which is 1111 1111
clearly the most significant bit of this is set so when you try to print it as an int it will be interpreted as a -ve number
to avoid getting -ve numbers you ll have to declare the iv as an array of unsigned chars
2378772
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
this is with the intel icc compiler 11.1 on an x86-64 linux - results with other compilers gcc or with other operating systems windows may be different of course
i typically see a 30 speed improvement for compute-intensive code on x86-64 compared to x86
this is most likely due to the fact that we have 16 x 64bit general purpose registers and 16 x sse registers instead of 8 x 32 bit general purpose registers and 8 x sse registers
2380000
put	get
Pattern(s): 
with the what you get back is essentially the variable containing the returned integer
that means you can actually put it on the left-hand side of an assignment like so

2380280
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
it s great for transforming a string to a keycode and back again
here s code to simulate a cmd - s action a cgkeycode is nothing more than an unsigned int typedef uint16_t cgkeycode
from cgremoteoperation.h your real issue will be turning a chars probably an nsstring into a keycode
2380391
mbunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
test driven development start with mstest its not as slick as anyone would like but its not the worst thing in the world
i would also recommend mbunit which has all of nunit s features along with some good support for the integration tests that you will probably be writing by accident as you are starting out with testing
oh and if you have customization freak i would urge him to look at xunit.net
2381443
jstl	taglib
Pattern(s): 
first create a final class with a public static method which does exactly that then define it as a facelet-taglib in meta-inf formatter.taglib.xml then familarize facelets with the new taglib in the existing web-inf web.xml note if you already have the facelets.libraries definied then you can just add the new path commaseparated then define it in the facelets xhtml file as new xml namespace finally you can use it as intended hope this helps
indeed you cannot use the good old jstl in facelets anymore the way as you would do in jsp
facelets only supports a limited subset of jstl and has it already builtin the jstl jar file is in fact superfluous
2382460
getter	setter	getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
yet it is reasonable to provide access to object s properties and use getters setter for this
for example if car has the color property it s acceptable to let clients observe it using a getter
if some client needs the ability to recolor a car the class can provide a setter recolor is more clear name though
2382665
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
if the platform has 32 bit int and 8 bit chars but is little endian and or doesn t support unicode and if the serial number can vary in length then the below may be useful though it s a little workmanlike
if the serial number fits into 32 bits and the platform is big endian and supports unicode 32 bit int and the standard c libraries then this is pretty straightforward as other answers have shown
if the platform has 32 bit int and 8 bit chars but is little endian and or doesn t support unicode and if the serial number can vary in length then the below may be useful though it s a little workmanlike
2384201
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
i refer to to data and method visibility a few times
i m talking about members marked as public vs
private or protected which is a totally different type of object protection discussed here .
2384658
width	height
Pattern(s): 
edit see michael stum s answer which indicates that the img.width height reference is even more costly than thought
as it sometimes happens with properties the implementation of the object may run a significant amount of code to produce the value for example it may do a bunch of math to get to the width each time rather than somehow caching it etc..
this seems to be the case with this img object hence the interest to do this only once if you are sure that the value will remain constant for the duration of the loop logic
2388732
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	cakephp
Pattern(s): 
cakephp has very ambiguous documentation.
i think codeigniter is a good choice
cakephp has very ambiguous documentation.
2389388
csv	tsv
Pattern(s): 
fortunately tsv isn t usually nearly so nasty
while practice is all well and good csv is actually a lot more complex than the name suggests - you have quoted unquoted multi-line and the horrible issue where in some areas the c becomes a period .
i strongly recommend you use something pre-rolled such as csvreader
2389912
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
such a design is very hard to test which means that it is also very rigid
prefer delegation over inherited
or as jbrains puts it stop subclassing or the kitten gets it
2390527
svg	vml
Pattern(s): 
other vector graphics alternatives are the currently hated sigh flash ie s vml directly coded to and svg if a browser supports it
there are rumblings that ie9 is going to have svg which is an interesting development
what is curious about this teeth nashing about canvas versus other things recently flash of course is the lack of real discussion about its practical application challenges
2390633
typemock	moles	typemock	moles
Pattern(s): 
it should be noted there is an additional mocking framework that can intercept all calls the microsoft moles framework
it works the same way typemock does it uses the .net profiler api to intercept calls
moles is free for now
2392356
nunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
you can t do that with mstest
you can change the code in nunit because it is open source
you can t do that with mstest
2392939
put	get
Pattern(s): 
if the get is destructive this can lead to unintentional data loss
you might be safe if your keys aren t repeated the action might just fail but why put your application and data at risk
destructive actions should always use either post or delete preferably the latter -- although that usually requires that it be done via ajax so you often end up supporting both
2393078
post	get
Pattern(s): 
i had called it blog.php which works fine when creating an ordinary page template
but when using a page as a post page wordpress has some specific setup rules
the pertinent section of documentation which i scoured the entire internet for using hours of my life i ll never get back is hidden here also any template assigned the page will be ignored and the theme s index.php or home.php if it exists will control the display of the post
2393129
wxpython	pyqt
Pattern(s): 
if you can afford a book pyqt has a good one also applies to pyside as above -- this excellent and free one is unfortunately very old so i don t think it helps
wxpython s own book is also quite good
tkinter s again is very dated
2393668
jar	manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 
here is the graphical illustration of what that means alt text double-click on the manifest.mf file and through the dependencies tab just add org.eclipse.core.runtime and it will add other dependencies including org.eclipse.equinox.registry which includes your missing class
as mentioned in this thread don t include the jar files manually in the plugin.xml file
use the dependencies tab in your plugin.xml editor to manage the dependencies on the plugins
2393712
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
this method would be passed the subclassing when it is created which you can track
override the class method named inherited
this method would be passed the subclassing when it is created which you can track
2393989
nunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
nunit contains a fluent version of assert api as already mentioned - assert.that.. there are several of these implemented by 3rd parties for mstest nunit is much faster see jamie s comment he has managed to get mstest running faster - nunit can run tests in 32 and 64 bit mstest only runs them in 32 bit iirc not in 2010 64 bit support is built in
nunit allows abstract classes to be test fixtures so you can inherit test fixtures
mstest does not
2393989
nunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
correct there is a lot of misconception that mstest is the same as nunit but mstest is a generalized framework
nunit contains pnunit running parallel tests with nunit
mstest only adds this ability in vs 2010 correct there is an xml config setting that allows control of degree of parallelism
2393997
int	boolean	int	boolean
Pattern(s): 
so non-boolean values or not automatically transformed to boolean
in the first case the result of the statements is an int which is non-boolean which will not work
the last case the result is boolean which can be evaluated in an if-statement
2394465
instances	transient
Pattern(s): 
if the elvis class is made to implement serializable the following readresolve method suffices to guarantee the singleton property this method ignores the deserialized object returning the distinguished elvis instances that was created when the class was initialized
therefore the serialized form of an elvis instances need not contain any real data
all instances fields should be declared transient
2395741
sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
Pattern(s): 
if the only reason you use udp is latency then you can probably use tcp and disable the nagle algorithm
if you want packetized data with reliable low latency delivery another possibility is sctp also with nagle disabled
it can also provide out-of-order delivery to speed things up even more
2398079
inherited	properties	width	height
Pattern(s): 
note that there are different rules for block-level and floating elements but is naturally an inline element width auto is the default value width value length | percentage | auto | inherited initial auto
you can find various rules for calculating the width for width auto here . regarding inherited each properties may also have a specified value of inherited which means that for a given element the properties takes the same computed value as the properties for the element s parent
so width inherited means it takes the same computed width as the parent element. regarding width auto on inline elements if height and width both have computed values of auto and the element also has an intrinsic width then that intrinsic width is the used value of width
2398221
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
there is nothing wrong with your second example - yes it is a bit verbose but it is clear concise and gets the job done
the getter of the first example is returning the property itself not a backing field
unfortunately there is no way to shorten what you have automatically implemented properties must have empty getter and setter blocks to be syntactically correct
2398275
post	get
Pattern(s): 
it would help to know that
caching post requests is kind-of weird and your browser won t want to do it because a post is supposed to mean that you are doing something actively on the server
for get requests things are cached the same way the browser caches anything else with the exception that jquery will modify your get urls with dummy parameters if you tell it to the cache property you pass in the argument object to .ajax
2398833
int	double
Pattern(s): 
this doesn t change the binary value so the number displayed is the binary representation of a float or a double
the actual cast from float to int is much more complex in the generated assembly

2399567
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
there s more information on using styles on msdn
visualtree inherited is not universal
the dependency properties specifies that it will inherit down the visual tree when it is declared
2400341
onclick	preventdefault	onclick	preventdefault
Pattern(s): 
as per the other answers you can then us the css hover pseudo-class to style the element for the href # i would put this in the html you submitted if not you can use the following jquery to add the attribute as for returning false from the click event it appares that at least when you have only one click event defined jquery will return what your click function returns so or use the preventdefault method on event see
in some browsers a hover does not work if you do not have an href to get the onclick and the hover functionality you can the return false on the onclick will prevent the browsers default action taking place and the href # means that even if it does this is just a link to this page
as per the other answers you can then us the css hover pseudo-class to style the element for the href # i would put this in the html you submitted if not you can use the following jquery to add the attribute as for returning false from the click event it appares that at least when you have only one click event defined jquery will return what your click function returns so or use the preventdefault method on event see
2400818
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 
cast one of them up to a double and the entire division will be done as double
try this if you divide an int by an int you will get a truncated answer
cast one of them up to a double and the entire division will be done as double
2402671
ffmpeg	libavformat
Pattern(s): 
alternatively examine the source code for one of the many open source projects that already incorporate ffmpeg at projects.html
the ffmpeg documentation guide can be found at ffmpeg.org documentation.html including the developer s guide
i suggest looking at libavformat output-example.c or perhaps the source of the ffmpeg command line utility itself
2403253
width	margin
Pattern(s): 
bottom 30px
margin-left should be 1 2 of the width of the div you are centering so if the div is 200px wide use -100px for your margin-left
when the margin is negative it pulls the div in that direction
2406533
tabs	tabpanel
Pattern(s): 
tabpanel is a poor choice for a variable name keep them beginning with lower case and never name them after the framework classes
try tabs or tp
also the naming convention will be clearer if you prefix the node id with a string like tab-
2406955
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
certain properties like font-family inherit
if you set a font-family on the body that font family will be inherited by all the elements within the body
the same is true for color but it is not true for background or height which will always default to transparent and auto
2407115
moq	typemock
Pattern(s): 
otherwise you ll have to refactor so that an interface can be mocked.
moq and most other mocking frameworks don t support mocking out static methods
however typemock does support mocking out static methods and that might be of interest to you if you re willing to purchase it
2408201
gif	png	gif	ico
Pattern(s): 
you also want to use an alpha channel transparency in your bitmaps to get the best result so storing them as .png files in your resources is the best way to go since png supports an alpha channel
ico and gif files support only single bit for transparency - every pixel is either fully opaque or fully transparent
an 8 bit alpha channel for transparency looks much nicer
2408241
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
if other objects need to access the object you can always add a getter
this exposes another problem in that other classes might be able to change the object returned by the getter
but your getter could always return a copy of the instance variable. in addition using a getter setter also shields other parts of the same class from knowing about its own implementation which i ve found very useful on occasion
2410107
equals	icomparable	equals	icomparable
Pattern(s): 
icomparable would tell you that 5 comes before 7
iequatable tests whether two objects are equals
icomparable imposes a total ordering on the objects being compared
2410107
equals	icomparable	equals	icomparable
Pattern(s): 
icomparable imposes a total ordering on the objects being compared
for example iequatable would tell you that 5 is not equals to 7
icomparable would tell you that 5 comes before 7
2410769
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
the problem is that the definition of class b can t know that d is a subclassing of c until it sees a full definition of class d but the definition of class d can t know that b is a subclassing of a until it sees a full definition of class b and so you have a circular dependency
this can t be resolved with forward-declarations because a forward declaration unfortunately cannot specify an inherited relationship
there s a similar problem with trying to implement a covariant clone method using templates which i found can be solved but the analogous solution still fails here because the circular reference remains impossible to resolve
2414783
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
Pattern(s): 
there are some workarounds to mimic this event on older versions of ie like the used on the jquery library they attach the ie specific onreadystatechange event
the domcontentloaded event will fire as soon as the dom hierarchy has been fully constructed the load event will do it when all the images and sub-frames have finished loading
domcontentloaded will work on most modern browsers but not on ie including ie9 and above
2414824
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
also in the late 1960s and early 1970s when lex yacc were created hardware limitations posed a serious challenge to parsing
the table driven lr parsing method used by yacc was the most suitable at the time because it could be implemented with a small memory footprint by using a relatively small general program logic and by keeping state in files on tape or disk
code driven parsing methods such as ll had a larger minimum memory footprint because the parser program s code itself represents the grammar and therefore it needs to fit entirely into ram to execute and it keeps state on the stack in ram
2414890
next	except
Pattern(s): 
here are the lines from my .vimrc file that way i can switch between tabs using the left and right buttons just like i normally would move the cursor except i just hold the control key as well
control + l moves to the next tab control + h moves to the previous tab control + n creates a new tab

2415238
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster
this is one of the way cool features of bazaar that doesn t get enough press the ability for people to work the way that makes them comfortable even on the same shared repository
fine
2416635
moq	moles	moq	moles
Pattern(s): 
moles supports static or non-virtual methods. it might be useful for your current situation
as mentioned in previous answers you can t use moq on static methods and if you need to your best shot is to create a wrapper around the static class
however something i ve discovered recently is the moles project
2417601
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
you could use a database for this or even a flat cache file in xml or something. you could then serialise de-serialise an array of your md5 hashes dates etc remove any from the array you don t need any more then serialise the array back to your cache file again
if you re storing the date the hash was last retrieved update the date every time you check the feed and the item still exists and create a maintenance routine that removes dates older than a pre-determined interval
run this maintenance routine say once a day
2417777
polymorphism	specialization
Pattern(s): 
conceptual hierarchy conceptually related classes can be organized into a specialization hierarchy people employees managers geometric objects .
polymorphism objects of distinct but related classes may be uniformly treated by clients array of geometric objects software reuse related classes may share interfaces data structures or behaviour
geometric objects .
2418158
vtk	itk
Pattern(s): 
some more information for option number 1 i wrote this but as you mention it is the inferior option
here are some links for option number 2 mayavi2 s mlab s has a nice ability to switch between vtk and numpy
wrapitk allows you to write itk pipelines in python and you can go back and forth with numpy with the pybuffer external project found there
2418619
int	double
Pattern(s): 
an int suffix can tell the compiler if it s a long long long or unsigned type
10 is implicitly a signed int 10u 10u is explicitly an unsigned int 10l 10l is explicitly a signed long int 10ll 10ll or 10i64 on win32 is explicitly a signed long long int 10ull is explicitly an unsigned long long floating point types also have this situation
a type can either be a float a double or a long double
2418928
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
then maven will build correctly
you should manage your dependencies either through eclipse or through maven
maven has a nice utility to create eclipse project files and there s a plugin to manage the pom.xml file in eclipse
2418971
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 
basically update your pom.xml with and add the dependency
as the other answer suggests you should use eclipse or maven
maven has a useful eclipse eclipse target that can be used to generate an eclipse project that can be imported in eclipse
2420281
agile	sprint
Pattern(s): 
if it didn t pass qa then the sprint goals were not met and the story carried over into the next iteration as the highest priority item
agile is not about taking short cuts and there is a heavy emphasis on quality
if you are working somewhere where this is not happening then you have been hoodwinked imho
2420868
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	add	subtraction	add
Pattern(s): 
if multiplication is not allowed then there also seem to be plenty of integer division algorithms which just use shifts bitwise operations and add subtract first hit on google www.bearcave.com software divide.htm
there are various methods - i would suggest newton-raphson which is simple and fast and uses only multiplication and subtraction
if multiplication is not allowed then there also seem to be plenty of integer division algorithms which just use shifts bitwise operations and add subtract first hit on google www.bearcave.com software divide.htm
2421540
komodo	aptana
Pattern(s): 
color coding and syntax checking are there to an extent
the project control on komodo is very unwieldy and strange compared to the other ides
aptana the perfect solution
2422059
qstackedwidget	qwidget	qstackedwidget	qgraphicswidget	qstackedwidget	qgraphicswidget
Pattern(s): 
with a little work you could even make it generic enough to be used as a qgraphicswidget version of qstackedwidget
you can fairly easily emulate a qstackedwidget on your own
create your own widget however you want to either from qwidget or from qgraphicswidget and put it where you want the two different widgets to appear
2422410
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 
yes there are differences
nunit is an older more established unit testing framework designed to do exactly one thing - unit testing
mstest is newer so it does not have the same level of maturity in its api
2424785
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
there is no need to subclassing button to react to events
this article should give you a complete answer design principles from design patterns composition versus inherited i quote a straight answer from erich gamma here i still think it s true even after ten years
inherited is a cool way to change behavior
2424785
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
inherited is a cool way to change behavior
but we know that it s brittle because the subclass can easily make assumptions about the context in which a method it overrides is getting called
there s a tight coupling between the base class and the subclass because of the implicit context in which the subclass code i plug in will be called
2425322
uidatepicker	uipickerview
Pattern(s): 
you can only ask for its date info
uidatepicker does not respond to selectedrowincomponent
it s not a subclass of uipickerview
2426955
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
Pattern(s): 
blindselectionpanel.setalignmenty jpanel.top_alignment
riduidel is correct about setting setalignmenty on the gameselectionpanel itself and gridbaglayout is an excellent alternative
if you prefer to stick with boxlayout the article fixing alignment problems discusses the matter suggesting all the components controlled by a left-to-right boxlayout should generally have the same y alignment. in your example add botselectionpanel.setalignmenty jpanel.top_alignment
2427391
structuremap	log4net
Pattern(s): 
in any case structuremap does not currently require log4net
here s a quick screenshot from reflector showing as much alt text jnmiller img sm-log4net.png it might be worthwhile to find out which version of structuremap the book is referencing and try that one rather than the latest

2427520
squash	branch	squash	branch	squash	merge
Pattern(s): 
note it does not produce a commit right away you need an additional git commit -m squash branch this is useful if you want to throw away the source branch completely going from schema taken from so question git checkout stable x stable a---b---c---d---e---f---g tmp to git merge --squash tmp git commit -m squash tmp x-------------------g stable a---b---c---d---e---f---g tmp and then deleting tmp branch
git rebase --interactive replays some or all of your commits on a new base allowing you to squash or more recently fix up see this so question going directly to git checkout tmp git rebase -i stable stable x-------------------g tmp a---b if you choose to squash all commits of tmp but contrary to merge --squash you can choose to replay some and squash others
so the differences are merge does not touch your source branch tmp here and creates a single commit where you want
2427839
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
however i haven t find anything for mysql it is not the most advanced database
for postgresql for other the syntax varies alter table foo add foreign key fooid references bar deferrable
which means that constraint will be checked at the end of transaction
2428206
post	put
Pattern(s): 
for example template for uri key put data 201 created or put data 200 ok you can also do a create but do not replace if exists using if-none-match jan
post does not support a lookup or create approach
the server cannot tell the client i would create that but it already existed
2428773
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
i would get this error when i assigned the result cannot use string offset as an arrays and aparently the friends_arefriends method above was failing alot
my solution was to create a for-loop that ran that code and then check answer to see if it was an arrays using php method is_array and executing the method call again if it wasn t
my loops was for 10 tries before just letting it fail
2428941
openmpi	mpich
Pattern(s): 
mpich has built-in debugger while openmpi does not last time i checked
in production openmpi most likely will be faster
but then you may want to research other alternatives such as intel mpi
2430207
width	font-size	width	font-size
Pattern(s): 
and the jquery code that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equal to 800px
maybe one solution would be to use javascript to calculate the width of the given text in some standard font size then resize until you get a reasonable width
in javascript you can calculate the width of the text like this initailly the text is placed in a span with no styles applied apart from the font-size
2430207
width	font-size
Pattern(s): 
for example i quickly wrote this using jquery
suppose you have your html like this i used a span because it resizes to the width of the text rather than the container
and the jquery code that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equal to 800px
2430545
lxml	elementtree	lxml	elementtree
Pattern(s): 
the elementtree api is very nice in an object oriented setting
i don t do much with xml but when i ve needed to lxml has been a joy to work with and is apparently quite fast
the elementtree api is very nice in an object oriented setting
2430984
int	double
Pattern(s): 
this will overflow silently if n is too big as is the custom in c and java
if the numbers int can represent are too small for the factorials you want to compute then choose another number type
long long if it needs be just a little bit bigger float or double if n isn t too big and you don t mind some imprecision or big integers if you want the exact values of really big factorials
2432171
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 
sicp uses scheme and is itself a great resource for learning to program the functional way
however common lisp has many advanced features that make it quite expressive such as powerful error handling more powerful than exceptions multimethods and support for aspect oriented programming
you might start with one but in the end you should study many languages
2433993
rational-numbers	zero	rational-numbers	integer
Pattern(s): 
i claim that q is the smallest such positive integer
i am assuming that the input decimal r is a positive rational-numbers r with a terminating decimal representation
let d be the number of digits after the decimal point assume that we have trimmed all extraneous zero from the decmial representation of r

profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 
especially for languages like c or c++ there are tools like purify or quantify that profile memory usage performance statistics and the like
to make those profiling programs work correctly an instrumenting step is necessary to insert the counters array-boundary checks etc that is used by the profiling programs
note that in the purify quantify scenario the instrumentation is done automatically as a post-compilation step actually it s an added step to the linking process and you don t touch your source code
2434591
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 
note that in the purify quantify scenario the instrumentation is done automatically as a post-compilation step actually it s an added step to the linking process and you don t touch your source code
some of that is less necessary with dynamic or vm code profiling tools like optimizeit are available for java that does a lot of what quantify does but no special linking is required but that doesn t negate the concept

2434786
daemons	systemd
Pattern(s): 
dumpleton does a much better job of laying out the considerations than i could attempt to summarize here especially the defining process groups section
delegation to daemons process section find the section of text toward the bottom of the page that begins with now traditional wisdom in respect of django has been that it should perferably only be used on single threaded servers
this would mean for apache using the single threaded prefork mpm on unix systemd and avoiding the multithreaded worker mpm
2435651
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
if an admin deploys your web part to the bin directory then this folder will be in something like which will be mapped to something like c inetpub wwwroot wss virtualdirectories 80 wpresources yourwebpart if an admin deploys to the gac then it will be mapped to c program files common files microsoft shared web server extensions wpresources webpartstrongname to find out the path that you need at runtime you should use webpart.classresourcepath so modifying your code msdn - creating a web part with client-side script
resources should go in the wpresources folder

2436304
haskell	scheme
Pattern(s): 
if your language makes it feel natural to write imperatively it s too easy to fall into that way of thinking and never realize there s a different way to do it
if you re interested in functional programming haskell is the only purely functional language on that list
common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure
2436575
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
the geographical capabilities of the two databases are very very different
postgresql has the exceptional postgis extension
mysql s geographical functionality is practically zero in comparison
2436884
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 
this conversion is defined by the standard to take the value modulo-256 so the result is that n is set to 0
not sure where you can find a table but the rules for integer conversions are at 6.3.1.3 1 when a value with integer type is converted to another integer type other than _bool if the value can be represented by the new type it is unchanged
2 otherwise if the new type is unsigned the value is converted by repeatedly adding or subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until the value is in the range of the new type.49 3 otherwise the new type is signed and the value cannot be represented in it
2438289
capitalize	uppercase
Pattern(s): 
sᴛᴀᴄᴋ oᴠᴇʀғʟᴏᴡ and text-transform uppercase makes it all caps too but but the typeface stays the same size so uppercase typeface will be bigger that small-caps
if you use text-transform capitalize the word stack overflow will become stack overflow only the 1st letter of each word gets caps
but if you use font-variant small-caps the word stack overflow becomes stack overflow but the height of the type-face will match the height of the lowercase letters before the css style was applied
2439328
width	margin
Pattern(s): 
using the margin is cleaner if you have several controls in the grid and don t want to create nested grids to handle this kind of split
try this just make the button the desired width and the text box will fill up the rest
thanks for the catch
2440086
clang	llvm
Pattern(s): 
llvm contains a reasonably modern parsing framework
and there is a c++ parser as well see clang project
some packrat implementations for c++ are available sort of the most trendy thing in parsing
2440915
rspec	capybara
Pattern(s): 
i also prefer capybara over webrat
rspec is wonderful for it s rails integration and structure
it s technically behavior testing but in practice it ends up feeling like unit testing
2441756
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 
then use the appropriate ddl statements
first make sure you are using innodb or another engine that supports foreign keys
myisam does not
2441874
cos	sin
Pattern(s): 
secondly if you don t care that much about precision you can precalc the radians itself for let s say 10000 points from 0 to pi 2 - that should give a nice approximation up to 4 decimal numbers eg less than a km also remember that sin a when a pi 2 and a pi equals to sin pi - a when a pi and a 3 2 pi equals to -sin a-pi and when a 3 2 pi and a 2pi it s equal to -sin 2pi - a
similiar functions can be made for cos function
try this and see if it helps. luke
2442400
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
if your enum is a nested enum of a class it can be declared as protected
however if it is a top-level enum it can be either public or internal
public of course means it is visible to everyone both inside and outside the assembly
2444451
hash	md5	hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
bigger hash mean a larger set of possible hash for the same input set so a lower chance of overlap but until processing power advances sufficiently to make brute-forcing md5 trivial it s still a decent choice for most purposes
while it is likely that you get collisions if the values to be hash are much longer than the resulting hash the number of collisions is still sufficiently low for most purposes there are 2 128 possible hash total so the chance of two random strings producing the same hash is theoretically close to 1 in 10 38
md5 was primarily created to do integrity checks so it is very sensitive to minimal changes
2444451
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
this is why it is hard to guess a password based on the hash value alone
while the hash itself is not reversible it is still possible to find a possible input value by pure brute force
this is why you should always make sure to add a salt if you are using md5 to store password hashes if you include a salt in the input string a matching input string has to include exactly the same salt in order to result in the same output string because otherwise the raw input string that matches the output will fail to match after the automated salting you can t just reverse the md5 and use it to log in because the reversed md5 hash will most likely not be the salt string that originally resulted in the creation of the hash
2445463
subclass	inherited	subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 
however while technically possible most of the time you are subclassing builtins such as str you are looking at a has-a kind of relationship not is-a therefore composition should be used not inherited meaning you should create a class with a string as an instance attribute rather than subclass string
to do that you can subclass str

2446607
equals	tostring
Pattern(s): 
in order to avoid lazyinitializationexception no matter whether in equals or in your view jsp you can use opensessioninview
equals and hashcode should be implemented using a business key - a set of properties that uniquely identify the object but are not its auto-generated id
in tostring you can put whatever information is interesting - for example all fields
2446749
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	dealloc
Pattern(s): 
you need to manage the timer properly
if you want it to start when the view is first created and keep ticking firing even when the view is not shown then you need to create it during init or viewdidload and then be sure to stop it when you dealloc or viewdidunload
if you want your timer to only tick fire when the view is the current view then you need to ensure you re managing stopping and starting the timer appropriately on viewdidappear and viewwilldisappear
2447823
post	get	post	put	post	put
Pattern(s): 
also as you are putting a resource you can use or put but i think the 1st one is more restful since you are putting a resource while the second onde you just use the url
i don t think that s the case to use post
the reset action is a idempotent action if you call it n times you will always get the same result so imho you should use a put call instead post as post is not idempotent
2448378
children	parent	children	parent
Pattern(s): 
it s not the cleanest solution but if you keep it as an nsnumber in the parent entity you d have access to it even if children is faulted and you can sort on it directly
your query would work but assuming children is faulted would use key-value coding methods on the children property which in turn would fire the fault see the nsmanagedobject docs for a list of methods that fire faults and a discussion of this behavior so you d lose the performance benefits of batching and faulting
you might consider maintaining a derived attribute on your parent entity call it childrencount that reflects the number of children related to the parent if this is feasible for your situation
2449370
post	put
Pattern(s): 
idempotent means that no matter how many times you apply the operation the result is always the same
in sql insert is the only nonidempotent operation so it should be mapped onto post
update is idempotent so it can be mapped on put
2451394
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
this way you can let many models have the properties of a restaurant without duplicating your code
what you could also try though i haven t experimented with it myself is multiple levels of inherited
not sure off the top of my head whether mongomapper supports this but i don t see why it wouldn t
2451594
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
a divide-by-two search in a sorted arrays of size n can be written as a non-nested for-loop too but it would have o log n time
and like you rightly said a for-loop from 0 to n n would execute in o n n time
yes there are codes where running time is not immediately obvious
2451674
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
the source is much more than a handful of lines
boost.typetraits has make_unsigned type if t is a unsigned int type then the same type as t if t is an signed int type then the corresponding unsigned type
otherwise if t is an enumerated or chars type chars or wchar_t then an unsigned int type with the same width as t
2451785
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
anybody can contribute to both but for dojox the barrier of entry is much higher because a submission will be reviewed and can be rejected if it doesn t meet strict criteria
in general it takes a lot of time while in jquery land anybody can submit any code as a plugin at any time and with any license
it makes it easier to belong to the jquery community
2453270
subclass	base-class
Pattern(s): 
for instance in an actual project i have a base-class for generating html-code
depending on the situation i create the correct subclass that generates the right html
this classes have mostly the same interface but their behaviour is so different that i don t want to select it via if or switch
2453822
prng	random
Pattern(s): 
the hash function by its definition should make a good job at concentrating that entropy into a n -bit string
once we have n bits we use a prng pseudo-random number generator to crank out as many bits as necessary
a prng is said to be cryptographically secure if assuming that it operates over a wide enough unknown n -bit key its output is computationally indistinguishable from uniformly random bits
2453997
config	ini	config	ini
Pattern(s): 
if there s just one possible config for one user or such maybe you should just put everything in a text file the extension doesn t matter ini cfg txt lol anything you want just simplify your life by using standard java config access using the properties class
if this config is user-related maybe you want to keep separate config for each user serialized on a database so you can load them dynamically when a user loads the form that displays the checkboxes
if there s just one possible config for one user or such maybe you should just put everything in a text file the extension doesn t matter ini cfg txt lol anything you want just simplify your life by using standard java config access using the properties class
2454600
isr	freertos
Pattern(s): 
however a preemptive rtos like freertos uses its own stack frame typically bigger than the stack frame generated by the compiler because an rtos must store the complete context
in this case __bic_sr_register_on_exit called from an isr might not find the sr on the stack
worse it probably corrupts some other saved register value on the stack
2455246
settings.bundle	plist	settings.bundle	plist
Pattern(s): 
as for your general questions here s my take for persistence i would recommend simply persisting an nsdictionary of your settings to a plist file in your app s document folder either using nspropertylistserialization or nsdictionary s writetofile atomically i suggest building a series of custom nibs and caching the views once they are loaded definitely have your settings view manage the navigation stack that way your settings view can be reused in other projects easily
if you re just looking at displaying your settings.bundle in your app i suggest you take a look at the inappsettingskit at or you could at least use the framework as a starting point

2456049
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
a new configuration should be added to explictly re-compile them if needed. 4
the vs project definition for each of the wrapper dll s should include a post-build event to copy them to the expected lib folder location. 5
at runtime the external dll s must be present in the application s bin directory or the machine s gac or otherwise explictly loaded
2457342
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
for the rest the search_path will decide your namespace if you don t add the namespace
postgresql has namespaces which is definately the most efficient way of handling that sort of thing just create a new namespace for the old database and you re done
the way most php mysql solutions solve it specific prefix per app is also an option but not one i d recommend
2457549
int	double
Pattern(s): 
int is not an instance of fractional nor can or should it be
as what to do when converting an arbitrary rational to an int is underspecified
the conversion to a double from an arbitrary fraction however makes perfectly good sense within the range of the type
2458328
drive	createfile
Pattern(s): 
the api documentation can be found at
call deviceiocontrol with the control code ioctl_storage_get_device_number and you ll get the physical disk drive for the given partition device handle
the device handle for the partition can be retrieved using createfile api
2458703
post	put
Pattern(s): 
we could just as well have written and put that with no args in the else branch but in my opinion sw p is more general and i m surprised it s not in standard latex already
debilski s post is definitely a solid way to do it although the say is not necessary
here s a shorter way that makes use of some latex internal shortcuts gobble and ifnextchar makeatletter def hyphenatestring#1 xhyphen te#1 unskip def xhyphen te ifnextchar gobble sw p hskip 0pt plus 1pt xhyphen te def sw p#1#2 #2#1 makeatother note the use of hskip 0pt plus 1pt instead of discretionary - when i tried your example i ended up with a ragged margin because there s no stretchability
2460768
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
you can only specify arbitrary x and y co-ordinates for views when their parent container uses absolute layout such as a canvas
the vgroup has its own ideas about where it s going to put its children
if you want arbitrary control over the position of child components use an absolute layout
2461713
nsnull	nsstring
Pattern(s): 
the nil value is a null pointer it doesn t point to any object instance
in your second code you don t have any nsnull instance
an nsstring pointer that contains a null pointer is not an nsnull instance it s still just a null pointer
2462536
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 
anyone reading your code is already familiar with standard for loops and will understand instantly what you re doing
actually the for-loop does not hide what you re trying to do
anyone reading your code is already familiar with standard for loops and will understand instantly what you re doing
2465059
ord	chr
Pattern(s): 
an essential transformation to recognise in this process is it s also important to remember that with partial evaluation you can break off the last argument to a function for your particular function consider the flow that k and t go through apply ord to each of them add the results subtract 2 a take the result mod 26 add a apply chr so as a first attempt at simplifying we get note that you can avoid flip by using a section on mod and sections using - get messy in haskell so there s a subtract function they clash with the syntax for writing negative numbers -2 means negative 2 and isn t the same as subtract 2
in this function ord k + ord t is an excellent candidate for using data.function.on link
this useful combinator lets us replace ord k + ord t with a function applied to k and t we re now very close to having and hence unfortunately haskell is a bit messy when it comes to composing a binary function with a sequence of unary functions but there is a trick i ll see if i can find a good reference for it and we end up with which is almost a nice neat point-free function pipeline except for that ugly composing trick
2465470
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 
the viewdidload is call when the initialisation of the viewcontroller is finished. i should you to call it in the viewwillappear method like that
the urltoget is null into your readfeedwebviewcontroller in the viewdidload method because when this method is call this variable is not yet affected
the viewdidload is call when the initialisation of the viewcontroller is finished. i should you to call it in the viewwillappear method like that
2465473
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
if such a page contains data instead of code it gets written to the paging file
whenever the program accesses that page again it generates a paging fault letting the operating system read the page back from disk
if the machine has little ram and lots of processes consuming virtual memory pages that can cause a very unpleasant effect called thrashing
2465473
disk	ram	disk	ram
Pattern(s): 
if the machine has little ram and lots of processes consuming virtual memory pages that can cause a very unpleasant effect called thrashing
the operating system is constantly accessing the disk and machine performance slows down to a crawl
more ram means less disk access
2465884
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt	hash	hmac	hmac	pbkdf2
Pattern(s): 
hmac can use any hash function here the spec calls for sha1 as you mentioned
the hash is done on an intermediate state within the hmac algorithm h k xor opad h k xor ipad text h the chosen hash function k is the passphrase text would be ssid this hmac process is repeated 4096 times by pbkdf2
hmac algorithm there s a source example here of deriving a key salt is the ssid pass is the password
2465914
bash	zsh
Pattern(s): 
something along the lines of and run note the exact zsh line probably needs some escaping to work in a make file instead of
it can also be replaced with bash + find

2465931
ready	each	ready	each
Pattern(s): 
you ll end up with a branch for each release branches v1.0 branches v1.1 etc
you tag from the release branch when it is ready
notes about model #1 people can work in branches without stomping on each other
2469934
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 
it s been very good and their support forums while lite on content seem to be monitored pretty well
the xlsreadwriteii2 versioning is blindingly fast and supports all sorts of things like charts and graphics named ranges adding formulas on the fly cell formatting including borders and shading merging cells vertical and horizontal alignment auto-width column sizing and so forth
i haven t upgrade to the latest versioning we re still using xlsreadwriteii2 because we can still use the excel xp format files and i haven t used the xlsmini at all
2470785
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 
something like before loops will help
if you never enter the for-loop say when the players arrays is empty the variable tempbrowser will remain uninitialized
so to overcome this you need to ensure that tempbrowser has a value assigned to it irrespective of loops
2471014
post	put
Pattern(s): 
it was derived from this helper edit the data will be submitted as an array that the cakemagic can deal with
for the default example post -habtm- tag an input field in the post-view should be when submitting the data and doing a save in the postscontroller cake will also save the habtm association in the posts_tags table
if you are interested how exactely the data looks simply place in the postscontroller also 2 comments if you would like some help please put some effort in formulating the question it might help if you would accept an answer once in a while
2471150
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
we will create an abstract greetplugin class to contain some shared boilerplate code simply because we don t want to duplicate code in our actual plugins
the abstract plugin class will implements the greetinterface so we can make sure all subclasses implements the interface too
since dude already implements the interface as well we could have the plugins extends dude but that would be conceptually wrong because extends creates an is-a relationship but a plugin is not a dude
2471150
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 
since dude already implements the interface as well we could have the plugins extends dude but that would be conceptually wrong because extends creates an is-a relationship but a plugin is not a dude
the plugin class accepts one argument when initialized any class implements the greetinterface
the typehint makes sure the class fulfills the contract
2472576
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
Pattern(s): 
others should not be. in java generally checked exceptions are supposed to be caught while runtimeexception and errors are not
a nullpointerexception is caused by a programming error missing null check so it should not be caught
however there might also be situations where you will want to catch a runtimeexception solely for the purpose of logging it before throwing it back
2474226
hiphop	xcache
Pattern(s): 
database and file system access are still going to be your killers
i like the idea of hiphop so don t get me wrong here but there is something to remember hiphop is not for everyone
from sebastian bergmann it is not a solution for a problem faced by 99.9 of the php deployments out there unless you have facebook proportion traffic and your bottleneck is cpu or memory usage you re not likely to see much of a benefit as compared to xcache apc etc
2474902
post	put	post	put
Pattern(s): 
just put the right before and the directly after the
the post block is executed once for each post thus the markup for the container should go outside this block
just put the right before and the directly after the
2476415
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
you ll have to do select from ptest where day between to_days 2010-03-11 and to_days 2010-03-12 - although it might be in this case shortcomings in mysql between
partitioning on dates in mysql is hard and there s a lot of shortcomings in the partitioning implementation atleast if you want to cover a lot of different query constraints we usually place an int id in the tables pointing to a calendar instead of a date type as we ve found mysql to handle partitioning on a simple int to be quite reliable compared to partitioning on columns involving a function such as to_days we have create table datatbl time_id int not null ....
time_id references a calendar prefilled with dates for the next 10 years looking like create table calendar time_id int primary key year int not null month int not null day int not null dayofyear int not null quarter int not null is_weekend chars 1 not null db_date date not null unique index year month day unique index dbdate
2478364
allocator	stl	allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
so using adjacency_list says bgl uses containers from the stl such as std vector std list and std set to represent the set of vertices and the adjacency structure
ok then you just have to give your adjacent list std vector std list and std set which have their own allocator type
adding your own allocator to stl containers is an easy task
2478364
allocator	stl	allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
adding your own allocator to stl containers is an easy task
having done all this you just have to get from your allocator the size of memory that has been allocated while filling the adjacency_list
so the idea is to build the adjacent list out of stl containers which seems possible after a quick look at the bgl documentaiton which have own allocator types
2478595
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
chaining redirects and non-html redirects work just fine in most modern browsers
if you want temporary redirect use 302 unless you want to redirect post and puts as well
the problem is that most implementations will issue get for the new resource address after post or put that got 302
2478917
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 
what i tend to do is use the following kind of html snippets and then define my css rules like this while that doesn t utilise fancy selectors like one could argue one ought to it does makes for excellent compatability with legacy browsers especially ie6 which as long as windows 2000 is still in use likely won t vanish from the internet all too soon
i m not sure if this is the phenomenom you re experiencing but it does strongly seem that way so radio button are input tags like any other
if you have a css rule that applies to all input tags they ll fire for radio button and submit button and checkbox et cetera right along with input text fields
2480475
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 
in the context of generating a random password i can t see any point in salting the hash as the password data is random anyway
salting a hash is used to decrease the possibility of collision and ensure that the hash can t be found in a database like this - if everybody is using md5 for storing their passwords then a password file database could be de-hashed by looking up the md5 d value of the password
using a salt there is an added unknown element to the hash which means the code for generating the salt must also be known to try and brute force the hash
2481019
hex	binary	hex	binary
Pattern(s): 
every single file on your computer can be represented with binary 1s and 0s and indeed that s how it s generally stored on disk alignment of magnetic particles or ram charge
you re viewing your exe with a hex editor which represents the content using hexadecimal numbers
it does this because it s easier to understand and navigate hex than binary compare fa to 11111010
2481595
wordprocessingml	odf	spreadsheetml	presentationml
Pattern(s): 
you can also look at the open source xslts in openxml odf translator add-ins for office to get some ideas on things you may need to account for in any conversion outside of ooxml
the one thing to keep in mind is that spreadsheetml is more similiar to presentationml than it is to wordprocessingml in file structure inside the package for every sheet there is a seperate file
if your doing this from .net i d do this from linq instead of xslt
2481612
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 
sha1 to date has been pretty secure in generating unpredictable collisions
the danger is when collisions can be predicted it s not necessary to know the original hash input to generate the same hash output
for example attacks against md5 have been made against ssl server certificate signing last year as exampled on the security now podcast episode 179
2481710
subclass	accessor
Pattern(s): 
update i got interested in this question and re-read the kvc doc for myself
the language here gave me pause to-many unordered relationships are most often modeled using instance of nsset or a subclass
in that case the key-value coding will if it doesn t find these accessor patterns for the property directly access the set. typically you only implement these methods if you are using a custom collection class that needs to be accessed as if it was a set
2481866
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
Pattern(s): 
some alternatives you may consider are kohana cakephp symfony
i have been very happy using codeigniter to develop two rather small web applications
having worked with ruby on rails the mvc aspects of codeigniter were easy to pick up although codeigniter is much looser a framework than ror
2481866
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
Pattern(s): 
having worked with ruby on rails the mvc aspects of codeigniter were easy to pick up although codeigniter is much looser a framework than ror
i like codeigniter since it does a good job of organizing your code but ultimately gives you the flexibility to work with your code how you see fit
some alternatives you may consider are kohana cakephp symfony
2482660
printf	getchar
Pattern(s): 
however if you know you are just doing characters then getchar and putchar will be more efficient since the printf and scanf variants will have to parse the string each time to determine how to process your request
plus they may be called in a lower level library meaning you may not have to have the printf scanf linked if they are not needed elsewhere

2484042
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 
to the specific this example provides the essentials for a linkedlist that is serializable as a normal list and deserializes back to a linked list
the serializable form does not contain the inter-element links
but those links are reliably remade upon deserialization
2485248
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 
so if the same code is smooth on the iphone it will probably still be smooth on the ipad
i m still hoping to find better answers than this and happy to switching my answered checkmark to a better solution if i see it but here s how i m approaching this problem for now i m writing universal apps and testing the cpu-intensive bits on my iphone
my thinking is that the ipad s a4 is probably scaled up enough to handle the extra graphics processing that s needed for the larger screens
2485469
strsplit	substr	strsplit	substr
Pattern(s): 
it can be made faster by using unsafe code to iterate over the source string though this requires you to write the iteration mechanism yourself rather than using yield return. it allocates the absolute minimum a substr per non separator token plus the wrapping enumerator so realistically to improve performance you would have to use even more unsafe code by using compareordinal i effectively am mainly in avoiding the overhead of character lookup on the string with a char buffer make use of domain specific knowledge about the input sources or tokens. you may be happy to eliminate the null check on the separators you may know that the separators are almost never individual characters the code is written as an extension method
this will have identical semantics to strsplit default mode so not including empty tokens

public	protected
Pattern(s): 
however by convention the access modifier public private protected is always given first static and or final if applicable are given next followed by the return-type
the signature for main needs to be public static void main string args insert code here however there is no requirement that one method be placed before another method
they can be in whatever order you like
2486220
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
there is no requirement for forward declaration as in c and c++ because of this multi-pass approach taken by java
the modifiers public and static can be shuffled
however by convention the access modifier public private protected is always given first static and or final if applicable are given next followed by the return-type
2486662
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
Pattern(s): 
handling this case is of course essential in order to support refactoring and refactoring is exactly the kind of thing you will want to do on a branch
i too have been looking for a case where say subversion fails to merge a branch and mercurial and git bazaar ... does the right thing
the svn book describes how renamed files are merged incorrectly
2487794
codeigniter	yii
Pattern(s): 
if you want something more elaborate i suggest you consider yii www.yiiframework.com that i am also learning right now
codeigniter is very useful and very easy to learn
its a kind of simple but it could be an advantage too
2489645
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
i would have singer bassist and ninja as roles not as subclassing of person and connect them via foreign keys
multiple inherited doesn t work well with databases and your django models do need to map down to a database in the end and inherited is often a bad way to model roles because people s roles do change
i would have singer bassist and ninja as roles not as subclassing of person and connect them via foreign keys
2489946
bash	zsh
Pattern(s): 
for instance zsh defines the default null-command as cat not unless in an emulation mode
if you ever end up needing to make the script work with a bin sh which is not bash eg a bsd system any closed-source os or even on some gnu linux distributions now where dash is used you ll make your life easier if you use

2490000
free	alloca	free	alloca
Pattern(s): 
however you can create a variable-length array on the stack in c++ with alloca is not part of the standard either but both gcc and visual studio support it
be aware the space it allocates is free when you exit the function not at the end of buf s scope
alloca inside a loop will lead to suffering
2491811
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if your myclass is not a child of qobject you ll have to use the plain c++ way of doing things
also note that the parent child hierarchy of qobject s is generally independent of the hierarchy of the c++ class hierarchy inherited tree
that means that an assigned child does not need to be a direct subclassing of it s parent
2493179
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
you can check imagebutton class from fluidkit library - it does exactly what you want
ideally you have to create a custom control inherited from button
add three dependency properties and create default style for new control
2493606
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
splitlayoutpanel is a subclassing of docklayoutpanel . you may have already read about this in the developer s guide section on layout panels
often the uibinder documentation for a class is actually given in the docs for its superclass
take a look at the documentation for docklayoutpanel and see if it works for you
2493674
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 
idempotent methods and web applications methods put and delete are defined to be idempotent meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request. methods get head options and trace being prescribed as safe should also be idempotent as http is a stateless protocol
by contrast the post method is not necessarily idempotent and therefore sending an identical post request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects such as financial transactions
in some cases this may be desirable but in other cases this could be due to an accident such as when a user does not realize that their action will result in sending another request or they did not receive adequate feedback that their first request was successful
2496033
vbscript	autoit	vbscript	autoit
Pattern(s): 
autoit v3 is a freeware basic-like scripting language designed for automating the windows gui and general scripting
it uses a combination of simulated keystrokes mouse movement and window control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages vbscript and sendkeys
autoit is also very small self-contained and will run on all versions of windows out-of-the-box with no annoying runtimes required
2496095
public	protected
Pattern(s): 
variables within a function can only have static applied to them at least that s the only thing i ve ever applied to a variable inside a function
public and private are only applied to variables within a class anywhere else is useless
you cannot request a variable from a function therefore it can t be defined as public private protected
2498436
post	get
Pattern(s): 
in all cases the method supported is get and the response format is a json encoded result with embedded status codes
for google.language.translate the post method is available
applications that use this interface must abide by all existing terms of use
2499632
width	font-size
Pattern(s): 
you will have to resort to javascript
you could put each number in a span and loop over each span checking its width
if the width is greater than the fixed width bump the font-size down and then check the width again
2500022
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
less memory-limited implementations might for example cache all chars and shorts as well as integers and longs in the range of -32k - +32k
no it shouldn t autoboxing causes two distinct int objects to be created in the implementation of java that you are using
if the int values were in the range -128 to 127 then the jls states that the same int object would be used
2500724
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 
second don t use globals
third typedef is unnecessary for this purpose in c++
you can declare your struct like this
2504570
width	border-color
Pattern(s): 
moreover you can always employ setting the border attributes separately via border-width border-style border-color
it s not a bug every decent browser will require you to set all three values for border - color style solid dashed etc. and pixel width
if one or more attributes are missing then results can vary
2505296
post	get
Pattern(s): 
to clairify it goes like this form gets sent via post user clicks on form form gets processed user gets redirected to the same page via get user now will be refreshing a get request instead of a post request
submitting a form sending a post request is commonly used to confirm an order on ecommerce sites
therefore submitting it twice would submit the order twice
2505366
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
also a depedency properties has inbuilt support for change notifications data binding and styling
a bunch of classes and defined ways to use them that provide the above functionality to be used on classes that inherited from dependencyobject
they are not a language feature
2505557
testng	jmockit	testng	jmockit
Pattern(s): 
here you can find sample code which uses openejb testng and jmockit for unit testing
you can go for apache openejb which is a lightweight ejb3.0 implementation that can be embedded into testng
here you can find sample code which uses openejb testng and jmockit for unit testing
2505659
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 
by doing this you ll get achieve some of the clarity of using separate subclassing instances self.ge.dosomething vs self.ge_dosomething and you ll avoid conflicting member names which is the main risk when combining such large classes into one
if you want to use multiple inherited to combine everything into one big class it might make sense to do this then you can refactor each of the parent classes so that every method and properties is either private starts with __ or has a short 2-3 character prefix unique to that class
for example all the methods and properties in your guievents class could start with ge_ everything in guihelpers could start with gh_
2505946
coldfusion	railo
Pattern(s): 
coldfusion exists now also opensource something not many seem to know railo
it is possible to have all of those technologies installed on a windows server it is possible to make a connection to both ms sql and mysql via both php and coldfusion
providers usually have php and mysql as combination but the bigger providers have also windows based hosting with an ms sql database server so a connection from the php linux server can be made to a ms sql server you do need some special library installed though i read
2507219
octal	decimal
Pattern(s): 
mar 24 10 at 11 31 original answer i don t think there is one
prefix 0 if for octal and 0x is for hexadecimal
from php docs integer can be specified in decimal base 10 hexadecimal base 16 or octal base 8 notation optionally preceded by a sign - or +
2507219
octal	decimal
Pattern(s): 
from php docs integer can be specified in decimal base 10 hexadecimal base 16 or octal base 8 notation optionally preceded by a sign - or +
to use octal notation precede the number with a 0 zero
to use hexadecimal notation precede the number with 0x
2507719
jruby	mri
Pattern(s): 
the advantage of json_pure can be if you don t have mri
for example the json_pure gem can be installed in jruby maglev or other implementations
the json gem can t be
2509084
children	parent
Pattern(s): 
this won t work because parent is not an enumerable type
change your itemsource binding from binding to binding children and change your hierarchicaldatatemplate to just a datatemplate
if you want to retain myclass as a top level node you could also wrap myclass in an ienumerable and set that as the data context
2509793
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 
here s an example if you want to override with a 404 in that directory
you can put a web.config in the nohandler folder that defines a different handler notfound if you want to server a 404 style etc
same format as your current web.config just put only the elements you want to override like the handler
2510081
allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 
drop it into a test program that uses various stl containers and you can easily see how the allocator is used by the standard containers not all of the interface functions in the mallocator such as construct and destroy are instrumented with trace output so you might want to drop trace statements in there to more easily see how the standard containers might use those functions without resorting to a debugger
that should give you a good idea of how your containers might be expected to use a custom allocator

2511737
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if your constructor is being called in the chain to instantiate a subclassing of your class you may call a method which is overridden in the subclassing and relies on an invariant that is not established until the subclassing constructor has been run
it also messes badly with inherited
if your constructor is being called in the chain to instantiate a subclassing of your class you may call a method which is overridden in the subclassing and relies on an invariant that is not established until the subclassing constructor has been run
2512486
maven	m2e
Pattern(s): 
this is the case of eclipse + m2e
and this applies also to netbeans under the following condition see dependency management hint if you open a project that other projects depend on the icon in other projects changes to a maven project icon to denote that the ide knows about link between the projects. however such a link is only established when the groupid artifactid and version all match in the dependency and project declaration
frequently occurring problem is that you change an api signature in your library project but the application is not picking up. often it s caused by the fact that the application is using an older version of the library artifact
2513135
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 
also you don t need to pass the timeout function in a string you can just pass the reference directly settimeout timeout 1000 instead of settimeout timeout 1000
yes setinterval timeout 1000 does nearly the same thing
it s somewhat different in that the the next interval starts counting immediately after 1000ms not after the script that runs has completed or even started
2513463
namedtuple	dictionary
Pattern(s): 
however python 2.6 has a new factory function that creates a similar datatype called namedtuple
a namedtuple is a tuple whose slots can also be addressed by name
the namedtuple should not require any more memory according to the documentation than a regular tuple since they don t have a per instance dictionary
2515669
3des	aes
Pattern(s): 
in a nutshell viewstate data in your web form is encrypted using the rijndaelmanaged implementation of the aes algorithm which is not fips compliant
the easiest solution is to add the following or similiar line to your web.config file specifying 3des encryption
3des is fips compliant
2515988
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 
the term stl is outdated imho what used to be the stl has become a large part of the standard library for c++
if you are doing any serious c++ development you will need to be familiar with this library and preferably the boost library
if you are not using it already you re probably working at the wrong level of abstraction or you re constraining yourself to a small-ish subset of c++
2520582
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
git is a red herring as the os support issue alone is a major difference
the real question is why hg rather than bazaar as these two are very similar and hg developers themselves consider bazaar to be their real competition and vice-versa
sun conducted an extensive evaluation of both when it came to choosing a dvcs for opensolaris and openjdk
2521098
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 
when false the form submission will be aborted
the button s onclick does not submit the form
it is merely a button that calls authenticate on the client side
2521494
scheme	racket
Pattern(s): 
scheme since it gives you a really nice environment to work in supports many dialects of scheme and gives very good failure and debugging information
i believe most implementations of scheme are interpreters although it is possible that there is a compiler out there
if you are a commandline junkie like me an alternative you might consider is to run the racket interpreter directly which is essentially the same thing as dr
2523885
snmp	mib
Pattern(s): 
most well-designed mibs actually put the changed mib object right into the trap
that way your snmp manager does not have to poll the agent just to be sure
having said that the trap on the entity-mib does not have any state variables
2525686
post	get
Pattern(s): 
if you omit this and the connection somehow get broken then the other side will never be able to determine if the content is fully streamed in or not
that said the cast to httpurlconnection is unnecessary if you know the fact that the request method will automatically be set to post if you do connection.setdooutput true
or in your case more suitable connection.setdooutput post .equals method
2526781
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
linux is case sensitive and python.h won t work
on debian and debian deriviatives like ubuntu you can use apt-file to find out what package to install given a filename

2529618
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
and of course any further subclassing must also have non-public constructors and static factory methods which diligently call init .
calling an overridden method from the superclass constructor is simply not going to work - don t do it
the superclass constructor must always finish before that of the subclassing
2529618
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 
if the overriding method depends on any initialization performed by the subclassing constructor the method will not behave as expected
if you can change the superclass implementation try moving the call to the virtual function out of the constructor
one way to achieve this is using a factory method note that the constructor of subclassing is private to ensure that it can only be instantiated via createinstance thus instances are always initialized properly
2535829
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 
eclipse is available for linux and if you get ubuntu then eclipse is amazingly easy to install
i used virtualbox + ubuntu + eclipse for several projects i worked on
if you decide that linux is not for you and your project was in eclipse then you will have no problem switching back to windows since eclipse is available for both operating systems
2535991
comparator	comparable
Pattern(s): 
this defines the natural ordering for all hockeyplayer objects
using a comparator is more flexible in that different implementations can order by name age etc
for completeness i should caution that the return o1.f - o2.f comparison-by-subtraction shortcut must be used with extreme caution due to possible overflows read effective java 2nd edition item 12 consider implementing comparable
2536651
range	max
Pattern(s): 
then click the advanced filter button
the data range would be the entire database a1 b6
the criteria range is the new two row column you just made of value and the max formula
2536651
range	max
Pattern(s): 
the criteria range is the new two row column you just made of value and the max formula
then select and output range that will be big enough to hold your filtered data
in this case a 2x2 grid will be enough
2538292
autoresetevent	manualresetevent	autoresetevent	manualresetevent
Pattern(s): 
when an autoresetevent or manualresetevent are not set calls to waitone will block the calling thread until set is called
these two classes differ only in that autoresetevent unsets the event once a successful call to waitone completes making subsequent calls block again until set is called
manualresetevent must be unset explicitly by calling reset
2538409
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 
to require that the values only be changed via setter functions and then you use that as an opportunity to recalcuate the things that changed or 2
to require that you use getter functions to get the calculated value which you calculate on the fly or if that s expensive you retrieve from a cached calculation
returning multiple values from a function if you re looking for a way of returning multiple values from a single function you can do that easily by returning an object
2542094
teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 
the trick to making this successful is to create automated builds that are easy to maintain and extend - rake is probably a better choice for this than nant due to the expressiveness of ruby but you can achieve the same with nant if you take care
teamcity is probably the simplest and fastest ci server to set up and get running and definitely beats the pants of cc
hudson was another product that came up a lot when i was researching which ci server to use but as i chose teamcity and have never used hudson i can t really compare the 2
2543023
identifier	ambiguous
Pattern(s): 
the c# language specification has been designed for this not to be an issue
from section 7.5.4.1 of the c# 3 spec in a member access of the form e.i if e is a single identifier and if the meaning of e as a simple-name 7.5.2 is a constant field property local variable or parameter with the same type as the meaning of e as a type-name 3.8 then both possible meanings of e are permitted
the two possible meanings of e.i are never ambiguous since i must necessarily be a member of the type e in both cases. in other words the rule simply permits access to the static members and nested types of e where a compile-time error would otherwise have occurred
2543256
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 
workarounds -- if you absolutely must have both class decoration as usurpation not just class decoration by changes in the received class argument and super -- basically need protocols for cooperation between the usurper and the possible-usurpee such as the following small changes to your example code
basically you can see the problem after entering your code sample at the interactive python prompt the name subclassagain is now bound in global scope in this case to a class that in fact isn t the real subclassagain but a subclass thereof
so any late-bound reference to that name like the one you have in its super subclassagain call will of course get the subclass that s masquerading by that name -- that subclass s superclass is of course the real subclassagain whence the infinite recursion
2544996
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 
if you use the settimeout method then you can have it check wait for the response of the ajax and let the code the handles the ajax response set a new timeout
or set interval is probably more like what you after you can then call something like setinterval function code you want to run here 100
then your code will run every 100 milliseconds
2545179
goto	break
Pattern(s): 
have a look at the tutorial
no goto is not used but you can define labels and leave a loop up to the label
you can use break or continue followed by the label
2546942
post	get
Pattern(s): 
i sometimes get the relative path wrong
adding a dir to the post build is an easy way to show where you are and can help correct path errors

2547440
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 
there are other home screens managers out there that have more than 4x4 cells such as the custom home screens manager on the archos tablet
if you want your appwidget to work in some of these other homescreen managers that do special things like increase the number of cells on the screens or allow text input and scrolling in app widgets then you are probably going to have to write a custom version of your widget for those home screens managers
so the answer to your question assuming you are always targeting the default home screens manager is that the screens is always 4x4 cells and as long as you stick with device independent pixels you have nothing extra you need to do to make your appwidget scale and work correctly on higher resolutions
2547502
int	chars
Pattern(s): 
for example xeb x2a could be more portably be specified as 0xeb2a or 0x2aeb depending on what value you really wanted
one area that i ve found multi-character constants to be of some use is to come up with clever enum values that can be recognized in a debugger or memory dump there are few portability problems with the above other than platforms that have small int or warnings that might be spewed
whether the chars end up in the enum values in little- or big-endian form the code will still work unless you re doing some else unholy with the enum values
2547964
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 
it s often represented as a string of 36 chars - but the actual value is a 128bit int value
a guid is actually an int type - it s a 128 bit int 16 bytes
it s often represented as a string of 36 chars - but the actual value is a 128bit int value
2548187
daemons	launchd
Pattern(s): 
anyway if you have very good reasons to do such a solution even simpler than checking that the process is alive as it would probably in some way involve some ps -blahblah stuff you could just put the java program launchd in a shell while true loop as follows while true do # launchd the java program here no background # when crashing the shell will be given hand back java -classpath blahblah... echo program crashed relaunching it... done
to be honest relaunching the daemons without any question after a crash is probably not a good idea
well it depends greatly on the type of processing achieved by your daemons but if for example it processes files from a given directory or requests coming from a queue manager and the file message contains some unexpected data causing the crash relaunching the daemons would make it crash again immediately excepting when the file message is removed no matter it has been correctly processed or not but as well it seems not to be a good idea
2548225
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 
it is just a matter of setting the path environment variable properly
the regular x86 compiler lives in the vc bin subdirectory
there are two 64bit compilers a 32-bit compiler that generates 64bit code in vc bin x86_amd64 and a 64bit compiler that generates 64bit code in vc bin amd64
2548810
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
this is clear requirement of the owasp top 10 a3 broken authentication and session management sending a cookie over http is also a violation of cwe-614 and cwe-311
yes ssl tls is required to maintain a securely authenticated session
if you have a login then the login s post and the entire session must be protected by https
2550383
bitarray	bitset
Pattern(s): 
loop through your vector of integer values
look up each value in the first bitarray
if it is not set then set the bitset it to 1
2550655
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fixed-point
Pattern(s): 
so the fixed-point version might outperform the float version by an order of magnitude even on a machine where the fpu has theoretically higher throughput
there is likely to be a significant difference in real-world speed between fixed-point and floating-point math but the theoretical best-case throughput of the alu vs fpu is completely irrelevant
instead the number of integer and floating-point registers real registers not register names on your architecture which are not otherwise used by your computation for loop control the number of elements of each type which fit in a cache line optimizations possible considering the different semantics for integer vs
2551219
nhibernate	automapper
Pattern(s): 
jimmy bogards automapper is a great tool which will help with the mapping process
edit after re-reading the problem i had a look around the and came across this article which describes a workaround for sending nhibernate collections over wcf
david brion has written a good follow up article
2551508
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
i would see a developer running release candidates as something positive though tools it cannot be stressed enough how much javascript development is facilitated by firebug for firefox
i definitely think that the developer should mention firebug or google-chrome developer tools for debugging purposes
another tool it d be great if the developer used would be pagespeed for firefox which is an excellent way of inspecting what javascript functions can be deferred until after page load for instance
2554560
jstl	taglib
Pattern(s): 
for the remnant of jstl tags only the functions taglib is useful in jsf all the other taglib are superflous in a jsf environment since it either provides the same functionality out of the box jstl core and format taglib or it simply doesn t suit in the mvc ideology jstl sql and xml taglib
jstl and jsf doesn t work seamlessly together in sync as you would intuitively expect from the ordering in the source code
roughly said jstl processes the entire page from top to bottom first and then hands the generated output thus without any jstl tags but with its generated output over to jsf which in turn processes the entire page from top to bottom again
2554560
jstl	taglib
Pattern(s): 
to fix this you should rather use the jsf-supplied iterating components such as richfaces a4j repeat or facelets ui repeat or tomahawk s t datalist
they all do less or more the same as the jstl c foreach
for the remnant of jstl tags only the functions taglib is useful in jsf all the other taglib are superflous in a jsf environment since it either provides the same functionality out of the box jstl core and format taglib or it simply doesn t suit in the mvc ideology jstl sql and xml taglib
2556165
luabind	luainterface
Pattern(s): 
however if luabind is used between c++ and lua that will complicate things a bit as luabind adds a lot of stuff to lua and i m not sure this could be simulated or ignored
it really depends a lot on what parts of luabind are relied upon
have a look at luainterface it s a good mediator between .net and lua
2556615
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 
you can check a feed you ve created against the feed validator
that s not rss
you can t just create any arbitrary set of xml tags and hope that an rss reader will understand it - rss is a standard with particular tags required
2556779
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 
this approach would also need some way of redirecting requests to the appropriate protocol
there are several ways to approach this if your firewall supports it you can terminate ssl at the firewall level and have that determine which pages need to be secured via ssl using isa server and keep the existing site as is
alternatively you can set up the existing web site to accept requests via both https and http
2557151
internationalization	translation	internationalization	localization
Pattern(s): 
while you could write a translation frontend if you re mostly translating application ui as opposed to content then the above approach combined with either a desktop app there are many you can just ship translators the string bundles and they can edit and return or my favorite these days pootle which is a web front-end and can commit translation direct to scm can provide friendly frontends
as the above individuals have mentioned - string externalization is in most respects the core concept in internationalization localization
your choice of bundles depends on platform - for c gettext is a popular option
2557151
pootle	gettext
Pattern(s): 
your choice of bundles depends on platform - for c gettext is a popular option
while you could write a translation frontend if you re mostly translating application ui as opposed to content then the above approach combined with either a desktop app there are many you can just ship translators the string bundles and they can edit and return or my favorite these days pootle which is a web front-end and can commit translations direct to scm can provide friendly frontends

2558011
vim	textmate	vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
i m sure i ve only scratched the surface here and it s well worth searching for tools applicable to your domain
the combination of traditional vi s powerful toolset vim s improvements on it and plugins which extend vim even further it s one of the most powerful ways to edit text ever conceived
vim is easily as powerful as emacs eclipse visual studio and textmate
2558011
vim	textmate	vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
vim is easily as powerful as emacs eclipse visual studio and textmate
thanks thanks to duwanis for his vim configs from which i have learned much and borrowed most of the plugins listed here
