note that when operating on linked lists mergesort only requires a small constant amount of auxiliary storage.
from the wikipedia entry on quicksort quicksort also competes with mergesort another recursive sort algorithm but with the benefit of worst-case θ nlogn running time. mergesort is a stable sort unlike quicksort and heapsort and can be easily adapted to operate on linked lists and very large lists stored on slow-to-access media such as disk storage or network attached storage. although quicksort can be written to operate on linked lists it will often suffer from poor pivot choices without random access

in the second loop you can subtract 1 from the index instead of producing an unnecessary 0th output list element that needs to be shift ed off and where you unnecessarily iterate m n times where m is the number of output lists and n is the number of unique elements iterating over the unique elements would reduce the iterations to just n which is a significant win in typical use cases where m is much larger than n and would simplify the code

these commands will make a good guess and then possibly set a binary svn mime-type property on the file being added. if subversion guesses wrong the user can always remove or hand-edit the property. hand editing would be done by svn propset svn mime-type some type filename.extension
from page 367 of the subversion book in the most general sense subversion handles binary files more gracefully than cvs does. because cvs uses rcs it can only store successive full copies of a changing binary file. subversion however expresses differences between files using a binary differencing algorithm regardless of whether they contain textual or binary data

with o n 2 worst case that rarely happens quicksort is potentially far slower than the o nlogn of the merge sort

apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 1	
here s an example nginx configuration for running a wordpress blog through php fastcgi note i ve also put in the nginx equivalent of the wordpress .htaccess so you will also have fancy urls already working with this config here s the fastcgi.conf file i m including in the above config i put it in a separate file so all of my virtual host config files can include it in the right place but you don t have to do this i also happen to do what the nginx wiki suggests and use spawn-fcgi from lighttpd as my cgi-spawner lighttpd is a pretty fast compile w o weird dependencies so a quick and easy thing to install but you can also use a short shell perl script for that

to answer your question you should use the override annotation if the lack of a method with the same signature in a superclass is indicative of a bug



95586
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 1	
the url was aydsman s answer is correct more info here i can t think of any use-case for an exception with non-serializable members but if you avoid attempting to serialize deserialize them in getobjectdata and the deserialization constructor you should be ok

google-chrome is full featured browser



98367
copying	overwrite
Pattern(s): 3	1	
i d actually suggest just copying the contents to your .vimrc as it s well commented and a good place to start learning how to use vim
you can do this by this will overwrite your current .vimrc but if all you have in there is the indent settings davr suggested i wouldn t sweat it as the example vimrc will take care of that for you as well



98589
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	3	
so for genuine portability issues which mostly are implementation-dependent rather than unspecified or undefined but i think that falls into the spirit of the question chars is not necessarily un signed



99194
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 1	0	1	1	
the while loops is appropriate for polling or where the number of loops to meet exit condition will change based on activity inside loops

Pattern(s): 1	
weather learning mips assembly is useful to you depends on what career you plan to follow



99235
x86	mips	x86	mips
Pattern(s): 3	1	
most compilers will dump assembly code for you on request instead of going on to machine code and linking. that said mips asm is probably useless because almost nobody uses mips now

tcp is generally as fast as it gets for reliable streaming of data from one host to another



109038
cairngorm	puremvc	cairngorm	flex
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t
cairngorm is full of anti-patterns like heavy use of global variables puremvc hides the worst parts of itself
puremvc is anti-flex cairngorm just doesn t use many of the good parts of flex

Pattern(s): 3	
therefore if there is no business logic for example when a getter simply returns a value or a setter sets it then there is no point in writing a test



116106
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 3	3	
however instead of setting svn ignore to . on the cache directory you may want to include cache in the parent directory s svn ignore property in case the cache directory is not always present



116114
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 3	
this is more easily and flexibly accomplished by redirecting the stdout stream further getting rid of stderr is easily accomplished in situations where it makes sense to use backticks i prefer to use the qx in order to emphasize that there is a heavy-weight command occurring



116753
hash	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	1	3	3	1	1	
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement

linux sucks are pretty much everything but internationalization is something they get right



124384
downcasting	upcasting
Pattern(s): 2	
downcasting makes sense if you have an object of derived class but it s referenced by a reference of base class type and for some reason you want it back to be referenced by a derived class type reference



125553
matlab	simulink
Pattern(s): 2	2	2	
you might be surprised at the number of people that use matlab for this and as it could be considered a programming language and certainly manages its own memory with support for huge data sets etc then it should seriously be considered as a solution here



126773
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 1	3	
in fact common lisp features the most powerful class-based object system that i know of incorporating stuff like aspect-oriented programming out of the box
lisp seems to me to actually be the language family that most encourages experiments in new directions and most easily incorporates programming paradigms that aren t supported from the get-go

nebula grid fits in well with the widget + viewer paradigm



132787

boost	stl
Pattern(s): 2	
from a professional standpoint i believe the best way to get started with boost lambda is to get usage of boost bind understood and accepted



137344
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
the biggest caveat however with virtual bases is that the constructor for the virtual base must be called by the most derived class meaning that a class that derives virtually has no control over the constructor parameters



139276
gridview	repeater

a restart is not required for changes to .htaccess



142778
.htaccess	httpd.conf
Pattern(s): 1	1	
also check that .htaccess is readable by the httpd process
check the error_log - it will tell you of any errors in .htaccess if it s being used. putting an intentional syntax error in .htaccess is a good check to make sure the file is being used -- you should get a 500 error on any page in the same directory



143221
bitarray	bitvector	bitarray	bitvector
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	1	
it s a c extension so much faster than bitvector which is pure python and stores its data in an actual bitfield so it s eight times more memory efficient than a numpy boolean array which appears to use a byte per element.

146374
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	2	
but if instances of a class are supposed to be immutable then making it final is one good way of making sure they really are all immutable that there aren t mutable instances of subclassing kicking around which can be used anywhere that the parent class is called for
i don t think the article you referenced should be taken as an instruction that all immutable classes must be final especially if you have a positive reason to design your immutable class for inherited



149437
range	max
Pattern(s): 3	1	
a float is only good for 6 to 7 digits of precision so that means a max of about +-9999.99 without rounding

at first i believed it was a built-in feature of the wysiwym markdown editor but shog9 is correct it s not baked-in at all but is courtesy of the jquery plugin textarearesizer i was lead astray by the browser was using to check on the editor demo because google-chrome itself adds the expandable functionality on textareas mdash



149471
nstimer	nsrunloop
Pattern(s): 1	
as i wrote below a nstimer object is created that gets a pointer to the target object and a pointer to a c string containing the method name and when the timer fires it finds the right c method to call by using the string table hence it needs the string name of the method of the target object hence it needs a reference to it

unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 3	
also note that a short is not guaranteed to be 16 bits



150148
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 3	3	
grouping is not so powerful as in tclientdataset as also indexing is poorer



150584
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	
if you have a string with 2 bytes that you wish to interpret as a 16 bit int you can do so by note that the is for big-endian the largest part of the int comes first



150835
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 2	
please note however that using the default filesystems under both win32 and nix there is no way to guarantee the atomicity of the operation if you check for the existence of files a b and c some other process or thread might have deleted file a after you passed it and while you were looking for b and c

versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 3	1	
doing it this way we can stay with versioning 1 of a project until upgrading to versioning 1.5 is absolutely necessary



152425
put	get
Pattern(s): 1	
but don t just take my word for it in access-ordered linked hash maps merely querying the map with get is a structural modification the linked hash map s javadoc if you are absolutely sure that there are no caches no collection statistics no optimizations no funny stuff at all - you don t need to sync



152830
gdi	stretchblt
Pattern(s): 2	
however when it is scaled it will be stretched using stretchblt



153015
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
udp is connection-less - meaning no virtual circuit between the 2 endpoints is ever created



156321

this doesn t mean that manually adjusting the stdio buffering is a good idea though



157010
typedef	typename	typedef	typename

pdfbox	itextsharp	pdfbox	itext
Pattern(s): 1	
if you re looking for something a little more diy there s the itextsharp library - a port of java s itext - and pdfbox yes it says java - but they have a .net version by way of ikvm.net



159454
width	height	width	height
Pattern(s): 1	1	
in listening for size changes note that we ignore any resize events where the width stays the same
this is because changes in the height of the content do not affect the minimum height of the content as long as the width is the same



160892
x86	mips

in my opinion mips is actually a little bit more of a clean and elegant architecture than sparc but they re both great



161983
struts	stripes

profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler	yourkit	jprofiler
Pattern(s): 3	
i ve used yourkit and it is a very nice profiler the best i ve ever used in java i ve used a variety of others over the years



164437
yourkit	jprofiler
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	1	
it s so much less invasive than jprofile in that i ll happy run production servers with the yourkit agent installed which i would never do with jprofiler
also the analysis tool that comes with yourkit is more intuitive in my opinion making it easier to get the root cause of problems



164595
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 1	
of course if you re writing both the producer and consumer of the rss and your goal is that the feed always contains the full set of assigned tasks just updating the pubdate will work just fine



165622
yourkit	jprofiler
Pattern(s): 3	3	
it is priced also very reasonably about about 1100 for 5 licenses i think



165921
qpushbutton	qwidget
Pattern(s): 3	3	
it is not possible to do it because it means you would add a slot to an existing qt class like qpushbutton which is not really the way to go



166098
subclass	getattr
Pattern(s): 3	
the problem gets worse when this double-underscore attribute is actually a method overriding the method or calling the method in a subclass means doing the name-mangling manually or reimplementing all the code that calls the method to not use the double-underscore name

if you don t have many complex requirements i think wordpress is not a bad idea



173007
g++	gcc	g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 3	
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this



173406
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 1	
currently i believe that safari is the only shipping browser to support any of these and i believe it only supports the client side databases and local storage parts



176144
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	firefox
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	0	
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around



176144
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 3	1	
google-chrome comes last because it s so likely to just work if safari is good to go



176345

sometimes because of class inherited you ll be stumped as to how to get the object mapped to a database row



177557
qdialog	qobject
Pattern(s): 0	3	
your dialog derives from more than one class and qdialog is not the first class that it derives from



178555
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl	verilog	hdl
Pattern(s): 3	
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously



179813
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
Pattern(s): 0	
so verilog is easier to get started with but you can make mistakes more easily



180634
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
probably due to a delphi background and i always make it private to avoid the problem when the inherited is erroneously omitted from a class but a subclassing tries to use it



181372
matlab	simulink
Pattern(s): 1	3	
for further comparison with python i can say that matlab provides a full package for you to do your work without the need of looking around for external libraries and implementing extra functions
one last point about matlab which i see is not mentioned in the answers here is that it has a very powerful visual modeling simulation environment called simulink

as a workaround i ve done the following which will replace the text of the statement with the numbers ending up as something like where buildingid in 1 2 3 4 note that this is getting close to a sql injection vulnerability but since it s an int array is safe



185365
terminate	timeout
Pattern(s): 3	
the timeout has to be big enough to delays in delivering the initial data from the client in the tls ssl handshake so it ll make establishing ssh connections slower



186279
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 1	1	
advantages there may not be a hard and fast rule as to why prototypal inherited is an advantageous form of code-reuse
code reuse itself is advantageous and prototypal inherited is a sensible way of going about it

198607
xna	slimdx
Pattern(s): 1	3	
xna provides several math constants including 3d specialists like pi 2 etc. and some advanced math functions with float precision though not the trigonometric functions
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big

prng	random
Pattern(s): 1	
normally seeding a new state takes quite while for a serious prng and making new ones each time won t really help much. the only case i can think of where you might want more than one prng is for different systems say in a casino game you have one generator for shuffling cards and a separate one to generate comments done by the computer control characters this way really dedicated users can t guess outcomes based on character behaviors

as far as ssl goes you can buy separate certificates for the domain and subdomain or a single wildcard .foo.com cert that covers them both naturally the wildcard cert will be more expensive



232602
ienumerable	ienumerator
Pattern(s): 1	1	3	1	1	1	
i guess the generic enumerator t inherits from idisposable so there doesn t need to be a runtime type-check it can just go ahead and call dispose which should have better performance since it can be probably be optimized away if the enumerator has an empty dispose method
ienumerator t does inherit idisposable however whereas the non-generic ienumerator doesn t

multiplying	subtract
Pattern(s): 2	
take the worst case multiplying for a four bit system 1111 1111 11100001 so it takes 8 bits to store the result of a 4 bit multiplying you will quickly find that if you had a 4 bit system most of the multiplies you want to do will result a number that cannot be stored in 4 bits

253740
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 1	0	3	
actually all other aspects being equal a slower hash function is more secure than a fast one
this is because a slower hash function results in slower generation of rainbow tables and slower brute forcing or dictionary attacks on the password
from thomas ptacek at as referenced in this coding horror article the problem is that md5 is fast

width	height
Pattern(s): 3	0	3	1	
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height
of course if there aren t any hard width values then the design is a liquid layout so the concern about designing for a particular width is somewhat altered

innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	
very limited concurrency i think it s either one writer or multiple readers per database file mysql far more features choice of engines innodb provides good features for many workloads much more control of storage backup restore etc network-capable - which allows its use in large scale applications better concurrency - the innodb engine has mvcc which means that readers do not block writers nor do writers block readers
even the old myisam engine has table-level locking rather than for the whole database as sqlite



265151
appfuse	spring	appfuse	stripes	sitemesh	stripes
Pattern(s): 1	
stripes seems to be a great starting point for a java web app too



265372
client-side	server-side

the nice thing about these validation controls is that it will preform client-side validation when it detects the browser is able unless client-side validation has been disabled



267793
public	protected
Pattern(s): 1	1	
a protected class is visible to other classes in the same package and to classes that extend the enclosing class
a public class is accessible to a class in any package



267839
octal	decimal	octal	decimal
Pattern(s): 3	
historically octal has also been used for bit masks



268287
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	0	1	
classes should either be designed for inherited or prohibit it
there is a cost to designing for inherited it can pin down your implementation you have to declare which methods are going to call which other methods in case a user overrides one but not the other it reveals your implementation rather than just the effects it means you have to think of more possibilities when designing things like equals are hard to design in an inherited tree it requires more documentation an immutable type which is subclassing may become mutable ick item 17 of effective java goes into more details on this - regardless of the fact that it s written in the context of java the advice applies to .net as well



268335
ssd	sata
Pattern(s): 3	3	
sata is pretty much the easiest fastest option



268785
organization	naming
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	
look closely at the ribbon and you ll see it s organization is pretty much the same as menu bars with equivalents for file the logo menu edit the home tab which includes formatting and view so from an organization standpoint it makes little difference whether you re using a ribbon or menubar



269535
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 3	
the new class is now a subclass of the original class



269670
copying	overwrite

skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	tree
Pattern(s): 0	
a binary tree allows for more rapid searching and insertion by being inherently sorted and navigable



271143
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	3	3	
just remember that byte is always the size of a chars so if chars is bigger a byte is not only 8 bits any more



271143
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	
for chars it states explicitly that it should have at least 8 bits char_bit . c++ inherits those rules for the limits.h file so in c++ we have the same fundamental requirements for those values

Pattern(s): 2	
unfortunately some more experienced programmers learn the wrong lesson and assume that everything always needs to be cached in ram or it will be too slow



277233
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 1	1	
when executing gcc from the command line g++ is the c++ compiler while gcc is the general c compiler



277445
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	1	3	3	
there are numerous other differences however the common one s i am aware of are myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not innodb supports referential integrity whilst myisam does not innodb handles indexes a bit differently storing the primary key as part of every index making indexes take up more room on the disk but also making a covering index more likely myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking different memory buffer index settings are used in the mysql configuration files innodb is typically said to have better crash recovery as mentioned in another answer the data is store on disk differently



277452
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 3	
innodb seems to lump everything together in a file called ibdata1



277489
operands	scalar
Pattern(s): 3	
in scalar context or if the left operands is not enclosed in parentheses it returns a string consisting of the left operands repeated the number of times specified by the right operands



277511
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
myisam locks the whole table for reading while inserts updates are executing



279287
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 1	
if you structure your project this way src __init__.py main.py dirfoo __init__.py foo.py dirbar __init__.py bar.py then from foo.py you should be able to do import dirfoo.foo or from dirfoo.foo import fooobject per tom s comment this does require that the src folder is accessible either via site_packages or your search path



279805
tstringlist	tlist
Pattern(s): 1	
.add .insert .remove .clear etc. tstringlist has the basic tlist type methods and other methods custom to working with strings such as .savetofile and .loadfromfile if you want backwards compatibility then tstringlist is definitely the way to go

if it s a flashy custom-styled application with tons of custom controls and complex compositing swing is the only game in town



282162
phpunit	simpletest
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	
it is quite easy and well described



283767
textinput	textfield
Pattern(s): 3	3	
this event does not occur if you use data binding or actionscript code to change the text . you can also use the valuecommit event which is dispatched when the user commits the changes usually by moving the focus away from the textfield but remember that this event is also dispatched when the field value is changed programmatically
textinput is dispatched only when the user has input text into the control



284711
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 1	1	3	1	
a uinavigationcontroller is a distinct object that is very different from a uitabbarcontroller
it is also improper to refer to the display of a uiviewcontroller as such an object doesn t have a visual representation



284851
junit	testng	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 1	
in either case segmenting out the tests as both testng and junit do is helpful with integration tests too

286303
swt	swing	swt	swing
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java
it depends with eclipse 3.4 swt 3.4 is quite supported with macos
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java



286617
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 3	
note that the inline is just a compiler hint it doesn t force the method to be inlined. but that s good if the code size of an inner loop exceeds the instruction cache inlining easily hurts performance whether the pass return-by-reference can be resolved depends on the strength of your compiler i ve seen many where foo x out forces stack variables whereas x foo does keep values in registers



286617
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 0	2	
however inlining opens the door to more optimizations if you have v a + b + c your wrapper class forces the generation of stack variables whereas for inline calls the majority of the data can be kept in the fpu stack



287676
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 1	
then the attacker needs to know 1 the way you combine the salt and the password not much security there 2 the salt which is likely in the db already and 3 they have to compute that value for each combination of password and salt

290253
int	boolean	int	boolean	tinyint	boolean	tinyint	boolean
Pattern(s): 1	1	
a tinyint is an 8-bit int value a bit field can store between 1 bit bit 1 and 64 bits bit 64



290255
tinyint	boolean
Pattern(s): 2	2	
tinyint 1 allows any value that can be stored in a single byte -128..127 or 0..255 depending on whether or not it s unsigned the 1 shows that you intend to only use a single digit but it does not prevent you from storing a larger value

emacs	jedit
Pattern(s): 3	
add to that the highlight parens mode and it gets even better



295657

try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 3	3	2	
... a method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of error that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught since these errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur
as the specification mentions an error is only thrown in circumstances that are chances are when an error occurs there is very little the application can do and in some circumstances the java virtual machine itself may be in an unstable state such as virtualmachineerror although an error is a subclass of throwable which means that it can be caught by a try-catch clause but it probably isn t really needed as the application will be in an abnormal state when an error is thrown by the jvm

362937
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 3	3	
if there is a framework class that does almost exactly what you want but a particular function of its interface throws a notsupported exception or for some other reason you only want to override one method to do something specific to your implementation it s much easier to write a subclass and override that one method rather than write a brand new class and write pass-throughs for each of the other 27 methods in the class

365834
innodb	myisam	innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 2	
in innodb however primary keys are clustered meaning they stay attached to the data pages and ensure that the row contents remain in physically sorted order on disk according to the primary key but only within single data pages which themselves could be scattered in any order. this being the case i would expect that innodb might have an advantage in that myisam would essentially have to do double work -- write the integer once in the data pages and then write it again in the index pages



366741
inherited	subclassing

377533
inherited	subclassing	inherited	base-class
Pattern(s): 1	
there is a precedence issue - the overridden method is defined in the base-class so for best method purposes the overload even with an implicit cast is preferable since it is defined in the most-specific type the subclassing

directcast	out
Pattern(s): 1	1	3	
with linq you can just use oftype for this purpose but you see what i mean... in my experience direct casting is appropriate more often than trycast - although with generics i find myself casting a lot less often than i used to anyway
for c# developers trycast is similar to as and directcast is the equivalent of normal casting
as mike pointed out in the comments as works for nullable value types but trycast doesn t. if the value really should be a t then directcast is indeed the right way to go - it fails fast with an appropriate error

430553
unsigned	short	unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 3	
reading between the lines i think the logic was something like this generally the java designers wanted to simplify the repertoire of data types available for everyday purposes they felt that the most common need was for signed data types for implementing certain algorithms unsigned arithmetic is sometimes needed but the kind of programmers that would be implementing such algorithms would also have the knowledge to work round doing unsigned arithmetic with signed data types mostly i d say it was a reasonable decision



432844
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 1	3	
another way to do it is bool a bool b the xor operator on two boolean is logical xor unlike on ints where it s bitwise

if you want to this as a cpu load simulation you might want to take a few addtional steps on a multicore system be sure to either spawn the loop like this in multiple threads one for each cpu or execute the process multiple times and to make the scheduling predictable assign thread process affinity explicitly sometimes you may also want to increase the thread process priority to simulate the environment where cpu is heavily loaded with high priority applications
your loop mostly sleeps which means it has very light cpu load

nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
Pattern(s): 1	
throwing a nullreferenceexception here is a bad idea for a few reasons a null reference did not actually occur so seeing one is counterintuitive throwing a nullreferenceexception and causing a nullreferenceexception to occur produce discernably different exceptions one way to see the difference is the error code

int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	3	
now perhaps in 2009 a 800gb database is the same for all intents and purposes as a 810gb if you converted the varchars to chars but for short strings 1 or 2 chars chars is still a industry best practice i would say

cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 1	3	
cvs is old and not very fast in terms of branching tagging branch tag creation depends linearly on number of files in a project you should think of your branching strategy first do you want to have a stable trunk feature branches developer branches unstable trunk release branches platform branches this heavily depends on your project and development philosophy if you want to use svn you really have to think of your repository layout because nearly all softwareprojects are module-based and you should find a structure in which you can easily tag all needed modules

mysql is easy to set up fast for oltp and generally takes the approach of doing few things and doing them well
postgresql is kind of the opposite -- it s a database researcher s favorite playground which means it has a dozen different join strategies storage engines advanced optional packages and all kinds of stuff
it s slower than mysql when doing things mysql does well and blows it out of the water when doing things mysql just doesn t know how to do see above with hash joins

xsl-fo is definitely way to go when generating pdf s or printed documents
edit i only answered part of your question i guess. xsl-fo is not natively supported within any common browser as of today. i don t think there any plans for implementing native support in ie i d be very surprised if it was. xsl-fo is just xml so you won t need any further xsl-fo support by the .net framework then as of today. typically xsl-fo is generated using xslt and then the transformation result is passed to a formatting objects processor such as fop. in some cases xslt at least not 1.0 is not enough if your xsl-fo document is very complex

it should look like this sprint 8 -------- story 17 task 1 8 hours task 2 6 hours task 3 2 hours story 18 task 1 8 hours task 2 6 hours story 19 task 1 6 hours task 2 3 hours ... so basically these are the 2 types of estimation you should be doing at the start of each sprint where usually the 1st sprint requires a little more effort to build the initial project roadmap
usually estimation should be done in 2 levels at the start of each sprint story level and task level

hbase	hypertable
Pattern(s): 2	2	1	
in the mean time though if your application data storage can be modelled as a star schema see you might like to checkout the solution that hypertable proposes for secondary index-type needs

Pattern(s): 1	
i create a basenode class that contains the shared data i want to maintain and inherited further from that for any specific node types



548154
pem	pkcs#12
Pattern(s): 1	
as far as i m aware stunnel only uses pem certificates so you will need to convert your jks files into two pem files one for the private key one for the public certificate



548501
jruby	mri
Pattern(s): 2	
if you really need good multi-threaded support and for your software to be written in ruby you might try running it on jruby

in haskell a function means something closer to its mathematical definition as a map from a set a to a set b



549212
ienumerable	icollection
Pattern(s): 3	
here s a small function i m using to determine if an object is a collection which will be enumerable as well since icollection is also ienumerable

the series start here to be honest net.tcp is really currently more useful for wcf to wcf communication



550341
debian	linux	debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 1	
if the machine doesn t have apt-get then chances are it isn t a debian or ubuntu machine which means that using a tutorial designed for debian or ubuntu is unlikely to get you very far

struts	wicket
Pattern(s): 3	3	
struts 1 is already outdated and struts 2 has a very tough competition



556411
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 1	
note that this is across all cpus so if the process has multiple threads and this process is running on a computer with more than one processors it could potentially exceed the wall clock time reported by real which usually occurs

559595
abstract-class	superclass	subclass	abstract-class	subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 1	
something you might consider depending on the rest of your design is a factory where your abstract-class has a static method or multiple static methods depending on how you implement it that constructs the appropriate subclass and returns it as an iconverter



561037
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	
this part overwrites the definition of since the newly created object already has a do properties it does not look up the prototypal chain
the classical form of inherited in javascript is awkard and hard to grasp



562587
vsto	add-in	vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 3	1	
even vsto is still using the old idtextensibility2 com interface underneath



562587
vsto	add-in	vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 1	1	3	3	
however now with vsto there is an additional layer of abstraction vsto uses a so-called solution loader implementing idtextensibility2 which is a dll provided by the vsto runtime
this means that your add-in is no longer com-visible



563391
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 0	3	
that way you avoid having to index into the list each time you want to set a properties so it is a cleaner and slightly faster solution in both execution time and writing it time



563846
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
writing something like varchar 65536 in postgresql is silly



564639

on this separate box a cron job runs all outstanding jobs every 60 seconds unless jobs are still running from the last invocation



568230
winpcap	wireshark
Pattern(s): 2	1	
ethereal while i m not certain if the library would work on wince or whether it directly provides what your looking for it may serve as a framework for any packet analysis that would need to be done in order to facilitate bandwidth use measurement
winpcap is a netwok packet capture library for windows which i believe is a port of a nix library



568983
strsplit	substr
Pattern(s): 3	1	
the above method is bounded by the performance of indexof and substr which does too much index of out range checking and to be faster you need to optimize away these and implement your own helper methods



569825
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	3	
edit i corrected my post to use the scalar function to retrieve the size of the arrays and also add some checking in case the arrays does not contain an even number of elements

572748
ssms	sqlcmd
Pattern(s): 2	
now you could wrap the sql to create the trace in another stored proc that can be run via sql agent idle threshold but use fn_trace_getinfo to see if one if running already

for example chars 10 is the same as x000a



573057
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 2	
you might just be stuck with emacs



573250
width	height
Pattern(s): 3	
however as the div is located in a table cell the width is not fixed as the cell would expand and contract according to the contents of the other cells in the table

tcsh is not bad for those who are very comfortable with c-like syntax



574726
range	max	range	min

if min is smaller than - max+1 you have as floats and doubles have subnormals. normally positive and negative values are symmetric with perhaps one offset but you can adjust the test by adding negative values



574741
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
however google-chrome has most functions implemented in javascript and will return the source for most functions object.constructor is one of the few native functions in google-chrome that does return native code below you find a function with a regexp that checks for native code



575390
fcntl	posix
Pattern(s): 1	
in most systems these are equivalent operations in fact under linux lockf is implemented on top of fcntl but posix says their interaction is unspecified

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 1	
it s possible to add a uitabbar to any uiviewcontroller



577186
uitableview	uipickerview
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	
it s not for navigation or long lists
uitableview is appropriate when you have a list possibly a quite long one and you want to navigate a hierarchy by tapping items on the list
also look at uipickerview which is similar to a drop-down list on a combo box



577405
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	
in most cases where equals compares multiple fields it doesn t really matter if your gethash hashes on one field or on many
you just have to make sure that calculating the hash is really cheap b no allocations please and fast b no heavy computations b and certainly no database connections and provides a good distribution

modular addition over such a group is not terribly interesting though
more interesting might be modular addition over a group of size n where n has prime factors other than just 2 or size p where p is a prime



581876
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 3	
note if you are keeping the exact names of the old subdirectories in your mvc site during the porting phase it s preferable to migrate a whole subdirectory at a time i ve realised because by only doing a few files the routing rules you need to write become more complex since if an existing folder exists with the same name as a routing rule s path and that folder has a default.aspx file then foldername will default to the default.aspx page as it takes precidence over the routing rules

a shared code base is - all considered - simpler and more efficient



586834
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 3	1	
contrary to my previous post it turns out that mysql is also using a cost-based optimizer which is very good news - that is provided you run your analyze at least once when you believe that the volume of data in your database is representative of future day-to-day usage

the best practice for getter is to not allow them to throw exceptions at all



595731
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
for a loops with much longer code where a break or continue could easily hide from notice the purist approach might be more clear since loops is already complicated to grasp in that case



595860
goto	break
Pattern(s): 3	1	
the thought of not using break since it is just as evil as goto is pretty nonsensical



596104
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 1	
this means that if something writes to or reads from a 64bit sized variable it s possible for that read write to get pre-empted during execution



596828
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
if the superclass prohibits mixed-type comparison via the getclass check then the trivial extension would not be comparable to its superclass

598723
addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo	multiplication	modulo
Pattern(s): 3	3	
if on the other hand you want something similar to integer multiplication modulo a power of 2 then multiplication will do - there are elements without an inverse so it s not a group but it is closed - you always get a floating point value back

also pretty much any element of something defined in the pom.xml file can be referenced as an ant property within the build.xml file
really with the ant task for maven there is no viable reason for ivy to even exist



599235
haskell	sml
Pattern(s): 3	1	
sml which is also functional but not lazy can use arrays more naturally than haskell but lists are still more common because they map well to recursive algorithms

a consideration is that currently it is slightly easier to get wxhaskell to work natively on mac os x



601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	1	
wxhaskell is not updated as frequently but the core team is active and there are regular bugfixes but with major new functionality being added rather more slowly than we would like we all have day jobs
wxhaskell gives true native application appearance on all supported platforms out of the box



601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
Pattern(s): 2	
i would admit that with only a small amount of extra work the same could be done with gtk2hs so this is probably the weakest argument in favour of wxhaskell

memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 0	3	0	
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
i d tend to use memcpy if i have already calculated the length although strcpy is usually optimised to work on machine words it feels that you should provide the library with as much information as you can so it can use the most optimal copying mechanism

hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 3	1	
adding a salt only makes it harder for an attacker to generate the fingerprint it s a case of if they have all but one piece of information then the last piece of information is rendered useless i d suggest that you add some more things in for example within vbulletin a project i used to work on the session id hash which is basically the same as the fingerprint is generated with the following code
also a session hash is generated using md5 uniqid microtime true



616773
hash	salt

dependencyobject	freezable
Pattern(s): 2	1	
dependencyobject could and should have been a very clean ubiquitous reusable class. instead it is structurally and behaviourly bound to it s inheritors and even contains specific constants fields methods and work-arounds to help freezable co-exist with the rest of the sub-classes which not only strays far from good oo design but also makes an otherwise superb class utterly unusable outside of the wpf framework
after much research and muddling through the source code for dependencyobject here s the short answer the inheritencecontext the property which reveals the logical parent of an instance is like 90 of the useful implementation of dependencyobject marked as internal and thus kept hidden from all code outside of windowsbase.dll it is possible to use reflection to set the _contextparent field as well as to call this hidden methods to set the inheritencecontext but at the end of the day its not a clean solution

625031
free	malloc	free	strdup	strdup	malloc	strdup	strtok
Pattern(s): 2	2	
i think you can come up with something like this since it is called new strdup you would be supposed to free it once done using the string using an alternative way of writing it is using malloc



625585
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
Pattern(s): 1	
salt are used for password verification - they prevent an attacker performing an offline attack against the password database - each user s password has a salt attached to the plain-text before the hashing - then a pre-computed rainbow table of plaintext - hash text is useless



626143
realloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 3	1	
use the suggested approach hold the pointer to the previous buffer until realloc has successfully returned
once realloc successfully returns the previous block has been freed and all pointers to it have become dangling adjust them



627566
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
if the client computer is slow this reordering may be visible no matter what you do

if you chars set is small enough you might not need more than 30 bits



630279
profiling	instrumentation

i ve never had much luck with the sampling option - instrumentation has often been useful though



631115
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml	children	parent

Pattern(s): 3	3	3	
sorry - triple des is no longer considered best practices
aes is simply a better algorithm so if you can use it then you should



633408
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 2	1	
check this out this will give you a good explanation i think the most common use of the term serializable has to do with converting a binary object into an xml or other string representation so that it can be stored in a database file or sent across a network in a web service call
deserialization is the reverse process - converting an xml string back into an object



633410
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 1	1	
deserialization is the reverse process turning a stream of bytes into an object in memory
deserialization is the reverse process turning a stream of bytes into an object in memory



633651

Pattern(s): 1	
..and have a border that is semi-transparent



643018
loops	if-statement
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	3	3	1	
this is also one of the reasons why a call to a virtual function or a function-pointer-call is not that worse as many assume
also note that inside a loops is not necessarily very expensive



643936
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	
note that integral is another term for int but is not the same as int



644490
viewdidload	viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 3	1	
viewdidload is only called once unless the view is released and needs to be reloaded
this occurs usually only when the view controller receives a low memory warning



646388
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 1	
vmware is great for stability and mobility of vm images but you might want to try some other solutions if you have the time



646805
ienumerable	ienumerator
Pattern(s): 2	
a similar case might be made for ienumerable



647519
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
Pattern(s): 3	
the equivalent in code roughly looks like this then when you need to push a new view controller probably in your didselectrowatindexpath delegate method in your rootcontroller notice that you didn t have to create the self.navigationcontroller property it is already defined in uiviewcontroller and will be injected with the right reference depending on the current state of the navigation



648017
int	chars
Pattern(s): 2	
they can be treated as int with no casting required. i can do and the compiler won t complain



649277
3des	aes
Pattern(s): 3	
and 3des sucks three times as much



649402
portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 3	
if you re working mostly with text as most programmers or other technical folks do or even documents then portrait mode is much more valuable



649736
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 1	
once you have become proficient in the input model going back to an editor where you are forced to use a mouse feels clumsy and ultimately at least to me irritating



650721

if there is not enough available memory realloc returns a null pointer and sets errno to enomem



651900
datamapper	activerecord
Pattern(s): 1	
datamapper is a drop-in replacement that seems to have some traction



653565
accessor	properties

range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
the mostly-likely fit for the by-name lookup is a dictionary the range is trickier



656063
cos	atan2	cos	sin

658007
set	bag	set	bag
Pattern(s): 3	3

abstract-class	superclass
Pattern(s): 1	
explaining a bit make an abstract-class that has a static dict and methods to register an instance with a selector string



660854

postgresql has better foreign key support better referential integrity transactions views subselects etc



668515
super	abstract
Pattern(s): 1	
the super class s discriminator is the objecttype column



669298
post	get
Pattern(s): 1	3	
w3c http standard says that get is idempotent the same url get executed multiple times should always result in same response and consequently can be cached along the way while post is not and must reach the url target



669888
hash	salt	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 1	1	
cryptographic salt is used in password-based key derivation algorithms
salt causes the same password to yield different hashes and thwarts dictionary attacks where a hacker has pre-computed hash values for common passwords and built a reverse-lookup index so that they can quickly discover a password for a given hash



670524
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	3	
if an application can t even keep track of its installation path through the registry then it s probably not worth installing in the first place
b. i m assuming they put 32-bit applications into an x86 folder because it s not a 32 bit os that is old stuff goes here
if 64bit is a step forward then why would you put the legacy software in what will continue to be the standard installation folder



671250
put	get
Pattern(s): 3	3	
i ve heard that delete and put is not fully supported in all browsers i didn t check it



671451

i learned that firefox out-of-the-box supports multiple selection ranges in a web page that contains multiple frames hell firefox even supports multiple selections on a single frame



675708
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 2	
you should be worried about hash to password lookup tables rainbow or otherwise



676595
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
then a variable is destroyed and free is called again for the same address which leads to segmentation fault



676786
expression-blend	silverlight
Pattern(s): 1	
expression-blend is the visual editor of choice for now - there are 3rd party editors available such as xamlcruncher and kaxaml but they don t really support xaml with code-behind classes



677315
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
unlike c++ templates java generics work by type erasure so it only generates one class for all values of t and translates all references to type t in this class to the super type of t in this case superclass then uses virtual dispatch to provide the variance for calls to object methods and static dispatch to calls to static methods



677839
int	chars
Pattern(s): 2	
the exception is when there is a natural key that can be captured as a short chars string in an accounting system where item entries are chars strings



678590
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 3	1	
nearly all apps have only one window. other than that walking up the view hierarchy is perfectly legitimate



679196
margin	height
Pattern(s): 1	
however as the button in question has a fixed-pixel on-page size you don t really need to use nested backgrounds at all



679875
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 3	
post is not a protection from all malicious behavior as some people have implied



680613
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	3	3	3	
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss
while quicksort is often a better choice than merge sort there are definitely times when merge sort is thereotically a better choice



680613
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 3	0	3	1	1	
quicksort is usually faster than this but given the theoretical worst possible input it could run in o n 2 which is worse than the worst possible merge sort
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss



680664
goto	break
Pattern(s): 3	3	
with if else you d need a goto which is not very nice to your readers .

692804
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 1	
what the other answers say about it being impossible to accurately predict the performance of code running on a modern cpu is true but that doesn t mean the latencies are unknown or that knowing them is useless



694450
webclient	webrequest
Pattern(s): 2	
if i understand the question it s much easier than people are saying - if you want to let webclient do all the nuts and bolts of the request including the redirection but then get the actual response uri at the end you can subclass webclient like this just use mywebclient everywhere you would have used webclient



694688
pyexcelerator	xlrd	pyexcelerator	xlrd
Pattern(s): 1	
pyexcelerator is abandonware mdash

postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
for getting it up and running quickly mariadb the successor to mysql is probably your best bet



695838
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 2	
of course that granularity of versioning needs to be baked in at the start and could severely complicate the server-side code



696496
tunnel	packets
Pattern(s): 1	
the wikipedia article about tunnel is helpful but to understand it better you should have a basic idea how encapsulation and osi model work



696666
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 1	
this means that any readily available dictionary is useless since the likelyhood of it containing the hash for that text is a lot less than the likelihood of it containing the hash for dog this likelihood becomes even lower if the salt is a random alphanumeric string



697819
des	aes	des	aes
Pattern(s): 1	
des is slow and now considered obsolete aes is the replacement for it . rc4 sucks don t use it



699126
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 1	
while there are some recent developments that help make ant less procedural a developer s experience with ant is in coding a procedural language written in xml



699126

even though i m very much convinced that maven makes sense i d happily use ant + ivy with a project team that had a very sharp build engineer



699266
boost	stl	inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 1	
because boost function is polymorphic it cannot be inline



699350

in this case it would be a and b resulting in this ends up ordering the results consistently between calls when the count of the items between grouping is not unique assuming the same set of data



707543
wxpython	pyqt
Pattern(s): 3	1	
but qt is far superior to wx



708639
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 3	
serializable and deserialization is not the simplest problem you can work on



709950
createfile	getlasterror
Pattern(s): 3	
to see if the file is in use if you get a valid file handle then you know the file does not have conflicting sharing permissions with a process that already has this file open



711712
super	self
Pattern(s): 3	
just like self is not the receiver s class



711969
exponent	modulo
Pattern(s): 3	3	
with totient and the private exponent the public exponent is quickly computed
in any case most rsa key pairs use 65537 as the public exponent and the modulo is always carried as part of the private key



713091
indesign	framemaker
Pattern(s): 1	
beware indesign currently has weak xml support imo



713223
octal	hex	octal	decimal

firstly http auth is secure over ssl other than the fact that you can t implement a true logout functionality



715574
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception	runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
Pattern(s): 3	2	
below exception there is runtimeexception also an unchecked-exception
the way that the designers of java intended exceptions to be used is exception things that can go wrong error low level things that can go wrong and a program cannot recover from runtimeexception programmer errors like going past the end of an array or calling a method on null



716516
groovy	gpath	jruby	mri
Pattern(s): 1	
but groovy as a language has made huge strides and is a pleasure to work with



717812
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	
because of the way memory usage works in the clr you can essentially consider that getting the length property of a string is just like retrieving an int variable



718492
copying	overwrite
Pattern(s): 1	1	
you re copying to the stack so it s dependent on what the compiler has placed on the stack for how much extra data will be required to crash your program
some compilers might produce code that will crash with only a single byte over the buffer size - it s undefined what the behaviour is



718586
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 2	3	2	
it needs to be the right expression though - if you do and cast c a double the multiplication will be done with double arithmetic but a b might still be done as integers. here s the listing changed appropriately to make sure double arithmetic is used everywhere it should be
if they re both int then the lines initializing angx and angy will be evaluated using int arithmetic



718697
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	3	
the size of the integer is large enough to hold the address of any memory location



719228
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 2	
it is free to create and distribute compiled plt scheme code on any platform



719332
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 1	1	
if the other machines you used to run the program were using vista x86 it s likely that there s a pinvoke in your code that s causing the issue. you may want to try setting the compiler target architecture to x86 to force your program to run in wow64 on the x64 vista. by default visual studio uses settings building assemblies in architecture-agnostic ways



721444
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 1	1	
it s encryption and from the sounds of things this is really more of a salt or cypher not real encryption. a hash is one-way by definition

postgresql has some nice features like generate_series custom aggregate functions arrays etc which can ease your life greatly if you take some time to learn them



728038
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	
subclassing foo means that you re saying that a subclass bar is always acceptable to use where a foo could be used
in particular it means you inherited not necessarily foo s implementation you can override that or foo may be abstract and give no particular implementation for a method



728595
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 1	
rss provides you with a few standardized formats instead of having to all the malformed html that makes up the web.



728716
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
to get a real figure fit the string into a frame that is taller than the one you need - then you ll get a height that is greater than your actual height



729163
realloc	memmove
Pattern(s): 0	1	1	
simply rearranging pointers frags i frags i+1 or using memmove is easier quicker and stops you wasting memory though
your realloc is likely failing because you re not reserving a byte for the trailing nul 0 character in strings -- adding a +1 to your realloc size will fix that bug
the specific error you re getting is likely because one of your strings is length 0 and realloc foo 0 simply gives you that error on your system or because you re writing the trailing 0 in unallocated memory and overwriting something else important causing corruption

735964
multiplying	subtract
Pattern(s): 3	1	
the allowed range for initial n is -64 to +63. here s what the function does for positive n if n is in 0..63 initial range the function call adds 64 mapping n to the range 64..127 intermediate range if n is in 64..127 intermediate range the function subtract n from 64 mapping n to the range 0..-63 for negative n the function uses the intermediate range -65..-128
using complex numbers you can effectively divide the task of negating a number into two steps multiplying n by i and you get n i which is n rotated 90 counter-clockwise multiplying again by i and you get -n the great thing is that you don t need any special handling code

qt-creator	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	
qt-creator is just as portable between platforms as qt itself and uses the mingw compiler under ms windows and the gcc compiler under linux
generally speaking i found open source qt a polished piece of software which gives a much smoother and more pleasant user experience than kdevelop which tries so desperately to implement slews and slews of bells and whistles that it neglects to make simple things easy and reliable and it has few features and a much simpler interface than kdevelop perhaps the paying version also has a more complicated interface

switching	screens
Pattern(s): 1	1	
the selection screens btw is a good place for the new record button
disclaimer i have been doing cruds for i don t know how long but i m just starting now with my first winforms app. p so some mixed ideas in our current system written using centura gupta we use a mdi-like approach. i think it is important to allow the user to start working on a new record without forcing him to close his current work so a list of open windows is always displayed to allow quick switching between the different forms

post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
i think this might cost less than the use of regexes though i am not totally clear on what you are trying to accomplish i have learned from other post it is cheaper and better to wrap up all of the data when you are reading through a file the first time

one last note ocaml gives you hashtable but it s hardly sensible to use it in code if you really want to embrace functional programming



823338
haskell	ocaml	haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 3	3	
f# essentially uses the .net type system plus ml-like hindley-milner polymorphism see question what is hindley-milner . ocaml is not quite consistent on whether it thinks variants should be statically typed or dynamically typed so it provides both algebraic data types and polymorphic variants

that is nhibernate will make sure that while reconstituting an instance the collection will not contain duplicates. - when you map the collection as a bag it is possible that your collection will contain the same entity more then once when loading the object from the db
a set is a collection of distinct objects considered as a whole



826146
recv	epoll	recv	epoll
Pattern(s): 1	
it seems that epollin and a recv that returns an empty string is indicative of the other end having closed the connection however using an older version of python before epoll were introduced and plain select on a pipe i ve experienced that a read that returned did not indicate eof just a lack of available data

webclient is fairly limited



830889
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	uiwindow
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	1	
edit the uiview is something generic provides common methods you use to create all types of views and access their properties
while uiwindow is more concrete class defines objects that manage and coordinate the windows an application displays on the screen. i know is a little vague and i think only apple would know the exact reason for this hierarchy



832674
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	3	
you want to enhance a but a is final and can no further be subclassing then you need to use composition and delegation
assume your class is called b and the derived delegated to class is called a then here are some examples when inherited or delegation are being used if you want to express relationship is-a then you want to use inherited

if so passing id is not enough as .net does not assign the same server id as client-side id



858910
sqlparameter	oledb	sqlparameter	oledb
Pattern(s): 3	
the update is failing because it can t find a record that matches the customer id supplied and i think that that is because the parameter value is not being defaulted - there are additional values for the sqlparameter that will allow you to do this



860351
public	protected
Pattern(s): 1	
public - base class s public members will be public usually the default protected - base class s public members will be protected private - base class s public members will be private as litb points out public inheritance is traditional inheritance that you ll see in most programming languages



860887
fgets	feof
Pattern(s): 3	1	
feof f then it is broken since the eof flag does not get set until after a read has been done
instead do something like this since fgets is defined to return null on either failure to read or eof

however unless you really need the flexibility that daemons provide cron is much easier and simpler



865907
hide	show
Pattern(s): 2	3	
i think it depends on what you re planning on displaying if it s images then i d be tempted to hide them on page load and then show on hover but if it s just a block of text then i d probably be tempted in appending to the dom and then removing on hover out
if you inspect facebook with firefox s firebug plugin you can see that the hide div is there when the page is loaded but is hidden and activated through css classes

3 because this is a trojan that sends back your ftp password it doesn t matter how good your password was



872315
trojan	virus
Pattern(s): 3	
if you can t update as explained above then follow these instructions you ll need to extrapolate but basically you have a file the name may vary which is pointed in the registry and use hijackthis to remove it once you rebout without this file excuted all is fine 5 of course update your passwords but make sure the trojan is removed first



872761
tapestry	grails	tapestry	wicket
Pattern(s): 1	3	
tapestry is another framework that attempts to be a full stack from what i understand and takes a wicket like or i guess wicket takes a tapestry-like approach

but sizeof int is actually useful int s can be different sizes on 16- and 32- and these newfangled 64-bit computers



874572
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 3	
it can support oop because it supports inherited through prototyping as well as properties and methods



875344
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 3	0	
therefore seeing as the alternative using an explicit loops is not harder to implement than a call to map it is highly recommended that one restricts use of map to those cases in which the function to be applied does not cause side effects



875407
floor	sqrt

880612
gtk	cairo
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	
gtk is huge and very useful but not at all shoes-ish
_why has written shoes mostly on top of cairo which is what recent versions of gtk use for widget drawing also so it appears he purposely stepped back to the core of ui design and created a different framework from the ground up for a solidly different reason than one would use gtk for

i ll assume platno can be used as a unique identifier for a machine



881252
single-quotes	double-quotes
Pattern(s): 1	
the single-quote is the standard sql string delimiter and double-quotes are identifier delimiters so you can use special words or characters in the names of tables or columns



881800
autofac	castle-windsor
Pattern(s): 3	1	
once you get that and you feel the need for more mature product that can do other things than simply di i d suggest taking a look at castle-windsor which is pretty powerful out of the box very well designed and customizable. if you don t like that i ve heard good things about strcuturemap



883490
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 1	
never store the password directly store the hash value 2 use a char x the number of characters returned from the hash is constant so you can give it a known storage size

creating the superclass is much harder when you have to think about how it can be extended



892649
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 3	
if the program you re using is installed correctly it should already be in the program files folder so you could just refer to the configuration file as . config_file.txt if its in the same directory as the program or .. other_program config_file.txt if its in a directory different than the other program

894009
vsto	add-in	vsto	add-in

i believe vsto provides its own shim if you choose to go down that path i didn t since i needed to be able to drive office from scratch rather than relying on the user to start the application



894032
int	chars
Pattern(s): 1	
i said that whether int is 4-aligned is platform-dependent on arm it absolutely has to be since unaligned access throws a hardware exception

Pattern(s): 2	
it means that an entity is associated with the database and changes will be written or persistent to the database



908126
post	get
Pattern(s): 3	1	
the reason post is so common is that historically at least web browsers only supported get and post



909712
set	bag
Pattern(s): 1	
the best reason of all to use .settings is generally that you gain the ability to clearly identify who is using which setting in a code base by following usages of properties and each set is a separate block in the xml file

factors	matrix
Pattern(s): 1	
as explained in the previous text the normal transformation matrix is m-1 t

note also that you should almost never use filewriter since it does not allow you to specify the encoding



915986
post	get
Pattern(s): 3	
if the request is not a post it is most likely a get



916923
icomparable	compareto

enterprise validation block has few negative sides as well



918825
vtk	itk
Pattern(s): 3	
i m assuming itk does too



920673
ienumerable	ilist
Pattern(s): 3	
the reasons i have seen for doing this in the other answers and comments are currently ienumerable is read-only ienumerable is the defacto standard it reduces coupling so you can change the implementation you don t expose implementation details while ienumerable only exposes readonly functionality that doesn t make it readonly



923533
subclass	superclass	subclass	inherited	subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 1	
i still find in practice however that django s inherited leads to some awkward extra steps on occasion



923798
error-handling	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 1	1	
i have to say i slightly resent the tone that implies this sort of lax error-handling behaviour is something fundamental to java programmers
sure java programmers can be lazy just like every other programmer and java s a popular language so you ll probably see a lot of code swallowing exception-handling



926598
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 2	
getitem for loops expect that an indexerror will be raised for illegal indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the sequence. raise indexerror to signal the end of the sequence



926806
int	double

suppose we add an additional design criterion that the problem be solved solely with int arithmetic rather than computing the quotient as a double since the double solution has been explicitly rejected in the problem statement



926864
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 3	1	
if it s just you you might want to try bazaar

Pattern(s): 1	2	
i know redmine has an additional feature that checks for these bug numbers in the commit logs and attaches the revision to the bug so you can see from the bug all the revisions that were involved in fixing it
i d be suprised if trac doesn t have something similar



930194

uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 3	1	
added to a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller that is added directly to uiwindow or a chain of these that leads to uiwindow
did you check if viewwilldisappear gets called when it goes offscreen

inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 3	
in any case the inline specified is indeed a hint



934669
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 0	
inline is nothing more than a suggestion to the compiler that if it s possible to inline this function then the compiler should consider doing so



935862
width	height
Pattern(s): 3	1	
what then happens is that the height is not good enough for most readers so i copy the image and duplicated it above it so it now is the width i want and double the height of the generator



935945
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 1	1	
it seems likely that the same is true of uitabbarcontroller



936403
tabcontrol	tabitem
Pattern(s): 2	
you should declare an instance of your class within the datatemplate itself this will cause a new closabletabitem to be created whenever a new tab is added to the tabcontrol



936760
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 3	3	
which means you probably want to start with a socketserver using a tcp connection tcp is basically guaranteed delivery of data
udp is not

i m not certain about tomcat but this post looks pertinent



939155
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
Pattern(s): 2	
p invoke can be used in a cross platform way once you have your pcm data using a ogg c lib or managed code something like this of course there are licencing issues with mp3 you will need a way to play it unfortunatly .net does not provide any direct assess to your sound card or methods to play streaming audio



941141
beyondcompare	winmerge
Pattern(s): 1	1	
on the file comparison front beyondcompare is a good low-cost commercial alternative to built-in tortoise compare merge



941188
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 3	
for more general profiling like object allocation you want to use instrumentation which is also part of apple s developer tools suite



941663
factors	matrix
Pattern(s): 3	3	
however its constant factors is far too large to be useful in practice



942051
inherited	properties	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 3	1	
now after thinking about it you most likely do not want the masterpage properties set....but just the class inheritance
the hookup of the masterpage properties creates a weak association and renders content inside of a specific structure



943515
mockito	easymock	mockito	easymock
Pattern(s): 3	1	
actually we made a lot of jokes about how easymock is not easy
it allows partial mocking painlessly - something that easymock required a separate library for



943515
mockito	easymock
Pattern(s): 1	3	0	
it allows partial mocking painlessly - something that easymock required a separate library for
also mockito has much better error messaging

filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 1	
for example on windows systems using the fat or fat32 file systems st_mtime has 2-second resolution and st_atime has only 1-day resolution



948285
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 0	1	
there is only one good argument i ve heard in favor of cvs and that is in situations where you have a project that will have many different releases and branches in cvs it is easier to just push an arbitrary file into the branch or tag you need when you need it
svn is more formal about these things and makes it harder to just pick on one file and merge it as you need it



948818
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 1	1	
fat has 2 second precision. ntfs is 100 nanoseconds. ext3 is 1 second

ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 1	
so how to make it work sudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt and note there are on .dll files in linux dll refers to dynamicaly loaded library its used in windows linux equivalent is .so and im pretty sure that you havent just installed the mcrypt packages



952134
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
i have given up on mysql for geospatial data for now because of the following reasons mysql only supports spatial datatypes spatial indexes on myisam tables with the inherent disadvantages of myisam concerning transactions referential integrity... mysql implements some of the opengis specifications only on a mbr-basis minimum bounding rectangle which is pretty useless for most serious geospatial querying-processing see this link in the mysql manual



952203
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 3	
the whole point of maven is so that you can include all your dependancies using inheritance or importing them with the import scope



952727
direct3d	directx
Pattern(s): 2	
edit changed directx in original answer to direct3d



954364
ready	each
Pattern(s): 1	
also with the wshttpcontextbinding you should check whether you really need the sessions that are on by default - the recommended best practice would be to use per-call instancing on the server each caller instantiates a new server object



954395
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 1	
post is non-idempotent meaning if you send the same post request many times you will get many new items



955153
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 1	
in the basepage class you can have a public properties which contains the extra fields you want to store for your user eg



955456
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 1	
the intptr.size property is returned in bytes 8 bits per byte so it is equal to 4 on a 32-bit cpu and 8 on a 64bit cpu



956032
direct3d	directx
Pattern(s): 3	
my choice direct3d is sometimes faster on some graphics card than opengl and that is because of graphics vendors and their drivers



959276
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 2	
the best advice i ever received for ood was to look to the smallest object that each logical branch of your app can be distilled to it probably on has native types for properties with .net there no point in reinventing framework objects either so they can be in your base class and then using inheritance polymorphism and encapsulation to expand on those base classes until you have an object that encapsulates the logical branch



959368
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	
nunit really is supported everywhere
our 200+ developer shop just moved away from mstest to nunit and so far we ve not encountered issues with lack of tool support in fact rather the opposite it seems that the support infrastructure around nunit is very extensive



960490
codeigniter	cakephp
Pattern(s): 0	1	
codeigniter on the other hand seems more natural to pure php-ist because it s less abstract so it might be easier to pick up



960573
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	
content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded is already default with curl -d no need for anything extra -x post is superfluous as -d implies post -d does not url encode the data

if you prefer using firefox firebug provides similar functionality



961939
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	3	
for example if you want to perform all your calculations up front so that you can release a resource then a list comprehension or for-loop is probably best



962806
multiplying	multiplication
Pattern(s): 3	
multiplying is just multiplication and scale and propagate the integer overflow



962890
mergesort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 1	3	3	
it s easy to see that mergesort does as it s symmetric but reasoning about something like bubblesort or more importantly quicksort or heapsort is not



963204
glut	glui	glut	glui
Pattern(s): 1	
they have newer version number in their header files note that to use gl extensions requires v1.2 glut v4 freeglut opengl v1.3 glext ... so to use the first option comile with -i usr include opengl and link against -lglut32 -lglu32 -lopengl32 to use the x11 version compile with -i usr include which is included by default and link with -lglut -lglu -lgl note the difference you could add the x11 headers and libraries but i guess their included by the gl ones

the hash is repeated many times so that it will be expensive and slow for an attacker to try each entry in her dictionary of most common passwords



969881
many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 3	
the problem is not made any better by the fact that linq to sql does not support many-to-many relationships directly and in reality assuming that your lookup table only defines a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship you d have to do something like ad.adbases.single .milbase of course assuming there will always be one - if that s not the case then you ve got some more complicated things ahead of you

when i press tab it creates spaces instead of for tabs check the option if unchecked it will display tabs not space



971393
subclass	abstract-class

Pattern(s): 3	3	
unfortunately you can t create the linked resource if the real directory is already there in the project structure



974012
daemons	launchd

i believe ironpython does additionally support compilation but i m not 100 sure and less about ruby



979198
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 1	
i imagine boost uses a lot of advanced c++ features like templating etc



979275
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 2	2	
since m_pi is a floating point number and multiplication in c is left-associative meaning it proceeds from left to right the first multiplication 2 m_pi will be promoted to a float as will each successive multiply
since cos returns a float pnumber will be assigned a float without having performed any integer division hence no loss of precision



979622
wxpython	pyqt
Pattern(s): 2	3	3	
for another project which is to be delivered exclusively on .net i plan to use winforms after lots of great feedback from stackoverflow members
the reasons were wxpython in action book by rappin dunn the voluminous examples that come as part of the wxpython download the number of projects that have used wxwidgets the fact that wxpython code runs equally well on linux mac os x and win32 i did consider pyqt and other researchers are successfully using it

pascal	delphi
Pattern(s): 3	
turbo pascal was one of the if not the main compilers of the dos era and delphi is still the second most sold ide in the world after visual studio so i think the dead language and teaching language bits are a bit exaggerated

993495
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 1	
however neither is quite as rich as you require for example to present the same data as bytes or halfwords you need to copy it between two arrays the numpy third-party add-on is much more powerful for interpreting the same area of memory in several different ways and for example to display some bytes in hex there s nothing much bundled beyond a simple loop or list comprehension such as

Pattern(s): 3	
talking to ram takes a fairly long time



998269
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	1	3	1	
edit the code in the second question is missing the int in both cases but adding it makes it ok works fine and with different values for a maxhp and cat maxhp -- in this case the subclassing is not inheriting the static from the base class since so to speak it s hiding it with its own homonymous one



998420
cvs	rcs
Pattern(s): 1	
cvs uses the old rcs file format and uses rcs tags both for branches and cvs tags



999113

1001344
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	
a chars pointer is then assigned to point at the first least-significant byte of the int value

margin	font-size
Pattern(s): 0	
finally try adding a overflow hidden to your parent element to force it to not budge when the font-size gets larger



1004041
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 1	
itunes is on the other extreme -- it relies on the mouse almost exclusively as do most drag-drop dominated uis and using the keyboard only is next to impossible



1004498
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	
in addition oracle s provider called oracle data provider for .net odp.net is a popular and viable option



1005202
super	extends
Pattern(s): 3	1	
it would not make sense otherwise - super class is not aware of your elements so it would overwritten your calculation

goto	break
Pattern(s): 2	2	
if you have ever used a break or a continue you ve used a goto



1005835
atoi	strtod	strtol	atoi	strtol	strtod
Pattern(s): 2	
same for atoi and strtol . if a function be advertised to return an error code in the event of difficulties thou shalt check for that code yea even though the checks triple the size of thy code and produce aches in thy typing fingers for if thou thinkest it cannot happen to me the gods shall surely punish thee for thy arrogance



1006227
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	3	
this is because a string at least in c c++ is not quite the same sort of thing as an int



1008704
post	get
Pattern(s): 3	0	3	3	
http post is not encrypted it can be intercepted by a network sniffer by a proxy or leaked in the logs of the server with a customised logging level
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

1009949
division	addition
Pattern(s): 1	
but really jvanderh s answer most expresses what you want to do because it allows for easy addition of cases in the future that don t break on a multiple of 50 and don t require future maintainers to follow the math or know about the operator



1011238
bazaar	git	bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 3	
if by code management you are looking at content management git is designed to manage just that the staging area for instance allows you to record what current content you want to commit even though you have already begun to make some large modification you end up not wanting to commit in the current branch to be sure re-read linus s original vision for git back in april 2005

1017309
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 1	
i m also unsure whether including thiry-party components into versioning control is a good thing because of the space it takes - though you can also put them somewhere else and include them as external which makes it much smaller but also imposes the problem that upgrading the components for one app will upgrade them for all - so you better have good integration tests



1018476
cppcheck	pc-lint
Pattern(s): 1	
cppcheck is free and will check for unused private functions



1018881
alloca	malloc
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	
however if the thing you want to alloc using alloca is reasonably small i think that it s a good technique that s faster and more convenient than using malloc or otherwise
in other words alloca 0x00ffffff is dangerous and likely to cause overflow exactly as much as is



1019215
bazaar	svn
Pattern(s): 3	1	
reasonable learning curve for developers used to clearcase the gui can be a factor to alleviate the learning curve but a dvcs is very different from clearcase as this core concepts answer illustrates

nsscanner	nsnumberformatter	nsscanner	nsstring
Pattern(s): 1	
for example see nsnumberformatter to format us telephone numbers and remove all but numbers from nsstring . of course i m definitely a fan of a wide variety of data structures in general although cocoa s simplicity is refreshing compared with some languages



1019915
subclass	inherited	subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	3	1	3	
you can use the type object to dynamically construct a class given a name tuple of base classes and dict of methods class attributes eg mysub is now a subclass of drvcrystalfontz and some_other_class inherited their methods and adds a new one some_extra_method
i m not sure i m clear on your desired use here but it is possible to subclass dynamically

inherited	base-class	inherited	base-class
Pattern(s): 1	
your code boils down to the line where you try to assign a baseclass to an inherited class which is impossible



1025655
inherited	subclassing

1026810
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
Pattern(s): 1	0	
the situation is similar to when you use argumentnullexception except there is no specific exception for empty values
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit

int	double
Pattern(s): 1	1	
from here the internal representation of all numbers including int uses double-precision floating-point numbers

Pattern(s): 0	0	1	
for vim vim has better integration with other tools shell commands scripts compilers version control systems ctags etc. than most editors



1088705
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 3	3	
lots of editors handle different file encodings ok but vim gives you very specific and foolproof ways of setting file encodings and converting between them
the very first thing that impressed me about vim is how perfectly it handles tab space indentation options and unix dos linebreaks compared to other editors that i had problems with at the time



1088933
hash	md5	hash	hmac
Pattern(s): 3	
md5 is not encryption - it s a hash



1088933
hash	md5	hash	md5
Pattern(s): 1	
md5 is an unkeyed hash function - there is not key in use at all



1089392
exponent	addition
Pattern(s): 3	
it s just like when we adjust the exponent after doing an operation on numbers in decimal scientific notation



1091876
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 2	2	
i think a decision on the relative merits of the two approaches might take into account factors such as the frequency of changes to the schema the frequency with which changes need to be propagated to other schemas test user acceptance production clients n etc the degree to which the schema may vary across development branches how well-known in advance your various changes can be scheduled whether or not you can generate sql diff scripts between schemas



1092119
shadowing	named

1099359
udp	mtu
Pattern(s): 3	
a 512-byte udp payload is generally considered to do that although even that does not leave quite enough space for a maximum size ip header



1099695
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
read this udp is useful for broadcasting information in a publish-subscribe kind of application



1099712
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 1	3	2	
udp is a connection-less protocol and used in applications like snmp simple network management protocol dns domain name system where data packets arriving out of order unreliability and not of concern and immediate send through of the data packet matters
since udp does not involve connection establishment there fore applications like dns where connection establishment delays needs to be avoided udp is preferred over tcp



1099807
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
udp has lower overhead as stated already is good for streaming things like video and audio where it is better to just lose a packet then try to resend and catch up



1099870
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 1	1	
in some cases which others have highlighted guaranteed arrival of packets isn t important and hence using udp is fine
there are other cases where udp is preferable to tcp

if it is helpful you can find out a bit more here



1100554
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 3	
when you think about this it makes sense since all a union really does is serially splice the output from the two queries together



1100868
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	
however if you need guaranteed delivery of packets with no loss and in the right sequence then tcp is probably what you want
on the other hand udp is appropriate for transmitting short packets of information where the sequence of the information is less important or where the data can fit into a single packet



1101645

1103942
cpu	affinity
Pattern(s): 1	
it s interesting to note that threads can swap between cores quite frequently in the course of a single running process due to other loads and interrupts that can hit a cpu core



1104479
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	
my initial approach was to extend the matrix type with a scala class and then overload the arithmetic operators and call the java native methods but the matrix class doesn t provide a default constructor without arguments the scala class needs one primary constructor i thought one good primary constructor could be the one accepting an array array double first thing that sucks that syntax is much more verbose and hard to read than double as far as i know by reading the manuals the parameters of the primary constructor are also implicitly fields of the class so i would end with one array array double in the scala subclassing and another double in the java superclass which is pretty redundant



1105111
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
Pattern(s): 0	
when the scene is larger than the scroll bars values you can choose to use translate to navigate the scene instead

by extension this also means that if the getter is defined in a different .dll .so the call can not be inlined



1110150
nsstring	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata

qtp has no special handling for this but it is fairly straightforward to set up a mechanism to do this



1126248
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 1	3	3	
but if you could the indexer would have to be written like so as you can see calling this multiple times in a loops is going to be much slower than using an enumerator that can remember where it is in the list
a for-loop gets compiled to code approximately equivalent to this where as a foreach loops gets compiled to code approximately equivalent to this so as you can see it would all depend upon how the enumerator is implemented versus how the lists indexer is implemented

1134501
std	ostream
Pattern(s): 2	
the basic_ostream template and ostream class are defined as then the possible manipulators that can be passed to a std ostream are if you want to accept manipulators you must provide that overload in your class in particular the signature for endl which may be the only one you require is so it falls under the manip1 type of functions

glut	sdl
Pattern(s): 3	3	
if you still long for cross platform compatibility then your best bet is likely sdl which is very much like glut in that it is a fairly thin layer over the underlying abstractions but it provides a slightly richer event system and more opportunities for interacting with hardware such as sound and joysticks



1145852
imperative	declarative
Pattern(s): 3	
a better solution imho if you need that what a debugger could do for you is to use the sql profiler which has the advantage of being able to tell you what a procedure is actually doing in production instead of just what it does in you artificial tests

using gettype .equals as i do is more precise than is or as since value must be exactly of the type string



1166745
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 3	
usually when you have to declare self referencing structures like lists you use both because the typedef has not effect until the structure is defined unless you make a forward declaration for example so now you can declare variables of the same type in the following ways the three variables above are the same pointers to the node structure

Pattern(s): 2	
then you need to edit the test run configuration and specify which files will be copied to the test execution folder



1168962
ienumerable	icollection
Pattern(s): 1	3	3	
the message about expanding the results view will evaluate the collection is a standard message presented for all ienumerable objects
i m not sure that there is any foolproof means of checking if an ienumerable is deferred mainly because even a yield is deferred



1169205
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 2	
if you are attached to having a particular number of iterations then you could do something like sunqiang s answer repeated here for-loop in xrange 240 os.system kjor time.sleep seconds finally if you are on a unix platform such as linux or mac you should take a look at cron as it is designed to set up recurring programs to run and particular time periods

1179093
tabs	tabpanel	tabs	tabpanel
Pattern(s): 1	
this is why the default tabcontrol has its headerpanel tabs sits on the top first row



1179379
memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 2	3	
to answer your first point the power of memcached is that it allows to create a cluster of cache servers it is not meant to be used on a single server event it you can use it that way the theory is you have many servers and each one has some free ram you have no use for to use this ram you install memcached on these servers and configure it to use the amount of ram that wasn t used and if one machine is down it automatically stops using it and put load balance the data on the others the drawback of memcached for some people is that it s network based even when you use it on only one machine
which means a bit slower that local-only apc works on only one machine it is great used as a caching mecanism to store data you only need on one server or if you only have one server



1179908
fseek	fread	fread	strlen
Pattern(s): 3	1	
you re not treating this as a null terminated string you aren t allocating enough space for teh null terminator - just exactly what s needed to fit your binary data so strlen is probably inappropriate



1179908
fseek	fread	fread	strlen
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	
also strlen is not necessarily a valid thing to use since it s going to assume that this is a null terminated string



1179924
bindparam	bindvalue	bindparam	bindvalue
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	
not values with bindvalue you can pass both values obviously and variables bindparam works only with variables because it allows parameters to be given as input output by reference and a value is not a valid reference in php it is useful with drivers that quoting the manual support the invocation of stored procedures that return data as output parameters and some also as input output parameters that both send in data and are updated to receive it



1181524
addslashes	multibyte
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	1	
as a result a function such as addslashes is not able to prevent sql-injection attacks



1181629
integer	unsigned	integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 3	3	
there s no point in using it in application code a size_t is completely ok int is not because it s signed and you ll get signed unsigned comparison warnings

1182540
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 1	
consider the following example i have a test class i have a superclass and i have a subclass in my main method i create an instance of testsub the results are as follows tester 3e205f super init block tester bf73fa super constructor tester 5740bb sub init block tester 5ac072 sub constructor



1182972
uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 2	
if however you are only interested in performing basic animation and it can be done through uiview the api is usually simpler so it will make sense to use uiview to save yourself time there



1183073
uiview	calayer	width	height
Pattern(s): 3	3	
the memory overhead of a uiview compared to a calayer is just the size of the instance variables of the uiview class plus a few instances of additional classes that will get allocated



1183073
uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	
the memory overhead of a uiview compared to a calayer is just the size of the instance variables of the uiview class plus a few instances of additional classes that will get allocated
if uiview adds functionality that s useful for your application then use it

move	drag	qtreeview	qabstractitemview
Pattern(s): 3	1	
it calls fetchmore when geometry is updated the scroll bars are move rows are inserted the current item is changed as a result of an autoscrolling drag drop operation qtreeview additionally calls fetchmore when an item is expanded this is essentially the only time it calls fetchmore with a non-root index the view s layout needs to be relaid such as with expandall and collapseall i think the best solution would be to subclass qtreeview to make it call fetchmore in the appropriate places and with the appropriate indices



1186250
printf	fgetc
Pattern(s): 3	1	
the reason that fgetc is apparently working for multibyte characters for you is because the bytes making up the multibyte character are being read in seperately written out seperately and then interpreted as a multibyte character by your console



1186597
boxlayout	miglayout	boxlayout	miglayout
Pattern(s): 1	
well mostly because boxlayout is an old api before they knew any better



1187087
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 1	3	
first of all the following for-loop is wrong obviously you switched _dicesize and _noofdice



1187573
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 2	
use settimeout in the callback for your request don t forget to call your function once after it has been defined to start it off after that settimeout will be called every time after a request has finished. note that in some cases you might not reach readystate 4



1187895
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 3	
marc s answer is entirely correct the possibility of a repl or script like c# has been discussed by eric lippert in two blog post why doesn t c# implement top level methods it already is a scripting language i would add that the 2010 ctp does contain an f# repl not much use for c# but if you were interested in some aspect of the bcl or clr then it might be sufficient for your needs i find that linqpad makes up for the lack of a repl in many cases

int	chars	readonly	temporary
Pattern(s): 2	
for instatnce in c c++ almost evertying but specialy values defined as chars int long float and arrays of course go on stack. that mean that linker use and expect only data on stack or in program itself which is generaly readonly when program need extra memory in sizes which can not be defined in time of compilation it need heap

1194930
outputstream	inputstream
Pattern(s): 2	
but this requires you to keep count how many bytes you read this can be implementd with a filterinputstream then close the inputstream open it again skip that many bytes and only then wrap it in an objectinputstream



1195096
folder	directory	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 3	
if however you want to remove a file from a directory you need access only to the directory because a directory itself is just a regular file that lists the locations of but does not contain other files



1195605
many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 2	
if it does then you would have to map it as a separate entity location would have a collection of links mapped as bi-directional one-to-many link would have many-to-one relationships with both location and endpoint if otoh links has no other columns and you re willing to forgo its primary key which is neither needed nor can be mapped for many-to-many join table then you can map it as many-to-many collection of endpoint s on location



1196033
range	max
Pattern(s): 3	
if you need a short field say a few hundred characters at most then it would be reasonable to use a field with a specified maximum length nvarchar 256 however if it s a lot of text as can appear on this site then nvarchar max is probably more appropriate



1196642
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	
so in this case you have to do it old school if in the real code the enhanced for-loop is really worth it then you could add the items to a temporary collection and call removeall on the list after loops



1197657
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 2	3	
that s why you see very often interfaces used insted here b and c could have inherited from a which would have created a very high coupling among them by using interfaces the coupling is reduced if a decides it will no longer be nameaware the other classes won t broke



1198427

perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 1	1	
some other issues i had with perforce what you commit is not what you get back for example if you commit an utf16 file on an intel mac and sync it from another ppc mac you ll get another utf16 file because perforce is smart and does covert you the file to the client byte-ordering

1318765
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 1	
you can make your changes to those files and commit them as normal using svn - svn simply uses the .svn dirs to detect whether anything has changed and to generate the diffs to send to the repository



1319665
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
in postgresql this is a fairly common approach to your dilemma



1320022
hash	salt	hash	hmac
Pattern(s): 1	2	3	1	
hmac essentially rolls a secret key known only by your server into the hash so even someone who knows the algorithm can t generate a hmac that will be recognized as valid without knowing the key
just using a plain old hash is trivially bypassable because the attacker can generate valid hash of their own data and all the salt in the ocean won t fix that



1320637
rank	max
Pattern(s): 0	
if you are using oracle something like this will work step 1 find out max value of userid in your table select max userid from tbl_userid let this number be m step 2 find out the max value of rownum in the foll query select rownum from all_objects step 3 if the max value is greater than m then you can use the foll query to list your unused user ids select user_id from tbl_userid where user_id not in select rownum from all_objects if max value returned by step 2 is less than m you can tweak your query to the following repeat the union all until you get max rownum m if you are using sql server kindly let me know



1320978
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 0	3	3	
ocaml is weaker even when just looking at parallelism given its underlying architecture



1323270
jar	war	jar	war
Pattern(s): 1	
when the war is built any compile-scoped dependencies and their transitive dependencies will be bundled into the war s web-inf lib directory aspectjrt will be included as well



1324990
merb	ruby-on-rails
Pattern(s): 3	
you ll get a deeper understanding of the library that way anyway at the cost of some upfront screen time reading code. ruby-on-rails by contrast is a relatively stable target with extensive tutorials and documentation but it s all going to be obsolete in ruby-on-rails 3 when it s merbified



1325163
actionscript	haxe	actionscript	haxe
Pattern(s): 1	3	
haxe is an open source language driven by a quite small but active community haxe is a platform indepented language .
the same code can be later reused for desktop mobile apps haxe is a very expressive and powerful language featuring first class functions anonymous functions and methods which are the same in haxe and closures as well as enums with parameters much like algebraic types that allow the use of functional approaches good type system including generics structural subtyping etc



1327014
converter	multibinding	converter	multibinding
Pattern(s): 1	3	
dependencyproperty.unsetvalue is passed into the converter when a binding is valid but does not have its value set yet



1328221
xslt	xquery
Pattern(s): 1	
xslt is good at document simplification but it s just missing too many basic features to be sufficient on its own



1331704
free	realloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 1	
also don t forget that realloc frees the old buffer for you so you only need to free the last buffer.



1331913
strtod	malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
all of these functions are in the standard library except strtod which is c99-specific so it s in there if you re lucky



1331967
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
it s traditionally had a more complete feature set in terms of acid compliance support for advanced queries etc. than mysql it has solid windows odbc drivers and its documentation scrupulously points out any areas in which it deviates from the sql standard



1331967
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	1	
it s traditionally had a more complete feature set in terms of acid compliance support for advanced queries etc. than mysql it has solid windows odbc drivers and its documentation scrupulously points out any areas in which it deviates from the sql standard
all databases it seems deviate in one respect or another but postgresql is the only one i ve seen that makes sure you know when you re doing so. i haven t tried the usage scenario you describe but i ve had no problems running it on linux and accessing it from both windows odbc and linux clients



1332398
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
Pattern(s): 3	
to that end addslashes does not make your query safe either



1333065
junit	powermockito	junit	mockito
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	3	3	
from version 1.1 powermockito also has basic support for mockito
the test order in junit is intentionally undefined this is not a maven issue and it s probably just luck that your tests were running ok up until now

ncover	partcover	ncover	partcover
Pattern(s): 1	3	
ncover is a commercial product now



1334903
qstring	qmodelindex
Pattern(s): 3	
expanding on troubadour s answer here s a modification of the qsignalmapper documentation to fit your situation in the handler function changed qstring position note that a qstring is a pretty clumsy way to pass this information



1335916
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
i think you need to convince yourself why on a case-by-case basis it is beneficial to use an interface because there is an overhead in adding an interface



1337871
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	0	1	
for performance single table inherited is usually best
from a good database design point of view joined table inherited is better
joined table inherited enables you to have foreign keys to subclassing enforced by the database it s a lot simpler to have non-null constraints for subclassing fields

websphere	ibm
Pattern(s): 1	
and the solution is explained at this link in this case setting the com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokefilterscompatibility value true websphere setting up custom properties for completeness sake i ll put how to correct this problem here -in the administrative console click servers and under servers click application servers -click on the server to which the custom property is to be applied -under configuration and container settings click web container settings and under web container settings click web container -under configuration and additional properties click custom properties -in the custom properties page click new -in the settings page enter the name of the custom property to be added in the name field and the value to be set for the custom property in the value field



1338712
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
postgresql has a richer set of abilities and a better optimizer

that way your script .bat ant maven whatever you want can be run with a simple click on the external tools menu



1340553
titlebar	window	width	height
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	
for my purposes it is probably fine to just stick to one thickness and ignore user theme adjustments



1341082
xom	xerces	xom	xerces	jdom	xom	jdom	xerces	jdom	xerces
Pattern(s): 3	1	
the best lightweight alternative is in my opinion xom but jdom is still a very good api and i see no reason to replace it



1341371
background-repeat	margin
Pattern(s): 3	
secondly the background does not go into margin-area of a box so if you want to have the background only be on the actual contents of a box you can use margin instead of padding



1342576
nsstring	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
Pattern(s): 1	1	
nsdata one is similar
nsdata one is similar



1343117
irc	telnet

sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 2	
this query works if the ordering by which you prioritize the types can be done using sorting either alphabetically or numerically



1346581
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	
this is for all of the reasons that you mention it may be needed now but if not it may be needed in the future



1348076
copying	overwrite
Pattern(s): 2	
this could also be handled by copying the file to the local templates directory instead



1348658
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
however it s worth pointing out that the maven super pom.xml configures central to have snapshots disabled so maven shouldn t ever check for updates for snapshots on central unless you ve overridden that in your own pom.xml settings



1350875
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	1	3	
it is similar to how normal extension can add methods except the subclassing is only coupled by a reference which means that any superclass can be used



1350893
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 2	
in this case the int values you gave will be converted to double



1353844
qmodelindex	qstandarditemmodel
Pattern(s): 2	
you might have missed it but the qmodelindex class has a parent field this helps build up an hierarchic structure



1354863
oncreate	ondestroy
Pattern(s): 2	2	
oncreate will be passed a null bundle when the application is starting
oncreate will be passed a non- null bundle if the application is restarting due to some previous system-required ondestroy such as the default case when the screen is rotated



1355745
pentaho	olap
Pattern(s): 1	
olap is non-relational or rather it s more of an application layer or optimized data structure that can live on a relational database

also if a directory is changed or deleted then you simple change and or delete the responsible function



1359507
firefox	safari	firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 1	
firefox uses the w3c-compliant textcontent property



1360578
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 1	1	3	1	1	
there s a method to updating each of these numbers major number change means that the new versioning is incompatible with the old one and any dependent of the prior versioning will require code changes to upgrade to the new package
minor number change means that the new versioning is backward compatible with the previous versioning but has significant enhancements over the previous versioning



1360662
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 3	
since that representation is very specific to your programming language and how it represents objects in the memory an improvement would be to convert your object into a string representation which has a certain well known structure like xml or json so that you can a transfer it easier b store and restore it easier c since everybody knows how the format is defined any other programs can read your object too so putting you object into a database is just another form of serializable too



1361826
profiling	instrumentation
Pattern(s): 3	3	
the irony is that instrumentation is not required to do profiling coverage analysis as .net has an api for this
for some obscure reason however the visual studio coverage analysis and profiling does not use this api.



1361919
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
Pattern(s): 3	1	
also be aware that isequal isequaltostring comparisons are case-sensitive foo is not equal to foo

unicode	ucs
Pattern(s): 1	
unicode is a standard specified by the unicode consortium



1363485
sharepoint	spsite
Pattern(s): 3	3	
it is almost always better to use dependency injection to provide an spsite or spweb reference for your class to use perhaps through the constructor



1363582
gridview	repeater
Pattern(s): 0	1	
see scott mitchell s why i don t use datasets in my asp.net applications for some details about datareader performance - as long as you aren t optimizing prematurely it s quite good advice. instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater



1363670
wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 3	
i think the wordpress documentation is better too



1364702
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 1	2	
it is ok for the repository to have some logic pertaining to where or how to save the data but it would be best for that to be encapsulated in a common area when possible



1367563
ienumerable	ilist
Pattern(s): 3	
if ienumerable has everything you need then you could be even more generic and use that instead



1368708
agile	sprint
Pattern(s): 2	
technical debt being something that doesn t immediately add business value that is sometimes an important thing to use to prevent some problems as there may be problems with a particular architecture and so part of a sprint may be spent doing a re-arch that has to be communicated so that if there is a sprint with little to demo this is why

postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	1	
postgresql has a uuid type

there are some c string functions available in the standard c library



1371893
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 1	
case differences uppercase versus lowercase are typically ignored if there are any differences in the base or accents. punctuation is variable



1372182
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 2	
consider this class it could be rewritten as if the initializer can throw a checked exception all constructors must declare they can throw it

a 0 is not a memory location containing a memory address it is a memory location containing an int



1373404
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 3	3	
some variant of duff s device if the arrays is sufficiently long and prefix --i not suffix i-- although most compilers will probably correct that automatically.



1373617
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 3	3	
however mysql is much more popular so is more likely to be directly supported by a random application especially web applications



1373943
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	objectoutputstream	objectinputstream

1374694
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	1

1376340
multiplying	add
Pattern(s): 1	2	1	3	1	
in the calculation of zcircular note fft y n which is matlab syntax for padding out the y signal with zeros up to n before calculating the fft
this might be considered inefficient in memory usage but compare the speed linear convolution 4096 multiplying adds of 64 each 262144 multiplying adds circular convolution 2 ffts of 4096 + 1 complex multiplying of 2 4096 elements + 1 inverse fft 3 4096 log2 4096 + 4096 6 172032 assuming 6 operations for the complex multiplying basically the nlogn speed of the fft even when you need three of them beats the n m convolution operation unless m is very short



1376408
post	get
Pattern(s): 3	
data for post is sent separately



1378670
or-operator	and-operator
Pattern(s): 3	3	
there is already an accepted answer but i like to mention that the or-operator is also called default-operator because it doesn t return a boolean but instead the left or right hand argument
same goes for the and-operator which is also called guard-operator



1378820
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 3	1	
perforce is quite heavy weight esp for a small team



1379497
operands	scalar	operands	scalar
Pattern(s): 3	
and || are short-circuit versions for which the second operands is evaluated only when the result is not fully determined by the first operands



1382558
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 1	2	
in simple terms if the submitted hash which is the same as the submitted hash were to leak via any other vulnerability within the application via sql injection for instance then the application has a vulnerability where in it protects the passwords inadequately
if the underlying vulnerability must be fixed then it is necessary to treat the submitted hash as a password in clear text which should then be hashed with a salt preferably before comparison with a stored hash



1382596
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 1	
this is possible w o any wait if you actually split the execution stack up to the for-loop you execute on the calling thread after the for-loop you finish on the last queue thread whether this will work or not depends on many factors and i can t say w o knowing more about the caller context if is possible to suspend its execution on the calling thread and resume it on a queued thread



1384024
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 3	
if you don t want the user to be able to find out what your page is really doing server-side code is probably the only option

Pattern(s): 3	
is a unix shortcut that means the currently logged-in user s home folder which is typically something like



1384699
mako	genshi
Pattern(s): 3	1	
genshi chooses interpretation instead of ahead-of-time python code generation according to their faq that s for clarity of error messages and an arm s length approach to python by using xpath for selectors xinclude instead of inheritance etc so it might be more natural to people who know no python but are very competent with xml

Pattern(s): 3	
boost just says not to store objects which may throw exceptions



1387133
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
it has its own model of prototypes which can be quite confusing but doesn t actually deliver the proper potential of prototype inherited because it s still tied to constructor-functions which look like class constructors but aren t really



1387189
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	
then it processes operators first exponentiation then multiplication and division together and finally addition and subtraction together
because well-formed input is expected as specified in the challenge it doesn t check for the addition operator explicitly since it s the last legal operator after all the others are processed



1387511
median	max
Pattern(s): 2	
this would be called an online median selection algorithm although wikipedia only talks about online min max selection



1388552
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
a controlled upgrade is better than having the application break on you all of a sudden



1391094
short	base	short	base
Pattern(s): 1	
also doing this would break the open closed-principle which in short reads classes should be open for extension but closed for modification



1391566
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 1	
since auto implemented getter takes the same name for the property and the actual private storage variables



1391631
irssi	mirc
Pattern(s): 1	
you re not likely to get a standard cohesive behavior across irc clients...ansi escape codes are processed by more of the old-fare staple unix clients like irssi and mirc sometimes does its own thing



1394287
return-value-optimization	nrvo
Pattern(s): 1	
return-value-optimization is old feature and most compilers supports it



1397627
wxpython	win32gui
Pattern(s): 1	
he s actually working well below wxpython s level of abstraction and in terms of win32gui calls win32con constants plus a finite state-machine clocked by a wx.timer at 100 milliseconds though he does admit that the result from the latter frankenstein surgery is.



1398788
int	double
Pattern(s): 3	
double is just a c# keyword working as alias for the class system.double the most common thing is to use the aliases



1399957
cpu	hyperthreading
Pattern(s): 3	
conversely something that looks like 50 total cpu utilitization on a dual-processor machine is a sign that only one thread is running and so maybe your locking is a problem that s preventing more than one concurrent thread when counting the number of cpus in your machine beware multi-core and hyperthreading



1400026
int	chars
Pattern(s): 1	1	
python s int has the same endianness as the processor it runs on



1400676
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	3	
internet explorer has certain keys that can t be overridden and certain keys which - even when overridden - still executes default behavior--like the f11 key which switches to full-screen mode and the f1 key which opens up a help-window
google-chrome does not allow you to use key-events at all



1401186
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 2	
this is a pretty loose reason to choose this other than the fact that the for-loop implementation can be used both for normal code and codedom generated code



1401765
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
Pattern(s): 2	
unfortunately it doesn t offer a text console interface but the serial port can be connected to a local pipe file and that can probably be worked with just as well



1402777
concave	convex	concave	vertex
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	
if positive this vertex is convex and protects much of the interior
if negative this is a concave vertex that excludes much of the exterior

tostring	string.format
Pattern(s): 1	
string.format is a destructive algorithm which means you can t always go back



1410869

1416090
mef	prism
Pattern(s): 3	3	
as far as prism with mef the challenge at this point is you need to write a bunch of code as prism does not yet have implementations of the services necessary to talk to mef one option is to use the mef unity integration layer we have in mef contrib mefcontrib.codeplex.com



1416152
virtualenv	setuptools
Pattern(s): 3	
at the moment afaik virtualenv is not supported with python 3 because among other things setuptools the magic behind easy_install is not yet supported on python 3 although there is work in progress towards a solution for that

dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 1	
the second dictionary maps a second type to the right comparison function for those two types

ocp	principles
Pattern(s): 3	1	
so indeed the open closed principles refers only to stable ready for compile and use entities



1416636
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 2	
you should convert it to number for example using the unary plus operator you could alternatively use also you are using a for..in loops to iterate over orders if orders is an arrays you should use a normal for-loop that is because the for...in statement is intended to be used for iterate over object properties for arrays it may be tempting to use it because seems to work but it s not recommended since it will iterate over the object properties and if you have extended the array.prototype those properties will be also iterated in addition to the numeric indexes



1417633
xfs	btrfs
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	
xfs does not always do so which can result in much better performance for applications which use short-lived temporary files if you have enough ram



1419094

rubygems	bundler
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	
if you look at the comments you will see the author say this the point i was not trying to make is that rubygems is bad or that people shouldn t use it
i use rubygems and think it s a critical piece of ruby s success i just don t have the line require rubygems anywhere in my library s source code because it s not necessary or convenient and makes it hard impossible for other environments like bundler rip gae debian hand rolled etc to use the library without rubygems which is often important



1436057
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 2	2	
this can readily be done client-side using jquery libraries
but the data must still be validated server-side after the user submits and if there are still problems with the data you must still provide an explanation to the user

a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented



1443181
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	
i recommend you rewrite it like the following it is not a nice idea to expect the superclass to know the parameter to be used in the init of its subclassing since it is really hard to ensure that all the constructor will be the same maybe the animal dialog window takes diff parameters

quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42
exact numbers can be seen in comparison with existing parsers section



1450998
rational-numbers	fractions	rational-numbers	zero	int	double
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	3	
the reason for the exception is that an int does not hold rational-numbers basically fractions
so trying to parse 0.3 to a int is nonsense. a double or a float datatype can hold rational-numbers



1451846

common lisp although does not have native continuations allows to create delimited continuations using cps transformers like cl-cont



1452840

division	subtract	division	subtraction
Pattern(s): 2	
this allows greater flexibility in the timing of the application of each digit to the operation like for instance deferring the application of the secondary digits of the divisor a x 1 until after a partial quotient is created from the prior step s division by a 1 which in turn allows them to be applied as a product subtraction rather than a division operation

1471660
hash	md5	hash	salt

md5 is a bad hash to use for passwords it s fast which means if you have a target hash it s cheap to try lots of passwords and see whether you can find one which hash to that target



1471668
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 3	
reversing md5 is actually considered malicious - a few websites offer the ability to crack and bruteforce md5 hashes - but all they are are massive databases containing dictionary words previously submitted passwords and other words

webclient	httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	
the webclient is a very dumbed down wrapper for httpwebrequest
webclient is great if you just doing very simple consumption of services or posting a bit of xml but the tradeoff is that it s not as flexible as you might want it to be



1474861
webclient	webrequest

inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	
even though you have overloaded equals with a more specific overload enumerable.contains ends up calling because the classes properties is really backed by a

that does not mean the imperative approach is useless



1480534
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 1	
this can actually be superior because stl implementation is free to optimize based on some inner knowledge - for example in msvc std vector knows that it can use swap instead of copy constructor for std tr1 shared_ptr and does just that avoiding constant refcount changes

inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	
an abstract class is only to be subclassing inherited from

1595743
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	2	0	
this can be achieved using inherited along with the template method pattern calling abstract or virtual methods in a base class which are overridden in subclassing to achieve the desired new behavior but it s more often demonstrated using composition using the strategy pattern encapsulating the variant behavior in class and passing it to the closed type to be used in determining the overall behavior achieved
from your example it appears you were thinking more along the lines of trying to achieving ocp through inherited but starting with a base report formatter to establish the interface with subtypes to indicate different types of formats for a given report is actually a good start toward showing ocp through composition

innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 1	1	
innodb supports fk s supports transactions uses a large memory buffer for operation supports row level locking but has a much higher maintenance cost -- you really need to tune your memory usage configure your table files etc
myisam has a bunch of special column features that innodb doesn t like full text indexes spatial columns i m pretty sure this doesn t work with innodb very fast for primary read append use cases table locks for updates deletes but not for inserts also typically has faster inserts caches indexes in memory key buffer but relies on the os to buffer the actual data pages for example i d use innodb for things like ecommerce user databases or anything that i want to use transactions in

in practice no cpu manufacturer makes more than 4 pipelines in a single core



1656728
cpu	processors	cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 1	
a core2 cpu is capable of running the same code that was compiled for a 486 while still taking advantage of instruction level parallelism because it contains its own internal logic that analyzes machine code and determines how to reorder and run it what can be run in parallel what can t etc. this is the essence of superscalar design and why it s so practical

arp	tcp	arp	tcp
Pattern(s): 1	0	
if the arp reply takes a long time or is itself lost you might be getting a retransmission even though the device waiting for the arp reply is queuing the packet
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time



1716751
arp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	3	
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time
this implies that reuse of the arp is not causing it to stay refreshed which is possible behaviour that would be helpful in your situation



1719024
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 1	1	
we solve this for nhibernate by overriding 2 methods of the object class. gethashcode and equals gethashcode basically returns a unique hashcode based on an object s state. equals compares two objects for equality like this basically gethashcode concatenates the object type and the name of the tag as a string ie app.domain.tag|nameoftag and generates a hashcode for that string equals then compares the gethashcode result for the first object with the gethashcode result for the second object to test for equality

1728892
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 2	
at this hash size the weaknesses in md5 are pretty irrelevant since the best known attacks on md5 take roughly 2 32 computations while one can generate a collision in even an ideally secure 32-bit hash in around 2 16 computations since by merely choosing random inputs you have 1 in 2 16 chance of a collision so after roughly 2 16 random guesses you ll probably have found a colliding pair of inputs



1729074
passenger	thin

a side note after time has passed using hardened hash is far better than using a plain speed-based hashing function



1756971
button	checkbox	button	checkbox	onclick	onchange
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	1	
one comment of balusc might confirm my assumption in case of radios checkbox the change event is in certain browsers only fired if you click 2 times
try use another event like onclick from tldoc of selectbooleancheckbox onchange is javascript code executed when this element loses focus and its value has been modified since gaining focus. and onclick is javascript code executed when a pointer button is clicked over this element. yesterday was a similar question

gentoo	ubuntu
Pattern(s): 2	3	1	1	
be warned gentoo is not a drop dead simple distro to use ubuntu -- you have to understand a bit about how the os works -- but it does provide an excellent developerment environment
as nick stinemates mentioned gentoo is an excellent distro for developing java



1767044
ilist	icollection
Pattern(s): 1	
what is slightly inconsistent is that the generic ilist t interface has an isreadonly property inherited from icollection t whose semantics are therefore different from the non-generic ilist.isreadonly



1767222

1768086
inherited	properties	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 0	
a static method cannot rely on context can t rely on a specific instance of a class can t rely on the this keyword therefore this would not be a static method this would be an example of a static method but there s absolutely no sense in making getname static because as the name implies it must rely on an object instance to determine what the name properties is you should have more generic helper functions like parsing functions such as date.parse as static methods and define instance methods in the prototype as they re more efficient than defining in the constructor



1768520

hash	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 3	1	
government applications will be required to move to the sha-2 family of hash functions by 2010. 8 i think one major problem with it is that there are rainbow tables of md5 hashes all over these days so bare md5 is very susceptible to brute forcing



1779580
operands	decrement	operands	decrement

1782787
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
Pattern(s): 1	1	
quoting note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

in your case you don t want to do exactly the same thing to each element - and thus a foreach loops is not the right tool for the job



1783640
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 1	1	
therefore you could access through reflection like this since class inherited is different than interface compliance it seems logical to access them differently



1784556
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 3	1	
however i just want to let you know that calling html.renderpartial inside a loops is not efficient



1785126

a loop isn t really appropriate here because the settimeout function is asynchronous



1793698
textblock	itemscontrol	textblock	itemscontrol
Pattern(s): 3	1	
first of all i don t think the datainput label control is needed here a simple textblock with a binding on its text property would work just as well without the extra baggage



1794378
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 1	
instead of you could write personally i think a getproperty is a poor candidate for throwing exception-handling just for all this extra boilerplate required

superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
also parameterised constructor of superclass is not inherited by subclassing



1799165
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 2	2	
you do have to be careful because if foo was say an integer integer division would be performed and then the result would be stored in halffoo
wherever you intend for them to be used as floating-point values



1799202
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 2	
data can be lost when floating-point representations are converted to integral representations as the fractions components of the floating-point values will be truncated rounded down



1799830
std	ostream	std	ostream
Pattern(s): 3	3	
use std count to count the number of elements which is equal to some value or std count_if to count the elements which satisfies some predicate if you just want to copy the contents of a container to an ostream object like std cout use std copy instead if you need the return value from each invocation of the function use std transform std transform is also overloaded so it works for binary functions as well as unary functions

1811677
inline	inlining	inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 1	0	
be aware though that this should only be on a release build since inline code is difficult to debug
also you said that you don t mind making your program larger as long as it gets faster but that often inlining makes it slower

logarithm	modulo
Pattern(s): 1	
output 6 16 26 36 46 obviously this will take a long time if the modulo is large



1812932

Pattern(s): 1	
the potential danger exists even if your chars array has sufficient length to cover the entire int



1817840
super	self
Pattern(s): 2	
in python3 the 0-argument form of super was added so super b cls could be replaced by super and python3 will figure out from context that super in the definition of class b should be equivalent to super b cls



1819248
int	double
Pattern(s): 2	
now change your program to assign that value and print the result thats the max value an unsigned int can hold shown in base 10 representation



1819602
min	max
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are estimating for a specific developer and you know your estimates are generally accurate for that developer then the min value is the logical deadline initially



1822328
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 1	
edit to make some points a bit more explicit a typical cpu has a number of different caches



1823380
glut	sdl

doing some opengl with glut is a good place to start in my opinion as it allows you to do both 2d and 3d graphics



1826126
temporary	tablespace
Pattern(s): 3	
afterwards drop the second temporary table created. 3 for oracle 9i and higher you could just drop the tempfile s and add a new one s everything is described here in great detail

run the -d option means that the request will be made with post



1829364
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 1	3	3	1	
indeed for lazy languages this simplistic approach can even get you the best complexity possible for the k smallest greatest sorted with maximum minimum as a special case if your sort is lazy enough
quicksort works well in this scenario whereas the default sort in haskell merge sort doesn t compose quite as well as it does more work than strictly necessary to return each element of the sorted list
as this post on the haskell mailing list notes lazy quicksort is able to produce the batch of the first k smallest elements in o n + k log k total time 1 while lazy mergesort needs o n + k log n total time 2 for more you might like to read this blog post



1831872
subobject	instances
Pattern(s): 2	
upcasting to base2 modifies the pointer so that it points to the memory location that can be directly be interpreted as a base2 instances so the contents of a pointer memory location of type base2 pointing to an object of type derived will not coincide with a pointer of type derived into the same object



1834444
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 2	
this means that in cases where you want 2 objects to be considered equals they are more likely to have different hash codes which is incorrect



1837668
internationalization	translation
Pattern(s): 2	
a handy tool is the inline translater - this can be turned on via system - configuration - developer - translation inline

inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	0	1	
it s one of the reasons that old-style classes should be avoided multiple inherited with diamond-like patterns just doesn t work sensibly with them while it does with new-style
the crucial difference between resolution order for legacy vs new-style classes comes when the same ancestor class occurs more than once in the naive depth-first approach -- consider a diamond inherited case here legacy-style the resolution order is d - b - a - c - a so when looking up d.x a is the first base in resolution order to solve it thereby hiding the definition in c

hex is easy



1853219
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 1	0	3	
because some critical applications will require guarantees of speed performance heapsort is the right way to go for such cases
one of the major factors is that quicksort has better locality of reference -- the next thing to be accessed is usually close in memory to the thing you just looked at
by contrast heapsort jumps around significantly more



1853219
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 3	2	
by contrast heapsort jumps around significantly more
since things that are close together will likely be cached together quicksort tends to be faster

turing	decidable
Pattern(s): 3	
wikipedia defines them as follows a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set also called a decidable recursive or turing computable set if there is a turing machine that given a number n halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set

1855250
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	3	
using chars for int is really only useful when you have a lot of numbers a large array and you need to conserve space



1855254
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	
this is why c defines types and operations as it does - the size of int is not mandated by the standard allowing compiler authors to make it correspond to a machine word and expression evaluation is defined to promote smaller int types to int greatly reducing the number of points at which results must be coerced to some target type



1856450
nginx	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 1	
so what you have to do instead is use a server module such as for lighttpd which implements the upload_progress view for you on the server



1856558
expression-blend	silverlight
Pattern(s): 1	1	
as silverlight is kind of platform independent and as it s model is similar to wpf i predict wpf is going to rule at least for next 6 7 years if not a decade



1857438
accurev	svn
Pattern(s): 2	
it integrates svn with bugzilla and imposes rules such as in order to commit you have to enter a message in order to commit you must have entered a bugzilla id that is in a valid commit state. .



1857438
perforce	accurev
Pattern(s): 1	
ah yes if you do use it i hope that you do not have to replicate your server between some place in the us and some place in india perforce is more robust but it is not very easy to administer

the sound advice is never call code that could throw an exception-handling in cleanup code such as destructors and any function that might be called from a destructor such as cleanup close or release_something



1859033
virtualenv	setuptools
Pattern(s): 2	
setuptools distutils distros can include scripts that will be installed to usr bin so that s how you can include your runapp script

Pattern(s): 2	3	2	
there is a finite amount of numbers that can be stored in a double variable and 33222221 is not one of them
when you attach a debugger and inspect the values you will see that the value of d is actually 33222220.999999996 which is correctly truncated to 33222220 when converted to int
there is a finite amount of numbers that can be stored in a double variable and 33222221 is not one of them

short	base
Pattern(s): 1	
my calculator says that b is about equal to -0.0021202920156806272577911119053782 or perhaps -0.0021 would work best in short

1863484
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
you can verify this by throwing an exception in printart derivedarg while calling it on a reference of type base and examining the stack trace as for finding this in the java language specification i first missed it as well as it is not as one might expect specified where overriding or the subsignature relation is discussed but in members and constructors of parameterized types 4.5.2 which reveals that formal type parameters of the superclass are syntactically replaced by the actual type parameter in the subclassing prior to checking for override equivalence



1864012
textmate	bbedit

beware that an else in a for-loop is tricky



1866710

then you use bijective bit operations then when you output your list you iterate x from 0 to m-1 and output l p x only if p x is actually n



1866788
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 0	1	1	
renaming a file in the fat filesystems can also change the file id but only if the new file name is longer than the old one
in the ntfs filesystems a file keeps the same file id until it is deleted . you can replace one file with another file without changing the file id by using the replacefile function. however the file id of the replacement file not the replaced file is retained as the file id of the resulting file



1870093
datamapper	activerecord

it s often difficult to promise that the math does not exist for a fast algorithm but in this case i don t think that there is any known formula



1876763
put	get
Pattern(s): 2	
some are even incapable of performing operations sometimes even load operations on unsuitably-aligned data - in order to work on such data it has to be loaded into two registers and then a series of bit shifts and masks need to be performed to get a usable value and then it needs to be put back



1877652
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	
chars is just silly
int is a good start but 64- or 128-bit reads would probably perform far better still



1877889
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 3	1	
mysql is the only major system which lacks a way to generate it
postgresql implements a special function generate_series to do that while oracle and sql server can use recursion connect by and recursive cte s accordingly



1878053
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
it sounds a little weird to display such a long tree on one page but in fact with collapse expand it s much more intuitive than separate pages and since we re offline download times are not a problem parsing times are though but google-chrome is amazing



1879220
free	malloc

1883586
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 1	
as ubuntu uses the same settings for their build of the package you should really bet set libgl1-mesa-dev | libgl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev | libglu-dev libpng12-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev x11proto-core-dev the | means alternative so you can use the mesa-based packages or ones matching your graphics card like the various nvidia- packages



1884693
prepare	pdostatement
Pattern(s): 1	3	2	
the cost of creating a pdostatement with prepare is low anyway
what you may want cached are the results returned from the same sql query either raw or built by prepare and this is a feature of your dbms mysql for instance not php

ensure jquery is loaded before the other scripts and add jquery.noconflict



1887931
zoo	xts	zoo	xts
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point
because these rolling functions often apply with time-series data some of the newer and richer time-series data-handling packages already do that for you the zoo has excellent documentation that will show you many many more examples in particular how to do this with real and possibly irregular dates
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point

or could have been protected and non-virtual in this example since base was not used



1892394
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 2	
the standard functions filtering map and reduce are used for various operations on a list and all of the three functions expect two arguments a function and a list we could define a separate function and use it as an argument to filtering etc. and its probably a good idea if that function is used several times or if the function is too complex to be written in a single line

1894845
jar	war	jar	war
Pattern(s): 2	1	1	
persistent units can be packaged as part of a war or ejb jar file or can be packaged as a jar file that can then be included in an war or ear file
if you package the persistent unit as a set of classes in an ejb jar file persistence.xml should be put in the ejb jar s meta-inf directory
if you package the persistence unit as a set of classes in a war file persistence.xml should be located in the war file s web-inf classes meta-inf directory



1896729
multiplying	division

and note that the number you will return will not really have only two decimal places because division by 100 cannot be represented exactly in ieee-754 floating-point arithmetic most of the time



1896962
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
standard way is but you ll find these functions can simplify things a lot usage in a stackoverflow greasemonkey script to show all questions on page regardless if they re ignored or not don t worry if the for-loop looks weird in that it skips every other element

postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	0	
in this context mysql databases are analogous in function to postgres-schemas insomuch as postgresql lacks off-the-shelf cross-database functionality that mysql has
conversely postgresql has applied more of the specification implementing cross-table cross-schema and then left room for future cross-database functionality

here s an implementation of a priorityqueue that could be adapted to your needs



1936096
profiling	debugging	xdebug	runkit
Pattern(s): 3	3	
counter-retort 2 unfortunately most standard php functions don t use exceptions for reporting errors which makes structured exception handling much less useful finally made it in php 5.5 operator overloading retort in php you can use runkit extension to emulate the same feature counter-retort in php you have to use runkit extension to emulate the same feature swig integration threading retort python have global interpreter lock so it s not really parallel with .

youre assuming it works just like if you submit a form to a plain php page then that page renders to the browser



1938431
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 2	
excerpt the inherited value can be used to strengthen inherited values and it can also be used on properties that are not normally inherited



1938519
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 0	1	
tracking state is a higher level function -- that is left to the server or client separately
stateful http is impossible because it isn t really http anymore it s something totally different



1938844
verilog	vhdl
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	3	1	
learning verilog is very far from high-level languages
the syntax has been inspired by c yes but designing electronics be it using vhdl or verilog is very different from writing software



1940388
post	get	post	get
Pattern(s): 3	3	
it s when you use redirect that it causes a response to be sent to the browser causing it to make a get request which is where it loses the request attributes for the original request because the get is an entirely new request

it looks like the pg boolean type uses string literal notation



1943256
short	base
Pattern(s): 1	
many have found it easier to use a much slower add-on templating engine like smarty but for those purists among us who demand fast rendering and a pure code base php is the only way to write templates

hash	md5
Pattern(s): 3	
the hash function is not exposed



1945822
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear

1946968
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 1	
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate



1947902
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
Pattern(s): 3	0	
opera is even worse when you press shift the keypress gets translated into p so you can t type capitals



1948272
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	
it is definitely typing in which an object s current set of methods and properties determines the valid semantics rather than its inheritance from a particular class or implementation of a specific interface



1948470
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 3	3	
md5 is pretty widely available



1950028
integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 1	
an integer specifies the maximum number of lines



1951182
webrat	cucumber
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	
the sequence of events is roughly cucumber runs your feature when the i am on the home page step is reached it invokes webrat to make the request to the controller webrat constructs a request and sends it to the controller step fails because the request does not have an accept-language header apparently webrat does not add this header when it builds the request
so to make this work add a step that puts in the header run this step before you visit a page and webrat is no longer confused



1951706
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
Pattern(s): 3	1	
for instance the g1 is a mdpi class device 160dpi but its screens density is actually around 180dpi
the droid is a hdpi class device 240dpi but its screens is 265dpi



1951887
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	3	
serialization deserialization this sort of serialization does not really fit into a get set property so you will most likely want to override the saveviewstate and loadviewstate methods of your user control page and add the serialization deserialization logic within these

uploadify is also another great multiple file uploader



1953893
ant	maven	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 3	
and that structure tends to reflect back a bit to the source layout as well. here is a page that details project structures for java projects in general they don t agree very much with what i wrote above and for j2ee projects in particular maven projects maven is a very versatile project build tool



1955275
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 2	
very good resources including examples to help you set this up correctly can be found in the official django docs how to use django with apache and mod_wsgi and the mod_wsgi docs integration with django the second snippet with addhandler line is for fcgi



1955655
srp	ocp
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	
the srp is also very helpful here because it means that if a class does only one thing and that thing becomes obsolete it doesn t drag along a lot of other problems



1955764
freebsd	linux
Pattern(s): 0	
for example freebsd is tier 2 platform for ghc that means ghc may release new versions even if it cannot run on freebsd

more complex case when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly



1962025
int	chars
Pattern(s): 2	
can you explain why we are allowed to assign x int problem3 in the above code because problem3 is a function pointer the memory address of a function and all pointers can be cast to int



1964836
allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 3	
if you re making a video game and you know that your stl implementation does not have this problem then don t worry about this -- however there might still be some issues with list splice and std swap on containers

3ds	lighting
Pattern(s): 2	
i cache whole geometry into separate normal and vertex array indexed drawing cannot be used because i want flat shading similar problem to smoothing groups in 3ds max



1966926
int	double	range	max

if the range is not 0.0 s 1.0 but 0.0 s max then either way there is no quantisation function other than one you might write yourself



1967394
woodstock	trinidad
Pattern(s): 1	
also note that woodstock is buggy and already dead since a year or two



1967867
rss	feed

1980712
activemq	rabbitmq
Pattern(s): 3	3	
not all the messaging systems can support very large queue sizes - though activemq does not all the messaging systems survive a hard broker stop without loosing messages activemq will - without you having to use transactions
and if you are going to use open source - always look at the community - activemq is the most active community of any open source message vendor - and it s also apache - which means diversity and no reliance on any single developer or vendor for delivery



1982432
datamodel	relational-model
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	
conceptual datamodel is really requirements analysis from a data centric point of view
logical datamodel is generally the application of a specific datamodel to the requirements discovered in conceptual datamodel
relational-model is used far more than any other specific model and developers need to learn relational-model for sure



1982432
datamodel	relational-model
Pattern(s): 3	1	
physical datamodel is generally dbms specific and doesn t need to be learned in much detail unless the developer is also the database builder or the dba



1982994
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 3	
also if you re debugging in a vm vmware has extensions to record a vm s execution for debugging as well

the deviceiocontrol method with the ioctl_disk_get_drive_layout_ex control code can be used to get this information



1984931
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 1	1	
since the folder is the same on the emulator you can use that to get the folder path
eg cd data data com.yourapp this will drop you into a directory that is read writable so you can change files as needed

komodo edit there is a plugin called komode pun intended which adds modeline support to komodo edit it also understands a limited subset of vim modelines



1986457
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
it definitely leads to odd situations such as multiple catch statements that have the same logic as you would expect when things are distinguished by type but that is a limitation of the language



1986486
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 2	
they can be paged to disk or in the standby page list no longer in use but not paged yet either



1987651
accurev	cvs
Pattern(s): 0	
for my two cents accurev is the better product



1987845
haskell	scheme
Pattern(s): 2	1	
in haskell and ml the closure stores the values of the free variables. an anonymous function is a more general concept and need not be restricted to a simple binding and body
for example in smalltalk a block represents an anonymous function but the body of a block is a sequence of statements so it is definitely not the same as a lambda expression



1989291
datamapper	activerecord	datamapper	activerecord
Pattern(s): 3	
fowler himself says activerecord is mainly to be used ...for domain logic that isn t too complex...if your business logic is complex you ll soon want to use your object s direct relationships collections inheritance and so forth. these don t map easily onto activerecord

Pattern(s): 1	
the strdup is necessary as tmpname is modified by mkstemp



1995147
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
Pattern(s): 2	3	3	3	3	
a sqlconnection should really be treated as a unit of work - you create it when needed and dispose of it when finished
a sqldatareader is not even a unit of work - it is a throwaway object for which there is absolutely no reason to keep at a global level



1995378
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 3	
git will checkout say foobar and then checkout foobar which the filesystems sees as simply replacing the contents of foobar but leaving it in place



1995555
salt	md5
Pattern(s): 3	
the most secure would be to use a cryptographically secure random number generator to produce a salt which is then stored along side the password



1995555
hash	md5	hash	salt	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 1	
if you created a salt which was an md5 of the password then it would have to stored alongside the hashed and salt password value which means you have an unsalted hash which is vulnerable to precomputed lookup tables unless you plan to calculate it every time which is a small performance hit



1996082
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave
Pattern(s): 1	
mouseout is the wrong event - it is triggered when you hover over a child element



1997606
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	0	
to distinguish between float s and int s is trickier



1999558
ant	maven

here s just an idea ant is really not such a bad tool



1999901
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
that comes from their definitions in mathematics a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles a square is a polygon with four equal sides and angles at design level there is a generalization relationship between the square and the rectangle



1999956
entity-relationship	entities
Pattern(s): 1	2	
the entity-relationship model is useful for conceptualizing a schema and understanding the requirements but it should not be confused with a database design

you could however expose a class in your project to com and have it called from a vba add-in that is called back from the application.onkey event



2001853
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	2	
to explain a bit further you can only cast up the inherited tree which is to say an object can only be cast as the class type it was created as any of its superclass or any interface that it implements
thus a string can be cast as either a string or an object



2002223
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
Pattern(s): 2	
it could be that it is adding extra data to the file so it can be deserialized with objectinputstream



2004857
gcj	javac
Pattern(s): 3	
this message is your clue gcj has been detected as the current java virtual machine. that means your system java is still the gcj version not the sun version

i m sure vim has similar capabilities



2005404
url.action	actionlink
Pattern(s): 1	
there is an overload of url.action that takes your desired protocol http https as an argument - if you specify this you get a fully qualified url



2007641
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 3	
this allows the order of name bindings in the class body to be preserved and used while the normal dictionary loses order which is sometimes nice when the class must have fields in a certain specific order to map 1 1 onto a c struct a row in a csv file or db table and the like -- in python 2



2008529
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 3	
this will tell you when the properties is actually been accessed or set

2012224
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
and also the extends clause must not appear in the definition of the class object because it is the primordial class and has no direct superclass



2014525
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 1	
safari has partial support for css3 depending on version but i suspect that this is the cause of your undesired behavior



2014955
set	bag
Pattern(s): 1	3	
a map persists idictionary is an unordered collection that is indexed with uniques keys of a given type
a set persists iset from iesi.collections probably will use the iset that comes with the version 4 of the framework is an unordered collection that does not allow duplicates

super	self
Pattern(s): 1	
also in the case of multiple inheritance using super ensures that all the right constructors are called in the right order



2018943
jar	manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 1	
an executable jar has a main class defined in the jar s manifest.mf file and the manifest also allows the definition of a class path to include libraries that the code in the executable jar will need



2018943
jar	manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 1	
and last but not least the final jar s manifest.mf file tells one-jar what your main class is



2018945
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
Pattern(s): 2	3	3	3	
test code has it s uses and it is possible you may have identified a corner case where nsoperationqueue does not do the most efficient thing but that doesn t mean that nsoperationqueue is always horribly inefficient when dealing with real code in real life



2020115
qobject	qwidget	qobject	qwidget
Pattern(s): 1	1	
since qwidget is a subclass of qobject tr is available in methods of qwidget but in main you have to use qobject tr in order to use the function as shown below

for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inline and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function



2021333
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
each class had a single integer field with a name corresponding to its letter - so for example class adtestg has a single int field g in addition to the b field it inherited from its immediate parent adtestb and the pkey and a fields from the top-level abstract superclass



2021629
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 1	
the only other tip is that google-chrome uses all of the special webkit css properties curved borders drop shadows etc so make use of them if and when you can

i don t really think malloc 0 has much use except in cases when malloc n is called in a loop for example and n might be zero



2023448
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 3	
udp also uses ip so udp is technically udp ip



2023499
tinyint	boolean
Pattern(s): 1	
using tinyint is more standard practice and will allow you to more easily check the value of the field



2024372
queue	fifo
Pattern(s): 3	
the former means copying out the memory to the stack of the main-loop on pop which might be slower -- however provided your fifo has enough memory you should not have to allocate slist nodes from a heap -- which means no memory management headaches



2024421
uiview	calayer	uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 1	
i think what you want to do here is to have a very single simple uiview that covers the entire play area

all that s required is the appropriate xml to set up the logging in the config file and in your assemblyinfo.cs and it should work easily



2027842
range	max	range	infinity
Pattern(s): 3	
it s usually more convenient to accept that addition is o 1 because the numbers are fixed-size but ignore that gcd is also o 1 pretend that its behaviour in the range 1 2 32 extends to infinity and analyse it on that basis



2028368

2028844
agile	sprint	next	except
Pattern(s): 3	
no one likes to use the words fixed or signed-off to describe how a sprint works because it sounds too old school waterfall but agreement on sprint content such as a set of of user stories from the product backlog is essentially the same thing for each sprint just done more often than in non-agile projects



2030419
inherited	subclassing

another way of looking at the problems is illustrated with the following code and the extremely fussy compiler settings shown above this fails to compile because of the -werror setting with the message remove the -werror setting and it compiles but then shows the next problem that you have - the one of not checking for error indications from functions that can fail direct operations integer value 2249459722 integer value 0x8614080a dotted decimal 10.8.20.134 indirect operations conversion failed for 2249459722 basically the sscanf function reports that it failed to convert the string to a signed integer because the value is too large to fit - see the warning from gcc 4.4.2 but your code was not checking for the error return from sscanf so you were using whatever value happened to be left in c at the time



2032794
int	double
Pattern(s): 3	
int is not one of those types one definition of mean ought to cover all of and but without the rational bits and without the type annotation the type inferred for mean is because of the division by the length of the list



2034801
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
yes if you leave it blank it ll use the superclass default constructor which in the case of an array is actually a constructor with a default value set array numelements int 0 so by default you ll be creating an array with zero elements which i guess is probably what you want anyway



2037048
fileinputstream	filechannel	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	fileoutputstream	filechannel
Pattern(s): 2	2	2	
such methods may be added in a future release
in this release a file channel can be obtained from an existing fileinputstream fileoutputstream or randomaccessfile object by invoking that object s getchannel method which returns a file channel that is connected to the same underlying file



2038204
ienumerable	ienumerator
Pattern(s): 1	3	3	
foreach operates on ienumerable which requires a new ienumerator class to be instantiated
array types are special types recognized by the compiler so if the compiler already knows that the ienumerable is actually an array then it compiles down to indexed access instead which is much cheaper



2038541
typedef	typename
Pattern(s): 3	
if you know in advance that t is never a reference to avoid the reference-to-reference problem you can also do this directly if what you wanted to do is to create a reference data member your syntax without typedef was correct i do not know what you want to do exactly

Pattern(s): 2	
since this will get called a lot you will need to make it as efficient as possible ideally only writing changed data to persistent storage



2044021
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 2	
edit to illustrate this if the int variables are signed should compile into something along these lines mov data eax imul ecx eax cvtsi2sd eax xmm1 addsd xmm1 xmm0 on the other hand if the int variables are unsigned cvtsi2sd can t be used to do the conversion so a software workaround is required



2044282
int	double
Pattern(s): 1	1	
converting int to float can lose precision if the int value is large in absolute value
it is less likely to with double since double is more precise and can represent many more exact numbers

x86	64bit	x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	
historically x86 has been very backward compatible
x86-64 has thrown away some very old instructions like bcd instructions but it s unlikely that these kind of changes are going to happen again at least not until something huge as 64bit address space transition happens



2045870
int	double
Pattern(s): 3	1	
assuming also 64 bit ieee double it is not possible for an int- double conversion to be imprecise because all int values can be exactly represented as a double

jquery argues that the src value is not equal to foo.jpg when you pass it in as part of the selector but it is equal to the string literal when you compare from a call to attr

the only portable thing you can do is to set each pointer to null in a loop your primary problem is that your realloc call is wrong
so you should do if you really want to know what the memset call should be you need to set to zero the memory starting at colors+colorcount and set i+1-colorcount members to zero but as i said above all bytes zero is not guaranteed to be a null pointer so your memset is useless anyway

gtk	xlib	gtk	vte	vte	xlib
Pattern(s): 3	
an implementation that might be easier to read is vte terminal which gnome uses since it ll be mapping between vt100 and glib gtk which is probably a lot closer to what mac os x provides

int	chars
Pattern(s): 1	3	
int is an ordinal type not a class

inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	
illustrating the differences note that when defining sub1 and sub2 no metaclass functions were called. they will be created exactly as if c1 and c2 had no metaclasses but instead had been manipulated after creation



2150336
inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
certain use cases might need your classes to be of type type or might want to avoid the inherited issues in which case a metaclass function is probably the way to go



2151786
appkit	nsimage
Pattern(s): 1	1	
in general core graphics and uikit use flipped co-ordinates origin upper-left positive y going down whereas appkit uses unflipped co-ordinates origin lower-left positive y going up
but it is possible to flip or unflip co-ordinates from each api and some classes such as nsimage and nsview make it very easy to do so



2152230
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
remember udp is datagram oriented all operations are on those packets not on bytes.

2162881
free	malloc	free	calloc
Pattern(s): 1	
the c++ declaration is roughly equivalent to the c declaration but in c++ you can do this and in c this is illegal unless you have a c99 compliant compiler -std c99 in gcc you can t have arrays with variable numbers of elements in c so you have to resort to calloc or malloc and do your own memory management like this in this case i m assuming that you re going to unfold your array of arrays into a single long c array of integers large enough to hold the answer so you can reduce the number of bits of memory you have to manage



2164697
feof	fread
Pattern(s): 3	3	
you should never use feof it is almost always the wrong thing to do



2167003
subclass	abstract-class
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	1	
and i think that there is a good reason for this too if your method in the subclass is merely an implementation of an abstract method then i think it would be correct to leave the abstract-class name in there
on the flip side if your method in the subclass is not just a simple implementation and does something more that is noteworthy enough to be mentioned in the javadoc then you should write a new javadoc on the method in the subclass instead of invoking inheritdoc

they could even get stuck in a state where it is nearly impossible to swipe between screens because of the widgets covering the touchable area



2170452
sorting	grouping

Pattern(s): 1	3	
the gridview is for tabular data only and does a lot of the work for you like binding data automatically to columns



2171878
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
having a common superclass makes it slightly easier because you can have the new object add its own class to a global class collection if not already present in the superclass constructor but unfortunately this will not work for abstract-class because no instances are ever created

signtool - the sign tool is a command-line tool that digitally signs files verifies signatures in files or time stamps files



2177226
post	get
Pattern(s): 1	3	
of course that s probably not the only way you could do it and it is somewhat a compromise now querying for a single post is fast - you only do one operation and get everything back but you have no way of maintaining the relationship between authors and posts since it all becomes part of the post document



2178101
int	chars	int	double	nsinteger	double
Pattern(s): 2	
it is possible to create a nsnumber object from a signed or unsigned chars short int int long int long long int float double or bool. among the two nsnumber can only be used in collections such as nsarray where an object is required but nsinteger cannot be used there directly

in my experience svcutil.exe is quite picky about its xml structures - so don t be surprised if it barks at you with tons of warnings and or errors



2191720
nssortdescriptor	nspredicate
Pattern(s): 3	
some filtering with nspredicate is required too i have no idea if this is the most efficient method but until you have reason to believe that it is causing problems there s no need to worry the performance implications



2192386
int	chars
Pattern(s): 1	
that explains as you have discovered yourself that using an unsigned int or int works as there was sufficient room to hold the values on input



2193351
int	double
Pattern(s): 1	
d means decimal int



2195221
trie	tree
Pattern(s): 1	
in that respect a trie is similar to the tree you already have and a hash map will probably be better-behaved than a naively-allocated tree



2196796
width	height
Pattern(s): 3	
according to the css1 specification released by the world wide web consortium w3c in 1996 and revised in 1999 when a width or height is explicitly specified for any block-level element it should determine only the width or height of the visible element with the padding borders and margins applied afterward

wadl web application description language wadl is a standard to describe http-based web applications typically rest web services
so wadl can be seen as a rest equivalent of wsdl 1.1



2219057
idictionary	icollection
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	
edit hmm idictionary does not implement icollection which is a bit of a pain
my advice is to change the code to use dictionary instead of idictionary since idictionary is not readonly so you are not hiding all that much by using that instead of concreate dictionary



2221014
inherited	properties

2221699
width	height
Pattern(s): 3	
on the first pass the jeditorpane computes its preferred height based on the assumption that its width will be unlimited so it returns the height of a single line since the text contains no line breaks. on the second pass the width has already been set constrained by the size of the first jpopupmenu and now that it knows the maximum width it can compute how tall it needs to be

2225081
getattr	subclassing	getattr	setattr	setattr	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	1	
for example if you have a class that overloads the bracket operators with getattr and setattr but uses some funny internal scheme it would be appropriate for it to behave as a dictionary if that s what it s trying to emulate
the other problem with the type a is type b checking is that if a is a subclassing of b it evaluates to false when programmatically you would hope it would be true



2225803

i believe fcntl is posix compliant so should work on windows too



2228761
fiddler	charles
Pattern(s): 1	
the flex app behaves like it couldn t access the server side which is probably because the response from fiddler is signed with a self-signed certificate which flash player correctly recognizes as different than the target site certificate but still the http request has been sent already and is visible via fiddler

the bool type is just a small int type which causes the error message you are seeing because the compiler needs a pointer for the second argument to performselectoronmainthread withobject waituntildone



2232891
inherited	base-class
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	3	
also you need to make sure your inherited hierarchy is flat rather than multi-layers which is generally good anyway because inherited is fragile enough without piling on the layers



2233128

i suggest you read up upon the stack vs the heap value-type vs reference-type since it s a very fundamental subject when programming



2233896
datamapper	activerecord
Pattern(s): 3	3	
the datamapper pattern is not very popular in the php world in favour of activerecord and certainly much of that favour is attributed to the fawning of ruby on rails in the php framework community although there exists one notable project -- and it looks promising

you can instantiate the object only when needed when the getter is first called



2253157
uiview	subviews	uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 2	
if it makes more sense to put the behavior into the buttons themselves they shoudl be uiresponders and as such subclass uiview and be added as subviews of your main view

2254006
entity-relationship	entities
Pattern(s): 2	
this can be mapped into a relational model in several ways most widely used of them being creating one table with attributes of both entities



2254138
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 3	1	
int works just fine as a boolean type



2254590
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 3	1	
there are downsides - udp transmission is not reliable or guaranteed in the same way as tcp



2254966
glut	glfw	glut	fltk	fltk	freeglut
Pattern(s): 3	0	3	
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself



2256557
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 3	
1.0.x versioning aren t being updated any longer and it s age is really starting to show

sequence	permutation
Pattern(s): 3	
if there is a tie choose the sequence is first in lexicographic order



2258018
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 1	
all you really need to do is right click the folder under your website click properties and under the application settings section click create



2258316
mergetool	winmerge
Pattern(s): 1	
it makes sense that the file we are merging to will also be this file - we also know that git mergetool makes the variable available that names that file



2258605
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 2	
i think the issue is that assemblies in the gac don t get copied to your project s build folder and fxcop doesn t know how to handle non-framework gac references



2259414
maven	cargo
Pattern(s): 3	
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates yes cargo can do this in a clean way



2260324
mediarecorder	audiorecord
Pattern(s): 2	
if you use mediarecorder the example above it will save compressed audio to a file



2260736
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 3	1	
msvs has solution folder which is quite different thing and there isn t much sense in expressing real folder as solution folder



2260872
width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
Pattern(s): 1	
to reproduce this behaviour firefox and others render some form fields select button input-type-button with the css3 box-sizing style set to border-box so that the width property reflects the entire rendered area width including the border and padding



2261868
sharpmap	proj4js
Pattern(s): 1	1	
proj4js also provides an online coordinate calculator which might help you to figure out which coordinates system the coordinates in your database are using
if you are looking for a c# framework sharpmap is great for handling all aspects of geospatial applications



2262332
cstdio	iostream
Pattern(s): 1	1	
a c++ standard draft n1905.pdf on www.open-std.org i don t have the exact link seems to indicate that it comes from c c standard output cout 27.3 standard iostream objects lib.iostream.objects 1- the header iostream declares objects that associate objects with the standard c streams provided for by the functions declared in cstdio 27.8.2
... 27.3.1 narrow stream objects lib.narrow.stream.objects istream cin 1- the object cin controls input from a stream buffer associated with the object stdin declared in cstdio

queue	fifo
Pattern(s): 1	
so normally you add new items to the queue s rear whilst removing items from the queue s front



2263393
uiview	uiwindow
Pattern(s): 3	
that uiwindow is never subclassed and it fills the whole screen



2265552
ant	maven	ant	maven
Pattern(s): 3	
but if maven is really overkill and you just want to launch the whole build in one step use a global build.xml



2266474
jdom	dom4j
Pattern(s): 3	
dom4j is another alternative again not genericised



2267199
filesystems	fat
Pattern(s): 1	
fat is a murderer for flash-based non-wear-protected devices as file allocation table is written to the same location over and over



2267285
onclick	onchange
Pattern(s): 0	
i concur with pointy that onclick is a better way to handle checkboxes if you want to avoid surprises



2267381
exponent	modulo
Pattern(s): 1	
pt z where exponent are the half of the exponent found in the factorization of yi calculate d mcd x-y n if 1 d n then d is a non-trivial factor of n otherwise start from step 2 choosing a bigger k

2267841
post	get
Pattern(s): 2	
after that a couple of things that can be noted using get your users can use the back button in their browser and they can bookmark pages there is a limit in the size of the parameters you can pass as get 2kb for some versions of internet explorer if i m not mistaken

personally i find that the netrw plugin is more than sufficient and this usually comes installed with vim



2273074
gprof	shark	gprof	shark
Pattern(s): 3	3	
instrumented profiling such as gprof is not particularly useful unless you really just want to know about call graphs and the number of times that functions are called



2273957
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	
both haskell and ocaml provide the lovely benefits of using an ml-family language but for most programmers ocaml is likely to offer a gentler learning curve and better immediate results
as far as multi-language integration goes combining c and haskell is remarkably easy and i say this as someone who is unlike dons not really much of an expert on either



2274414
int	double	int	double
Pattern(s): 1	
d stands for decimal and it expects an argument of type int or some smaller signed int type that then gets promoted



2274978
sequence	permutation
Pattern(s): 1	
in short this sequence is optimal because you can t make it worse somewhere in the hope of making it better someplace else



2275666
pop-up	dialog	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 2	
those items will appear in the pdf pop-up menu in the print dialog and if the user selects the item a pdf of the file will be placed in the folder or be passed to the application script or workflow

Pattern(s): 1	
although awt is supposed to be thread-safe it isn t really



2276906
lxml.html	beautifulsoup	lxml.html	beautifulsoup

2277303
ecj	javac	ecj	javac
Pattern(s): 3	
eclipse has its own built-in compiler called ecj which is probably the reason you could get away with not having the jdk installed to use it



2278175
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 1	
basically if there is a member doing anything with the entity nh need to know about it and tap into it. like mentioned earlier in order for nhibernate to do the magic it creates proxy classes which inherited from your entities category in your case



2278435
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 2	
the key reason to use properties is that since they are accessor they can be read and or modified from outside the class



2279405
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 3	
and now on each of your subclass you override the getequation by specifying the constraint and as transient is not inherited by subclasses the overriden getequation will be use for the equation field mapping



2280675
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 3	0	
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp



2280767
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar

so when calling sqrt 1.0 n the compiler consider you try to call test.sqrt int with a double swhich is obviously not possible



2285756
paredit	slime
Pattern(s): 1	
anyway it is a nice summary of how it works



2288104
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	3	3	
if you are using testng or junit 4.7+ since surefire-555 it is possible to run tests in parallel see the parallel and the threadcount optional parameters but that s not a default
now while i m not sure if the surefire plugin behaves the same as junit it is possible to get some control by manually creating a testsuite and specify the order in which tests are executed you are however strongly advised never to depend upon test execution order unit tests really should be indeed independent



2288489
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql also has a much richer sql dictionary that might give problems in mysql



2288951
serializable	deserialization

2289783
viewdidappear	performselector	viewdidappear	performselector
Pattern(s): 3	1	
might be that uiwindowcontroller is mistakenly assuming the view is still visible when the viewdidappear notification call returns



2289979
subclass	inherited
Pattern(s): 3	3	
you have to define an abstract method b in the base class test which makes this class abstract so you cannot have instances of it to call this method otherwise the function b is not defined in this class only in it s subclass of which the base class knows nothing and should not have to know anything



2290921
icmp	udp
Pattern(s): 3	
typically for gaming situations udp is used primarily because of the speed involved



2293090
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 3	
imo it s is much more straightforward to achieve c++-like performance in ocaml than in haskell



2293801
multiplying	modulo
Pattern(s): 1	
the hardest part here is to normalize resulting value which is done with modulo and is trivial



2294219
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 3	
important client-side validation is not a substitution for server-side validation



2294556
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 3	3	
the fact that it extends abstractmap is arguably just an implementation detail



2295609
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
unfortunately it is possible to write myotherclass.mystaticmethod - but that doesn t mean there s any real inherited going on under the covers this is just the scoping rules being very lenient



2295887

this post has already a very good answer by community wiki and i also recommend to look at rick strahl s web blog there are many good post about wcf rest like this



2296303
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 2	
this parent folder should also have svn ignore set to the following furthermore this project folder should be what goes into your trunk branches and tags directory



2299813
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 3	
so how much memory a processes uses is really not clear



2301782
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 1	
so if my understanding is correct here s how the three flags make the assembly run note it s the main assembly the program assembly that dictates this not each individual assembly for themselves on different platforms the n a for x64 assembly on x86 means that the assembly won t load and you ll get an exception if you try



2301786
many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 1	
or possibly a many-to-many relationship if one activity belongs to multiple processes

onclick	onchange	onclick	onchange
Pattern(s): 3	
onclick is not a valid handler for option types



2302020

accessor	properties	accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 1	1	
converting a simple attribute to a properties is quick and easy and doesn t need modification of client code

Pattern(s): 0	
a superclass defines a class that has a larger set of possible values as members



2305354
minimum	max	minimum	max
Pattern(s): 3	3	
once you zoom out a bit the max value is always a positive integer and the min value is always a negative integer



2306183
pascal	delphi
Pattern(s): 1	
the wrapper you are trying to write is possible in free pascal since free pascal supports 2 equvalent declarations for varargs external functions so instead of function pushfstring fmt pansichar pansichar

junit	testng
Pattern(s): 1	
unless there are new features in junit this is a difficult thing to do



2306769
jsf	stripes
Pattern(s): 3	
also you might want to check out stripes it is also a very nice server side web framework and finally here is a very thorough and a little old comparison of most java web frameworks



2306802
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
to make things easier we rely on the fact that free null is no-op so we set all the pointers at a given level equal to null before we try to allocate them so that if an error happens we can free all of the pointers



2307380
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 1	
but what exactly is o log n what it means precisely is as n tends towards infinity the time tends towards where a is a constant scaling factors



2308997
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
an abstract class is a partial implementation of a class with reusable code for multiple subclassing



2310284
backslash	double-quotes
Pattern(s): 1	1	
you could also avoid the double-quotes and thus avoid the first interpretation bin sh -c ls 1 1 another way is to store the filename in a variable and use that value export f 1 printenv f 1 bin sh -c ls f # note that bin sh interprets f not my current shell 1 and finally what you tried will work on some shells i m using bash as for the above examples just apparently not with your shell bin sh -c ls 1 1 csh # enter csh the next line is executed in that environment bin sh -c ls 1 unmatched . i strongly suggest you avoid such filenames in the first place

2313968
median	minimum
Pattern(s): 3	1	
if finding the median directly is too costly usually this is the case if you re trying to use quicksort what s commonly done instead is to either take the median of three potential pivot elements or else just pick a random element as your pivot



2314137
put	get	goto	break
Pattern(s): 3	
the break as goto is probably the answer but i will put forward one other idea



2315847
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
udp is connectionless but can have a fake connection enforced at both ends on the socket objects



2316518
next	except
Pattern(s): 3	
task foo do puts printed next puts never printed end or you can move the code in a method and use return in the method



2316866
exponent	addition
Pattern(s): 3	0	2	
but the effect of choosing a small public exponent is much greater than the effect of the faster algorithm so encryption is faster in practice
this means the rsa encryption operation can be done with a few modular squarings and an addition

2322858
required	placeholder
Pattern(s): 3	
stfail is the exception and only requires 1+ arguments. the last required argument is always an optional format string for a description and any other parameters are used to substitute in those placeholder just like you d do with printf or nslog

inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 2	
i create a base controller that has a virtual method sendemail mybaseviewmodel model that can be overridden on inherited controllers but has logic that looks for an email fromemail and subject in the view model and if found sets a sendmail boolean to true and also looks for an alternateemailview string in the viewmodel



2327301
short	base
Pattern(s): 2	
if you mean to limit your question to factorials of numbers short enough to be multiplied in o 1 then there s no way n can tend to infinity and therefore big-o notation is inappropriate



2327340
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops

specifically answering your question the delete operator invokes the destructor where free does not



2329889
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
Pattern(s): 3	0	
from the homepage we estimate that on modern 2009 hardware if 5 seconds are spent computing a derived key the cost of a hardware brute-force attack against scrypt is roughly 4000 times greater than the cost of a similar attack against bcrypt to find the same password and 20000 times greater than a similar attack against pbkdf2



2332880
dwoo	smarty
Pattern(s): 3	3	
they are both very similar but dwoo has the advantage of not sucking major donkey balls which is smarty s main downfall
i have written an extension for the codeigniter parser library to get it to use dwoo which integrates perfectly with my template library



2333981
free	realloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 1	
the reason realloc returns a new address is because expansion of the buffer may necessitate it being moved if that current block is surrounded in the memory arena in other words it can t just expand into a free block following it



2333981
realloc	malloc	realloc	memset
Pattern(s): 3	1	
that s because realloc null 7 is identical to malloc 7 - realloc is perfectly capable of starting with a null pointer



2334903
text-align	font-size
Pattern(s): 0	3	
element fill whole width of parent text-align justify works best with small font-size with slightly higher line-height - line-height is for readbility and smaller font size puts more characters in one line abstract characters-per-line width therefore gaps between words justified text looks better regarding images instead of small non changing parts of text - i tend to use as few image replacement parts as possible - i have very good results with cufón if you learn to count with it s cons i don t advice using justified text for sidebars and one-liners - it mostly seems ugly edit2 the main problem is that browsers don t know how to part your text unbreakable to un-breakable - soft hyphyen should solve this link soft hyphen overview but browser support is wild at best

2336574
gif	png
Pattern(s): 1	1	
the main difference is gif is patented and a bit more widely supported
png is an open specification and alpha transparency is not supported in ie6



2336582
tiff	png
Pattern(s): 1	
the png format is a popular alternative to gif images since it uses better compression techniques and does not have a limit of 256 colors but pngs do not support animations

that means that inherited is from another object not a class definition



2342929
uiview	calayer

note that according to the uiview class reference since the view is the layer s delegate you should never set the view as a delegate of another calayer object



2343646
equals	tostring
Pattern(s): 2	
as stated in msdn you should also override equals in your poco so it can be found in the items collection if necessary

memcached	apc	memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 1	3	2	
using apc your cache is duplicated on each server
while data stored in apc can be different on each server we generally use apc for data that has to be accessed very often is quick to generate and either is not modified often or it doesn t matter if it s not identical on all servers memcached for data that takes more time to generate and or is less used. or for data for which modifications must be visible immediatly when there is a write to the db the cached entry is regenerated too for instance we could use apc to store configuration variables don t change often are accessed very often are small use memcached for content of articles for a cms application for example not that small and there are a lot of them which means it might need more memory than we have on one server alone pretty hard heavy to generate a couple of sidenotes if several servers try to write to the same file that s shared via nfs there can be problems as there is no locking mecanism on nfs as far as i remember apc can be used to cache data yes -- but the most important reason to use it is it s opcode caching feature can save a large amount of cpu on the php servers entries in memcached are limited in size you cannot store an entry that s bigger than 1m i ve sometimes run into that problem -- rarely but it s not good when it happens

x86	64bit	forth	compiled-language
Pattern(s): 3	3	3	3	
mostly this is because x86_64 doesn t just have 64bit registers it also has twice as many
x86 does not have enough registers to make compiled-language as efficient as they could be so x86 code spends a lot of instructions and memory bandwidth shifting data back and forth between registers and memory
x86_64 has much less of that and so it takes a little less space and runs faster



2378769
int	chars
Pattern(s): 2	
clearly the most significant bit of this is set so when you try to print it as an int it will be interpreted as a -ve number



2378772
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 3	
this is most likely due to the fact that we have 16 x 64bit general purpose registers and 16 x sse registers instead of 8 x 32 bit general purpose registers and 8 x sse registers

nunit contains a fluent version of assert api as already mentioned - assert.that.. there are several of these implemented by 3rd parties for mstest nunit is much faster see jamie s comment he has managed to get mstest running faster - nunit can run tests in 32 and 64 bit mstest only runs them in 32 bit iirc not in 2010 64 bit support is built in
nunit allows abstract classes to be test fixtures so you can inherit test fixtures
mstest does not

inherited	properties	width	height
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	1	
you can find various rules for calculating the width for width auto here . regarding inherited each properties may also have a specified value of inherited which means that for a given element the properties takes the same computed value as the properties for the element s parent
so width inherited means it takes the same computed width as the parent element. regarding width auto on inline elements if height and width both have computed values of auto and the element also has an intrinsic width then that intrinsic width is the used value of width

2449370
post	put
Pattern(s): 2	2	
in sql insert is the only nonidempotent operation so it should be mapped onto post
update is idempotent so it can be mapped on put

what you could also try though i haven t experimented with it myself is multiple levels of inherited



2451594
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 2	
a divide-by-two search in a sorted arrays of size n can be written as a non-nested for-loop too but it would have o log n time

int	chars
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	
boost.typetraits has make_unsigned type if t is a unsigned int type then the same type as t if t is an signed int type then the corresponding unsigned type
otherwise if t is an enumerated or chars type chars or wchar_t then an unsigned int type with the same width as t



2451785
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 2	0	
anybody can contribute to both but for dojox the barrier of entry is much higher because a submission will be reviewed and can be rejected if it doesn t meet strict criteria

a prng is said to be cryptographically secure if assuming that it operates over a wide enough unknown n -bit key its output is computationally indistinguishable from uniformly random bits



2453997
config	ini	config	ini
Pattern(s): 1	3	
if this config is user-related maybe you want to keep separate config for each user serialized on a database so you can load them dynamically when a user loads the form that displays the checkboxes



2454600
isr	freertos
Pattern(s): 1	
however a preemptive rtos like freertos uses its own stack frame typically bigger than the stack frame generated by the compiler because an rtos must store the complete context



2455246
settings.bundle	plist	settings.bundle	plist
Pattern(s): 2	2	
as for your general questions here s my take for persistence i would recommend simply persisting an nsdictionary of your settings to a plist file in your app s document folder either using nspropertylistserialization or nsdictionary s writetofile atomically i suggest building a series of custom nibs and caching the views once they are loaded definitely have your settings view manage the navigation stack that way your settings view can be reused in other projects easily

2458703
post	put
Pattern(s): 2	1	3	3	
we could just as well have written and put that with no args in the else branch but in my opinion sw p is more general and i m surprised it s not in standard latex already
debilski s post is definitely a solid way to do it although the say is not necessary



2460768

for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
if you never enter the for-loop say when the players arrays is empty the variable tempbrowser will remain uninitialized



2471014
post	put
Pattern(s): 1	
for the default example post -habtm- tag an input field in the post-view should be when submitting the data and doing a save in the postscontroller cake will also save the habtm association in the posts_tags table



2471150
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 1	
since dude already implements the interface as well we could have the plugins extends dude but that would be conceptually wrong because extends creates an is-a relationship but a plugin is not a dude

i like the idea of hiphop so don t get me wrong here but there is something to remember hiphop is not for everyone



2474902
post	put	post	put
Pattern(s): 3	
the post block is executed once for each post thus the markup for the container should go outside this block



2476415
int	chars
Pattern(s): 1	
partitioning on dates in mysql is hard and there s a lot of shortcomings in the partitioning implementation atleast if you want to cover a lot of different query constraints we usually place an int id in the tables pointing to a calendar instead of a date type as we ve found mysql to handle partitioning on a simple int to be quite reliable compared to partitioning on columns involving a function such as to_days we have create table datatbl time_id int not null ....

Pattern(s): 3	
i m not sure if this is the phenomenom you re experiencing but it does strongly seem that way so radio button are input tags like any other



2480475
hash	md5	hash	salt
Pattern(s): 2	
salting a hash is used to decrease the possibility of collision and ensure that the hash can t be found in a database like this - if everybody is using md5 for storing their passwords then a password file database could be de-hashed by looking up the md5 d value of the password



2481019
hex	binary	hex	binary
Pattern(s): 2	
every single file on your computer can be represented with binary 1s and 0s and indeed that s how it s generally stored on disk alignment of magnetic particles or ram charge



2481595
wordprocessingml	odf	spreadsheetml	presentationml
Pattern(s): 1	1	
the one thing to keep in mind is that spreadsheetml is more similiar to presentationml than it is to wordprocessingml in file structure inside the package for every sheet there is a seperate file



2481612
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 2	
the danger is when collisions can be predicted it s not necessary to know the original hash input to generate the same hash output



2481710
subclass	accessor
Pattern(s): 2	
in that case the key-value coding will if it doesn t find these accessor patterns for the property directly access the set. typically you only implement these methods if you are using a custom collection class that needs to be accessed as if it was a set

serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 3	
the serializable form does not contain the inter-element links



2485248
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 3	
my thinking is that the ipad s a4 is probably scaled up enough to handle the extra graphics processing that s needed for the larger screens



2485469
strsplit	substr	strsplit	substr
Pattern(s): 1	1	
it can be made faster by using unsafe code to iterate over the source string though this requires you to write the iteration mechanism yourself rather than using yield return. it allocates the absolute minimum a substr per non separator token plus the wrapping enumerator so realistically to improve performance you would have to use even more unsafe code by using compareordinal i effectively am mainly in avoiding the overhead of character lookup on the string with a char buffer make use of domain specific knowledge about the input sources or tokens. you may be happy to eliminate the null check on the separators you may know that the separators are almost never individual characters the code is written as an extension method

codeigniter is very useful and very easy to learn



2489645
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
multiple inherited doesn t work well with databases and your django models do need to map down to a database in the end and inherited is often a bad way to model roles because people s roles do change



2489946
bash	zsh
Pattern(s): 3	
if you ever end up needing to make the script work with a bin sh which is not bash eg a bsd system any closed-source os or even on some gnu linux distributions now where dash is used you ll make your life easier if you use

inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 3	
you can check imagebutton class from fluidkit library - it does exactly what you want



2493606

Pattern(s): 3	3	
often the uibinder documentation for a class is actually given in the docs for its superclass



2493674
post	get	post	put
Pattern(s): 3	3	
by contrast the post method is not necessarily idempotent and therefore sending an identical post request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects such as financial transactions



2496033
vbscript	autoit	vbscript	autoit
Pattern(s): 1	3	3	1	
it uses a combination of simulated keystrokes mouse movement and window control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages vbscript and sendkeys
autoit is also very small self-contained and will run on all versions of windows out-of-the-box with no annoying runtimes required



2496095
public	protected
Pattern(s): 2	
you cannot request a variable from a function therefore it can t be defined as public private protected

2505557
testng	jmockit	testng	jmockit
Pattern(s): 2	
you can go for apache openejb which is a lightweight ejb3.0 implementation that can be embedded into testng



2505659
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to use multiple inherited to combine everything into one big class it might make sense to do this then you can refactor each of the parent classes so that every method and properties is either private starts with __ or has a short 2-3 character prefix unique to that class



2505946
coldfusion	railo
Pattern(s): 3	3	2	
coldfusion exists now also opensource something not many seem to know railo
providers usually have php and mysql as combination but the bigger providers have also windows based hosting with an ms sql database server so a connection from the php linux server can be made to a ms sql server you do need some special library installed though i read

this won t work because parent is not an enumerable type



2509793
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 1	
you can put a web.config in the nohandler folder that defines a different handler notfound if you want to server a 404 style etc



2510081
allocator	stl
Pattern(s): 1	2	
drop it into a test program that uses various stl containers and you can easily see how the allocator is used by the standard containers not all of the interface functions in the mallocator such as construct and destroy are instrumented with trace output so you might want to drop trace statements in there to more easily see how the standard containers might use those functions without resorting to a debugger
that should give you a good idea of how your containers might be expected to use a custom allocator



2511737
inherited	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
it also messes badly with inherited



2512486
maven	m2e
Pattern(s): 3	
and this applies also to netbeans under the following condition see dependency management hint if you open a project that other projects depend on the icon in other projects changes to a maven project icon to denote that the ide knows about link between the projects. however such a link is only established when the groupid artifactid and version all match in the dependency and project declaration



2513135
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 3	3	
yes setinterval timeout 1000 does nearly the same thing
it s somewhat different in that the the next interval starts counting immediately after 1000ms not after the script that runs has completed or even started



2513463
namedtuple	dictionary
Pattern(s): 2	
a namedtuple is a tuple whose slots can also be addressed by name

that way your snmp manager does not have to poll the agent just to be sure



2525686
post	get
Pattern(s): 2	
that said the cast to httpurlconnection is unnecessary if you know the fact that the request method will automatically be set to post if you do connection.setdooutput true



2526781
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 1	1	2	
linux is case sensitive and python.h won t work

2529618
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	3	
calling an overridden method from the superclass constructor is simply not going to work - don t do it



2529618
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
one way to achieve this is using a factory method note that the constructor of subclassing is private to ensure that it can only be instantiated via createinstance thus instances are always initialized properly



2535829
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 3	
if you decide that linux is not for you and your project was in eclipse then you will have no problem switching back to windows since eclipse is available for both operating systems



2535991
comparator	comparable
Pattern(s): 1	1	
using a comparator is more flexible in that different implementations can order by name age etc



2536651

2538292
autoresetevent	manualresetevent	autoresetevent	manualresetevent

teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 3	
teamcity is probably the simplest and fastest ci server to set up and get running and definitely beats the pants of cc



2543023
identifier	ambiguous
Pattern(s): 1	1	
from section 7.5.4.1 of the c# 3 spec in a member access of the form e.i if e is a single identifier and if the meaning of e as a simple-name 7.5.2 is a constant field property local variable or parameter with the same type as the meaning of e as a type-name 3.8 then both possible meanings of e are permitted



2543256
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 1	
so any late-bound reference to that name like the one you have in its super subclassagain call will of course get the subclass that s masquerading by that name -- that subclass s superclass is of course the real subclassagain whence the infinite recursion



2544996
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 3	3	
or set interval is probably more like what you after you can then call something like setinterval function code you want to run here 100



2545179
goto	break
Pattern(s): 3	
no goto is not used but you can define labels and leave a loop up to the label



2546942
post	get
Pattern(s): 1	
adding a dir to the post build is an easy way to show where you are and can help correct path errors



2547440
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 3	1	
so the answer to your question assuming you are always targeting the default home screens manager is that the screens is always 4x4 cells and as long as you stick with device independent pixels you have nothing extra you need to do to make your appwidget scale and work correctly on higher resolutions



2547502
int	chars
Pattern(s): 2	2	
one area that i ve found multi-character constants to be of some use is to come up with clever enum values that can be recognized in a debugger or memory dump there are few portability problems with the above other than platforms that have small int or warnings that might be spewed



2547964
int	chars	int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	
a guid is actually an int type - it s a 128 bit int 16 bytes



2548187
daemons	launchd
Pattern(s): 3	3	
to be honest relaunching the daemons without any question after a crash is probably not a good idea

x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 3	
it is just a matter of setting the path environment variable properly



2548810
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 3	2	
this is clear requirement of the owasp top 10 a3 broken authentication and session management sending a cookie over http is also a violation of cwe-614 and cwe-311
if you have a login then the login s post and the entire session must be protected by https



2550383

jstl	taglib
Pattern(s): 1	
for the remnant of jstl tags only the functions taglib is useful in jsf all the other taglib are superflous in a jsf environment since it either provides the same functionality out of the box jstl core and format taglib or it simply doesn t suit in the mvc ideology jstl sql and xml taglib
