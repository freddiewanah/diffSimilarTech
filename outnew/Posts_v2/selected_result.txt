cassini	iis
cassini is not ment to be a replacement
cassini is ment to be a light waight test webserver
the idea is that a developer does not need to have iis installed and configured to test his application


11969 not in 
vmware	virtualbox
that being said you should probably try them out with the particular environment and apps you will be using and see which one is best for you
one feature of vmware i really like is the ability to snapshot the system
i do this before every software install and when one of them goes awry i just revert the virtualbox back to the pre-install state

postgresql	mysql
mysql is a pretty popular database lots of tools are available and lots of books
sqlite and postgresql are also quite popular and also free open-source

quicksort	mergesort
mergesort this will teach how to merge which is important because there are a ton of speedups you can get by merging two sorted lists together as well as how to divide the problem into smaller sub problems important for dealing with hierarchical structures and also used in quick sort
quicksort though faster is much harder to understand
you need two scanning variables a pivot item etc.

anjuta	kdevelop
kdevelop is a kde project but run on gnome
anjuta is an equivalent project on gnome but i find it unusable for real work
for the rest of the stack gcc make valgrind ddd a gdb ide and python for scripting my code

114544
postgresql	mysql
these databases are very different - mysql is speed and simplicity postgresql is robustness and concurrency
it will be easier for you to learn postgresql it is not that hard

firefox	safari
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers
opera has native svg support firefox has native svg support internet explorer does not include svg support natively
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1

anjuta	kdevelop
code blocks is also very promising and i like that one best
i hear anjuta is pretty slick for gnome users
i played a bit with kdevelop and it s nice but sort of lacking featurewise

120052 not in 
bazaar	git
difficulty with git has been understanding the implications of the distributed model
i did glance briefly at other dvcses like bazaar and mercurial and they seemed to be somewhat more newbie-friendly
anyway as others have said subversion is probably the easiest way to get used to the version control mindset and get practical experience of the benefits of vcs rollback branches collaborative development easier code review etc


27440
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
mysql is much more commonly provided by web hosts
postgresql is a much more mature product
there s this discussion addressing your better question apparently according to this web page mysql is fast when concurrent access levels are low and when there are many more reads than writes


323809 not in 
firefox	safari
dammit that was the property i was looking for
as the others said you can use firebug and that will sort you out no worries on firefox
chrome safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to firebug s console so your code should be portable across those browsers

29923
bazaar	git
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it
most of the people were reluctant to move over as they have to type in two commands to commit and push bazaar ci + bazaar push
also it was difficult for them to understand the concept of branches and merging no one uses branches or merges them in svn



35297 not in 
bazaar	git
bazaar also had better documentation for integrating with native applications like visual c
i ve had the best luck with bazaar followed by mercurial
never could get git to work correctly



234867 not in
bazaar	git
for more technical people git could be good it has been developed by linux kernel people after all
bazaar or mercurial are probably better for those looking for ease of use

144890 
quicksort	mergesort
note that the bit-flipping trick can be used regardless of what sorting algorithm you actually use.
all things being equal i d expect most people to use whatever is most conveniently available and that tends to be quicksort 3
other than that quicksort is known to be very fast on arrays just like mergesort is the common choice for lists


60119 
cassini	iis
at this point you will be able to run your localhost over https
cassini does not support https
however you can use iis to do this if your using iis 5.1 download the ms iis toolpack for iis 6.0 it comes with a tool to create self signed ssl certificates


259460 
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that
i suggest using nhibernate with postgresql
you can do all your testing and development on sqlite so you don t need to have an instance of postgresql running on your dev machine


70427
quicksort	mergesort
i m a bigger fan of mergesort than i am of quicksort for these reasons
quicksort has a better average case complexity but in some applications it is the wrong choice
quicksort is vulnerable to denial of service attacks


77794
bazaar	git	bazaar	git
it is very easy to lose a commit or ruin a repository especially if you do not understand the inner workings of git
mercurial and bazaar resemble themselves very much on the surface
they both provide basic distributed version control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git

77794
bazaar	git
git well is not for the uninitiated
it is much faster than both mercurial and bazaar and was written to manage the linux kernel
it is the fastest of the three and it is also the most powerful of the three by quite a margin

77943
bazaar	git
git is fastest but all three are fast enough
bazaar is the most flexible it has transparent read-write support for svn repositories and cares a lot about the user experience
mercurial is somewhere in the middle


86173
jython	pypy
pypy is an experimental interpreter compiler that may one day supplant cpython but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas
jython and ironpython are useful if you have an overriding need to interface with existing libraries written in a different platform like if you have 100 000 lines of java and you just want to write a 20-line python script
not particularly useful for anything else in my opinion because they are perpetually a few versions behind cpython due to community inertia
