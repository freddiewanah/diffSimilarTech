vim	emacs	vim	emacs
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
it is daunting at first as i m sure vim is too but the question was about text editors on linux besides vi.
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

ubuntu	debian
or ubuntu has some nice gui things that make it easy to control apache mysql php
this article has some of the best ways to lock things down some highlights make sure no one can browse the directories make sure only root has write privileges to everything and only root has read privileges to certain config files run mod_security the article also takes some pointers from this book apache securiy o reilly press as far as distros i ve run debain and ubuntu but it just depends on how much you want to do
i ran debian with no x and just ssh d into it whenever i needed anything

9218
ubuntu	debian
let the nice package maintainers from linux distros such as debian or ubuntu do the work for you
install from the distro s precompiled packages and staying current becomes a matter of issuing the occasional apt-get update apt-get -u dist-upgrade command or using whatever fancy gui tool ubuntu provides

vmware	virtualbox
that being said you should probably try them out with the particular environment and apps you will be using and see which one is best for you
one feature of vmware i really like is the ability to snapshot the system
i do this before every software install and when one of them goes awry i just revert the virtualbox back to the pre-install state

anjuta	kdevelop
kdevelop is a kde project but run on gnome
anjuta is an equivalent project on gnome but i find it unusable for real work
for the rest of the stack gcc make valgrind ddd a gdb ide and python for scripting my code

24174
anjuta	kdevelop
code blocks is also very promising and i like that one best
i hear anjuta is pretty slick for gnome users
i played a bit with kdevelop and it s nice but sort of lacking featurewise

27051
ubuntu	debian
however you must make locale files for en_nz
for ubuntu edit var lib locales supported.d local and add en_nz iso-8859-1 to the file
if your system is another distribution including debian the location will be different

postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
mysql is much more commonly provided by web hosts
postgresql is a much more mature product
there s this discussion addressing your better question apparently according to this web page mysql is fast when concurrent access levels are low and when there are many more reads than writes

29770
vim	emacs
haven t played with both enough yet or tried more types of refactoring but i will do some more hacking with them
in the meantime i ve tried it two tools that have some sort of integration with vim
the first is rope a python refactoring library that comes with a vim and emacs plug-in

29900
bazaar	git
you ll probably need to be able to run python scripts on your webserver to host either of them
i d look at either mercurial or bazaar
i m told git also works on windows but i suspect the windows port is still a second class port at best

29923
bazaar	git
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it
most of the people were reluctant to move over as they have to type in two commands to commit and push bazaar ci + bazaar push
also it was difficult for them to understand the concept of branches and merging no one uses branches or merges them in svn

firefox	safari
here s the relevant documentation for gears workerpool api whatwg has a draft recommendation for worker threads web workers and there s also mozilla s dom worker threads update june 2009 current state of browser support for javascript threads firefox 3.5 has web workers
some demos of web workers if you want to see them in action simulated annealing try it link space invaders link at end of post moonbat javascript benchmark first link the gears plugin can also be installed in firefox
safari 4 and the webkit nightlies have worker threads javascript ray tracer chrome has gears baked in so it can do threads although it requires a confirmation prompt from the user and it uses a different api to web workers although it will work in any browser with the gears plugin installed google gears workerpool demo not a good example as it runs too fast to test in chrome and firefox although ie runs it slow enough to see it blocking interaction ie8 and ie9 can only do threads with the gears plugin installed

35297
bazaar	git
bazaar also had better documentation for integrating with native applications like visual c
i ve had the best luck with bazaar followed by mercurial
never could get git to work correctly

i am writing this on a centrino 1.5ghz 512mb ram running ubuntu
it s debian based and is the first linux distro i have tried that actually worked with my laptop on first install

37660
postgresql	mysql
i use postgresql and my answer works correctly there i tried it
see the postgresql update docs under parameters expression where it mentions that expressions on the right hand side of set clauses explicitly use the old values of columns
i see that the corresponding mysql update docs contain the statement single-table update assignments are generally evaluated from left to right which implies the behaviour you describe

37724
postgresql	mysql
mysql select concat field1 field2 from table
postgresql select field1 || || field2 from table


37854
postgresql	mysql
if you trace microsoft sql server back to its roots i think you ll find ingres - one of the very first relational databases written in the 70s
and postgresql was originally written by some of the same people in the 80s as a successor to ingres
oracle goes way back and i m not sure where mysql came in

39033
google-chrome	firefox
but the new internet explorer 8 beta 2 and the just announced google-chrome browser are heading in that direction so i suppose firefox will be heading there too
here is a post google-chrome process manager by john resig from mozilla and jquery fame on the subject


40699
google-chrome	firefox
you might find a more conclusive answer on the development site dev.chromium.org and some of the developers might be on irc on #chromium on freenode
google-chrome does support the netscape plugin api but that is for displaying certain kinds of content
you seem to be after a extention api really firefox is the only major browser to encourage and support third party extentions to browsing capability that aren t simply new toolbars nothing in the developer documentation points to a browser enhancing api - google seem to want to keep a tight reign on the look and feel of the application

41932
google-chrome	firefox
see for example - v8 tracemonkey squirrelfish ie8 benchmarks .
needless to say google-chrome s v8 blows away all the current builds of the next-generation of javascript vms
just to be clear webkit and firefox engines haven t even hit beta but it looks like the performance bar has just been set to an astronomical height by the v8 team.

42912
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome being an entirely new browser build on a clean rendering engine webkit was easier to write in this way
google-chrome s approach is difficult to write and requires forethought from the developers
ie and firefox are both attempting to move to a process-per-tab model but due to backwards compatibility are not able to transition quickly

47735
firefox	safari
different browsers implement this differently since it is not a common status code
alas unlike the opera and firefox developers the ie developers have never read the spec and even the latest most secure ie7 will redirect the post request from domain a to domain b without any warnings or confirmation dialogs
safari also acts in an interesting manner while it does not raise a confirmation dialog and performs the redirect it throws away the post data effectively changing 307 redirect into the more common 302

50846
google-chrome	safari
hth alastair
there are a number of known incompatibilities between tinymce and webkit the rendering engine used by google-chrome
if you re using tinymce 2.x you might want to try the safari plug-in to tinymce

virtualbox users open a terminal.app on your mac you can find it in applications utilities and run the following sequence of commands replacing input.vhd with the name of the vhd file you re starting from and output.vdi with the name you want your final disk image to have applications q.app contents macos qemu-img convert -o raw -f vpc input.vhd temp.bin vboxmanage convertdd temp.bin output.vdi rm temp.bin mv output.vdi library virtualbox vdi vboxmanage modifyvdi output.vdi compact start virtualbox and create a new virtual machine select the new vdi file you ve just created as the boot hard disk vmware fusion users open a terminal.app on your mac you can find it in applications utilities and run the following commands replacing input.vhd and output.vmdk with the name of the vhd file you re working on and the name you want your resulting disk image to have applications q.app contents macos qemu-img convert -o vmdk -f vpc input.vhd output.vmdk mv output.vmdk documents virtual machines.localized this will probably take a while it takes around 30 minutes per disk image on my 2.4ghz core 2 duo macbook w 2gb ram

cassini	iis
at this point you will be able to run your localhost over https
cassini does not support https
however you can use iis to do this if your using iis 5.1 download the ms iis toolpack for iis 6.0 it comes with a tool to create self signed ssl certificates

60815
postgresql	mysql
i know that postgresql sqlite mysql and oracle have the ability to order by a random function so you can use this in sqlalchemy from sqlalchemy.sql.expression import func select select.order_by func.random # for postgresql sqlite select.order_by func.rand # for mysql select.order_by dbms_random.value # for oracle next you need to limit the query by the number of records you need for example using .limit
bear in mind that at least in postgresql selecting random record has severe perfomance issues
here is good article about it

65582
firefox	safari
search for doscroll in the event.js
yui uses three tests to do this for firefox and recent webkit there s a domcontentloaded event that is fired
for older safari the document.readystate watched until it becomes loaded or complete

67626
google-chrome	firefox
and it s slow as hell in firefox
works better with opera and google-chrome though. ff3 windows xp ati


67878
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
additionally won t work for your example as it will either work when word-breaking but when not word-breaking not display any hyphens or work when not word-breaking but display two hyphens when word-breaking since it adds a hyphen on a break
your example works as expected in google-chrome safari windows and ie8
the text breaks out of the 150px box in firefox 3 and opera 9.5

70042
bazaar	git
and give me the flexibility i need see my article on git + visual studio
i think bazaar can do similar things and might be better at one thing it can easily support non-distributed central-repository based development


70427
quicksort	mergesort
i m a bigger fan of mergesort than i am of quicksort for these reasons
quicksort has a better average case complexity but in some applications it is the wrong choice
quicksort is vulnerable to denial of service attacks

70430
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	mergesort
in the worst case they are the same amount of algorithmic time but mergesort requires more storage
wikipedia s explanation is typically quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other θ nlogn algorithms because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures and in most real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the probability of requiring quadratic time
quicksort mergesort i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is ω n that quicksort implementations don t have

77794
bazaar	git	bazaar	git
it is very easy to lose a commit or ruin a repository especially if you do not understand the inner workings of git
mercurial and bazaar resemble themselves very much on the surface
they both provide basic distributed version control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git

77794
bazaar	git
git well is not for the uninitiated
it is much faster than both mercurial and bazaar and was written to manage the linux kernel
it is the fastest of the three and it is also the most powerful of the three by quite a margin

77943
bazaar	git
git is fastest but all three are fast enough
bazaar is the most flexible it has transparent read-write support for svn repositories and cares a lot about the user experience
mercurial is somewhere in the middle

77945
quicksort	mergesort
with o n 2 worst case that rarely happens quicksort is potentially far slower than the o nlogn of the merge sort
quicksort has less overhead so with small n and slow computers it is better
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases

85803
postgresql	mysql
we still have few problems with the postgresql one
we did a move from a mysql3 to postgresql 8.2 then 8.3
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok

86173
jython	pypy
pypy is an experimental interpreter compiler that may one day supplant cpython but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas
jython and ironpython are useful if you have an overriding need to interface with existing libraries written in a different platform like if you have 100 000 lines of java and you just want to write a 20-line python script
not particularly useful for anything else in my opinion because they are perpetually a few versions behind cpython due to community inertia

88632
firefox	safari
from that point i consider the market share and try to ensure a reasonable support level for all other browsers
for example even .net developers occasionally use firefox maybe even opera
safari and google-chrome are possibilities too now

89714
firefox	safari
ones that are definitely not dead are ie6 starting to push it ie7 ie8 latest opera 9.x latest firefox 3.x latest safari 3.x and others that have about the same capabilities
firefox 2.x isn t dead either and is needed for win9x users if they don t want to use opera


97431
google-chrome	safari
it is not real ie it s mainly only its rendering engine html+css+js plus web client http and some more protocols control itself has no menu bookmarks etc
google-chrome is full featured browser
so you should be asking for webkit rendering engine google-chrome use developed by safari s guys control

103817
cassini	iis
slow startup compared to iis
the built in web server for visual studio is called cassini and here are a few of its limitations.
it can host only one asp.net application per port

104095
cassini	iis
cassini is not ment to be a replacement
cassini is ment to be a light waight test webserver
the idea is that a developer does not need to have iis installed and configured to test his application

105921
postgresql	mysql
or you can use the free tool pgadmin
i like postgresql maestro
i also use their version for mysql

106334
postgresql	mysql
in your example you would want something like this select o.id o.address o.otherdetails group_concat concat e.firstname e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql - edit postgresql 9.0 is equally simple now that string_agg expression delimiter is built-in
here it is with comma-space between elements select o.id o.address o.otherdetails string_agg e.firstname || || e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql before 9.0 allows you to define your own aggregate functions with create aggregate
slightly more work than mysql but much more flexible

108421
vmware	virtualbox
intel-based macintoshes can boot windows and apple provides windows drivers for their various devices as part of a href rel nofollow noreferrer boot camp. a alternately you can buy a href rel nofollow noreferrer parallels a or a href rel nofollow noreferrer vmware fusion a for less than 100
i use vmware fusion
there is also a mac version of a href rel nofollow noreferrer virtualbox a from sun which is free though i have never used it

109979
vmware	virtualbox
for myself i stick with vmware workstation 7+ years and vmware server for my linux-hosted virtualization needs
at work it s vmware workstation on windows vmware server on windows and vmware esx on bare metal
i ll probably have another look at xen kvm and virtualbox at some point but for right now compatibility between work and home is paramount

110162
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a pretty popular database lots of tools are available and lots of books
sqlite and postgresql are also quite popular and also free open-source


114544
postgresql	mysql
these databases are very different - mysql is speed and simplicity postgresql is robustness and concurrency
it will be easier for you to learn postgresql it is not that hard


118325
firefox	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	safari
firefox with ie tab because those are the two browsers with the most market share and google-chrome because it is one of the few windows browsers that use webkit meaning it should display similarly to safari
i use firefox with ie tab and google-chrome
firefox with ie tab because those are the two browsers with the most market share and google-chrome because it is one of the few windows browsers that use webkit meaning it should display similarly to safari

120052
bazaar	git
difficulty with git has been understanding the implications of the distributed model
i did glance briefly at other dvcses like bazaar and mercurial and they seemed to be somewhat more newbie-friendly
anyway as others have said subversion is probably the easiest way to get used to the version control mindset and get practical experience of the benefits of vcs rollback branches collaborative development easier code review etc

126003
google-chrome	firefox
or you could fire up firefox in full screen mode in a dedicated vnc server instance and use a screenshot grabber to take the screenshot
fullscreen minimal google-chrome vnc server instance no visible ui + you can choose your resolution
use xinit with xvnc as the x server to do this - you ll need to read all the manpages

129279
vmware	virtualbox
you can revert to any previous snapshots and name them
3 it has nat support and bridged networking like the vmware and microsoft products
4 there is no server version of virtualbox but i know it shares an engine with qemu so it may be possible to host your vbox images on qemu

133160
firefox	safari
it pays to have the headers set correctly and it s worth investigating etags
afaik there is no difference on the part of browsers as both firefox and ie will incorrectly cache the response from a url with a querystring in the same way they cache the response from a url without a querystring
in the case of safari it respects the spec and doesn t cache urls with querystrings

133954
google-chrome	firefox
if you are creating a firefox plugin place your code in a xul overlay
if you really want to allow any web page to do whatever it is your plugin does you can establish some mechanism through wich the page can ask the plugin to do the operation with its google-chrome privileges and send the result to the page afterwards


134999
bazaar	git
non-distributed solutions such as subversion don t have that capability
a href rel nofollow noreferrer bazaar a does what you re asking for in terms of working very well standalone and there was a 2007 summer of code project to build a href rel nofollow noreferrer a visual studio integration plugin a which appears to have a href rel nofollow noreferrer produced an at-least-partially-functional product a
bazaar and other distributed tools such as git mercurial darcs and the like are ideal because you can have your repository stored in multiple places ie

135226
firefox	safari
john resig has a good explanation
here s the full version breakdown ie 6-7 support jscript 5 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 ie 8 supports jscript 6 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 - more bug fixes over jscript 5 firefox 1.0 supports javascript 1.5 ecmascript 3 equivalent firefox 1.5 supports javascript 1.6 1.5 + array extras + e4x + misc. firefox 2.0 supports javascript 1.7 1.6 + generator + iterators + let + misc. firefox 3.0 supports javascript 1.8 1.7 + generator expressions + expression closures + misc. the next version of firefox will support javascript 1.9 1.8 + to be determined opera supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc
safari supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc

144890
quicksort	mergesort
note that the bit-flipping trick can be used regardless of what sorting algorithm you actually use.
all things being equal i d expect most people to use whatever is most conveniently available and that tends to be quicksort 3
other than that quicksort is known to be very fast on arrays just like mergesort is the common choice for lists

149442
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	safari
much like the safari browser does
at first i believed it was a built-in feature of the wysiwym markdown editor but shog9 is correct it s not baked-in at all but is courtesy of the jquery plugin textarearesizer i was lead astray by the browser was using to check on the editor demo because google-chrome itself adds the expandable functionality on textareas mdash
much like the safari browser does

150593
firefox	safari
safari 3.1 for webkit opera for presto
i m pretty sure firefox will start supporting html5 partially in 3.1 all support is extremely partial
check here for information on what is supported

151912
postgresql	mysql
each client will receive the last inserted id for the last statement that client executed
this is the sequence solution for postgresql you d have to do it in a stored procedure or on your application code of course
for mysql the transaction is important not to trip on your own feet in case you re using the same connection for more than one insert

161503
cassini	iis
in this case you need to change the regional settings of the account under which the asp.net app is running
if you are developing with vs2005 or later you re probably running under the cassini web server under the identity of the current user - so just change the current user s settings
if you re using iis you probably want to change the regional settings of the aspnet account - you can do this from regional settings in the control panel by checking the checkbox apply to current user and to the default user profile

163395
google-chrome	firefox
after noticing that some of you are still trying to get this to work i decided to try a new approach
my results are far better this time around - at least on google-chrome on linux
i no longer have a windows pc available to me so i can only test on google-chrome firefox on ubuntu

173406
firefox	safari
currently i believe that safari is the only shipping browser to support any of these and i believe it only supports the client side databases and local storage parts
edit olliej correction firefox 3 supports the application cache but alas not the client side db


175905
firefox	safari
finally there should be a very specific customer request to invest the time and money making support for the other browsers like opera safari e.t.c
firefox ie7 and ie6 are enough to cover more than 90 of the browser market share
it is a good idea to read the new web standards and take in account what microsoft prepares for ie8

175905
google-chrome	safari
it is a good idea to read the new web standards and take in account what microsoft prepares for ie8
then you can try to be compatible with google-chrome
finally there should be a very specific customer request to invest the time and money making support for the other browsers like opera safari e.t.c

176071
google-chrome	firefox
if the interface does not rely heavily on javascript then it must degrade gracefully enough to be usable in text based and mobile browsers such as opera mobile links lynx iphone etc this includes any necessary optimisations for the screen size informational non-application sites must be at least tested with a screenreader i will put no significant effort into supporting firefox 1 and ie5.5 or below
new functionality must be tested and at least working with upcoming browsers such as ie8 and google-chrome
it s pointless ignoring these as they are both likely to become very popular in the coming months and years

176144
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also a side effect of targeting safari first ie is likely to be less painful as the webkit team has gone to great lengths to comply with existing practices wherever possible
google-chrome comes last because it s so likely to just work if safari is good to go
edit firefox 2 comes before firefox 3 because its support set is more restricted

181815
firefox	safari
hopefully your target audience will have a correctly configured system to display their own language
for me both the bbc sites you link to get the proper characters in the window title bar using firefox or ie on windows
i suspect you don t have the right fonts installed though i m not sure entirely what fonts it is that you would be missing to cause this problem particularly not if safari works

195398
postgresql	mysql
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
postgresql does comply better with standards so it can be easier to replace later
in the end the choice has so many variables that no matter which way you go you ll find some important issue that makes it the right choice

196705
postgresql	mysql
you will find more than 500 users there and some of them are development companies building projects for their clients
my impression is that most of them use postgresql that s what i do to and some others use the google app engine
in fact web2py is the only framework that allows you to write code once and the same code will run on gae sqlite mysql postgresql oracle mssql and firebird with the limitations imposed by gae

196933
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but the savings in transferred bytes can be enormous
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google-chrome
it apparently doesn t work this way in safari 3

203428
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
i m not sure if there is an equivalent for mysql but you can always do this which is a bit ugly but should work in both mysql and postgresql
in postgresql you can do this select whatever from mytable where something ilike match this
i m not sure if there is an equivalent for mysql but you can always do this which is a bit ugly but should work in both mysql and postgresql

205216
cassini	iis
then you will get the benefits of connection pooling while avoiding passing credentials
when you re running a web site using cassini the account used by the web server process is your own account that you use to log on to your windows machine
that account will be different on iis

207062
google-chrome	firefox
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base
google-chrome is an application not a window or a directx which you can create as a control
you can however as someone already mention host a webkit control

i have not tried it though

212565
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort this will teach how to merge which is important because there are a ton of speedups you can get by merging two sorted lists together as well as how to divide the problem into smaller sub problems important for dealing with hierarchical structures and also used in quick sort
quicksort though faster is much harder to understand
you need two scanning variables a pivot item etc.

in windows you can find hosts here c windows system32 drivers etc you can go into your web project settings and have it use the local iis as a host instead and then it will work fine
microsoft doesn t allow this on purpose - they don t want you deploying your application with cassini
it s compiled right into its code

for more technical people git could be good it has been developed by linux kernel people after all
bazaar or mercurial are probably better for those looking for ease of use

awt	swing
i don t think that awt is capable of restyling native component peers in a reliable fashion
i know for certain that swt can t and it s a far more sophisticated toolkit than awt

vim	emacs
if anything you re gonna be more comfortable using emacs on colemak than on qwerty at least i was
in vim it s a lot trickier since hjkl will be completely messed-up
then again i ve always felt that hlkl was broken and should have instead been jkj

259460
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that
i suggest using nhibernate with postgresql
you can do all your testing and development on sqlite so you don t need to have an instance of postgresql running on your dev machine

i use iis all the time it s pretty easy to setup and you guys are already doing that.
i know at one point i had an issue with authentication not working as expected on cassini built in development server also if you need to test things like isapi plugins a re-writer for example i m not sure how that s done on cassini
the constantly changing port is also rather disconcerting to me

cassini	iis
the constantly changing port is also rather disconcerting to me
also for each web project in your solution it fires up another instance of a cassini server and each one takes anywhere from 20 to 50 mb of memory
i use iis all the time it s pretty easy to setup and you guys are already doing that.

cassini	iis	cassini	iis
the other thing that s a pretty big gotcha is debugging web services is much easier using iis and vdirs rather than separate cassini instances
as i stated here your developers need to be aware that cassini runs as the local user which is typically an admin account for developers
the development will be able to access any file or resource that their account can which is quite different from what they will see on an iis 6 server

cassini	iis
here s a link to how this is accomplished debugging asp.net is a bit different though and i m not sure if this will work for you
if you are debugging locally using the light weight web server cassini you can apply this trick to cassini itself
if you are debuggin directly on a web server though inside of iis i don t know how to get this trick to work but hopefully it will lead you in the right direction

ubuntu	debian
cli is super powerful much more than the command prompt on windows i know about powershell... from a gui perspective i typically have the terminal cli running anyway from a debian ubuntu perspective start stop processes sudo etc init.d apache stop or sudo etc init.d apache start text editors gedit gui - gnome kate gui - kde vim cli or nano cli processes running ps -aux terminate process add a package sudo apt-get install php5-cli upgrade patch a system there is a whole lot of information here and a large variety of options to choose from
i would recommend going with a linux distro that has a friendly community ubuntu centos debranded free rhel or rhel you pay them to help you
there is definitely going to be a lot of value for you to play around with a distribution over a weekend on a virtual machine or spare machine at home work

firefox	safari
a short tutorial that demonstrates mixing xul javascript and other technologies to update a website
lastly here s a good lifehacker tutorial on firefox extensions add-ons which shows you much of the above for a simple example and then how to package it as an .xpi so others can easily add it to and manage it from their firefox
i don t have any insight into safari but it s based on webkit and there should be some resources on customizing it similar to how you d use xul on firefox

299849
firefox	safari
i see this behaviour on firefox for example not safari for what that s worth
you can reload the page and bypass the cache on firefox using ctrl - shift - r and you ll see the check value doesn t carry a normal ctrl - r will grab the info from the cache however edit i was able to disable this server side on firefox setting a cache control header cache-control no-store this seems to disable the remember form values feature of firefox

postgresql	mysql
ecpg will do with c++ that is was not the case for some other preprocessors .
you should have a look at c preprocessors that exists traditionaly with databases ecpg for postgresql pro c for oracle .
which lets you embed straight sql directly in your source files or an orginal system for mysql

312468
firefox	safari
instead if you want to read the inside size use clientwidth clientheight instead of offsetwidth offsetheight or measure the offsetwidth of a block inside the one with the scrollbar
document.body.offsetwidth returns the innerwidth value from left hand side to the left side of the vertical scrollbar in firefox
not for me it doesn t it returns the same value as ie opera konqueror and safari

320820
awt	swing
however awt and swing objects allocate some amount of native resources that need to be freed
furthermore the awt thread treats the windows as top-level objects preventing them from being garbage collected and the jvm from terminating
thus when you are done with your window you need to dispose of it which frees the native resources that it has allocated

323809
firefox	safari
dammit that was the property i was looking for
as the others said you can use firebug and that will sort you out no worries on firefox
chrome safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to firebug s console so your code should be portable across those browsers

326953
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
mysql exempts schema modifications from transactions
i have a postgresql background so that s an obvious thing to do begin a transaction do some stuff commit or rollback -- postgresql isn t picky about what do some stuff is
you can find a few bugs on this if you look through mysql s bug base

cassini	iis	cassini	iis
i ve had problems with security thread.currentprincipal etc on cassini that just disappeared when i started debugging against iis
probably not relevant to this discussion but be careful testing debugging on cassini
its threading model is different from iis

343797
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools
having automatically generated id tags that show a sensible version number is impossible to do with dscm tools like bazaar because everybody s line of development can be different from all others
so somebody could refer to version 1.41 of a file but your version 1.41 of that file is different

349968
postgresql	mysql
you can certainly make a case against mysql since some of the most important features in regard to data safety have been added only recently
if you re concerned about that use postgresql instead
as for the language you write your app in php has definitely proven to be able to run extremely large and complex systems

350855
anjuta	kdevelop
looks promising
then there are some others where i cannot tell you how they are since i ve not tested them including anjuta for the gnome desktop and code blocks written with wxwidgets it s quite cross-platform
if all you want is a gui for the compiler and a symbol browser you could also use geany which is very fast and includes an embedded terminal like kdevelop

353563
cassini	iis
you will also need to add a script mapping in the application configuration for .jss to the aspnet_isapi.dll in windows microsoft.net framework vxxxx directory
iis6 doesn t do the intergrated pipeline that is intrinsic to cassini and is default in iis7
edit details in iis manager open application properties

google-chrome	safari
if you have the necessary resources i would advise to look into fixing it up
google-chrome uses webkit a fairly standard rendering engine
safari uses it also and it doesn t sound like webkit is going away

373684
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve noticed that there can sometimes be problems where using a font like arial it shows up fine in firefox google-chrome ie but on safari it can cause a line to wrap because the font is slightly bigger
safari uses mac fonts but google-chrome would use windows fonts

376065
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
then apply ie-specific fixes
hopefully it ll render ok in google-chrome and safari
the reason is that there are fixes available to make ie work properly but not many to make firefox behave badly

vim	emacs
same environment will work on solaris as well but this is of course force you to use vim as editor i pretty sure that emacs can work with both ctags and cscope as well
you might want give a try to vim it s a bit hard at first but soon you can t work another way
the most efficient editor imho

google-chrome	firefox
including a script tag which would load fire off your javascript code
for a basic extension you would place your code in the google-chrome content directory of the extension
you would hook this content into firefox using an overlay

407475
google-chrome	firefox
now that gmail suggests people switch from ie to firefox and google-chrome i m guessing we ll see ie lose more and more market share to those browsers
google-chrome doesn t have much of a user-base now but i can imagine that will change

awt	swing
finally you might also want to check out swt the gui toolkit used for eclipse and an alternative to both awt and swing which is somewhat of a return to the awt idea of accessing native widgets through java
awt is a java interface to native system gui code present in your os
it will not work the same on every system although it tries

408830
awt	swing
features of widgets that aren t the same on every platform might not be supported or worse they might work differently on each platform
people used to invest lots of effort to get their awt applications to work consistently across platforms - for instance they may try to make calls into native code from java
because awt uses native gui widgets your os knows about them and handles putting them in front of each other etc. whereas swing widgets are meaningless pixels within a window from your os s point of view

409472
firefox	safari
also the resource inspector in webkit browsers like safari or chrome will do the same for you
there is a firefox add-in called lori life-of-request info which does this it displays the total number of bytes and other stats on the toolbar and if you right click on it it offers to copy the detailed stats to the clipboard which contains the urls themselves
it works for ajax requests i am not sure about swf though

412091
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
mysql has improved a lot with its later versions but postgresql still beats it in every category
for any application that wants to use an open source database the hands-down answer is postgresql
it s a lot more enterprise-ready than mysql not to mention that it follows the sql standard a lot better

412292
vmware	virtualbox
there is also sun s virtualbox which is free and the latest version is rather nice but i haven t looked at how slow disk operations are yet
with vmware disk operations are slower
for php development i doubt it would be a problem but you d definitely notice it if you are compiling a large c++ project

416189
firefox	safari	firefox	safari
a simple browsermatch safari nokeepalive in the apache configuration did the trick
using mod_wsgi made the problem go away for firefox
limiting my research to an interaction problem between apache and safari i stumbled upon this bug report for apache that describes something very similar to what is happening and it is apparently still open

417012
awt	swing
this allowed the awt to rely heavily on the paint subsystem in each native platform
... with the introduction of lightweight components in jdk 1.1 a lightweight component is one that reuses the native window of its closest heavyweight ancestor the awt needed to implement the paint processing for lightweight components in the shared java code
as swing is implemented in java it does have some performance disadvantage however i hear that performance has improved in recent releases of java

bazaar	git
it will allow you to check out code from your subversion repositories develop independently with local history and check your code back in to subversion as and when you need to
take a look at bazaar
it s rather less daunting than git and has a useful-looking interface to subversion repositories via bzr-svn

cassini	iis	cassini	iis
to work around it you can set your project to use a local iis installation instead - that will give you more control over directory browsing default documents etc
i assume you re talking about cassini the one visual studio comes with for development - if so then you re out of luck because you can t change the default document it uses or not in any way i know of anyway

firefox	safari
normal or break-word. this is currently supported in ie safari and firefox 3.1 alpha
with older and current versions of firefox there is no standard way google was my friend of doing it
some suggest using a small script that adds in the middle of the word

439744
firefox	safari
on the plus side it s trivial to just use the constructor that takes a string instead
you don t even have to convert the numeric month into a string on firefox at least so i was hoping a naive implementation would work
however after trying it out it works successfully in firefox chrome and opera but fails in konqueror invalid date safari invalid date and ie nan

google-chrome	firefox
values are normalized after the fastest result per browser to make it easier to compare which method is faster conclusion when i did this test 3 years ago -a was fastest but now math.abs x is faster in firefox
in google-chrome abs a and -a got the same time and it was only 3 ms difference to the slowest method when i tested it with 10 000 000 numbers
my recommendation use math.abs a

444369
firefox	safari
for best results use opera 9.2x- not 9.5+ safari or konqueror on this page
it partially works in firefox nested functions are not tidied meaning that most scripts you want to tidy still end up unreadable and fails to reformat code in ie and icab 3-
since you can always keep a copy of opera 9.2 on your computer as well as whatever the current version is i recommend you use opera and keep a copy of it around for use with jstidy

458776
awt	swing
i think a swing awt component must have focus for this to work
you ll want to hook in the java awt event queue to be absolutely sure you can get a global jvm wide keypress
use i think there may be other ways to accomplish global key presses with action maps

firefox lets you use different profiles

i was not able to duplicate it in webkit-based browsers chrome and safari
antonio i m afraid that the problem is in firefox it self

mysql is easy to set up fast for oltp and generally takes the approach of doing few things and doing them well
postgresql is kind of the opposite -- it s a database researcher s favorite playground which means it has a dozen different join strategies storage engines advanced optional packages and all kinds of stuff
it s slower than mysql when doing things mysql does well and blows it out of the water when doing things mysql just doesn t know how to do see above with hash joins

quicksort	mergesort
mergesort is still a pretty good solution for large data sets or other data structures like linked lists as your experiments confirm
one of the advantages of quicksort for relatively small array sizes is just an artifact of hardware implementation
on arrays quicksort can be done in-place meaning that you re reading from and writing to the same area of memory

497933
quicksort	mergesort
you can see both of these behaviors in your example implementations
as a result for relatively small datasets quicksort is more likely to get cache hits and therefore just tends to run faster on most hardware
