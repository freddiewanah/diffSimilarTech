6000378
cdr	cons
cdr returns the tail of the list which is a list assuming the input is a list and not a cons cell
you probably want to use cadr instead short-hand for car cdr foo

6003784
comm	grep
comm -3 file1-sorted.txt file2-sorted.txt | sed s t the sed command is needed to remove a leading tab inserted by comm
if the files are huge but must also be sorted comm may be preferable to the more general grep solution proposed by ivan since it operates line by line and thus would not need to load the entirety of file2.txt into memory or search it for each line

6007920
google-chrome	firefox
the buttons are both not working for me in google-chrome while on firefox the first link is working and the second not.
the thing is that the home page on firefox is sending the cpu load to 100 and i see you have loads of javascripts on the home

6008297
cassini	iis
you are probably using the default visual studio web developer server cassini which doesn t allow one to access the site from anywhere else than the localhost
the easiest way around this is to change from the web developer server to iis express

6008350
cassini	iis
microsoft strongly suggest that we developers stop using cassini as our web server for debugging
iis express lets you not only take the full advantages of iss such as ssl but enable full access for any machine on your local network acting on port 80 or any other you would like

6009203
union	distinct
intersect requires the same column output and is used like union or except not in the where clause just join onto the udf if you need to split m.productname if you can t fix the design use cross apply however join and intersect give different results if parameter has duplicated values
add a distinct to the udf for example to get around this

6012285
uiview	calayer
never-the-less it is evident that uiview is somehow overriding the implicit animation mechanism of its calayer property
so if you want implicit animations you must use calayer s directly not just suppose that because uiview has a calayer property that it will behave the same

6013131
gridview	datalist	gridview	repeater
when pressed a nested gridview repeater or datalist is used in place of a custom row
i find that jamming extra rows into a gridview in the above fashion is hard to maintain whereas nested gridviews or datalist are not too bad once you ve done it once

6020183
collabnet	svn
you can also use the collabnet one choose collabnet subversion command-line client from the link it is great that you want to try out with command line as well since eventhough gui clients like tortoise make your life much simpler it is good to have the basic command line knowledge to understand what is happening and also for that situation where you cannot do something without the command line believe me these situations do occur
like others have said tortoisesvn does not come with the standard svn client and here is the reason it doesn t - so you need to install a svn command line client for you to be running svn commands

6022991
innodb	myisam
the innodb storage engine
generally i go with innodb if my table will have more updates inserts delete statements then select statements or i want relational database with foreign keys if not i stick with myisam

6022991
innodb	myisam
generally i go with innodb if my table will have more updates inserts delete statements then select statements or i want relational database with foreign keys if not i stick with myisam
if you go with innodb you will give up select statement performance and the ability to do full text search indexes

6023360
spaces	delimiter
you also need a spaces before the closing square-bracket which isn t a command but is a delimiter
despite what it might look like is actually a command called test so should be note the spaces between the and the next bit of code

6025198
build.gradle	gradlew
it becomes this way you do not have to specify the testcompile dependency in each subproject s build.gradle file
however when i gradlew build the actual classpath used for javac only includes the direct dependencies of projectb and the jar generated by building projecta

6027659
haskell	ocaml
haskell implicitly creates selector functions for field names
ocaml doesn t do this

6027806
viewdidload	viewwillappear
check to make sure that your viewdidload method isn t making any assumptions about the availability of data and that your viewdidunload method isn t accidentally deleting data that the newly re-called viewdidload will need
similarly ensure that your viewwillappear method isn t being thwarted by something in your viewdidunload method

6030521
google-chrome	firefox
run google-chrome with the --plugin-startup-dialog flag and when your plugin process starts google-chrome will give you the process id of the plugin process and then pause the plugin process and wait for a debugger to attach
google-chrome and also firefox runs plugins out of process so you aren t actually attaching to the process that has your plugin code

6031871
mayavi	matplotlib
as a quick example modified from one of the mayavi gallery examples
just to elaborate on my comment above matplotlib s 3d plotting really isn t intended for something as complex as isosurfaces

6033099
punctuation	words
here s a short algorithm when a comment is posted convert the string to lowercase and split it into words split on spaces and optionally dashes punctuation
in a words table store each words with an id if it s not already in the table

6034182
serializable	deserialization
it has already solved the serializable problem for c# developers and there s fairly few reasons not to use it
the only problem i had with it related to its inflexibility with using interface objects in deserialization from json but unless you are doing unit testing on this class that shouldn t be an issue and it doesn t look like you are

6034305
email	dkim
1 start with an spf record and a dkim if you can that lets mail servers know to expect email from your servers 2 first you need to put the recipients in the bcc field so that it not each user has the email addresses of 49 other users on your system
one step further is to do each email separately putting only the recipient in the to field

6035844
client-side	server-side
since an ajax request to the server typically returns xml or json to a response and not html which is then parsed by client-side javascript there is no point at which spring can bind to the request form and add error messages to the content
you can t since tags like are evaluated server-side and embed error messages elements in the html content of the http response

6037518
notepad++	scite
the best of these is probably notepad++ which has way more than 4000 lines of code
it comes with a general public licence which is not compatible with the project i m currently working on so i ended up using the scite editor instead

6038368
mp3	ogg
loading the mp3 with audio doesn t work in opera of course anyway since opera doesn t support that format
is served as audio ogg which is good

6039100
visualvm	yourkit
if method a just calls other methods but very little time is actually spent in it it doesn t show up much in visualvm even if the methods a calls spend lots of time
yourkit offers early access ea builds which do not require a purchase

6039295
vsto	add-in
vsto doesn t actually care which template you are writing for only that your add-in is a vsto 3.0 add-in
2 reasons that i can see f5 debugging support and to make sure you do not access a new api if you do go down the only 2010 add-in road i suggest you do a compile of the solution against the microsoft.office.interop.outlook v12 pia which will show you any new api s that you are accessing

6039578
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox tim down s solution worked for me but not in google-chrome as contentwindow in not available
my revised code below which iterates though any frames on the page is working in gmail for me in firefox google-chrome and safari

6039774
n-gram	words
as you suggested you could use a jsgf to test out how it does for recognition if it doesn t use the n-gram models but instead does a simple grammar give it like twenty words including spaghetti and pencil
this way you can see if it is perhaps the language model which makes it difficult to recognize these words and it can do okay if it considers all the words to have equal probability

6040006
postgresql	mysql
i m no postgresql expert but i ve noticed the same behaviour
my understanding is that postgresql doesn t have a default order per se whereas mysql is reliable - as far as i know - in ordering by the primary key

6040006
postgresql	mysql
my understanding is that postgresql doesn t have a default order per se whereas mysql is reliable - as far as i know - in ordering by the primary key
postgresql s data format maybe means that modified records are shifted to the end

6040214
jboss	glassfish
you will need a different implementation though like jboss
the actual ee installation consists of a bunch of .jars in the libs folder i m not sure about the exact name as i don t have glassfish installed

6042027
profiling	debugging
in eclipse debugging configuration create maven build debugging config goals -dmaven.surefire.debug test profiling myconfigprofile weblogic or for a specific testsuite goals -dmaven.surefire.debug -dtest com.myorg.mypkg mytestsuite.java test profiling myconfigprofile weblogic n.b
don t put the props in jre jvm arguments as this doesn t seem to pause create additional remote java application config host localhost port 5005 running debugging your mvn build will stop and listen on 5005 by default

6045260
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml s awesome for parsing well formed xml but s not so good if you ve got non-xhtml html
if that s the case then go for beautifulsoup as suggested by systemizer

6047005
innodb	myisam
one of the main performance advantages of innodb is row-level locking as opposed to table-level locking of myisam which means that multiple insert update queries against the same table won t block each other unless really necessary
however innodb does not perform well at all out of the box you really need to fine-tune your mysql configuration for your specific site

6051438
kde	gnome
the other thing if you re particular about your desktop is that kde s konsole might not fit all too well within gnome
the gnome terminal doesn t have such features but if you re open to change you could try konsole it has some nice save session options you could find helpful though nothing about re-opening accidentally closed tabs as far as i know

6052769
jsf	seam
how to run seam 2 with jsf 2 - till seam 2.3 comes out
we re using seam 2.2.2 and we simply cannot stomach the thought of using jsf1 any more now that jsf2 is available and provides some decent composite comp functionality

6055748
onfocus	onblur
i had assumed that these onblur events would run before the onfocus onfocusin but it seems that this is not the case
the onblur events then seem to close the dropdownlist when applying the class change

6056344
implements	extends
see mdc for reference but if you look at the source of jquery see src manipulation.js you ll see that this method is very small so you can just implements it directly
in the next example i will use extends instead but it s not a must

6056424
super	self
now still i was not able to detect any shake motion so all i had to do was to make my viewcontroller the first responder and for that here s the code that i used - void viewdidappear bool animated super viewdidappear animated
self becomefirstresponder

6057934
inline	inlining
the reason is that you may have a teammate that sees approach b and decides that when you need to add more javascript to the render doing it inline is the correct approach
inlining javascript can according to what i ve read be used for very simple one one-liners but even then it s not recommended

6058187
cocos2d-x	corona
cocos2d-x is an awesome framework and the best one to use if you need the flexibility of a native library and or absolutely need features not supported in corona
it is not a case of objective-c or cocos2d-x

6060260
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie indeed act like you mentioned but google-chrome do not and i d guess other webkit browsers would do the same. in google-chrome clicking the back button will land you where you want to go the previous url of the parent frame
google-chrome to not add iframe url changes in the back button history

6060260
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome to not add iframe url changes in the back button history
sadly i ve found no way to force ie and firefox to replicate this so i used the ajax post approach suggested above by arun

6061653
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
safari 4.0.5 opera 10
on windows 7 native machine i had internet explorer 9 google-chrome 11 safari 5 opera 11 and for firefox i install the following app natively too personally i would not go back further than 5 years with compatibility other than ie for government networks unless you have a specific requirement i split google-chrome opera across years as i decided there were just to many releases

6062780
comparator	comparable
basically every class that implements comparable gets a comparator ... -method
a.compareto b will return for the cases where you can t implement comparable or do not want to there is a class comparator which can be given to the sort methods sparately

6064649
super	self
this is essential because without it the super invocation wouldn t be possible the self value is used by the compiler to send the invocation becomes objc_msgsendsuper self selector init
yes self already has a value when your initializer starts

6066263
vb6	vba
vb6 applications and vba applications which are heavily com based with massive potential for com interference com settings overwriting each other and becoming inconsistent have been known to trigger several mysterious self-repair problems most of which have not been properly explained
this can also happen on launch of visual basic 6 vb6 or visual studio and many other applications

6066686
spaces	delimiter
you ve got as less than and for templates and as shift remember not long ago when we had to put a spaces in between nested template declarations
so it turns out that the guy at nvidia who came up with this syntax was not a language expert and happened to choose the worst possible delimiter then tripled it well you re going to have trouble

6068112
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu for example uses .deb files to manage installation of software
.deb files are not specific to debian though and can be used on any compatible nix platform

6069408
inline	inlining
factors you say you re designing application level code not libraries so you don t currently have to worry about other teams getting dependent on your code nor minimise their need to recompile versus just relink by keeping implementation out of line but if you re writing good code that has any potential to become useful to other teams then you might find yourself wishing you d kept implementation private inline versus out-of-line typically represents about an order-of-magnitude overhead for trivial data get set functions.
if you have functions that are called repeatedly from performance critical code then you ve reason to prefer inlining in-header implementation especially if intermingled with the declarations can often obfuscate the api but sometimes actually makes the code more self-documenting localisation and removed redundancy of combining declaration definitions definitely removes potential for typos errors and can often improve productivity bottom line if you re finding yourself doing it more and more then it s obviously working for you and there s no particular reason to think you re about to get burnt

6071351
multiplying	multiplication
the same goes for the following lines but here you should be aware that you multiplying al with al which i assume is not the desired operation
as a solution you could rename every occurence of bh or bl to dh dl or ch cl and change the factor in the multiplication accordingly

6072388
opera	firefox
to sum up i have tried 2 approaches listed here in user javascript programming opera 11.01 this one didn t work creating multiline strings in javascript this worked fairly well i have also figured out how to make it look good in notepad++ source view creating multiline strings in javascript so i recommend the working approach for opera user js users
unlike what the author was saying it doesn t work on firefox or opera

6072388
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari
unlike what the author was saying it doesn t work on firefox or opera
only on ie google-chrome and safari

6075773
super	self
super is for accessing stuff from base classes but instance variables are as the name says part of an instance not part of that instance s class
after the base class s __init__ ran the derived object has the attributes set there some_var as it s the very same object as the self in the derived class __init__

6077458
innodb	myisam
on innodb this is not a problem
if you create a view on myisam tables selects and updates are mutually exclusive so a select update on the table would block any update select on the view

6078471
inline	inlining
the problem is that that particular copy can only be elided if the code is actually inline not only if it is marked as inline but actually inline if a function call is required then the copy cannot be elided
if the standard allowed that copy to be elided when the code is inline it would imply that the behavior of a program would differ due to the compiler and not user code --the inline keyword does not force inlining it only means that multiple definitions of the same function do not represent a violation of the odr

6079323
vim	emacs
emacs+vimpulse is awesome but i think its right workflow is to liberally use emacs commands in combination to vim shortcuts
for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q . also emacs commands are accessed through alt+x not commands

6079323
vim	emacs
for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q . also emacs commands are accessed through alt+x not commands
though vimpulse support a few important vim commands they are there just for compatibility

6082342
coalesce	isnull
strangely this is one place where you can t use the more standards compliant coalesce v3 resembles v1
you can force it back to being not null by wrapping it in an isnull v1 s value column is marked as nullable v2 s isn t

6082776
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
addition and subtraction work just the same
multiplication is slightly different because i 2 isn t -1 but +5 here

6084436
nhibernate	queryover
it s not complete and i didn t test it nhibernate and the missing operatorprojection part 1
using queryover this is a bit of a problem because we need to use projections when using sql functions

6084528
exponent	modulo
leading zero byte required because modulo is 2 511 02 03 01 00 01 public exponent 0x10001 leading zero byte not required because exponent is 2 23 02 41 00 b5 87 .
65 data bytes private exponent 0xb587.

6089902
super	implements	super	extends
as no no-arg constructor exists in thread you would need to explicitly call one of the public constructors in a super cal
when you would implements runnable instead of extends thread you wouldn t have thos problem

6090084
org.json	gson
i ve never seen org.json mixed with gson
usually gson replaces org.json it s not meant to be used together

6090202
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview
so expanding mbyd s answer in your oncreate method first call setcontentview then findviewbyid
you have to call it from your activity s oncreate method as the resources will not have been made available before that point

6090478
udp	tcp
as of version 10.3 the flash player browser plugin still only supports tcp sockets not udp so networking will be slower than it would be on a pc game like battlefield or call of duty
that said in our tests it s totally normal to get a 30ms ping with tcp sockets in flash i ve seen as low as 2ms to japan and that is plenty fast enough to do real-time twitch games

6090636
expression-blend	silverlight
there is a learning curve - xaml - but with the right tools visual studio 2010 and expression-blend you can learn a lot from what is provided out of the box
silverlight is not just for mobile development

6091601
vsto	add-in
vsto is actually a set of managed .net extensions which make writing add-in for office far easier
for external interaction vsto is not used at all though you can still reference vsto libraries and use some of the helpers if you wanted to

6091614
vsto	add-in
there is also a useful powershell script which will do this sort of stuff for you and is handy when figuring out when vsto not working at get started by running vstotroubleshooter.ps1 setdbg which will setup the vsto_suppressdisplayalerts env variable for you
actually it is quite easy set the environmental variable vsto_suppressdisplayalerts to 0 before running the office application then office will display exceptions and not kill your add-in during startup when there are issues

6093362
gitolite	gitosis
if you want ssh access control while only using a single system user like gitosis offers then you should use gitolite which can be combined with the git-http-backend cgi script
gitosis and webdav do not work together in any way

6093489
ssl	https
first ssl session is established then all http data are wrapped into secured ssl packets before sending and after receiving
https runs over ssl as it s name suggests http-over-ssl not ssl over http

6096688
floating-point	fractions
not being able to represent decimal fractions accurately is something that surprises most people and which they consequently consider a great disadvantage of floating-point formats when in reality it s a disadvantage of binary formats and they are not at all suprised at not being able to represent numbers like 1 3 accurately
from the floating-point guide why floating-point numbers are needed since computer memory is limited you cannot store numbers with infinite precision no matter whether you use binary fractions or decimal ones at some point you have to cut off

6098108
implements	extends
you db tables will implements this interface
your new class will also implements this interface but not extends zend_db_table

6101070
cassini	iis
ok that explains it - visual studio by default uses the built-in cassini web server unless you ve already switched to using iis express - and that server doesn t support anything but plain http
cassini doesn t support net.tcp and anything like that

6102059
highcharts	fusioncharts
i can also assist you in implementing the older highcharts.js by particularly detecting android based browsers and doing selective loading of older highcharts js files
there is also a small extension of fusioncharts that gracefully handles this replacement of older highcharts for devices that does not support svg or vml but supports canvas

6104047
implements	extends
then implements onclick like this
your onitemclicklistener should not extends activity

6105707
udp	tcp
note also that this does not apply to udp - without some kind of application layer preventative udp is at significant risk from blind spoofing
if the attacker can see the replies coming back say because he is sniffing the uplink or the local network of your server then this also doesn t apply - spoofing tcp connections in this case is not just possible but trivial

6106528
phpunit	simpletest
unfortunately cakephp isn t designed to work together with phpunit
cakephp has switched to using simpletest and you ll have one of two choices refactor your tests to work with simpletest or modify the core to use phpunit

6108723
inline	inlining
for example most compilers will automatically inline member functions that are fully defined in the header if the code is isn t long and or too complex
however this don t happen for example in debug mode for visual studio in debug the debug informations still need to map the binary code of the functions so it avoid inlining but will still inline functions marked inline because the user required it

6108723
inline	inlining
if you mark something inline you just tell the compiler that if it find it hard but not impossible to inline it should inline it
as inlining depends on both contexts of the caller and the callee there is no rule . what s often advised is to simply ignore explicitly mark function inline but in two cases if you need to put a function definition in a header it just have to be inlined

6112438
uiview	subviews
now add your subviews on the uiview
your subviews will not take the alpha property anymore

6112544
implements	extends
if you re talking about some skin specific graphics which is not represented as declaration in a host component then you can implements two strategies your hide reveal logic is just a part of view but no the component functionality
in this case you should extends your skin and place hide reveal logic there

6113727
google-chrome	firefox
for instance this persepctive demo will draw without such white lines in google-chrome but will have the ugly white lines in firefox because the two browsers decided to do anti-aliasing differently
because of this some things look nice in google-chrome and not firefox and vice versa

6113952
memcached	apc
using sessions apc memcached cookies etc does not guarantee that you will be able to hold the limit
if you use apc or memcached or any other system designed for caching your memory limit might run out and the key you stored will vanish thus allowing the user 25 new searches

6114626
ssl	https
so i will not need a ssl cert for the nettcpbinding as that is handled by windows security and is inheriently secure when using transport security
when using a wshttpbinding i will still need to secure the transport with a ssl certificate which i had done as mentioned previously and exposed the binding via https

6115849
client-side	server-side
the fix is simply to make sure it is enabled server-side the default then disable it see blow or enable it see above using client-side code
i have also found that if you disable the listbox server-side then use client side code to enable the list box using code like the following then you cannot get the selected items server side

6116030
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
no the fact that you are handling an exception does not make it a checked exception if it is a runtimeexception
yes checked exceptions are subclasses of java.lang.exception unchecked-exception are subclasses of java.lang.runtimeexception calls throwing checked exceptions need to be enclosed in a try block or handled in a level above in the caller of the method

6118047
.htaccess	httpd.conf
do a config check and then restart gracefully which doesn t take the server offline and reloads configuration alternatively this code can go into an .htaccess which is less preferable
using apache to create a reverse proxy using mod_rewrite in the main httpd.conf under the relevant if applicable first line checks for www.mydomain.com or mydomain.com second line identifies the id portion of the url if the first two conditions are met the request is made by apache to www.proxydomain.com newurl and then returned to the client

6119232
rar	zip
rar not so much
zip is easy

6121614
pascal	delphi
note that this directive is specific to the free pascal compiler delphi does not support it
to ensure that the record packing alignment padding is as gcc expects add packrecords c to your pascal source

6122775
bash	subshell
an excerpt from man bash each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process in a subshell
and subshell cannot change the variable in parent

6123519
implements	extends
these lines are never going to work because neither of them implements the interfaces ihttprequest or ihttpresponse
to make an inbuilt class implements your own interfaces you will have to extends it derive a new class from it i m not sure exactly why you are trying to do this with these two classes but typically you would only pass them around as an interface if you wanted to change how they are implemented

6126127
udp	tcp
udp is not reliable
for a reliable transport layer tcp ip suite protocol see the tcp packet

6126360
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
opera supports the file api from 11.1 but doesn t support the dnd
so you can use drag and drop file upload in firefox 3.6+ safari 6.0+ google-chrome 9.0+

6126445
spaces	linefeed
non-breaking spaces is not included.
add s as another choice to your regex to allow whitespace characters #x20 t n r that is regular spaces tab linefeed carriage return

6129698
email	dkim
when you are setting up your own email service to send large amount of email you should probably keep these in mind make sure your spf records are accurate and they stay that way incorporate dkim to complement your spf records
they aren t widely recognized yet but isps like aol will bounce you away if you don t have dkim validate the html you use in your email so that you aren t flagged as looking spammy warm up your ip by sending out solid transactional email over time and not have people report it as spam use external services to check out the status of your ip

6129698
email	dkim
they aren t widely recognized yet but isps like aol will bounce you away if you don t have dkim validate the html you use in your email so that you aren t flagged as looking spammy warm up your ip by sending out solid transactional email over time and not have people report it as spam use external services to check out the status of your ip
i always advise people to go for third party email providers because it will save you headaches going forward - you can just expect the email to be sent and arrive at the inbox and you won t have to worry about anything

6129823
lxml	elementtree
having played with linq to xml in .net as well i much prefer working python and lxml another remark lxml has some good support for html even ill-formed as well including facilities for filling out html forms i m not sure if that is what you meant with put results on html form however
look at lxml more specifically the combination of the elementtree interface an easier xml model api than dom much like the xdocument and xelement classes attributes and text are even simpler because they are not separate nodes which may look strange at first if you re working with mixed content models a lot and you re used to dom interfaces the e-factory of lxml.builder like functional construction in linq to xml but even better

6130277
uilabel	nsstring
you can easily change the uilabel to an nsstring and change the property to so you can set new text to it with
you are not initializing the uilabel well as far as i can see

6130654
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
i just moved my code that needed the dimensions of the frame bounds from viewdidload to viewwillappear and it worked properly
i ve been stumbling over the same problem and with some diagnostic work i discovered that the view s bounds and frame do not accurately reflect the landscape orientation in viewdidload when the device is held in landscape when the view controller is pushed onto the stack but do so correctly in viewwillappear and viewdidappear

6130967
daemons	systemd
if your daemons is a pure native application for example started through the systemd s inittab not something running within the context of an apk then android will never kill it
at least in my situation which is exactly this the only time my daemons has ever terminated is just prior to my fixing a sigsegv

6131885
skip-lists	tree
i would consider a skip-lists as a better alternative data structure
sortedlist and sorteddictionary are implemented internally as binary search tree and could ideally give you o log n performance for a min requires walking the tree but not enumerating the whole list

6132481
google-chrome	firefox
if you press any key in google-chrome the popup will open because it allows popups from keydown handlers
in ie and firefox the popup will be blocked becuase those browsers do not allow popups from keyboard events

6133331
backgrounding	multitasking
multitasking where is the new backgrounding agents come into play
backgrounding agents are a separate assembly distributed with your app that can be set to run while your app is not running

6135485
.htaccess	httpd.conf
.htaccess will not require a server restart but php.ini and the other apache conf files will
there are 2 different places you can set it php.ini .htaccess httpd.conf virtualhost include php_value post_max_size 20m php_value upload_max_filesize 20m which one to use depends on what you have access to

6135960
octal	decimal
octal numbers a numbers which go from 0 to 7
what you have to do and is best practice is to say you have decimal numbers not octal

6137103
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
the best documentation is the code but you ll find an overview of the request format in these slides requestfactory contrary to gwt-rpc uses a symmetric json-based protocol based on autobean s json serialization where client and server can communicate even when not compiled from the same code well depending on the changes you made between versions of course because they pass around class and property names
edit brian slesinsky just documented the protocol by reverse-engineering the code first gwt-rpc protocol is asymmetric so that it s always optimized for the client-side fast to deserialize something coming from the server and fast to serialize something to send to it

6137418
freemarker	velocity
see also 16.4 velocity freemarker
you jsp code can be rewritten in freemarker as follows note that spring library for freemarker doesn t have specifal element for form so you need to use ordinary html form and prepend model attribute name to paths of individual fields

6138628
equals	icomparable
the former is needed for sorting because just knowing which objects are of equals value doesn t help you putting them in a specific order
because icomparable allows to determine if an object is smaller or bigger than another object whereas iequatable helps finding out whether two objects are equals

6139051
prepare	execute
when you use the setters in prepare statement it encloses the parameters in single quotes
i am not sure why the executequery works. you will see a similar exception if you directly execute the following query

6139683
dictionary	map
and std map shouldn t be compared to dictionary
std map maintains keys in sorted order because it is a balanced tree dictionary solves a different problem

6140187
fgets	strcpy
so here is what happens when reading the last line fgets returns read_in_buffer not null pointer because there are characters read and no read error occurs
then the check feof fin returns true because eof already reached that makes this code never executed strcpy retreivedstring read_in_buffer

6141370
equals	compareto
you need to override equals and hashcode - hashmap doesn t use compareto which is meant for sorting
note that your compareto implementation is already broken as it s really only testing for equality

6145629
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
notice that content-type is text plain instead of video ogg http 1.1 200 ok date thu 26 may 2011 21 55 25 gmt server litespeed accept-ranges bytes connection close etag fa8cc4-4dde175c-0 last-modified thu 26 may 2011 09 03 24 gmt content-type text plain content-length 16420036 the html5 video plays for me in safari google-chrome and ie 9 but not firefox or ie 7-8
if you fix the mime-type issue it will play in firefox

6148332
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i did this in the head of my document updated does not work in safari or firefox but does work in ie8 and google-chrome
curious to know why because it s usually firefox or ie that don t play nice on their own and safari is webkit based like google-chrome

6149393
required	placeholder
i also took out all the tostring because they are not required
you must supply at least the same number of parameters or an array with at least the same number of elements as the highest placeholder value plus one placeholder values are zero indexed max placeholder value 3 you must supply at least four additional parameters

6150060
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you want to select all the content of an element contenteditable or not in google-chrome here s how
this will also work in firefox safari 3+ opera 9+ possibly earlier versions too and ie 9

6150399
implements	extends
the idea behind an interface is that the classes implements it must include the functionality of the interface
this doesn t mean they have to be limited to what is in the interface you can extends on it as much as you like it s perfectly reasonable to have methods that aren t part of the interface

6151359
plone	buildout
see for an example of a flat namespace plone package
works for me with buildout obviously this is not the result you expect though paster created a triple nested namespace package called myapp.plone.myapp - further note this app will not appear in add-ons in plone unless you add a genericsetup profile in myapp plone myapp configure.zcml like so then you should see finally there is nothing wrong with non-namespace packages they are just convention with pros cons over flat namespace packages and vice versa

6151458
google-chrome	firefox
if i inspect the html in google-chrome it looks like google-chrome is adding css to hide the image the images are displayed in firefox and also in google-chrome on mac
google-chrome on windows 7 is not displaying dynamic images

6152760
google-chrome	firefox
firebug was touching a service in firefox s google-chrome js privileged code space that was causing the worker to fail intermittently you can see the patch for it here as long as you do everything in accordance with the worker spec you shouldn t see this problem
as for the fix to firebug fx it should arrive in firefox 5 in late june

6152936
mvp	presenter
the main goal with mvp is decoupling of different aspects in the code
normally in javascript there are 3 major such aspects event handling dom manipulation server communication ajax calls for each of these concerns there s a corresponding term from mvp eventhandling presenter dom manipulation view ajax calls model since indeed it is not always simple to implement the 3 aspects an event bus may come in handy

6155805
lisp	prolog
it s structured like lisp lots of parens but it s designed for building expert systems
i haven t seen a problem that prolog solves that clips couldn t

6155879
backtracking	greedy
you re probably getting catastrophic backtracking
namely but not only because of your greedy sequences

6159829
swt	swing
currently the simplest way i can find to open this dialog is through swt not swing
swt s filedialog javadoc brings up this dialog

6162016
rtp	rtcp
in case you re also using mpeg4 the axis firmware is buggy and the absolute timestamps in rtcp sr are not reliable - in this case you have to synchronize the relative rtp timestamps to your clients wall clock
as ralf already said - the rtp timestamps are relative to a random clock - they are only useful for computing the difference between two frames or rtp-packets in general

6163496
svg	vml
you say you ve tried the svg approach and given up on it because it doesn t work in ie8
it s worth pointing out that while ie doesn t support svg it does support vml which is a competing vector graphics format

6163496
svg	vml
it s worth pointing out that while ie doesn t support svg it does support vml which is a competing vector graphics format
svg is now standardised so vml will fade away but older ies will continue to support it

6164301
rational-numbers	fractions
if your aspect ratio was 4 3 you could fill it with 4x3 squares of length width 4 height 3 or 8x6 squares of half that size or 12x9 squares of a third that size... if it is not a rational-numbers your task is impossible
you convert a fractions to lowest terms by factoring the numerator and denominator and removing all duplicate factor pairs

6164638
subtraction	addition
in your code the address of subtraction is first stored as local variable of the compatible type and then that variable is passed as argument to operation function
in case of addition it s address is not stored as local variable instead its passed as such to operation

6165124
thunk	trampolines
though technically to avoid a stack blowout you can 1 increase the stack size limit in languages which allow it or 2 eat a constant factor of extra work to virtualize your stack ick or 3 program in continuation-passing style which in effect also virtualizes your stack not sure the complexity of this but basically you will effectively take the deferred call chain from the stack of size n and de-facto stick it in n successively nested thunk functions.
though in some languages without tail-call optimization you may have to trampolines things to avoid a stack blowout

6165256
super	implements
i found out that the scrolling behavior is set in - void viewwillappear bool animated of the super instance
so be sure to implements like this and it doesn t matter if you use uiviewcontroller or uitableviewcontroller

6166137
haskell	ocaml
both are types with an essentially infinite number of distinct values though and against the grain of haskell s specifying arguments and results with finite types
i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term

6168698
jar	war
an executabele jar requires a class with a main method but a web application normally doesn t have any since that s the responsibility of the servlet container not the web application
normally a war is to be distributed as-is it s the serveradmin s responsibility to deploy it to a servlet container

6175240
uiview	subviews
now add your uiview as the subviews in your main view
create an uiview object set the frame property as much you require not the full size now create button add this as sunview to your newly created uiview

6176211
interpolation	splines
you will need to approximate the curve using an interpolation fitting scheme that depends on the problem and the curve shape and the known functional form
a splines might be appropriate or perhaps not

6176428
comparator	comparable
edit i just saw you have an has comparator logic instead of pure is comparable
that should be fixed remove the reference to the comparator from within data items - if not you re right - the tree might get broken.

6178737
shadowing	named
yes they happen to also be the named of actual concrete types but in this case you re shadowing that meaning
if you use your original named of m a and b the error becomes clearer m really does not take a type parameter.

6178768
charat	indexof
length will give you the length of a string charat someindex will give you the character at a given position so you can iterate the first string
indexof achar will give you the poisition a char in a string or -1 if it s not there

6180519
innodb	myisam
innodb extra lookup required to get to table data in innodb an extra lookup needs to be done because all secondary indexes refer to the pk and not to the rows themselves
myisam wasted space in myisam the penalty is not that great but you re still dragging along a 4 byte unused field that doesn t get used

6181566
google-chrome	firefox
see html 5 geo location prompt in google-chrome
works perfectly for me - with both google-chrome 11 and firefox 4.0.1 on win 7 make sure you ve not disabled location tracking in google-chrome because of security restrictions resources loaded with the file scheme are not allowed access to location

6185252
portrait	landscape
this happens only when i rotate the ipad simulator from portrait to landscape when theuipopover is already open
if i manually close it in portrait mode by clicking outside the popover or clicking the popover barbuttonitem on the left of the toolbar and then rotate the screen to landscape i do not face this issue.the left view of the splitviewcontroller is perfectly positioned

6190136
floating-point	fractions
it s because floating-point values are represented in the machine with binary exponents and 10 is not an even power of 2
thus some base-10 fractions turn into repeating fractions when converted

6191572
comparator	comparable
first of all ordering is akin to comparator not comparable
the scala equivalent to comparable is ordered

6191572
super	extends
the latter is equivalent to super -- which is not what you want
so with both these fixes in your code should look like this however this won t work for for instance since int does not extends ordered -- just like java s int does not extends comparable or anything else since it is not a class

6193550
irc	xmpp
couple of irc protocol s problems are that 1 the network has quite some trust on the tree of servers and 2 that changes to the network state require splits joins of clients
for rfcs and other technicalities see this comparison also includes psyc protocol for synchronous conferencing i ve never heard about it that supposedly has fixed some of the problems with irc protocol there is also xmpp but that does not do multicasting and may be more suitable to msn google talk type one-to-one chatting although the fb chat written in erlang uses it in addition to google talk

6199043
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
as no doubt you have noticed the old viewdidappear methods are not fired when the uimodalpresentationformsheet controller is dismissed
one can emulate the viewwillappear call by simply calling that method when you dismiss the controller but that isn t what you need

6199807
arp	icmp
try use arp for detect is host exists
actually berkeley sockets have not timeout for connect so you can not set it. icmp ping is not helpful i don t know why but if host not exists you spend around 1 second with ping

6200198
onresume	onpause
annoyingly i can t post a comment yet but i think you mean onresume not onrestart
your activity can be paused without being stopped which would cause onpause but not onrestart

6202826
udp	tcp
generally udp is a good idea for sending video stream data as losing video data usually can be tolerated
if you must not lose data consider using tcp as suggested

6203363
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
do not use multiple uiviewcontroller objects to control parts of a single view
the view controller is designed and intended to be used full-screen or as part of a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc

6208996
firefox	safari
except it is fine with firefox and explorer. i have spent most of my afternoon first with mac - safari and then with ms excel group
their conclusion is that it is a known bug between xl and mac and they are still working on it. i uploaded a .pdf to my web site link is and i was able to view the image with firefox but not with safari - i got the characters with safari

6209885
haskell	ocaml
the thing is that languages like haskell or ml tend to have some problems with that
i once did something similar to ocaml abused camlp4 and wrote some function that translates the p4 ast into some sexpr-like representation and the fun begins when you run into similar kinds of ast nodes that have different types because they re not really the same.

6210202
implements	extends
the first one gives me an empty string since this is the first page load there hasn t been yet any postback triggered with the __dopostback function. the second one gives me the uniqueid of the button that was pushed inside the user control this is the original and expected asp.net behavior. the third one gives me exactly what i passed as the first argument when i coded the method ie the clientid of the updatepanel. here s how i succeeded to implements my updatepanel use case assuming i m using the partial rendering mode. this is not perfect but it works as intended
if you don t want to extends the original updatepanel class you can also use this workaround thus you can examine the resulting id and add some conditional clauses to determine which code should execute

6210332
hex	binary
normaly you use hex notatition not binary because keeping track of so many digits is difficult
you can also use decimal but the charts that tell you which instructions have which codes are typically in hex notation

6211738
multiplying	multiplication
re-interprete the float input as an integer apply the hash function to produce an integer approximately uniformly distributed in 0 2 32 then multiplying this integer by 2 -32 to convert the resulting integer back to a float roughly uniformly distributed in 0 1
one suitable hash function which does not require multiplication is bob jenkin s mix which can be found here

6214493
client-side	server-side
this means doesn t work properly since variables that are included in will be treated as server-side variables and thus your client-side variable test is either considered as an undefined constant or a string without quotes
due to my knowledge server-side variables can not interact directly with client-sider variables without anything in between

6216396
firefox	safari
in firefox the images display and the inline css is not added
what i noticed was when i turned off all extensions in safari that the problem resolved

6216870
cocos2d-x	corona
a quick google search showed me that corona has costs associated with it for distribution - cocos2d-x does not
i can t speak for corona but cocos2d-x is just an obj-c library so you ll still have to know a bit of obj-c to get it going

6218120
d3.js	protovis
i m repeatedly annoyed that basic utilities like pv.sum or pv.mean don t have d3.js equivalents though some like .nest are shared across the two libraries
edit 10 1 12 d3.js has filled out its data utilities but there are still a few that protovis includes and d3.js doesn t pv.dict pv.numerate and pv.repeat

6218120
d3.js	protovis
finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions
protovis can re-render some or all of the visualization on demand but doesn t have any support for stepping through a limited-duration animation - you d have to code it all by hand with setinterval

6219337
tabcontrol	tabitem
an example template might look like this i would then be able to use your codepage class like this chances are you ll want a custom tabcontrol that overrides its container generation to return instances of your codepage instead of tabitem but that s another story
first of all your custom tabitem needs to override metadata so that the correct style is picked up based on your new type rather than your base class apologies - i ve used c# because i m not proficient enough in vb this will allow you to define a default style in your theme generic.xaml as such in this style you can define a template

6220980
trie	tree
see so question trie prefix tree in python for more info about implementations
there are a couple of trie implementations on python package index but they are not very good

6221977
oncreate	onstart
so you cannot change the image in oncreate
the activity is not visible until onstart runs

6223637
nhibernate	queryover
for any relationship that is not one-to-one nhibernate makes the assumption that the relationship could have 0 to many results thus uses a left join
i don t know about linq2nhibernate but in nh3 using queryover api you can specify the join types

6223658
dictionary	map
your python code actually translates to c++ pretty much directly python s dictionary is similar to c++ s map
they re both associative containers mapping a value from one type to a value of another in our case string to function . in c++ functions aren t quite first-class citizens so you can t store a function in a map but you can store a pointer to a function

6225183
portrait	landscape
2 modifying the image data after capture this is a tedious thing already mentioned in many blogposts stackoverflow uiimagepickercontroller camera preview is portrait in landscape app now rotate your image by 90 degrees or 270 deg based on orientation to make it look portrait
there are different things to consider here 1 you want the camera button not to change for landscape orientation to indicate portrait orientation only .you can achieve this by having custom controls and having your own camera control bar

6225186
profiling	debugging
another approach to testing slower but always valid it to fire data with very specific values into a ga profiling dedicated to development and check a few hours later that your data has came in
sometimes you need to figure if the debugging tools you use aren t giving wrong indications either because they are not appropriate either buggy or either too smart to give you the raw data for example

6225339
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you are opening a fileoutputstream to alicea.txt this outputstream is never closed in your code but in the error-line you open a fileinputstream on the same file imho while you have an open fileoutputstream on a file you can not open a file inputstream on the same file
that may be the reason why your fileinputstream is null and the exception is thrown

6226621
equals	compareto
equals requires invoking instanceof operator while compareto requires not
my colleague has noted large performance drop-down caused by excessive numbers of instanceof calls in equals method however my test has proved compareto to be only slightly faster

6227293
innodb	myisam
innodb does not work in an optimized way when run with default options you will have to configure and tune according to your needs . 3
innodb does not have compressed indexes like myisam so its going to take more space 4

6227293
innodb	myisam
innodb does not have compressed indexes like myisam so its going to take more space 4
innodb automatically appends primary key columns to secondary keys

6227558
ubuntu	centos
i have not been able to get it running in my ubuntu environment as of yet but i assume this is a bug in my server software
as my code is working fine with centos i conclude that the problem is not programming specific

6227961
hex	binary
variable length character strings are preceded by a 2 byte binary field giving the length of the string. in your case that would be 01 try viewing the output with hex on
since the length is a binary integer value it does not display as you were expecting

6228138
profiling	debugging
in general it s a good idea to profiling with debugging info make it fast and then remove the debugging info
i m glad you got it figured out but the next time you do profiling you might want to consider a few points the vs profiler in sampling mode does not sample during i o or any other time your program is blocked so it s only really useful for cpu-bound profiling

6231080
prepare	execute
you can use phps very own ssh2_exec after connecting to a prepare remote server
if that extension is not available you can of course just do execute ssh user server.name . myshell.sh

6233902
punctuation	words
n.b this will also match non-alphabetic characters such as punctuation digits etc
i means case-insensitive that is you ll get words like bacterious but not pancreaticoduodenostomy which also features all of the vowels in the right order

6235118
multiplying	multiplication
the important part is that the exponent is a constant -- you re multiplying n by itself some number of that s fixed -- not dependent on n itself
a factorial-complexity algorithm means the number of multiplication is not fixed -- the number of multiplication itself grows with n

6235395
erd	diagram
the inclusion of field names muddies this a bit - an erd shouldn t really express this information afaik
yes this is an entity relationship diagram using chen s notation

6235498
udp	tcp
if you lose some information it will not affect anything you can use udp for health status transfers
when using tcp you don t need to maintain proxy session opened just to keep opened the connection

6236467
listview	gridview
i found out that the overrides isenabled and areallitemsenabled from baseadapter will only be called if the adapter is attached to a listview but not to a gridview correct
while those methods are implemented on adapter they are a feature of listview not of adapterview

6236467
listview	gridview
while those methods are implemented on adapter they are a feature of listview not of adapterview
there is no enabled-state of my gridview items afaik

6237459
serializable	deserialization
a good reference for this is version tolerant serializable on msdn
in short changes to shared static in c# methods do not affect the deserialization of an object never remove a serialized field

6237554
implements	extends
using array#filter for this particular case the code would look like array#filter is not implements in some older browsers so see the linked article for a backward compatibility shim or better yet get a full-fledged es5 shim
for the more general case it s just a matter of extends this idea again i am using ecmascript 5 methods object.keys and array#every so use an es5 shim

6238531
interpolation	splines
you can try inverse distance weighted interpolation see inverse distance weighted idw interpolation with python . this should produce reasonably smooth results and scale better than rbf to larger data sets
smooth splines interpolation in dim 2 is difficult to implement and so there are not many freely available libraries able to do that in fact i don t know any

6240349
octal	hex	octal	decimal
i m not sure what the simplest way would be to encode it -- you could use eg xab xcf... the same with octal or you could use an array initializer something like don t quote me on this you could even use decimal values for the initializer. obviously whatever you do you ll have to pre-process the encrypted text into a hex representation -- an easy job for a toy program
encode it as hex octal

6241453
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql and sqlite under rails you d want t for true not just t
of course for mysql you d want 1

6243765
svg	vml
ie9+ support svg mainly because the rest of the world was moving on with svg and no one had interest in supporting vml
i m not familiar with dojo charting but it could be using vml

6243852
recvfrom	datagram
recvfrom will read the entire message that was originally sent but if the buffer isn t big enough it will throw an exception socket.error errno 10040 a message sent on a datagram socket was larger than the internal message buffer or some other network limit or the buffer used to receive a datagram into was smaller than the datagram itself so i am not sure why you would hang on the 2nd recvfrom if a 6-byte message was originally sent
you should throw an exception on the first recvfrom

6247259
ssl	https
basically anything sent over the internet with ssl is secure but ssl doesn t really have anything to do with encrypting usernames or passwords once your server has received them
basically if you want to ensure that your connection between the server and browser is secure you first test whether ssl https is being used and if not redirect to the same page but starting with instead of the standard put this code at the top of your page it will redirect the user s browser to use a secure connection

6247259
ssl	https
basically if you want to ensure that your connection between the server and browser is secure you first test whether ssl https is being used and if not redirect to the same page but starting with instead of the standard put this code at the top of your page it will redirect the user s browser to use a secure connection
using exit will ensure that your script doesn t send anything to the browser unless _server https on

6248325
floating-point	fixed-point
this is because ieee floating-point is stored essentially as scientific notation so range is favored over uniform precision
if it was uniform precision it would be fixed-point not floating-point. in other words numbers are stored in the form significand 2 exponent so if the exponent gets large a small change in the significand produces a large change in the number and vice-versa

6250027
client-side	server-side
to get the correct client-side element you ll have to use the following code alternatively you can change the asp.net markup to this and pass the div s id and the dropdownlist s current selection to the javascript function
i guess your problem is that the client-side id of the rendered select element is not the same as the server-side id of the asp dropdownlist have a look at the html source code rendered in the browser to confirm this

6255047
rspec	capybara
however you can use steak instead of rolling your own rspec support
capybara does not have built in support for rspec 1.x

6255089
apache	nginx
apache can be made to run fast but it s not the fastest horse out there
you ll do better with something like nginx or cringe cherokee

6256385
google-chrome	firefox
if you really need to use this dll as an npapi plugin things get more complicated because you need a window to load the plugin into and firefox unlike google-chrome doesn t have a dedicated background window for that
but i guess that you only turned your dll into a plugin to be able to use it in google-chrome

6256427
udp	tcp
packet it not a precise term tcp has segments udp and ip have datagrams and ethernet has frames
neither of these have anything to do with how many times you call send on the socket two calls to send does not necessarily mean two tcp segments are sent

6256841
mef	prism
most applications pick one from both categories alternatives to prism + mef for modular mvvm apps
prism is an application composition framework with mvvm features but is not in my opinion a fully-featured mvvm framework

6256890
jar	war
primefaces is just a taglib isn t it with the components backing it in the jar
so you should be able to use the same war and same facesservlet irrespective of whether you are serving mobile pages or desktop pages primefaces mobile and primefaces should be able to co-exist in the same war afaik

6256966
ienumerable	ilist
since it does implement non-generic ienumerable and non-generic ilist you can use to convert the collection into a form suitable for use with linq
however this approach isn t that helpful because the ienumerable that returns is an internal data structure with type

6260739
mvp	presenter
if you re overriding the built in methods you re not using the mvp framework as it s intended
you shouldn t need to override the onload method you should be attaching to the load event in the presenter

6261290
boost	allocator
for example use whereever possible instead of use smart pointers like boost smart pointers my personal favorite make sure you have understood the concept of ownership of a pointer and make sure that everywhere where you use pointers you know which code entity is the owner learn which constructors assignment operators are automatically created by the c++ compiler and what that means if you have class that owns a pointer or what that means if you have a class that contains a pointer to an object it does not own
there are some well-known programming techniques that will help you to minimize the risk of getting memory leaks at first hand if you have to do your own dynamic memory allocator write new and delete always pairwise and make sure the allocator deallocation code is called pairwise avoid dynamic memory allocator if you can

6264687
implements	extends
if the innereveniterator class does not extends any class or implements any interface i think it is nonsense because no other class can access any instance of it
however if it extends or implements any other non private class or interface it makes sense

6265858
interpolation	splines
one of the problems you face is that a splines doesn t usually go through its control points as a kind of interpolation function
minor detail your splines is a bit warped and that s because of your choice of splinedegree

6266557
primefaces	richfaces
if upgrading to jsf 2.x is indeed not an option then you ll have to look for a 3rd party jsf 1.x component library with builtin ajax functionality such as richfaces 3.x not 4.x since it requires jsf 2.x or primefaces 1.x not 2.x or newer since it requires jsf 2.x
richfaces 3.x ships with ajax4jsf tag library which supports the basic ajax functionality starting with tag

6273079
rpm	yum
if not try which java -- on centos it should be in usr bin java if are using the rpm installed version
if it doesn t show up use yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk which should install the jdk and any other required java libs do this with sudo or as root user

6274296
tabcontrol	tabitem
for example take a look at the following tabcontrol tab a will not display its blue background until you select a different tab
if you truly want the background to remain the same regardless of whether it is selected or not you will need to override the control template of the tabitem

6275275
gridview	sqldatasource
here are further informations on sorting some considerations why and when paging might not be working automatically if the data source does not support paging directly and does not implement the icollection interface the gridview control cannot page
for example if you are using a sqldatasource control and have set its datasourcemode property to datareader the gridview control cannot implement paging

6275275
gridview	sqldatasource
for example if you are using a sqldatasource control and have set its datasourcemode property to datareader the gridview control cannot implement paging
here are more informations on why the gridview might not support paging directly edit remember to check for

6277339
hive	hdfs
in the same time i would consider usage of hive - if your sql transformations are not that complicated - it might be practical to create csv files and make initial preaggregation with hive therof reducing data volumes before going to perhaps single node database
i do not expect loading to the hdfs to be a bottlneck since the load is distributed among datanodes - so the network interface will be only bottleneck

6277666
mvp	presenter
in mvp the view is not allowed to think
the presenter contains all the logic

6278623
ienumerable	icollection
it will only work if the object is an arraylist already for example if the object is not an arraylist but some other object that implements ienumerable the cast will fail
you can create an arraylist from an icollection for example this will loop through the collection and copy the items to the arraylist so it s an o n operation

6284908
postgresql	mysql
oracle and postgresql will not both raise errors and i don t believe the sql standard allows it but haven t checked so could be wrong there
let s see how it handles it so mysql deletes the row from the referencing table

6287488
innodb	myisam
i dont know if you have realiased but counting the rows on a large database with innodb is slow even without the distinct keyword
innodb does not cache the rowcount in the table metadata myisam does

6292502
junit	testng
i do not know about testng but junit has ability to plugin your own test executor
i am sure that testng has appropriate functionality

6294265
cassini	iis
i m not sure if cassini has the level of authentication built into it but i m a bit doubtful
i m pretty sure you should be able to use iis express which will be replacing cassini

6295580
equals	gethashcode
if none is specified it uses which calls the object s gethashcode and method or equals if the type doesn t implement
it compares objects for equality using equals

6295775
spaces	delimiter
if not add a everywhere spaces are legal also you can drop all instances of and replace each with
at a first glance everything looks ok but you need to make the regex case-insensitive by adding an i after the closing delimiter and so on

6296502
serializable	deserialization
with the example json corrected as ...then the following deserializes and serializable simply and as expected
in response to a few things in the original question note the following three things gson does not require deserialization to static inner classes

6296948
lwjgl	jogl
maybe you would be better of using lwjgl
latest sources seem to be here jogl doesn t seem to have much activity

6297297
equals	gethashcode
in addition to that equals should be symmetrical and yours isn t
looking into your gethashcode function it is clearly wrong

6297312
hex	binary
the print is turning it in to hex because you re asking it to print the whole tuple and print sees your string as arbitrary binary data
so as to not totally mess up some folks terminals it encodes potentially unprintable characters as hex

6298394
postgresql	mysql
your query would work in postgresql
best i m aware not in mysql

6299421
profiling	debugging
while using ants profiling is awesome it doesn t help if your problem is only seen in production
tess ferrandez has a series of labs that demonstrate how to debugging production problems including memory leaks

6299994
inline	inlining
there are many cases where inlining is not worth it from performance perspective and so the compiler doesn t inline them primarily when the method is longer than just few instructions
there are some cases when inlining is not possible like recursive or virtual methods

6300151
bash	subshell
the pipe is forking another bash process so when you do the increment filcount is getting incremented in the subshell that s been forked after the pipe
this value isn t passed back to the calling shell as the subshell has it s own independent environment environment variables are inherited in called processes but called process cannot modify the environment of the calling process

6302109
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
from the page entitled unchecked-exception the controversy runtimeexception represent problems that are the result of a programming problem and as such the api client code cannot reasonably be expected to recover from them or to handle them in any way
i think you should take a step back and learn the theory behind why to throw a checked exception vs an unchecked-exception

6305380
equals	gethashcode
if the objects are not equals they can go into the same bucket if they are equals then it is already in the hashtable and does not need to be added
gethashcode gets you an integral value that you can use for hashtables

6307137
ati	nvidia
i am not sure about ati chips but i think it is amd_gpu_association
since you are using nvidia quadro cards you can use the wgl_nv_gpu_affinity extension to select the gpu

6310904
uiview	calayer
uiview and nsview are osx ios equivalents but not identical
thus your portability will be better if you use core graphics and calayer

6312854
inline	inlining
note that it is not appropriate for implementations to provide inline definitions of standard library functions in the standard headers because this can break some legacy code that redeclares standard library functions after including their headers
the inline keyword is intended only to provide users with a portable way to suggest inlining of functions

6313438
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	icollection	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
you ll find the answer to this question the results view only works for collections which meet the following conditions implement ienumerable or ienumerable vb.net only works for ienumerable do not implement ilist ilist icollection or icollection c# restriction only do not have a debuggertypeproxy attribute system.core.dll is loaded in the debugee process in particular #2 entityset t implement s ilist t therefore the debugger won t show a results view option
using the asqueryable extension method returns an object which only implements iqueryable and ienumerable and therefore will show the results view option

6313569
xna	spritebatch
edit also overriding the spritebatch vertex shader is very difficult xna before 4.0
the correct solution here is to not use spritebatch for 3d drawing

6314656
d3.js	protovis
an outline of how might it look could be as simple as pseudo html then on the server example is gae-compatible microframework flask pseudocode but not that pseudo if none of this overlaps enough with your application space you will at least get something out of this answer by looking at d3.js which is a bit lower level
with your third requirement in mind take a look at something like this protovis interactive graph visualization or this infovis graph example code

6314981
innodb	myisam
i ve never used the innodb plugin as i ve always found the standard innodb engine to be perfectly perfomant especially for reads
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

6315053
ssl	https
this answer goes into more detail about sending passwords over ssl sending passwords over the web you can use php s crypt for hashing
if you mean sending from browser to your server then you need to use https ssl to encrypt the connection not the password itself

6315974
onresume	onpause
activity is start onresume is which you declare in your xml by default
and as i found from question answer on stack overflow is orientation change onsaveinstancestate onpause onstop oncreate onstart onrestoreinstancestate onresume switch to activity 2 onsaveinstancestate onpause orientation change while in activity 2 onstop oncreate onstart switchback back from activity2 onresume i m guessing that because activity 1 is hidden at the time of rotation onrestoreinstancestate isn t called because there is no view it can t be seen viewed

6318299
portrait	landscape
choosing whether to do height or width depends on your image and container dimensions if your image and container are both portrait shaped or both landscape shaped taller than they are wide or wider than they are tall respectively then it doesn t matter which of height or width are 100
if your image is portrait and your container is landscape you must set on the image

6319132
icmp	tcp
the os might keep letting you add data to its internal buffers too but at some point the writes will block. if the peer breaks the connection with a rst or icmp unreachable message a future call to send will return an error value for connection reset or broken pipe
update 2 i m not talking at the tcp level i m talking at the winsock api level this might be the source of confusion

6319667
apache	lighttpd
out of the box lighttpd wipes the floor with apache
but not as many people know lighttpd so getting it to work is harder

6319667
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
under heavy load if configured correctly lighttpd will out preform apache i did some tests a while back and you might see a 200-300 performance increase in requests per second
pros fast out of the box uses very little memory cons not as much support as apache sometimes just does not work nginx if you were running a static website then you would use nginx

6319667
apache	nginx
pros fast out of the box uses very little memory cons not as much support as apache sometimes just does not work nginx if you were running a static website then you would use nginx
you are correct in saying nginx s mod_wsgi isn t suitable

6319726
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
so use of apache isn t good as front end proxy for long polling application
if that is the criteria though would actually suggest you use nginx rather than lighttpd

6320317
innodb	myisam
but those stipulations apply to a transactional engine innodb
myisam doesn t support innodb style transactions

6320317
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t support innodb style transactions
myisam has read locks which will prevent writes from any sessions and write locks which prevent reads and writes from other sessions

6320969
serializable	deserialization
serializable not serializable properties that s haven t setters because if serializable serializable such property it will not able deserialize it back
so if you want serializable name property then just add fake setter into icommand need to add it also 2.if you don t want use bsonknowntypes attribute there is another way to notify serializable about know types it might encounter during deserialization

6321544
nfa	dfa
the advantage of nfa s over dfa s is the property to always choose the right path
since you cannot say in an algorithm to choose the right path usually a conversion from nfa to dfa works creating dfa states that symbolize multiple nfa states

6321544
nfa	dfa
since you cannot say in an algorithm to choose the right path usually a conversion from nfa to dfa works creating dfa states that symbolize multiple nfa states
thus when your nfa is in state a and has the choice to go to a b or c then the next state in your dfa would be a b c

6323110
implements	extends
this is the interface definition of arrayaccess you can extends from that in php by implements the interface
that s not extends but implements

6323820
actionscript	mxml
so if you have main.mxml main is a class name for that class and its package is determined by that mxml file path relative to the source folder as in actionscript classes
that s why you should name your mxml classes from the capital letter main.mxml but not main.mxml

6325735
rspec	capybara
since rspec doesn t have a scenario method i m guessing that you re using capybara or steak and that it s really just an alias for it
in that case rspec internally refers to this block of code as an example and you can access the meta data like this you can also put the metadata on the example group the describe block that encloses the various examples

6327361
serializable	deserialization
added note in order not to store an object variable mark the field with a transient .e.g related resources discover the secrets of the java serializable api
i m speaking in terms of java s serializable while int is a primitive type which stores only the value of the variable in binary the integer object using objectoutputstream will store some metadata that when deserialization occurs it will see the integer object

6327361
serializable	deserialization
i m speaking in terms of java s serializable while int is a primitive type which stores only the value of the variable in binary the integer object using objectoutputstream will store some metadata that when deserialization occurs it will see the integer object
yes serializable not only stores the object but also the states of the object so if you store the value is wrapped lack of better word inside integer and the whole object is stored

6331431
prepare	execute
last but not least i would suggest you use a preparedstatement to make prevent your code form sql-injections this amuses you re using the mysqli-class create a prearedstatement with the prepare -method
bind your parameters execute the statement bind the results fetch them

6334083
firefox	safari
you may use ogg vorbis for firefox
it probably doesn t work in safari

6334315
client-side	server-side
you should be able to edit the client-side properties of the control if that control translates to a simple html element
sometimes a server-side property doesn t have a client-side analog however

6334778
onresume	onpause
onresume refresh your data because your app is about to take foreground again
onpause save your data and stop anything that doesn t need to be running while your app doesn t have the foreground

6335372
factors	mean
i don t know why you would expect it to be the same since sift relies on a number of internal twiddle factors which can vary between implementations
finally i am not sure what you mean by convert from scale-space to image-space

6336256
express	node.js
for example my model looked more like this then in my application code i m using express when i get a transaction i want all of the notebooks with author last name s this seems wildly inefficient and hacky but i could not figure out another way to accomplish this
lastly i am new to node.js mongoose and stackoverflow so forgive me if this is not the most appropriate place to extend this discussion

6337784
union	distinct
union not only combines the two queries but also goes through and removes duplicates
it s the same as using a distinct statement

6338747
django	web2py
summary django s is better web2py s appadmin is for administrators only. web2py s are better
web2py has something called admin which is not equivalent to django s admin

6338747
django	web2py
web2py has something called admin which is not equivalent to django s admin
the web2py admin is a fully web based ide

6339968
udp	tcp
the connect on udp socket merely sets the default peer address and you can call connect on udp socket as many times as you want and the connect on udp socket of course does not perform any handshake for connection. hope this helps
it is important to understand that tcp is connection-oriented while udp is a connectionless protocol

6343708
implements	extends
you are implements sendsms as an activity but i don t think that it needs to be and it is not being correctly initialised as an activity so you are seeing this failure
take out the extends activity from your sendsms class and change your sendsms method to start as follows now you ll need to call it as sendsms this 15555215556 message

6344144
queue	fifo
a queue should definitely be fifo that is its nature
the priority queue changes the queue aspect slightly in that it lets higher priority items through in preference to lower ones but that shouldn t change the basic nature of the queue

6344144
queue	fifo
the priority queue changes the queue aspect slightly in that it lets higher priority items through in preference to lower ones but that shouldn t change the basic nature of the queue
i ve seen implementations that profess to be queues but do not follow the fifo rules

6344602
trie	tree
a more efficient though not necessarily space-wise solution would possibly involve using a hashtable and a hash function that acts on the answer choices to create its hash but i think a trie is the best way to go given your requirements and the don t-cares
oh right depending on how the answer choices are laid out it s possible you may have a series of answers on particular branches where there aren t any sub-branches tree for a few levels

6345473
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it is not supported by nitro safari v8 google-chrome opera nor internet explorer
according to wikipedia e4x is supported by mozilla s rhino used in openoffice.org and several other projects and spidermonkey used in firefox thunderbird and other xul-based applications

6345578
google-chrome	firefox
document.queryselector #wonderful div nth-child 2 nth-child 2 the following snipped works in both browsers but i assume you know that already document.queryselector #wonderful div nth-child 2 div.blue so it looks like an implementation failure in google-chrome for me
this worked for me in google-chrome but it does not work in firefox then

6345612
implements	extends
these implements methods specified by the event listener will be called back when an ui event happens which will not cause your ui thread to hang
for example public class myactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener and then implement the method also you need to add the listener to the ui widget widget.setonclicklistener this

6347460
activemq	rabbitmq
fuse esb contains a messaging infrastructure based on the jms technology of apache activemq
activemq is not interoperable out-of-the-box with amqp systems like rabbitmq

6348942
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my bigger beef is that google-chrome uses a 24 hour clock for local time
testing new date .tolocalestring windows 7 safari 5.0 tuesday june 14 2011 15 13 43 google-chrome 9.0.597.98 tue jun 14 2011 15 15 01 gmt-0400 eastern daylight time opera 11.01 6 14 2011 3 15 37 pm firefox 4.0.1 tuesday june 14 2011 3 16 33 pm msie 8.0 tuesday june 14 2011 3 16 06 pm msie 9.0 tuesday june 14 2011 3 17 09 pm they all return the hours minutes seconds in a group so to exclude anything after the time you could another way is to concat the locale day and time strings which surprisingly does not return the timezone on chrome- but your milage may vary

6349143
vbscript	jscript
not sure that it is a good idea but yes you can use javascript actually jscript instead of vbscript
just use activexobject class instead of createobject function that is used in vbscript to create objects

6349300
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so to check if the current represented as self in the code bellow controller is presented in a modal way or not i have the function bellow either in a uiviewcontroller category or if your project does not need to use other uikit controllers as uitableviewcontroller for example in a base controller that my other controllers inherit of edit i added the last check to see if a uitabbarcontroller is being used and you present another uitabbarcontroller as modal
edit 2 added ios 5+ check where uiviewcontroller does not answer for parentviewcontroller anymore but to presentingviewcontroller instead

6350225
sum	coalesce
then do a sum on the values update as noted when 0 records are returned as t this result in as single result of nulls in all the values
you have three options 1 add a having clause so that you have no records returned rather than result of all nulls having sum active_count is not null 2 if you want all zeros returned than you could add coalesce to all your sums for example select coalesce sum active_count active_count coalesce sum overdue_count overdue_count coalesce sum due_today_count due_today_count 3 take advantage of the fact that as sbarro s demonstrated

6350360
move	drag
cloning the source item should be cloned and not move but using a placeholder - i couldn t find draggable with a placeholder without being removed from list i have a temporary solution with adding the source item on the end of list but that isn t what i want to achieve in order to properly clone the item i might suggest changing your interface paradigm so you have a button that instructs the user with a call to action like click to add or something like that
it would be better to have a button that drove adding instead of worrying about drag drop

6351071
client-side	server-side
there are plenty of javascript libraries and frameworks out there to handle client-side interactivity
codeigniter is a server-side framework so it cannot intermingle with a client-side framework.

6351536
super	implements
super b self .go calls the next method in the method resolution order
it calls the method that would have been called had b not implements the method at all

6351794
spaces	linefeed
according to css 2.1 if white-space is set to normal or nowrap linefeed characters are transformed for rendering purpose into one of the following characters a spaces character a zero width spaces character u+200b or no character not rendered according to ua-specific algorithms based on the content script
according to css 3 a zero width spaces before or after a white spaces sequence containing a newline causes the entire sequence of white spaces to collapse into a zero width spaces

6351794
spaces	linefeed
reality most browsers transform linefeed characters into a spaces
so what you really want is to set the white-space-collapsing property to discard not collapse or to collapse and then add a zero width spaces character before the line break

6352855
domcontentloaded	onload
you can test whether a browser supports domcontentloaded using this page
if you are not using a dom library such as jquery which has built in support for domcontentloaded you could use domcontentloaded and then fallback to onload if the browser doesn t support it

6353011
bash	zsh
and it is not bash you don t need to put quotes around variables unless you specify some option don t remember which exactly always passes exactly one argument to command no matter what is in
to ensure that some zsh option will not alter the behavior put emulate -l zsh at the top of every script

6356928
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
although you did not provide enough informations i d suggest to use asihttprequest for http and asyncsocket for tcp and udp
if an connection was established callback methods will be triggered edit i have to say that my experiences with cfnetwork are very limited but for me it seems as if you are just testing if stream objects exists

6359099
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition
in addition to all the other good answers here let me point out another reason to not use shift when you mean divide or multiplying
i have never once seen someone introduce a bug by forgetting the relative precedence of multiplication and addition

6359678
google-chrome	firefox
i tried resetting the css top please see i tried your code on google-chrome the header stays on top
but when i tried it on firefox 3.6 the header doesn t stay on top

6360381
division	multiplication
my guess is that it was intended to be used in a division to show the above mentioned properties but there was a lapsus calami
in general integer div is not the same than floating point div integer div float div by making space_in_car a float then the results of the operations are calculated as floats no rounding but in this sample space_in_car is only used for multiplication .for multiplication the same goes but the value does not change 120 is the same than 120.0

6362663
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
here is the revised fiddle tested with ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox opera safariwin and google-chrome
edit if you réally don t want the dummy column i ve managed it to get this far but that solution does not work in google-chrome or safariwin

6364889
ssl	https
in order for sinatra to correctly assemble the url used for redirects it needs to be able to determine whether the request is using ssl so that the redirect can be made using http or https as appropriate
obviously the actual call to thin isn t using ssl as this is being handled by the front end web server and the proxied request is in the clear

6367496
asterisk	ivr
honestly asterisk is not very difficult to set up and get running for something like this
get an inexpensive and unlimited inbound sip channel from callcentric or another trunk provider and write your ivr as the default extension in the dialplan

6369536
interpolation	splines
i d guess that a simple linear interpolation would suffice and the margins probably wouldn t need to be huge but you could determine that empirically
this is a pretty unsophisticated suggestion admittedly but one obvious hack would be to fit overlapping rather than distinct subsets of points and then interpolate between the resulting splines in the overlapping region

6372898
ssl	https
even if you uncheck require secure channel i believe it will still use the secure channel because you are telling it ssl is not required but that doesn t mean it can t still use ssl
for instance if you navigate from secure_page1.aspx to unsecure_page2.aspx it will navigate over https or whatever protocol the first page used by default it won t automatically switch from https to http when you click the particular page link

6372898
ssl	https
for instance don t make login.aspx non-ssl then login-post.aspx the form post action url ssl because that is not secure
i must admit i have done a project where the website was a mix of http and https and we wanted to force the user s browser to use the protocol we wanted

6375475
innodb	myisam
try changing your engine to innodb
your database is probably using engine myisam which will cause foreign keys to not be created

6377113
daemons	systemd
the primary disadvantage to purely in-memory storage is that all your session data will be wiped if when you restart the daemons
in my experience memcached is rock-solid and i ve never had to restart it because of a failure but it is a consideration if your sysadmins aren t used to working that way or if your systemd are updated frequently

6380524
multiplying	multiplication
for instance in javascript to make sure you deal with integers and not strings a common practice is to multiplying a variable by one
in python the multiplication operator repeats strings so is a no-op

6381146
gson	jackson
gson allows for one of the simplest possible solutions
compared to similar apis like jackson or svenson gson by default doesn t even need the unused json elements to have bindings available in the java structure

6381311
innodb	myisam
first i recomend use innodb engine not myisam
innodb support foreign keys in the create table stament include engine innodb

6381573
postgresql	mysql
the update-from construction is not standard sql and mysql s non-standard version is different from postgresql s non-standard version
from the problem here it looks like sql server follows postgresql

6382962
fixed-point	fractions
if this is an issue calculate in fixed-point numbers 1.23 is represented by 123 with a fixed factor of 0.01 or use decimal.decimal
note that due to floating point not being able to express all decimal fractions some results won t be able to be expressed in floating point numbers

6383245
jar	war
and to make it worse the controller beans are not located in the war but in a seperate jar
as this jar is not in the war the jsf annotation processor does not scan it

6383245
jar	war
as this jar is not in the war the jsf annotation processor does not scan it
i guess i will restructure the project and likely throw out the skinny war

6385393
wadl	wsdl
wsdl 2.0 and wadl supports description of rest services and the point is similar as with soap services - describe what you can do with the service but in the rest way
there is no point in wsdl for rest services created with wcf because wcf supports only wsdl 1.1 or 1.0 which cannot describe rest seevice

6385934
division	subtract
note that this formula assumes integer division rounds down . but that is not quite right because every 100 years is not a leap year
so we have to subtract off y 100

6390006
udp	tcp
if you re generating valid ip packets you ll also need to generate valid udp and implement a tcp session with valid tcp packets yourself in order for the application to process them otherwise they ll also be thrown away by the tcp ip stack you ll be testing the lower part of the tcp ip stack on the receiving end
tcp udp this is not that different from sending receiving invalid ip packets

6390579
ubuntu	linux
assuming that you have all the dependencies installed on ubuntu that would be bunch of things like sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev and various other -dev packages then this is how i build python
the only modules that don t build during make are _tkinter - i don t do gui apps and would use wxwindows if i did bsddb185 - horribly obsolete version of bdb dl - deprecated in 2.6 imageop - deprecated in 2.6 sunaudiodev - obsolete interface to some sparcstation device i think next i collect any .so files that are not already in the python install directories and copy them over and then add setuptools for good measure at this point i can make a tarball of opt python272 and run it on any 64-bit linux distro even a stripped down one that has none of the dependencies installed or a older distro that has old obsolete versions of the dependencies

6393068
uiview	calayer
set view.layer.masklayer on an appropriate view a uiview containing the scroll view should work to something suitable a calayer with contents contentsscale contentscenter set appropriately
more of a pain since calayer does not autosize itself so your wrapper view will have to do the necessary things in -setframe -setbounds -layoutsubviews

6393269
stateless	stateful
to make this work though you must not call the super pageparameters constructor so that the page doesn t have enough information to build the stateless url
in this example you can navigate to the secretpage through two different links one stateless bookmarkable and the other stateful

6394052
uiview	calayer
alternatively if you re not using a custom calayer subclass and there generally isn t a real need to create your own you can do your custom drawing inside the uiview s -drawlayer incontext method
in order to respond to user interaction the best way is to use a uiview

6396239
implements	extends
i agree with u on some point compare jquery with gi i think they are not the same level jquery which implements the css searchengine provide the plugin structure and some util tools but it is still like component
gi which is the enterprise ria solution provide the mapping utility class interface extends implements structure amp plugin structure i10n i18n etc

onfocus	onblur
if you go with solution 2 it s a naive solution - if you want multiple handlers for the onblur and or onfocus then that method doesn t attach properly and all other handlers for those events will be replaced with these - so it s not technically a safe approach though in 99.9 of cases it will work just fine
there s a few solutions to this solution 1 a return in your onblur isn t what you want with the function the way you ve written it

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 12 works as described
i have not been able to get firefox 4.0 or 5.0 to behave this way and suspect this is a bug in their implementation or else the specification was different when they implemented it

6398107
spaces	delimiter
but given your example why don t you do something like this matches your value from 1 essentially deletes the text after your 1 value and prints the 1 value followed by a spaces your 2 value d2.... a spaces and the ending - character
edit finally i ll mention that some legacy unix sed s aix in particular seem to not accept escaping the regex delimiter char but i don t have access to a system to verify that now

6399910
google-chrome	safari
i m not kidding about the security aspect either one security expert i happen to know with a published textbook on how to do security testing has said the only good use for safari is to download firefox or google-chrome
google-chrome is webkit based and works with watir-webdriver

6401441
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
uigesturerecognizer is recommended by apple for recent ioses
you can use it not only for uibutton but also for uiview especially uiimageview in your case etc

6401515
freemarker	velocity
i would suggest you stick to freemarker for that purpose
velocity does not natively support html-encoding

6401833
inline	inlining
in your case check this condition procedures and functions used in conditional expressions in while-do and repeat-until statements cannot be expanded inline
the delphi documentation enumerates the conditions under which inlining does or does not occur inlining will not occur on any form of late-bound method

6401833
inline	inlining
routines that take open array parameters cannot be inline
code can be inline within packages however inlining never occurs across package boundaries

6402070
robocopy	xcopy
when deploying web applications before i ve used vbscript and powershell plus good old fashioned xcopy though i d agree robocopy is probably a better copy replacement
so going through the requirements - i think this is the sort of thing you want to do this should be done form a powershell command prompt get-service iisadmin -computername targetmachine | stop-service -force xcopy source dest get-service iisadmin -computername targetmachine | start-service i wouldn t use .cab unless you wanted compression for transferring the files then i d use a .zip file

6402409
spweb	spsite
disposing context.spsite spweb objects disposing spweb.parentweb objects this is done for you see best practices using disposable windows sharepoint objects not using output cache with publishing sites not using wsp solutions to deploy custom code changes
not disposing spsite spweb objects you new up in your code

6402698
cassini	iis
however if you are using the visual studio web development server aka cassini then that does not support ssl
the endpoint address if you are iis hosting should be either left empty or a relative address

6403089
setinterval	settimeout
using this syntax is not recommended for the same reasons as using eval delay is the number of milliseconds thousandths of a second that the setinterval function should wait before each call to func
as with settimeout there is a minimum delay enforced

6403884
lisp	racket
racket is actually unique among lisp and scheme in this kind of support but even with others the situation is still far more advanced than in non-lisp languages
lisp not lisp has a number of advantages when you re facing problems that are not well-defined

6405867
awt	swing
that is old awt code which is not used in swing
in swing custom painting is done by overriding the paintcomponent method of jpanel or jcomponent

6406619
gson	jackson
if gson doesn t support definition of field order there are other libraries that do
jackson allows definining this with jsonpropertyorder for example

6407859
stateless	stateful
if your ejbs are stateless it doesn t matter you re fine
if they are session you are out of luck since last time i checked in ejb 3.0 you were not allowed to call multiple stateful ejbs methods simultaneously

6414213
wadl	wsdl
rest has a similar concept called wadl - web application description language wadl specification as pdf - but that s not nearly as well established and widely used as wsdl for soap
if you have a wsdl - it s a soap service

6414511
fiddler	charles
it s cross-platform while fiddler is windows-only
unfortunately charles isn t free well it is you can use it without paying but have to deal with the nagware popups all the time

6414722
vim	emacs
you don t need to use emacs because vim can do it for you i say this because you tagged this vim and not to start a flame war
to do this in vim open your binary in vim and type the following

6416147
dbcontext	objectcontext
because of that i think that whole idea of dbcontext api was management failure
at the moment ado.net team must maintain two apis - dbcontext is not mature to replace objectcontext and it actually can t because it is just a wrapper and because of that objectcontext cannot die

6420848
google-chrome	firefox
it s not google-chrome or safari it s jquery that does the parsing if it sees the appropriate content-type on the response
update and the content-type you ve added to the question is correct. i can t immediately see why it wouldn t be doing it on firefox

6421602
selecteditem	selectedindex
as an example if you have comboa and combob and combob is set in response to the selection in comboa then setting the selectedindex of combob from the view is fine but setting the items or the selecteditem of combob is not - those properties are both data related and should be specified via binding to the viewmodel
the selectedindex property is directly visual related and somewhat independent of the actual data and it is irrelevant to the viewmodel

6421602
selecteditem	selectedindex
things like selectedindex are specific to the way the data is shown in the ui if you change the sort order of a datagrid then the selectedindex can change even though the selecteditem is still the same
in this particular case the selecteditem can be bound to the viewmodel but the selectedindex shouldn t

6421734
dbcontext	objectcontext
you must convert dbcontext to objectcontext by using after that you can access objectcontext.metadataworkspace but the workspace itself was not designed for direct usage - api is highly unfriendly and it is read only
dbcontext itself doesn t provide access to meta model

6422823
extjs	gxt
i was doing straight extjs javascript then moved to gwt with the advent of gwt-ext and later moved to ext-gwt gxt
i would still be doing extjs javascript today if it were not for those two toolkits

6424842
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is the only browser which supportes almost all if not all column controls
column breaks have never been supported in previous versions of safari - my guess this is still the case

6426046
serializable	deserialization
previous stackoverflow.com questions and answers some with examples on this topic deserialising a generic with unknown compile time type where a field indicates the type parse json with no specific structure for a field with gson json object serializable deserialization using google gson polymorphism with gson
gson does not currently have a simple mechanism for polymorphic deserialization other than implementing custom deserialization processing

6426612
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg is implemented in c and has no hooks for other languages out of the box
learning the api for the libav libraries is not for the faint of heart no straight-forward docs provided just read the source and examples and faq but as far as i can tell ffmpeg is basically how video is done in the real world

6426612
ffmpeg	libav
learning the api for the libav libraries is not for the faint of heart no straight-forward docs provided just read the source and examples and faq but as far as i can tell ffmpeg is basically how video is done in the real world
so if you can t find an out-of-the-box solution for python that meets your needs you could use swig or another interface generator to wrap the stock ffmpeg libraries as a starting point

6427843
profiling	instrumentation
if instrumentation isn t showing your slow areas you may be profiling only running threads instead of all threads
using the time profiler instrumentation click the little i next to the track header and then select all thread states

6428558
swift	objective-c
prior swift 3.0 string data yourdata encoding nsutf8stringencoding swift 3.0 string data yourdata encoding .utf8 see string#init data encoding reference
objective-c you can use see nsstring class reference example remark please notice the nsdata value must be valid for the encoding specified utf-8 in the example above otherwise nil will be returned returns nil if the initialization fails for some reason for example if data does not represent valid data for encoding

6429954
g++	gcc
try using g++ instead and edit your errors into the question so we can help better
you should be using g++ instead of gcc also vc++ code may or may not work depending on what the submission is required to do as windows has different libraries for certain things

6430527
ienumerable	icollection
in general pre-generics classes do not serve as useful abstractions for generic classes with the exception of ienumerable
probably because it s not generic and implements icollection whereas is generic and implements

6430804
gson	jackson
jackson doesn t currently have any built-in json versioning support like gson does
jackson issue 108 was logged over two years ago to address such a possible enhancement

6430842
jar	manifest.mf
instead a reference to that jar should be added to the class-path in the manifest
chadneal also if i unzip the jar file that is produced the contents look like this meta-inf meta-inf manifest.mf fecrudbreset.class sqljdbc4.jar the main jar cannot contain the sqljdbc4.jar

6433014
super	implements
if you d prefer not to write the php stuff you d better to migrate this question to super user
in the email you send instead of sending the policy as an attachment you could send a link which points to a php page you state in your question it would be trivial for you to implements this in php where you display or attach the document

6434766
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a uiviewcontroller s view is expected to fill its window or some frame provided by one of apple s container view controller classes uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller uisplitviewcontroller and so on
you should not add one uiviewcontroller s view as a subview of another uiviewcontroller s view

6435414
postgresql	mysql
even with activerecord sitting as an abstraction layer between you and your database there will be differences between mysql and sqlite and postgresql and some of them will be subtle and the correct time for them to bite you is in the development and test environments not production
a far better idea would be to figure out and fix the errors you re getting from postgresql in development test mode

6435438
postgresql	mysql
mysql will often silently truncate strings whereas postgresql will complain
mysql and sqlite will allow you to have things in your select that aren t in a group by but postgresql will complain

6435438
postgresql	mysql
mysql and sqlite will allow you to have things in your select that aren t in a group by but postgresql will complain
booleans are treated differently in all three postgresql uses literal t and f and a few others for booleans

6436275
mp4	h.264
if you have a h.264 video stream -- regardless of the container mov m4v mp4 -- and your html5 video renders in a web browser but doesn t render on the ipad there are two possible fixes the first solution is to convert the h.264 video stream to mpeg4
ffmpeg -i video_h264_not_working.mov -acodec copy -vcodec mpeg4 video_mpeg.mov alternatively you can select mpeg4 instead of h.264 in handbrake. the second solution is to re-process the h.264 video with the following parameters ffmpeg -i video_h264_not_working.mov -vcodec libx264 -r 25 -b 516k -bt 516k -crf 22 -vpre normal video_h264.mov the second solution came from i m guessing in the former case the mpeg4 codec is more relaxed on the ipad

6436974
google-chrome	firefox
pagex is non-standard and probably not implemented in google-chrome but jquery seems to provide this property in a cross-browser fashion see
mouse events in firefox have both a pagex and a clientx property see documentation at and respectively

6439134
mockito	jmock
i d say the competition is between jmockit and powermockito then mockito
i d leave plain jmock and easymock because they use only proxy cglib and do not use java 5 instrumentation like the newer frameworks

6439134
mockito	jmock
another recent mocking tool is mockito
although it does not attempt to overcome the limitations of older tools jmock easymock it does introduce a new style of behavior testing with mocks

6439306
awt	swing	swt	swing
if swt or awt is used you can get handle of ui components because these two toolkit uses native libararies
on the other hand if that java application gui is created by beans of swing you can not get any handle

6439573
udp	tcp
if you use udp you don t need to since it s a message protocol
tcp is a byte streaming protocol so it cannot send packets just bytes

6442113
ssl	https
the rule is never ever use basic http authentification if the connection isn t https ssl
if your webserver is completly in https no problem see edit on the bottom the clear text password are encrypted by ssl

6442151
webkit	gecko
it is a full webkit browser so you have a full dom bom model and all of the events available to you that you d get in a real browser
note this isn t a full solution because it won t simulate a gecko or ie or opera browser but if you re just regression testing your code rather than performing extensive cross-platform testing phantomjs looks perfect for you

6442481
draggable	droppable	move	drag
on the other hand the drag event of the draggable is raised every time the mouse move and seems appropriate for the task
there are however two problems with this strategy drag is raised whether or not the draggable actually lies over a droppable even in that case the droppable is not passed to the event handler

6442481
draggable	droppable
there are however two problems with this strategy drag is raised whether or not the draggable actually lies over a droppable even in that case the droppable is not passed to the event handler
one way to solve both problems is to associate the droppable and the draggable in the over handler using jquery s data facility and disassociate them in the out and drop handlers now that the draggable knows the droppable it s lying over we can update the element s appearance in a drag event handler the code that follows is a simple test case that demonstrates this solution it basically fills the commented gaps above and refactors common patterns into helper functions

6445380
uiview	calayer
you can only draw inside a uiview s drawrect method or by creating your own image context
you cannot draw to the screen by any means other than drawrect or implementing drawing for a calayer

6446391
super	implements
awakefromnib for appkit mac not true anymore if using os x 10.6 or higher you should call the super implementation of awakefromnib only if you know for certain that your superclass provides an implementation
because the application kit does not provide a default implementation of the awakefromnib method calling super results in an exception if the parent class does not implements it

6446391
super	implements
because the application kit does not provide a default implementation of the awakefromnib method calling super results in an exception if the parent class does not implements it
classes whose immediate parent class is nsobject or nsview do not need to call the super implementation

6446393
junit	testng
junit doesn t support test ordering
you will need to use testng for this

6449453
sudo	passwd
see since sudo su - expects a passwd it wouldn t work
there is a way around it make root logon without being prompted for a passwd

6449953
dbcontext	objectcontext
from msdn dbcontext wraps objectcontext and exposes the most commonly used features of objectcontext by using simplified and more intuitive apis
you can access the underlying objectcontext whenever you need to use features that are not supported by dbcontext

6449953
dbcontext	objectcontext
you can access the underlying objectcontext whenever you need to use features that are not supported by dbcontext
loading the related entities is supported but filtering them is not supported objectcontext.loadproperty so the answer is no for loading only a part of related entities in my opinion dbcontext offers some helper methods

6450730
boost	allocator
-- but i trust you know how to use boost bind or px bind to make it more real-life in addition to the above down to 27 loc even with the free function no more phoenix no more phoenix includes yay compile times no more phoenix expression types in debug builds ballooning the binary and slowing it down no more var ref if_ .else_ and the wretched operator which had major bug risk at some time due to the overload not being included with phoenix.hpp easily ported to c++0x lambda s - immediately removing the need for global variables
this is at least a lot shorter already down to 28 loc no more locals no more fusion vector wizardry no more inherited attributes no more grammar class no more manual iteration using expectation points see other to enhance parse error reporting this parser expressions synthesizes neatly into a if you choose to assign it with but it will cost performance besides potentially allocator a largish array

6450963
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
addition subtraction of such fractional numbers is exact and doesn t need any code changes
multiplication and division loses some decimal precision and needs to be scaled

6451936
innodb	myisam
mysql does support transactions but not for myisam you ll have to use innodb or likewise engine if you want transactions
there is a trick you can use and still keep myisam and have transactions kind of

6452120
daemons	systemd
this is particularly true when there are well-written off-the-shelf solutions to the problem milter-limit and before anyone points out that not everyone has access to reconfigure their mta - in most cases these people won t have access to run a daemons in php
this is really bad architecture - php is a very flexible tool which you could potentially use to implement such a systemd - but its not the right tool

6455074
octal	decimal
there s an exception for whole numbers containing the digits 8 or 9 - since those aren t legal in octal the parser will implicitly treat them as decimal even in the presence of a leading zero
javascript treats all whole numbers that start with a zero as octal so the actual value of 013 is indeed 11 decimal

6459528
opera	google-chrome
opera seems to work like that as well but it doesn t like it if you don t call event.preventdefault or return false from the event handler which is essentially the same thing
google-chrome however seems to add the timeout to the queue first and only add incoming messages after that

6460808
gtk	gdk
in the gtk documentation the little sections near the top labeled object hierarchy tell you how the classes relate together
there isn t really such thing as a gdk tutorial since one hardly ever uses it without gtk

6460943
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
note - the limit of localstorage and offline application caching varies per browser. - ie doesn t support offline application caching - in opera and safari you can store more than 5mb of localstorage. - in google-chrome you can check size of application cache by url google-chrome appcache-internals and localstorage in the map localstorage
i have tested this in google-chrome firefox opera and safari and all browser use for both technique a limit of 5 mb

6462560
serializable	deserialization
that said just in case you re doing something blatantly wrong you should post the serializable code for container container smallobject and container smallobject customdata
you should also ensure that it s actually deserialization that s taking 400ms and not a combination of deserializing + reading the data from the disk

6463183
prepare	execute
that won t always work though note that with most but not necessarily all dbms and hence most dbd drivers the statement is sent to the dbms when it is prepare
only the values are sent when the statement is execute

6463194
springlayout	grouplayout
i was looking to break from nested layouts for a name value dialog recently and looked at both grouplayout springlayout
it seemed the only advantage offered by springlayout was that it could achieve the right aligned text of the labels there may be a way to do it using gl but i couldn t figure out how

6469463
lxml	elementtree
for me returns i cannot speak to the descrepencey but i do suggest setting the argument pretty_print to true you will need to import elementtree from lxml import elementtree when outputted to an outfile the spaces and newlines will be perserved
also with print i am sure you have checked out the api but incase you haven t here is information on tostring . it is also safe to assume you have seen the tutorial on the lxml website

6470207
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it is not a jquery or javascript problem ie firefox and opera have no problem
but google-chrome and safari exhibit the issue you mention

6470435
ssl	https
since i apparently cannot write a comment i ll just drop my 2 cents here.. beginning with the next release r14 moznet called se7en in the op s post will have support for https ssl and the ability to accept deny certificates
edit the r15 release will have the ssl handling for sure

6475703
profiling	debugging
more details since the official examples are not so clear here is reusable example inspired by this blog post vmacquirer.java connection manager monitor.java actual monitoring required by the application being monitor informations available through jdwp tracing method call and return possibly for doing profiling or logging field value changes vm information see name and description in the example evaluate expression to execute arbitrary code
the jdk has a built-in java api for remote local debugging com.sun.jdi

6476928
postgresql	mysql
well to build this sort of application postgresql is really the best of the two
in complement to scott answer +1 i would add several things sql injections with subqueries is not possible with mysql but you can do sql injection with union queries a bit longer but in term of information disclosure union injections is a must

6478187
jar	war
clearly something has a dependency on that jar file
if it is not showing up in the dependency tree perhaps it is due to a dependency of your webapp war file on another war file that has this dependency

6478484
clang	llvm
-os isn t a valid optimization option for most clang - it s not completely flag-compatible with gcc
the clang man page is authoritative on what options your particular version accepts specifically optimizing by size is not yet a primary concern for llvm

6479305
equals	compareto
the full paragraph reads note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
... this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

6480321
setinterval	settimeout
you could also use setinterval to call your quote replacer
then you wouldn t need to manually restart the timer with the settimeout call but you would run the risk our updates fighting each other if an ajax call takes longer than n_seconds

6480762
queue	fifo
you could do something like you may have to use a different kind of queue if the speed of each download is not the same
blockingqueue is fifo i believe

6481946
shadowing	named
another safeguard you can use is to use shadowing in a good way by defining a proper undefined in a function ...some people prefer to give it a different named
if you somehow can t refrain from shadowing the global undefined or can t keep from trying to reference undeclared variables then use if you adhere to good coding practices and believe in letting broken code break use if you want a different alternative you can use ...where void always returns undefined and doesn t rely on the global property

6482384
postgresql	mysql
if you actually removed those dreaded backticks which are not even necessary in mysql most probably the second statement did not return any values because string comparison in postgresql is case-sensitive and your columns contain a captial s instead of s try
the second statement will not run in postgresql due to the invalid backticks around employees - but maybe that is a copy paste error

6486131
istream	getline
one way is to use istream ignore this will skip the maximum possible number of characters up until a newline is read
for what it s worth though you should probably not be using istream getline as it works with raw c-style strings

6486131
istream	getline
for what it s worth though you should probably not be using istream getline as it works with raw c-style strings
a better option would be to use std string and the free function std getline std string buffer

6491262
svg	vml
all other browsers support svg instead and even in ie ie9 now supports svg and only supports vml effectly as a legacy feature
of course that doesn t help you if you re trying to support ie version 8 and earlier as they only have vml and not svg

6491262
svg	vml
of course that doesn t help you if you re trying to support ie version 8 and earlier as they only have vml and not svg
however there are a number of javascript libraries which allow you to work with svg and will convert on the fly to vml for ie which means that of you use svg you can write code that works in all browsers

6493995
single-quotes	double-quotes
c# uses single-quotes to denote a char and double-quotes to denote a string
use single-quotes not double readstring.replace asc_cr

6496034
implements	extends
consider the ienumerable class which array implements but array has members that are not a part of ienumerable like its indexer
in c# and most of .net a class can inherit extends a single class and implement any number of interfaces

6496557
webkit	gecko
i ve run into these kind of seemingly-obvious bugs before with css transitions and they re a huge pain to deal with without resorting to byzantine hacks that are sure to break once the bug they re working around is fixed in this case my webkit fix
i really dug into this but couldn t come up with a clean solution that worked in the three main transitions-supporting layout engines webkit gecko and presto

6496557
webkit	gecko
my guess is that webkit doesn t have the same issue as presto or gecko but instead includes an optimization that gathers style changes applied in the same function and applies them all at once
again pure speculation from someone who s never gone near the webkit source or css3 spec

6499442
uiview	subviews
there you add and remove the tapgesturerecognizer to the uiview that should dismiss the keyboard when tapped
note you do not have to add it to all of the subviews or controls

6508788
mvp	presenter
i think you are absolutely right when you say the view stores the view state in mvp it s simply the way concerns are separated in mvp
in clean mvp view state is kept in the view and not in the presenter

6508788
mvp	presenter
in clean mvp view state is kept in the view and not in the presenter
the presenter can query the view for it s state using the methods provided by the view s interface

6509028
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
to fix that add vertical-align top a couple of times that works and is consistent between google-chrome firefox opera ie9 8
i realise that i m not really addressing the reason why opera displays differently here

6509539
memcpy	strncpy
returns 3 the memcpy function returns the value of s1
when using memcpy the source and destination buffers can overlap while in strncpy this must not happen

6513533
google-chrome	firefox
also the loading code doesn t seem to work in google-chrome but it would be something to look into as a separate issue
there are some small syntax errors that caused some errors if you are using firefox you should try taking a look into using either the built in javascript error console for firefox or firebug or if you use google-chrome the built in console and that should help you debug you re script

6513983
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you should almost never use sortedlist which is basically an array since complexity is o n for each insert or delete assuming the data is not already sorted
if the data is sorted then you get o 1 but if the data is already sorted then you still don t need to use sortedlist because an ordinary list would have sufficed. instead of sortedlist use sorteddictionary which offers o n log n for insert delete and search

6514314
prepare	execute
after the prepare
you prepared the statement but did not execute it

6515078
rar	zip
for the love of all that s programmy do not rar them
just plain old zip is fine

6515331
serializable	deserialization
the datacontractserializer dcs always serializable the objects as xml but the xml it uses can be both the normal xml with tags or a more compact binary format depending on the xmlwriter you pass to it during serializable and xmlreader during deserialization
another option which gives you more control over the produced xml but it s not as performant is the xmlserializer class which has its own attributes for controlling the serializable

6517854
factors	matrix
construct the 4x4 rotation+translation matrix t by dividing each row of a by the corresponding scale factors
if the scaling is not uniform scale x by 2 y by 4 z by 1 2 you can tell the order of operations by looking at the inner products of the rows and columns of the upper 3x3 matrix with one another

6519881
mri	rubinius
the following ordinary ruby code will make ruby mri 1.8.7 symbol#to_proc slightly less slow than before but not as fast as an ordinary block or a pre-existing proc
however it ll make yarv rubinius and jruby slower hence the if around the monkeypatch

6519881
jruby	mri
however it ll make yarv rubinius and jruby slower hence the if around the monkeypatch
the slowness of using symbol#to_proc isn t solely due to mri 1.8.7 creating a proc each time - even if you re-use an existing one it s still slower than using a block

6520636
implements	extends
create a class extends org.hamcrest.typesafematcher and implements the methods given. add a static constructor method for your class so you can easily call it in your assertthat statement and hand over a example of the object that should not be contained. in the matchessafely method assure that your list contains no object that matches the attributes of your sample
as an alternative implements equals on your object create a sample and then do assertthat yourlist not hasitem yoursample

google-chrome	firefox
if your image width is not specifically set in the tag google-chrome will return 0
firefox and ie will figure out the width but google-chrome will not

6525709
ubuntu	linux
answer no it is not - the best way to find it out is to get the very user-friendly linux distribution ubuntu and try it on your own
you can run the system as a live cd without installing anything if you want to test things. after working a bit with linux you get quickly used to it and even developing applications shouldn t be that hard

6526287
super	self
the general practice while using super is to pass the same parameters as you get from the __init__ method
in your code you are not passing any of the parameters of __init__ to super chef self .__init__ and hence the parameters defined in __init__ are more or less meaningless

6526704
google-chrome	firefox
i tested your code in google-chrome version 12.0.742.100 and it works as intended
the firefox code doesn t work and it s because of margin 0

6527846
profiling	instrumentation
aqtime have a free version of their latest profiling it supports .net 4 but i doubt it can do a mixed profiling of native and managed
if you are really serious about it you might look into the microsoft xperf tools they have a steep learning curve but they are free and i doubt any commercial profiling can do what xperf can the instrumentation is in the os not in a separate process thus either vista win7 or win2k8 are required

6528791
lxml	elementtree
i don t have lxml installed but the built-in xml.etree library is similar but doesn t support pretty_print
wrap the root element in an elementtree and use the write method

6529185
profiling	debugging
i changed all my settings debugging not to the distribution profiling just to be sure i built it again and checked out the embedded.mob and binary as you suggested no go again
i went nuclear - deleted all my profiles downloaded only the distribution build i needed here is when it became interesting - i could not build it on debugging expected but i was having the same problem of profiling not found even when i was in ad hoc archiving mode

6529185
profiling	debugging
i went nuclear - deleted all my profiling downloaded only the distribution build i needed here is when it became interesting - i could not build it on debugging expected but i was having the same problem of profiling not found even when i was in ad hoc archiving mode
surely that means that there remains a reference to the developer mode even when i was trying to archive it given that i have already changed all my settings and deleted all my other profiling so i digged up project.pbxproj and found the offending line that was still trying to access my development profiling in ad hoc build

6529431
single-quotes	double-quotes
variables are only interpolated in double-quoted strings not single-quotes strings
change those to double-quotes like this this will interpolate the variable into the string so you re now sending call getpicturedataforsendmsg abc1 to the database

6530371
aggregate-functions	sum
from the documentation page about aggregate-functions it should be noted that except for count these functions return a null value when no rows are selected
in particular sum of no rows returns null not zero as one might expect

6530371
sum	coalesce
in particular sum of no rows returns null not zero as one might expect
the coalesce function may be used to substitute zero for null when necessary

6530371
coalesce	nvl
the coalesce function may be used to substitute zero for null when necessary
so if you want to guarantee a value returned apply coalesce to the result of sum not to its argument select coalesce sum capacity 0 as for the oracle subquestion well i couldn t find any notion of nulls at the official doc page the one for 10.2 in particular but two other sources are unambiguous oracle sql functions sum of values of n ignoring nulls sum aggregate function oracle sql if a sum is created over some numbers nulls are disregarded as the following example shows that is you needn t apply nvl to capacity

6530443
sum	coalesce
i removed the coalesce inside of sum then the query become fast
just do this select coalesce sum capacity 0 from objects where null is not null

6530443
sum	coalesce
just do this select coalesce sum capacity 0 from objects where null is not null
by the way coalesce inside of sum is redundant even if capacity is null it won t make the summary null

6530443
aggregate-functions	coalesce
and a coalesce inside an aggregate-functions is a performance killer too as your rdbms engine cannot just rip through all the rows it has to evaluate each row s column if its value is null
i ve seen a bit ocd query where all the aggregate queries has a coalesce inside i think the original dev has a symptom of cargo cult programming the query is way very sloooowww

6532034
implements	extends
java provides a built-in mechanism to implements interfaces at run-time called dynamic proxy classes
there are also good libraries like cglib or javassist that allow you not only to implements interfaces but also to extends classes and to manipulate bytecode at run-time to change the behavior of a method for example

6532115
apache	nginx
apache will only act when you use svn which will not be so often
if you don t want to put the effort on moving stuff to nginx which i can understand then just move java apps to jetty and use apache 2 as reverse proxy for play

6533269
prepare	execute
it s not the structure you use stored procedures prepare statements etc. that is decisive but whether you are at any point concatenating sql together using unchecked user input
for example you can execute dynamic sql from within a stored procedure in which case the danger is still there

6537022
serializable	deserialization
in addition take care not to have both arrays and generics in the classes from which you serializable the instances with wcf because you ll get a problem during deserialization everything will be converted either to arrayof if you don t change the configuration or to collection type
as result you will get errors during deserialization from the wcf code trying to assign an array where you wait a collection and conversely

6537310
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
you should create uitabbaritem and pass array of that in setitems method
you should do something like below i am not sure what it will do as i am always using uitabbarcontroller

6538193
super	self
the first point as others have mentioned is that you must always use the current class in your super call not the superclass - in this case super secondclass self
that s because super means get the parent of class x so obviously you mean get the parent of secondclass - which is firstclass

6538381
octal	decimal
file modes are generally specified in octal as that nicely separates the bits into the three unix permission groups owner group other file.chmod 0777 filename so you re not actually setting the file to full access you re setting the permission bits to 01411 which comes out like this -r----x--t rather than the -rwxrwxrwx that you re expecting
notice that your decimal 777 permission bitmap has removed write permission

6538399
thin	webrick
make sure you run it with thin or rainbows
it will not work on mongrel or webrick

6539910
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
there are a many ways to achieve this with miglayout and i find it so much friendlier to use than gridbaglayout and just as capable if not more so
you won t need borderlayout flowlayout boxlayout etc

6541008
lxml	libxml2
so upgrade your lxml and you ll be fine
i don t know exactly in which versions of lxml the problem occurs but i believe the problem was not so much with lxml itself but with the version of libxml2 used to build the windows binary

6544326
oncreate	findviewbyid
if this code snippet above is what you copied-and-pasted out of your oncreate method then the main problem i see why it s giving you a null pointer error is because you haven t set the current activity s view to the xml layout with all the stuff in it
in other words findviewbyid doesn t know where you find those id s you re referring to

6544889
google-chrome	firefox
the ones you ve shown in your example are dom0 event handlers though which you can check for you can loop through the properties on the element looking at the ones starting with on and see whether they have a value update apparently at least on google-chrome the onxyz properties are non-enumerable so they don t show up in for..in loops
and on firefox you only see the ones assigned programmatically not via attributes

6545353
jar	manifest.mf
if that is not possible then i just include the jar in my bundle and updates manifest.mf - bundle-classpath library.jar
i usually use the following strategy if i can find the jar in question packaged as a bundle - the manifest.mf contains the correct entries - then i use this

6548800
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
your regular uiviewcontroller example has wantsfullscreenlayout set to no which causes the view to be automatically sized so it doesn t go under the status bar
uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller on the other hand default wantsfullscreenlayout to yes

6549358
google-chrome	firefox
what you have will likely work fine...just not locally in google-chrome
you can verify this by testing in another browser like firefox or by launching google-chrome with a command line switch to disable this safety feature only for testing

6549668
google-chrome	firefox
difference is that google-chrome will show you a list of all permissions not just the ones you ve granted already
for firefox right-click the page view page info there go to the permissions tab

6549794
serializable	deserialization
the general case is that the instance that serializable an object will not be the same as the one that deserializes it
what you can do is write custom deserialization logic for your class via readobject and writeobject

6550724
factors	mean
this factors directly affects the average time
assuming you mean push_back and not insertion i believe that the important part is the multiply by some constant as opposed to grabbing n more elements each time and as long as you do this you ll get amortized constant time

6551549
google-chrome	firefox
the workaround seems to be to add the following was looking at this for a while in google-chrome and couldn t see the problem
i think it s this bug in firefox

6554158
octal	decimal
you want to use 777 octal not decimal mkdir file1 file2 file3 0777
777 decimal turns out to be 1411 octal which will give you the bitmask 1 100 001 001 which is why you re getting those strange permissions

6556441
keystore	jks
if you do not have a requirement on keystore type you can switch to jks which is java s keystore and allows to set trusted certificates not part of the private key
for jks you can use the default provider sun

6556441
keystore	jks
update so your code would have to change as follows now you use the keystore store in your code which has the server s trusted certificate and not the private key
if you already have a p12 then you can not use jks for keymanager

6556868
fseek	fread
you can use fseek and fputc if you know exactly the position of the char
if not you should better first fread the file and find the needed position

6557414
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not display the password text when the page loads. also - firefox will display your password when autofill is switched on
i received the same error message while attempting to do this in firefox 5

6557849
jar	war
it means the searched-for class definition existed when the currently executing class was compiled but the definition can no longer be found as you say you correctly imported this class but to put it bluntly you are not giving the jar file for this class to the jvm when you are booting up jetty
in other words make sure you include the jar for this class when you build your war

6559638
udp	tcp
since you ve chosen to to use udp a fair choice if your data isn t really important and benefits more from lower latency than reliable communication you don t have much of a choice here a server is a piece of code for receiving packets from the network and your client is for sending packets into the network
udp doesn t provide any mechanism for the server to communicate to the client unlike tcp which establishes a 2 way socket

6561877
mongodb	bson
mongodb supports multiple indexes on a single collection you can query on many different fields not just the key or id
mongodb used bson a binary form of json

6562586
vim	emacs
so long as vim will balance s as you type it has the only feature you really need in your editor
eventually you might well choose to look into slime which needs emacs but it s certainly not necessary to get started

6564252
ssl	https
there are lots of references to this kind of issue on the microsoft support site also internet explorer file downloads over ssl do not work with the cache control headers
everyone who used file downloads on https is likely to have hit this problem with internet explorer

6564253
jboss	glassfish
you may have to add an entry to your web.xml as described in the jboss 6 documentation
if you find new issues i recommend you report them - though refer to the specs and not the glassfish implementation for the final word on expected behaviour

6565912
nsmutablestring	nsstring
unless you re actually modifying a string you shouldn t use nsmutablestring
you re reassigning the whole string to a new value so stay with a regular nsstring

6566685
google-chrome	firefox
well as you said you wanted to know whether this is a problem with firefox or not so i went and tested in google-chrome and it worked fine
my conclusion being that the lastmodifieddate attribute of a file object is not implemented in firefox 5 but is in google-chrome

6568120
awt	swing
as other answers have said it executes your runnable on the awt event-dispatching thread
because the swing data structures aren t thread-safe so to provide programmers with an easily-achievable way of preventing concurrent access to them the swing designers laid down the rule that all code that accesses them must run on the same thread

6568507
udp	tcp
udp is unreliable in the sense that it does not check if all of the packets are received by the clients
opening a lot of tcp connections to a lot of clients is not broadcast

6569572
floating-point	fractions
a canonical article on this topic is what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic
languages that use binary floating point representations python is one cannot represent all fractions values exactly

6569807
trie	tree
what you need is a prefix tree trie
this is a tree where each level corresponds to a position in the string root 0 level 1 first letter etc. and each node corresponds to a letter. the node also contains a boolean say isword specifying whether there is a word ending there or not and in your case you need another int say index to specify the index of the word in your initial ordering in case

6570305
super	extends
super list string string but this will allow clients to pass a converter object string as well as a converter collection string string etc
extends string does not mean any subtype of list string but an unknown subtype of list string

6571581
union	distinct
in that case have to make a query joining the tables so union is not an option you indeed need the result as one column in that case give the column an alias and bind the alias select distinct author as mycolumn from tblbook union select distinct bookcode as mycolumn from tblbook
you make a query of two distinct things

6571705
jar	war
according to the maven convention best practices you should not keep jar files in your project
convert your project to a fully war based maven project

6572160
gtk	gdk
if you want to receive events on the image such as button clicks place the image inside a gtk eventbox then connect to the event signals on the event box so i guess try to put a signal on an eventbox after wrapping the image with the eventbox
from gtk image is a no window widget has no gdk window of its own so by default does not receive events

6573211
icomparable	compareto
tnum is constrained to implement icomparable which doesn t have the operators you re using and
you should use the compareto method instead to use the operators take a look here

6576956
udp	tcp
it isn t the same thing as sending a udp datagram via a datagramsocket with a target address of 255.255.255.255 which is what you were advised to do
trying to connect a tcp socket to the non-existent ip address 255.255.255.255 a is impossible and b doesn t send anything anywhere

6581636
google-chrome	firefox
here s one that may be helpful during development when using google-chrome
this does not work for firefox although it works in google-chrome

6582814
profiling	instrumentation
the profiling only instrumentation a subset of the multiprocessors to collect data and then scales the results up to the full gpu
if your code doesn t evenly fill every mp with the same number of blocks then there can be variation in the resulting profiling output depending on how much work the profiling mp s received on a given run

6582963
cstring	bstr
you have a mismatch of three types cstring _bstr_t and char. try to unify all three operands to a single type to cstring
this means that compiler cannot choose which + operation to use for bstr + char concatenations

6584673
inline	inlining
so might end up emitting code that looks as though you ve written note that whether to actually inline a function is a decision made by the compiler based on its own optimization rules
those rules might take account of whether the function is marked inline or not but quite likely don t unless you re using compiler options to force inlining or whatever

6586853
uiview	uiwindow
another note if you want to intercept touches to that shadow view you can either make it a giant button subclass uiview to override one of the touch methods like touchesended or change it to a uicontrol which can receive touch events like a uibutton but without the extra options for text shadows states etc
while dan s suggestion is on target you cannot use a modal view controller in this case because a typical modal covers the entire screen blocking the parent view controller even if you have the background of your view as transparent you ll see whatever you have in the application s uiwindow

6587528
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos
installing on debian wheezy and newer and ubuntu trusty tahr and newer for python 2.x run the following command from a terminal sudo apt-get install python-pip installing on debian wheezy and newer and ubuntu trusty tahr and newer for python 3.x run the following command from a terminal sudo apt-get install python3-pip note on a fresh debian ubuntu install the package may not be found until you do sudo apt-get update installing pip on centos 7 for python 2.x on centos 7 you have to install setup tools first and then use that to install pip as there is no direct package for it
sudo yum install python-setuptools sudo easy_install pip installing pip on centos 7 for python 3.x assuming you installed python 3.4 from epel you can install python 3 s setup tools and use it to install pip

6587528
centos	linux
sudo yum install python-setuptools sudo easy_install pip installing pip on centos 7 for python 3.x assuming you installed python 3.4 from epel you can install python 3 s setup tools and use it to install pip
# first command requires you to have enabled epel for centos7 sudo yum install python34-setuptools sudo easy_install pip if your unix linux distro doesn t have it in package repos install using the manual way detailed below

6587630
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you could use a single uiviewcontroller with different full screen views being showed hidden but i don t really see the point of doing it that way the uinavigationcontroller will also feel familiar for your users where a custom solution might not
i strongly suggest you use a uinavigationcontroller possibly as a modalviewcontroller as it is intended to be used that way with a chain of sub view controllers for each step of configuration

6589357
floating-point	fractions	decimal	ieee
binary floating-point numbers are inept at handling decimal fractions so 0.1 + 0.2 is not equal to 0.3
this is the most frequently reported bug in javascript and it is an intentional consequence of having adopted the ieee standard for binary floating-point arithmetic ieee 754

6589433
mvp	presenter
that s about mvp then
this is only needed to decouple your view and presenter mostly to make mocking in unit tests easier this is particularly of the view interface though not much for the presenter one unless writing a test harness for you views

6591060
treemap	linkedhashmap
conveniently if you want to keep storing your data in a linkedhashmap you can simply load up a treemap with your current instance with some performance tradeoff of course
linkedhashmap doesn t offer a way to start iterating in the middle of its ordered view of the map s data

6592428
serializable	deserialization
doing so will require a good understanding of java s serializable format but it can certainly be done
though if you are asking if there is any way to modify the original instance of a through serializable as in to somehow get the same object to change in value without constructing a new instance via deserialization then the answer is no you cannot

6592428
serializable	deserialization
though if you are asking if there is any way to modify the original instance of a through serializable as in to somehow get the same object to change in value without constructing a new instance via deserialization then the answer is no you cannot
serializable simply creates a snapshot of the object s current state

6593663
requestfactory	gwt
if you use java on your backend server you can use one of the libraries danb suggested to process it on the server and then use requestfactory or rpc to transmit it to the client browser for further processing displaying
i am not sure if this is clear enough to you but it is not possible to process the excel file in gwt at least not directly

6593893
ienumerable	ilist
if you invoke contains on a ienumerable it will invoke the extension method which will just iterate through the items in order to find it
hence it doesn t warn with ilist

6596120
bmp	png
so in other words the bmp is not actually converted to another file type it s just compressed very much like you would by zipping it
whatever they re doing it must be good for it compressed better than the image with png compression

6596642
viewmodel	caliburn
features module manager for enabling or disabling of modules at runtime messaging services for interacting with the user from the client or server using the same api command service to associate wpf icommands with content interfaces that only become active when an active view or viewmodel implements the interface region adapters for toolbars and menus client-server logging ready to work out-of-the-box includes modules such as a web browser text editor output window and many more tabbed interface with dirty file indication reusable across modules nroute author rishi silverlight support yes documentation many articles available on author s blog see codeplex project home page for the links hosting codeplex license ms-pl features support blend3 behaviors and triggers models resource locator framework view services openfiledialog showmessage uses attributes to map view and viewmodel together nito mvvm author shammah silverlight support no documentation no hosting codeplex license not specified features various mvvm friendly implementations of the icommand interface ocean author karl shifflet silverlight support no documentation articles available on karl s blog hosting personal website license not specified features written in vb.net attribute based validation viewmodel base classes relaycommand closeableviewmodel sql server data access layer basic mvvm framework author lester lobo silverlight support no documentation sample application available with the library hosting codeplex license ms-pl features delegating commands keybinding messaging between viewmodel s handling events as commands with attached behaviors handling dialogs and more as services vs code snippets goodlight author peter o hanlon silverlight support yes documentation sample application available with the library hosting codeplex license ms-pl features workspace management set of document that can be closed skin support messaging between viewmodel s

ubuntu	debian
i assume that the pear version you re running has been installed via ubuntu s apt
find out where it has been installed with apt on debian ubuntu now let s see where pear installs the files to on my machine it is the same - but probably not on yours which is the problem

6598044
implements	extends
for writing you could implements a similar futuretask
note you need not extends the functionality of an existing stream reader writer like i did

6599945
vb.net	vb6
it s vb.net which is really a whole new language
the code uses a feature that is not available in vb6 generics

6600933
google-chrome	firefox
not really sure about safari but i imagine it is similar to google-chrome
for firefox dom.storage.enabled the web applications 1.0 specification defines a mechanism allowing web pages to store information with a web browser similar to cookies called client-side session and persistent storage. although use of session storage is subject to a user s cookie preferences this preference allows it to be disabled entirely

6601056
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
as you say you are not supposed to subclass uinavigationcontroller instead you use them as they are and you add viewcontroller on the uinavigationcontroller s
then after setting the root viewcontroller in each uinavigationcontroller you add the uinavigationcontroller to the uitabbarcontroller phew

6601454
opera	firefox
this type of calculation isn t currently supported in css certainly not in chromium 12 ubuntu 11.04 but there is a calc function defined in css 3 which would allow for this kind of behaviour using simple mathematical functions above example taken directly from the w3.org . my own in-exhaustive tests show +----------------+-------------------+ | browser | ubuntu 11.04 | +----------------+-------------------+ | chromium 12 | fails | | firefox 5 | fails | | opera 11.10 | fails | +----------------+-------------------+ the above results were obtained using the named browsers and a css calc demo the code of which is below html css if anyone would like to run the above test in the browsers on their platform and supply the results or edit them in to this answer that would be much appreciated. as pointed out by clairesuzy in comments take a look at caniuse it does work in firefox if you use width -moz-calc but that s about it
and indeed in firefox 5 ubuntu 11.04 it does work the other vendor prefixes don t appear to do anything for opera or webkit though

6604655
profiling	benchmarking
i think these three suggestions will supply you with enough programs to test your concurrency profiling
i would recommend looking around or asking the authors for the ibm contest benchmarking suite as it contains a number of java concurrency bugs unfortunately not large open-source programs

6606375
postgresql	mysql
well javascript is client side laguage - means it is executed in browser - it has nothing to do with your server side technologies php mysql postgresql
your problem might be from some queries that are mysql specific and are not working with postgresql take a look in apache s error log files and see if some errors are appearing when you press the buttons that are not working

6609812
mp3	wav
you can use javalayer to decode mp3 into wav
cutting a 40-second clip from a wav shouldn t be a problem

6612047
mp3	ogg
firefox doesn t support mp3 via html5
ogv files are ogg video not audio ogg which could be why it s not playing in the audio tag

6613468
vim	emacs
in general many linux enthusiasts use emacs or vi or vim for their editing
at first glance you may not see the power they have but emacs is definitely a wonderful editor and vi is very good once you become familiar with it

6614032
implements	extends
the problem is that the edittext class is not serializable if you debug and put a break point at on the printstacktrace and examine the ioexception it will tell you that classes have to use implements serializable in order for them to be written out as objects which edittext does not have
you can not extends the class and add the serializable tag either because the underlying class will still throw the exception

6614272
margin	text-align
or since you have a width declared on the input you can remove the text-align center and use margin 0 auto 1em auto
text-align does not work on block elements

6617740
bash	zsh
one way to create slaves like this is co-processes with coproc in zsh and newer bash or with special syntax in ksh
your bash probably doesn t support this yet

6618799
strcpy	malloc
i m willing to bet that your strcpy 3 calls here have written outside the bounds of the memory you ve allocated strlen 3 does not account for the 0 terminator at the end of c strings so your and are allocated one-byte-too-short
because this is so common it is an easy pattern to find bugs if i don t see a + 1 in the malloc 3 call it s almost certainly a bug

6618898
profiling	debugging
if that doesn t do it and the memory profiling doesn t show you any problems try adding a gc.collect as this may help if your large object heap is getting fragmented which is relatively likely with this sort of code
ants memory profiling is an invaluable tool for debugging these types of problems

6619995
google-chrome	firefox
note works fine in firefox 3 and above ie before 9 and google-chrome do not support multiple selection
google-chrome doesn t highlight all cells but captures all content

6622191
textview	imageview
if you do not need to show an image in the imageview i suggest to use a textview instead
you can put all your text in the textview and with the android autolink all attribute all links to webpages phonenumbers maps and email will be highlighted

6626326
cassini	iis
however sadly cassini does not allow remote connections
you might be able to use install iis express see this link without administrative privileges

6627679
cassini	iis
ultidev cassini is not actually dormant
its successor ultidev web server pro uws has been under development for more than a year and has become closer to iis in functionality not in size or complexity

6627679
cassini	iis
ultidev cassini is not limited to loopback ips host names
new uws uses http.sys kernel driver as listener - same as iis

6627679
cassini	iis
ultidev cassini and uws do queue requests but handle in parallel by pooled threads
inability to serve wcf with wshttpbinding is not a limitation of simpleworkerrequests but rather of wcf s assumption that whenever it s hosted in an asp.net appdomain then it s hosted either iis or original cassini and nothing else

6631149
margin	text-align
if that doesn t work you can try auto width with centerign margin or
firstly the tag is depreciated as per my suggestion would be to put all of the facebook like stuff in a div with text-align center

6631798
g++	gcc
sizeof int will generally be larger - unless you re using an obscure platform with 16-bit bytes which you re probably not. i ve called it test.c and copied it as test.cc as well compiling and linking test.c with gcc and test.cc with g++ works as expected compiling and linking test.cc with gcc doesn t work it compiles the code as c++ because the file ends in .cc but fails at the link stage which we can prove by separately compiling with gcc and linking with g++ to pull in the right libraries .
gcc has compiled the code as c++ rather than c because it had a .cc file extension

6632034
bash	subshell
i don t have ubuntu 10.10 to hand to test with but i d guess that your bin sh is not bash but a smaller and simpler shell with only the basic features required by posix
in which case probably launches a subshell which launches a subshell which does nothing but set a variable min to the string min-2 and then exit. try #

6636667
uiview	subviews
i ve added an illustration below in case it s not clear. it s not just a memory issue though because a uilabel object has all kinds of other overhead its own dozen properties and methods the several dozen properties and methods it inherited from uiview another dozen inherited from uiresponder and more than another dozen from uiobject
that uilabel can do all kinds of nifty things as a result have colors and shadows and alpha transparency and manage word wrap and have gesture recognizers attached and be animated and have its own subviews etc

6643228
dictionary	map
as is probably obvious this should precede the loop so we aren t redefining the dictionary every time through
now we have to map ln to one of these dictionary values

6643228
dictionary	map
now we have to map ln to one of these dictionary values
but the odds are good that ln isn t equal to any of the above numbers and so we cant plug it directly into the dictionary

6646312
innodb	myisam
the critical factor is concurrency the isam type engines are faster under single user workloads and fall apart as soon as concurrent workloads are being tested see myisam versus innodb
there are other factors too like warm up time not being considered since innodb like engines need to warm up the buffer pool but isam ones work reasonably fast on cold caches

6647615
nsmutablestring	nsstring
your assignment of it to an nsmutablestring does not actually make it an nsmutablestring so what you ve written is equivalent to
scott s answer is the correct general one but in this particular case the reason is that nsstring literals are uniqued compile-time constants and do not actually do anything at all when retained and released

6649329
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know why you think google-chrome would round or floor the value when accessing an array but it doesn t do that at all
neither does firefox

6650375
actionscript	mxml
when optimizing flex projects for mobile devices be sure to build your custom skins in actionscript not in mxml
since mxml is turned into as3 by the flex compiler it is not always the most performance intensive

6653563
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow is not a uiview and does not need a uiviewcontroller
on the other hand you can create any object you like inside of a mainwindow.xib so you can also have a uiview in there which you then add to the uiwindow instance and its corresponding uiviewcontroller

6654813
uiview	subviews
i am currently working on a solution to this but so far here is a question that can show you how to add the view from another nib file to a uiview control
i managed to place a nib file in a uiview control but i have the problem that the subviews will not rotate if the device does

6654935
profiling	instrumentation
the difficult part of using the time profiling instrumentation is interpreting the results
the time profiling instrumentation isn t going to tell you your app spends 75 of its time in function x

6655186
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
internet explorer and opera do not support it yet
so far the resize css property is only supported by the gecko and webkit engines firefox google-chrome and safari

6657113
keystore	jks
you would have to create a new keystore of type jceks to support secret keys
the cannot store non-privatekeys error message usually indicates you are trying to use secret symmetric keys with a jks keystore type

6657113
keystore	jks
the cannot store non-privatekeys error message usually indicates you are trying to use secret symmetric keys with a jks keystore type
the jks keystore type only supports asymmetric public private keys

6658225
multiplying	division
if you multiplying by 3 first you get which is representable and will not be rounded
this is a result of integer division

6660628
udp	tcp
you mentioned multicast - that would mean that you have some centralized source of data that transmits information and all the rest listen - in this case there s no benefit for p2p and multicast as a udp protocol may not work well accross multiple networks
but you can use tcp connections to each of the nodes and multicast on your own and not through igmp

6667923
ssl	https
i can tell you re at least not using ssl because you didn t use the -usessl switch
note that ssl https is not configured by default - that s an extra step you ll have to take

6667923
kerberos	ntlm
if the authentication scheme is different from kerberos or if the client computer is not joined to a domain then https transport must be used or the destination machine must be added to the trustedhosts configuration setting. the computername parameters of the new-pssession enter-pssession and invoke-command cmdlets accept an ip address as a valid value
however because kerberos authentication does not support ip addresses ntlm authentication is used by default whenever you specify an ip address

6667923
kerberos	ntlm
however because kerberos authentication does not support ip addresses ntlm authentication is used by default whenever you specify an ip address
when using ntlm authentication the following procedure is required for remoting. 1

6670263
prng	random
for example in multiplayer games a player might find out the internal state of the prng and use that to predict future random events guess the opponent cards get better loot .
one common pitfall using time to seed a prng is that the time doesn t change very often

6672712
cakephp	kohana
these four are mvc frameworks cakephp symfony codeigniter kohana i prefer codeigniter and kohana because they re pretty focused and not bloated at all and because they both besides being mvc are also big on the convention over configuration principle meaning you don t have to go around maintaining xml yaml etc config files of your classes url routes etc
in particular i like kohana because it has this nifty file system-based configuration hierarchy they call it cascading filesystem which basically means you have even less configuration nonsense to maintain because based on where you put your app s files classes config files etc the framework will know which parts of the system will be overridden

6672863
clang	llvm
clang docs doesn t do as much as gcc though and the docs seem to suggest it may also do the gcc ones
gcc has a set of atomic builtin functions but it does not have a plain atomic fetch however you could do something like to work around that gcc docs are here and there s that blog post above edit ah clang i know llvm ir has atomics in it but i don t know if clang exposes them in any way but it might be worth a shot to see if it complains about using the gcc ones it might support them

6674721
mongodb	bson
mongodb s underlying storage format bson doesn t support high-percision decimals only 64-bit floating point numbers
javascript in mongodb is single-threaded and can be a bit slow

6675428
cpython	pypy
running pypy on cpython wouldn t help besides slowing things down terribly because the api wouldn t interact with pypy s object model it would interact with that of the cpython host environment
pypy has alpha-level support for the cpython extension api via an emulation layer called cpyext

6675956
addition	modulo
at the cpu level there s no real reason for a cpu not to bail out on detecting potential overflow ignoring an addition or generating some manner of exception if the latter s not propagated to the os app or is ignored by them then the original value might be seen
but most cpus treat + 1 for signed types the same as they would for unsigned types which c c++ require to simply wrap round modulo 2 #bits .

6677840
cassini	iis
try iis express as an alternative for cassini that s why ms released it
as far as i know this is not possible - cassini does not support comprssion

6678664
decimal	ieee
ieee 754 on wikipedia the ieee standard for floating-point arithmetic is a technical standard established by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers and the most widely used standard for floating-point computation ... the standard defines arithmetic formats sets of binary and decimal floating-point data which consist of finite numbers including signed zeros and subnormal numbers infinities and special not a number values nans ...
the ecmascript javascript standard specifies that numbers are ieee 754 floats which include nan as a possible value

6678869
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
firefox and google-chrome safari triggers the domcontentloaded event before font-face is applied thus causing the problem
the solution is to not listen for domcontentloaded but instead go oldschool and listen to onreadystatechange and wait until the which is always triggered after font-face is applied as far as i can tell by my tests - which is of course what always happens in ie since it doesn t support domcontentloaded

6679152
freebsd	linux
freebsd would need dev ttyu 0-9 + i can t say i m enamoured of the way it picks which os it s running under either
i had a look at this and it seems the mono code for enumerating serial ports is not going to work on anything but linux

6683124
gitolite	gitosis
also you should really be using gitolite
gitosis is not being updated anymore

6684058
equals	gethashcode
or quoting from the docs if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

6684058
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

6685089
wav	ogg
depending on the formats you stream to you have a few options html5 audio objects codec compatibility varies from browser to browser and i am not aware of any format besides wav that is cross-compatible
if you have ogg and mp3 you should cover all current browsers supporting html5 audio

6685361
awt	swing
drawing directly in a jframe s paint method will only allow awt type drawing since the jframe directly inherits from frame a heavy weight container and since awt graphics does not use double buffering by default and this will lead to choppy animation
when you draw in a jcomponent s paintcomponent method such as a jpanel s you use swing which uses double-buffering when drawing by default

6685469
g++	gcc
on most systems you will need to install g++ along with libstdc++ etc to compile c++ code
gcc is a frontend that can be instructed to compile c++ but that usage is not recommended

6688339
equals	gethashcode
you should not rely on the implementation of string s gethashcode other than the fact that strings of equals value will produce the same hash code - but what the particular value of the hash code will be is only required to be consistent as per the documentation for the current execution of an application - a different hash code can be returned if the application is run again
also the implementation of gethashcode might be different if you have different .net clr versions on the machines in question the behavior of gethashcode is dependent on its implementation which might change from one version of the common language runtime to another

6688546
postgresql	mysql
after several frustrating hours i found the solution here basically the postgresql gem ended up using a different version of openssl
the details of how all that works under the hood are still not totally clear to me but the way to get unstuck is uninstall openssl and postgresql uninstall pg gem gem uninstall pg install openssl and postgresql using homebrew fork and install pg gem from source i downloaded it and ran rake install this can happen even with the mysql gem from reading around

6692376
google-chrome	firefox
i also had trouble with this not just in ie but also in google-chrome and safari using jquery 1.6.2
this solution appears to work as intended in all browsers i ve tried google-chrome safari ie firefox

6693632
xmltype	clob
assuming that the header and xml are both character data and the header is a fixed length i d probably use a combination of dbms_lob.converttoclob to turn the blob into a clob dbms_lob.substr to get a clob that has the xml portion xmltype.createxml clob to assign the xml to your xmltype xmltype.extract to apply your xpath expression if the header isn t character data you can still use dbms_lob.substr but it will return a raw which you ll need to convert
if the header isn t fixed length you can search for the location of the so based on the comments use something like this to build a clob that has what you want where offset is the number of bytes to the start of your actual xml

6695465
gif	png
it doesn t have the same optimizations for gif and jpeg
in addition if you add a png file as part of your xcode project then xcode will convert the png file into an apple specific variant of png

6695939
ssl	https
the header response of http 1.1 or 1.0 is absolutely correct for https traffic the ssl tls encryption does not change the transferred data but is a transport layer on top of http traffic
regarding http analyzer from their website at main features support https show you unencrypted data sent over https ssl connections as the same level of detail as http. so as i said it decodes the ssl and shows you the http based unencrypted traffic

6696593
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
as of july 2011 ie 9 firefox 5 and google-chrome 12 do not throw this error
safari 5 still does

6698092
lisp	scheme
as for dynamic non-oo languages i m not aware of many examples outside lisp scheme
common lisp s clos makes lisp a proper oo language and provides dynamic dispatch as well as multiple dispatch you can add or remove generics and methods at run-time and they can key off the type of more than just the first parameter

6700803
primes	modulus
in the non-prime case i think it could be that all leading entries aren t relatively primes so you have to combine them
a hackish trick which works when rounding errors aren t an issue find the regular inverse may have non-integer entries and the determinant an integer both implemented in numpy multiply the inverse by the determinant and round to integers hacky now multiply everything by the determinant s multiplicative inverse modulo your modulus code below do entrywise mod by your modulus a less hackish way is to actually implement gaussian elimination

6700803
primes	modulus
back then it worked for random matrices in my case the moduli were products of large primes
basically the first non-zero entry might not be relatively prime to the modulus

6700803
primes	modulus
basically the first non-zero entry might not be relatively primes to the modulus
the primes case is easy since you can search for a different row and swap

6703555
ssl	https
is a problem use the ip based ssl addon
dns redirects wouldn t care whether the inbound request is http or https so would maintain the original protocol - so would redirect to and the same for https

6704895
g++	gcc
btw strictly speaking the equivalent of g++ main.cpp -o main is cc1plus main.cpp -o main.o ld -o main main.o cc1plus may well not be on your path
i found mine in usr libexec gcc i386-redhat-linux 4.1.1 g++ -c main.cpp does traditionally perform that first step

6705361
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if you are not scrupulously careful those null values are going to come back to bite you as nullpointerexception s
so really your application code should either catch and deal with the illegalargumentexception that arises when the conversion goes wrong or it should allow the exception to bubble up to the top where it can be reported as for instance an error parsing the input stream

6706213
google-chrome	firefox
taking felix s performance test and making it pessimistic worst case and none of them match suggests that even google-chrome can t optimize it enough to make the repeated function calls not come out worse
i didn t do any comprehensive tests but google-chrome firefox and opera all came out about 60 slower

6709589
client-side	server-side
client-side caching should really only be used to assist with performance and bandwidth on the static parts of your site
if you set output cache on your aspx page that s server-side cache and you have a scenario where .net can decide whether to send pre-cached content or not and still apply acl rules

6714313
super	self
you have two choices to call queue.queue explicitly as suggested in toreltwiddler s answer or to add object to the bases class myqueue queue.queue object def __init__ self super myqueue self .__init__
queue.queue is an old-style class and as such it doesn t support many of the features of new-style classes such as super

6719193
shadowing	named
what you are doing is not overriding but shadowing
the new keyword lets you have a display method in both the classes bc and dc but the methods are not related at all they just have the same named

6720700
haskell	scheme
an example of a language where this would not be possible is haskell
most functional programming languages scheme included are unpure and would allow you to do so

6722323
base	fractions
from wikipedia for instance 1 5 cannot be represented exactly as a floating point number using a binary base but can be represented exactly using a decimal base
in your particular case a float and double will have different rounding for the irrational repeating fractions that must be used to represent 1.1 in binary

6723322
trie	tree
the trie was the first data structure of this kind discovered
the suffix tree is an improvement over the trie it has suffix links which allow linear error search the suffix tree trims unnecessary branches of the trie therefore it does not require as much space

6723322
trie	tree
the suffix tree is an improvement over the trie it has suffix links which allow linear error search the suffix tree trims unnecessary branches of the trie therefore it does not require as much space
the suffix array is a stripped down data structure based on the suffix tree no suffix links slow error matches yet pattern matching is very fast

6723322
trie	tree
the trie is not for real world use because it consumes too much space
the suffix tree is lighter and faster than the trie and is used to index dna or optimize some large web search engines

6723529
ssl	https
since apache has no problem whatsoever with connect when no ssl is involved i turn off ssl features and i use stunnel to serve an https version of my site
this does not require any recompilation and allows your site to serve https normally

6724447
google-chrome	firefox
here an example css demo in firefox the result is as excepted but google-chrome breaks it
i added a hack that make the height bigger this improve it but doesn t make it the same as firefox

6725715
inline	inlining
to prove that the code was semantically equal and perform this optimization not just that call would have to be inline but every access to the class
the compiler may well decide that inlining the class would not yield sufficient benefit

6726570
apache	nginx
threads problem only apply if one uses embedded php apache s mod-php for example and runs server that uses threads like apache server with worker-mpm
so - thread safety issue does not apply to you if you use nginx server it doesn t use threads. you use apache with either threaded mpm or not and php in fastcgi mode you use apache with non-threaded mpm as prefork-mpm and php in mod-php mode

6726570
apache	nginx
so - thread safety issue does not apply to you if you use nginx server it doesn t use threads. you use apache with either threaded mpm or not and php in fastcgi mode you use apache with non-threaded mpm as prefork-mpm and php in mod-php mode
so - most people with default apache install shouldn t worry about gettext not being thread safe as default apache s install in most distro s uses non-threaded prefork-mpm

6726650
inline	inlining
it s also much less likely to be inline
note that this doesn t prevent inlining -- the function could still be inline at link time in exactly the same way that a normal non-inline function can still be inline

6727890
serializable	deserialization
if you want to safely deserialize serializable instances each version of the class needs a unique serialversionuid
the deserialization process checks this value when deserializing - if it doesn t match an exception is thrown preventing the serialized data from being deserialized into the wrong version of the class

6727901
serializable	deserialization
if you do not specify a version the jvm will use some internal rules to try to work out on its own whether or not the serializable object and the version in its own classloader are compatible
this can result in a situation where someone has an outdated jar but the deserialization still works because the newer version of the class didn t change it in a way that is picked up as an incompatibility

6731933
super	implements
subclassing versions of init need to incorporate the initialization code for the classes they inherited from through a message to super
implements init method is not necessary unless you want to do some custom initialization

6734402
bmp	png
bmp is not supported in silverlight
bmp is a very old and not a very efficient format compared with png jpg so they have not bothered to support it

6734402
bmp	png
bmp is a very old and not a very efficient format compared with png jpg so they have not bothered to support it
silverlight only supports jpg png format images

6735730
ubuntu	linux
or on linux etc php5 apache2 php.ini this is the path on ubuntu or etc php5 cli php.ini etc php5 cgi php.ini etc
or you can get to know where it is like this php --ini | find i loaded in windows command prompt or php --ini | grep loaded in linux mac terminal using phpinfo and looking for the line loaded configuration file and remove the semicolon from the beginning of the following line to uncomment it on windows or on linux mac of course if this line doesn t exist you should paste it so as a result the expected line would look like this in php.ini on windows or on linux mac you may need to restart your web server

6735777
udp	tcp
udp is message-based not stream-based like tcp
udp does not guarantee delivery

6736250
google-chrome	firefox
it does not exist in the google-chrome nightly firefox nightly nor ie9
it is worth noting that firefox does have a functional mozgetasfile there is yet to even be any discussion for adding it to google-chrome

6736818
gif	png
the only guaranteed mime in the spec is image png so unfortunately even if you re lucky enough that the browser will generate gif there doesn t seem to be any browsers currently that take rle into consideration
the spec leaves it up to the browser on how to implement the gif mime type

6736904
google-chrome	safari
apple safari uses the same rendering engine as google-chrome webkit and should display pages the same way
if your site isn t rendering properly in any browser make sure your html and css are valid by testing them at . if your site doesn t render properly in google-chrome or apple safari file a bug at webkit.org as described at . if your site renders properly in apple safari but not in google-chrome please file a bug against google-chrome at

6736904
google-chrome	safari
if your site isn t rendering properly in any browser make sure your html and css are valid by testing them at . if your site doesn t render properly in google-chrome or apple safari file a bug at webkit.org as described at . if your site renders properly in apple safari but not in google-chrome please file a bug against google-chrome at
there are several tools to help you test your website in google-chrome web inspector right-click on any component on a web page to launch the web inspector

6737136
apache	nginx
the whole php remains non-threaded but apache serves threaded like it should
so basically from bottom to top linux apache + mpm worker + modfastcgi not fcgi | or | cherokee | or | nginx php-fpm + apc modfcgi does not correctly support php-fpm or any external fastcgi applications

6737251
strncpy	malloc
you merely strncpy arranged to the buffer
to be sure the buffer is large enough the user should also provide the size of the buffer in a 3rd argument the alternative malloc to store the result is not very user fiendly the user must freemem the buffer but may not be aware of this

6738173
vb.net	vb6
first of all based on those class names i m pretty sure you re using vb.net not vb6
you might get more responses if this really is about vb.net since more people know about it

6738997
spaces	delimiter
unfortunately i didn t find a way to specify the tab character alone i used the class it also includes spaces
if you really need to only match tab and not spaces as delimiter you can replace all the occurrence with actual tab characters you d type from your keyboard

6739572
persistent	transient
so save-update basically says to nhibernate when saving my entity if any objects associated with the entity are transient not yet persistent then persistent save them. any associated objects that are already persistent will be updated
the reason why it s called save-update is maybe that it applies to save update and saveorupdate in fabio maulo s nhibernate documentation chapter 9.9 talks about lifestyles and object graphs nhibernate does not fully implement persistence by reachability which would imply inefficient persistent garbage collection. however due to popular demand nhibernate does support the notion of entities becoming persistent when referenced by another persistent object

6742554
boost	stl
you can use boost to do it though requires a recent c++ compiler such as msvc 2010 or gcc 4.5
sadly the stl doesn t allow you to split a string on a separator

6742561
mp3	m3u
full list of supported file formats is present at to play mp3 playlist one option is to download the m3u file without using mediaplayer parse it to get the url to the mp3 file and then give media player the url of the mp3 file
android does not support playback of mp3 playlist .m3u file

6742561
mp3	m3u
android does not support playback of mp3 playlist .m3u file
m3u file is a text file containing url to the mp3 files in the list

6745058
kerberos	ntlm
if you enable windows authentication kerberos will normally be preferred and if that is not available it will fall back to ntlm
ntlm only requires the client to communicate with the web server in order to authenticate

6745776
prepare	execute
the jdbc driver documentation contains the gory details of when and how server-side prepare statements are used
anyway the log output you show isn t indicative of a problem because any query will be parsed bound and execute

6747406
vb.net	vb6
you can then use the following when i originally answered this question it was tagged as vb.net
for future reference my original .net-based answer is retained below as you thought this can be done with regular expressions don t forget imports system.text.regularexpressions also the original code reads like vb6 code not vb.net

6747548
updatepanel	scriptmanager
2 updatepanel jquery and scriptmanager aren t very related
just use scriptmanager to include jquery

6750272
doc	rtf
one can imagine some variations using doc and external files but before spending time on that i d want to know more about your requirements specifically how the above scenario would not meet them
what s happening here is that in xslt 1.0 the value of your literal xml stuff inside the variable instruction is a result tree fragment rtf which unfortunately cannot be processed directly as a node-set except to treat it just as a single node with a string value

6750942
xslt	xquery
it s unlikely it will support the new syntax but you should be able to use the alternative doctype-system about legacy-compat as described in the lengthy thread set html5 doctype with xslt
the isn t valid xquery syntax

6752429
uiview	subviews
uiview can still show elements that extend beyond their frame but user interaction will not extend beyond their frame
to see if this is the problem try setting the property of clip subviews to yes on the wrapper and see if you can still see the toolbar

6753066
junit	testng
note that surefire will only run either testng tests or junit tests but not both in the same build
running junit tests in maven requires minimal setup

6754450
postgresql	mysql
this is called table join elimination and you do need sql server oracle postgresql 9.x .
for this to work -- will not work on mysql yet

6754787
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this may not be related as google-chrome and opera are working faster but what may be happening is your server is still trying to get the content and is not done processing the html this is what a video application i wrote in php did before i fixed it
though i am not sure i think google-chrome may make multiple-requests to the server and thus pulls down the images while waiting while ie and firefox will do one task at a time

6757110
backgrounding	multitasking
for a longer explanation check this great article about ios 4 backgrounding and delegate messaging
willterminate will not be called on devices and ios versions supporting multitasking introduced with ios 4

6760474
rsa	aes
you cannot use rsa because image may be larger than 127 byte
two years before when i was trying with aes 128 bit encryption

6761064
uiview	subviews
put this in your header file interface yourview uiview property nonatomic assign cgpoint lasttouchlocation
end this should be the implementation what this does we check whether or not a line between the last received touch and the current one intersects the frame of a subviews

6764279
svg	vml
it is however different from svg web in that it does not use flash but instead delegates to vml internally in ie
raphael has a drawing backend for ie which uses vml dom and a backend for svg-enabled browsers which uses svg dom

6764661
apache	nginx
apache blocks
nginx doesn t

6767246
client-side	server-side
so for example if you were writing in php and you wanted client-side javascript to run if your php variable dothis was non-null you might write there aren t many situations where this happens but i know blogger uses technique where it displays the number of comments below a post
it s probably just an easy way to toggle enabling disabling code but what you may be seeing is javascript code that was rendered by a server-side language

6767261
google-chrome	firefox
i used google-chrome s developer tools to confirm this
it even works in firefox and internet explorer so it definitely isn t just a google-chrome thing

6767358
backtracking	greedy
for such a question the notion of greedy is merely an implementation detail - if you re using one of the common but inefficient backtracking implementations this can affect performance but not output
is not affected by greedy vs

6769419
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
gotchas you must use ff4+ or google-chrome and i haven t tried opera or safari
not all animations are supported on groups and afaik not all animations in keith wood s jquery extension work in firefox

6771671
innodb	myisam
this happens no matter which column you index because innodb uses clustered indexes where the index stores the data of the entire row
myisam in the case of myisam it does not have this problem

6771671
innodb	myisam
if you are updating mostly on a table i suggest you not use innodb unless if you need row-level locking high concurrency and transactions
otherwise myisam would be much better for update tasks

6776844
google-chrome	firefox
it does not exist in the google-chrome nightly firefox nightly nor ie9
it is worth noting that firefox does have a functional mozgetasfile there is yet to even be any discussion for adding it to google-chrome

6777968
awt	swing	swt	swing
edit for blocking the awt thread you could call invokeandwait method of swingutilities and inside the runnable instance show the swt dialog window
i m not sure if i understand this question well but when you are writing program with albireo swt_awt bridge you use swt normally and when you need you can use swing for some work as this example on eclipse wiki shows

6777968
swt	swing
i m not sure if i understand this question well but when you are writing program with albireo swt_awt bridge you use swt normally and when you need you can use swing for some work as this example on eclipse wiki shows
so if you have your parent most probably shell instance in some global attribute you can just create swt dialog whenever and wherever you need

6778839
inline	inlining
proguard s optimization step will inline methods like versionhelper#overridetransition which is not what you want since the method is intended to isolate the dependency on 1.6 although proguard can t know this
brute-force solution switch off all optimizations -dontoptimize finer-grained switch off all method inlining as you ve found out ideal solution avoid inlining this particular method and its siblings without details i can t say much about the other issues

6780372
innodb	myisam
it will output the innodb buffer pool size for your given dataset
cut and paste this one as well select concat round kbs power 1024 if poweroftwo 0 0 if poweroftwo 3 0 poweroftwo +0.4999 substr kmg if poweroftwo 0 0 if poweroftwo 3 0 poweroftwo +1 1 recommended_key_buffer_size br from select least power 2 32 kbs1 kbs from br select sum index_length kbs1 from information_schema.tables br where engine myisam and table_schema not in information_schema mysql aa br a select 2 poweroftwo b

6780598
apache	nginx
proxying node.js through apache misses a lot of the point of node.js no thread per connection proxying apache through node.js puts node.js on the front and while there are no known security flaws node.js simply isn t as battle hardened
enter nginx

6781272
backgrounding	multitasking
i think the short answer may be that you can t really determine specifically what causes the resign call however you can only plan according to if it actually goes in the backgrounding or not
check this link out where it details the steps multitasking takes

6781333
jar	war
if war#1 has a jar in its web-inf lib and is packaged in an ear with war#2 then war#2 will not be able to see the jar files in war#1 web-inf lib
if you have jar files that you need to share between multiple war files or between war files and ear files then you will need to package them in the ear

6785101
vim	emacs
here s one for ruby rails.vim ruby on rails easy file navigation enhanced syntax highlighting and more if you are new to vim this cheat sheet should help you vim graphical cheat sheet
if you are not a die hard fan of emacs then there s always vim and its plugins for any programming language

6786804
ubuntu	linux
well python does not come on all gnu linux distros but is present on most of the popular linux home user distributions ubuntu and fedora core for example possibly because most of the application of gnome desktop environment and kde use python 2.5+ not python 3 yet interpreters
since python is almost integrated onto the system environment from the start linux users feel easy to program in python

6787166
equals	compareto
the answer is in the javadoc of the equals method unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equals only if they are equals in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equals to 2.00 when compared by this method
in other words equals checks if the bigdecimal objects are exactly the same in every aspect

6788570
client-side	server-side
2 fill the window with an edit form - here your client-side script should make an ajax-like call not necessarily real ajax since in this case a synchronic request may be sensible to get the edit form from your rails application
see this simplicated example 3 prepare the form-returning action in your rails application - server-side usually this may be your new action of the given resource controller but rendered without layout

6791145
vbscript	jscript
the manual page you ve referenced states that slanguage is a parameter which can take the values vbscript jscript or javascript
it isn t that jscript is different from javascript it s just that both are valid names for the same language they need to support both names

6791931
lxml	elementtree
lxml uses libxml2 and provides a nicer interface the elementtree so you get most of the benefit of libxml2 s speed and all of the benefit of it s xpath evaluation
the added bonus is that the elementtree api is available by default in python2.5 though the version in 1.5 does not include the xpath syntax that was added in python 2.7 but you can get the 1.3 api as a separate package in older 2.x versions of python

6793701
backgrounding	multitasking
by default your app does nothing in the backgrounding
from your description it does not appear that multitasking is the problem

6794510
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
embed your root tab bar controller in a uinavigationcontroller
if it doesn t let you stick a uiviewcontroller in between them making uinavigationcontroller embeds uiviewcontroller which has a uitabbarcontroller s view added to it

6794626
pbkdf2	md5
pbkdf2 is also future-proof because it doesn t depend on a specific hash algorithm
for example can swap out md5 for sha3 when sha3 is finalized by nist

6794686
inline	inlining
inlining also known as inline expansion is a way to optimize a program by replacing function calls with the actual body of the function being called at compile-time
it reduces some of the overhead associated with function calls and returns and in some cases i m not sure if php is one of these can allow the compile to further optimize an area of code after inlining such as by removing code that has no effect

6795191
client-side	server-side
if you want to truly hide logic from your viewers then you need to do it server-side rather than with client-side javascript
you can complicate the dissection of what is happening in the client-side code but you cannot truly hide it

6796185
icmp	udp
i don t know if you can send an icmp packet with datagramsocket - but you could try to set the ttl like this example and you might be interested to see the flash.net.dns package
udp is not available on flash player only on adobe air runtime

6796197
bash	zsh
by the way variable is also available in bash though i do not know how to implement hooks there
for zsh you can try variable search man zshall for it

6798014
mdpi	hdpi
your issue is that some tablet not all are actually xhdpi instead of hdpi though i would think it would fall back to hdpi before mdpi
edit on second thought i think the more likely scenario is that your tablet is actually mdpi as there actually aren t a lot of xhdpi devices

6805425
allocator	stl
it s largely considered a design flaw in the c++ spec and in c++0x they re introducing a set of fixups to allocator to rememdy this
in the meantime any allocator you use in the stl containers must not have its own local state

6805945
cassini	iis
check out this question and answer - android emulator loopback to iis express does not work but does work with cassini
this might just be due to network limitations - either with the cassini development web server or with iis express

6806447
stateless	stateful
http is stateless so the web server doesn t need to know anything and you get caching in the web browser and in proxies
if you use websockets your server is becoming stateful and you need to have a connection to the client on the server

6811392
ssl	https
but that s why a real ssl tls certificate costs money and your self-issued certificate doesn t - anyone can generate their home-grown certificates but trusting them is an entirely different story
if i understand you correctly then you want to have only server-side authentication much in the same way as if you connected to an https site in your browser without requiring your clients to manage any certificates

6815213
sctp	udp
sctp can be an better suited alternative but there are many more mpeg-ts rstp ...
finally you always could built your own protocol for retransmission of missed erroneous frames based on udp but that is not a trivial task

6818030
udp	tcp
ppp pppoe are not mutually exclusive with udp
the former are link layer protocols the later is a transport layer protocol see tcp ip

6819546
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
not what i m aware of although there surely are possibilities where the opengl-es driver differs from phone to phone
i haven t experimented with shaders myself but however i can check regular translations rotations etc with debugging on on my glsurfaceview

6820811
google-chrome	firefox
in the earlier days it wouldn t persist on google-chrome of all browsers but it worked fine in firefox and ie
as of writing this it worked fine for me in google-chrome too

6823251
memcpy	memmove
the memory in memcpy cannot overlap or you risk undefined behaviour while the memory in memmove can overlap
some implementations of memcpy might still work for overlapping inputs but you cannot count of that behaviour

6823330
spaces	linefeed
if white-space is set to normal nowrap or pre-line every tab u+0009 is converted to a spaces u+0020 any spaces u+0020 following another spaces u+0020 even a spaces before the inline if that spaces also has white-space set to normal nowrap or pre-line is removed
the css spec explains the presentation of the white-space processing model specifically ..snip.. ..snip.. if white-space is set to normal or nowrap linefeed characters are transformed for rendering purpose into one of the following characters a spaces character a zero width spaces character u+200b or no character not rendered according to ua-specific algorithms based on the content script

6825988
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper orm and doctrine follow a completely different set of conventions
the datamapper orm is confusingly enough not a data mapper but an activerecord implementation

6830694
wadl	wsdl
i think wsdl is not appropriate for rest and wadl is not necessary
http exposes already what wadl could describe in a separate file

6830742
wadl	wsdl
for the record i use apache cxf to create restful services using jax-rs and that publishes wadl for them
with a good restful service it s not necessary to generate wadl let alone the much-less-well-fitting wsdl for it because it will self-describe

6833216
svg	vml
you ll probably have an easier time developing this in svg simply because of how much is already done for you
here are some other considerations canvas works in all modern browsers but not ie7 8 svg works in all modern browser and vml very close is in ie7 8 text rendering in canvas can look pretty different per-browser right now canvas works in android and ios to an extent minor things like text gradients still mess up svg does not work in android at least it didn t a year ago

6833216
svg	vml
here are some other considerations canvas works in all modern browsers but not ie7 8 svg works in all modern browser and vml very close is in ie7 8 text rendering in canvas can look pretty different per-browser right now canvas works in android and ios to an extent minor things like text gradients still mess up svg does not work in android at least it didn t a year ago
it does work in ios the accessibility of svg is far better

6833703
nsmutablestring	nsstring
for instance you have characteratindex method that returns the character at the given index or nsmutablestring s replaceoccurrencesofstring withstring options range that replaces all occurrences of a given string in a given range with another given string
nsstring is immutable meaning that you can not change its contents once its created

6833703
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you have nsmutablestring for that purpose
also you can not access the characters in a nsstring or nsmutablestring with this syntax nsstring s and nsmutablestring s are objects and you work with objects by sending messages to them

6833847
clang	llvm
you can get more information about clang from here one possible issue is that libclang may only be available on macs with xcode installed
xcode 4 hilighting i think is now based on clang clang llvm is a new compiler technology that has many goals that traditional compilers have not tried to achieve the feature of use to you is the compiler is not a single monolithic compiler but instead a collection of libraries you can pitch and choose which libraries you want to use the one you would be interested in is libclang which takes c c++.objective-c source code and turns it into a symbolic tree it then turn that into the llvm internal representation you should be able to get the symbolic tree representation which you can then use to hi-light source code

6834762
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton uses the target-action design pattern through the methods inherited from uicontrol to send action messages to a target object
uibutton does not make use of the delegation design pattern

6835059
client-side	server-side
you can definitely do that but you need to make sure the client-side object matches your server-side class structure property names and parameter name exactly
it sounds like your server-side method is expecting a personobj parameter but you aren t structuring it that way on the client-side

6836266
svg	vml
i know that neither canvas nor svg are supported by ie8 but then neither is border-radius so i assume that isn t a criteria for you
in any case raphael does actually work in all versions of ie as it detects the browser and renders vml instead of svg if it s running in ie

6837056
ienumerable	iqueryable
that code is definitely paging on the client side you are using ienumerable not iqueryable so the execution of the query is not deferred
if you want paging in the database add your paging code to the ef call other thoughts you could pass the ef query result to paginatedlist and refactor it to use iqueryable instead of ienumerable

6837670
tiff	png
a search through the pil source 1.1.7 tells me that it can recognize xmp information in tiff files but i cannot find any evidence of a documented or undocumented api for working with xmp information using pil at the application level
from the changes file included in the source + support for preserving icc profiles by florian böch via tim hatch . florian writes it s a beta so still needs some testing but should allow you to - retain embedded icc profiles when saving from to jpeg png tiff. existing code doesn t need to be changed. - access embedded profiles in jpeg png psd tiff. it also includes patches for tiff to retain iptc photoshop and xmp metadata when saving as tiff again read write tiff resolution information correctly and to correct inverted cmyk jpeg files. so the support for xmp is limited to tiff and only allows xmp information to be retained when a tiff image is loaded possibly changed and saved

6839408
rsa	aes
however algorithms like rsa do not scale in this way a 2048-bit rsa key is not 2 1024 times as hard to break as a 1024-bit key unless the attacker is really stupid
generally public key algorithms rsa need much larger keys than symmetric key algorithms aes because they rely on different mathematical properties

6842009
multiplying	multiplication
it does multiplying two different values by d4 one a right-multiplication and the other a left-multiplication but that s not exactly a repeated operation
anyway the total number of multiplication is about vs

6843770
implements	extends
interface pattern is useful when every other class implements the interface has almost same behavior that explains why all the method implementation is mandatory
if you feel some class might need some methods and others not probably you can got for abstract class model where you can extends and give the implementation which your class needs

6846252
ssl	https
also check the ssl settings feature to make sure the always require option is not turned on
it sounds like the iis web site instance you re hosting under is only configured for https ssl

6846306
wordpress	joomla
one way to address those security concerns is to run your ftp server listening only on 127.0.0.1 this allows you to use ftp from inside wordpress and you will be able to install plugins while not exposing it to the rest of the world
this can also be applied to other popular web applications such as joomla

6848631
tortoisegit	svn
as a personal experience the company i work migrated from svn to git after 2 years and every single developer that used tortoisegit ended up not really knowing what they are doing and sometimes screwing up their local repositories
in the end they dropped tortoisegit and spend time learning git the hard way shell msysgit on windows and everyone has been happy since then

6848902
ssl	https
this implementation will make ssl always required in the production environment but not otherwise so you can still do development as usual
depending on your environment it may also be possible for the upstream server to only be available via https if you re using apache you could configure it not to serve your application over port 80

6848914
daemons	systemd
covering automatic indentation and colour highlighting can access databases with sql- mode can work remotely with tramp mode access remote files as if they were local uses ssh scp can be ran as a daemons which makes it stateful so you can reconnect to your same emacs session be it on the workstation under x11 or equivalent or remotely via ssh with or without x11 or screen
has org-mode which together with babel provides a powerful sweave alternative as discussed in this paper discussing workflow apps for social scientists can run a shell via m-x shell and or m-x eshell has nice directory access functionality with dired mode has ssh mode for remote access interfaces all source code repositories with ease via specific modes eg psvn for svn is cross-platform just like r so you have similar user-interface experiences on all relevant operating systemd is widely used widely available and under active development for both code and extensions see the emacswiki.org site for the latter is not eclipse and does not require java you can of course combine it with whichever cran packages you like runit or testthat the different profiling support packages the debug package .

6850481
dbcontext	objectcontext
read something about using and querying dbcontext and start without repositories
also objectcontext api doesn t allow using derived types in query

6852023
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this answer assumes you re using apache 2.1 or later with the mod_authz_host module you can do access control by hostname in .htaccess or in the location or directory section of your httpd.conf file for example note that you can use partial domain names here so www.apache.org would be allowed access in this example
to ensure that you have mod_authz_host installed check for a line similar to the following in your httpd.conf loadmodule authz_host_module modules mod_authz_host.so one downside with this is that it will do a reverse lookup for each access which may or may not be a performance issue for you

6853130
inline	inlining
some systems may not even benefit from this inlining as strlen provides it s own or an inline out-of-line hybrid with a quick inline check for empty one-char maybe two-char strings then a call
i suspect the real answer is that the programmer felt like it but another potential justification rationalisation is that the loop is inline independent of whether strlen30 itself is whereas on many systems strlen is an out-of-line function call linux gcc

6853231
factors	mean
there are caveats to the test - if a const observer needs a lock it can obviously affect non- const usage from another thread from a timing perspective but shouldn t do so from a functional one - but it s pretty obvious how to factors that into your analysis
a useful test is could code with only const access to the device instance interfere with the operation of code with non- const access basically const access is meant to mean you re effectively an observer

6854795
skip-lists	tree
you can use an ordinary skip-lists tree which will include the lower and upper bounds of each range
note then when searching in a binary tree for a value if it does not exist your search will end when you are at the next value before after the search example if you have range keys 1 4 and you search 3 search will end when you reach 1 or 4

6855891
base	fractions
the problem is that computers like numbers to be based on base 2 and not base 10 like us
4.4 is an infinite fractions like 0.333333333.

6855950
comparator	comparable
if your keys are not comparable create the treemap with a comparator and then use treemap.addall existingmap
pick an implementation of sortedmap for example treemap and if your keys implement comparable use use the copy-constructor new treemap existingmap to put your existing map elements to the sorted map

6857601
addition	multiplication
for example addition can be achieved using this technique then it s a matter of doing multiplication using addition this multiplication doesn t yet work if b is negative but since this looks like a homework problem i ll leave that as an exercise for you
edit while multiplication is intuitive once you have addition the addition function is not so easy to understand so i ll explain it here

6858893
opera	firefox
webkit opera doesn t support this feature yet
image resizing is only possible on firefox 3.5+ and only at a fixed quality

6859873
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i would not use a uinavigationcontroller for the springboard
when the user chooses a subapp present the subapp s view controller which in some cases will be a uitabbarcontroller either manually using view transition animations or as a modal view

6862949
prepare	execute
since prepare statements only exist for the duration of a session the prepare statement must have been created by a prepare statement execute earlier in the current session
isn t the same as execute in pl pgsql oftentimes you will want to generate dynamic commands inside your pl pgsql functions that is commands that will involve different tables or different data types each time they are execute

6863204
stateless	stateful
stateful is normally not preferred over stateless when used standalone
stateless beans are pooled and execute one method for a client typically in a transactional context

6863204
stateless	stateful
stateless beans are pooled and execute one method for a client typically in a transactional context
their stateful counterpart is not pooled and without cdi the caller has to keep track of its life-cycle by eventually calling an remove annotated method

6863569
union	distinct
the different queries that are union together in one larger query aren t really subqueries strictly speaking
the queries are run in order the data type of the columns is determined by the first query by default identical rows are dropped union defaults to distinct the result set is not finished building until all queries are run ...there is no way to parallelize the different queries as they are all really part of the same query

6864054
trac	bugzilla
bugzilla slightly less ugh trac jira and now fogbugz
i like trac most of all but that s probably because i m not the administrator on fogbugz and it s being sadly and horribly mis-used in its current incarnation

6864065
uiview	subviews
aside people often confuse views and view controllers so it s not helpful to give your view controllers names ending in -view like blueview. call it blueviewcontroller to help avoid confusion. second as insertwittyname points out -viewdidload is a uiviewcontroller method not a uiview method
taking that a step further neither view controllers nor -viewdidload has any role in adding or removing subviews from a view

6865884
super	extends
when you make a new field in a sub class you are just hiding the super class field
why the flexibility with java fields you cannot make a field in another class go private by extends it

6867983
aggregate-functions	sum
the 3504 occurs when this column is not part of the group by clause because all columns that aren t part of the group by must be aggregate-functions eg
sum max min avg etc

6868005
implements	extends
and of course if you still end up needing ontouch for something you can always implements ontouchlistener in addition to yourtouchlistener
i would probably do essentially what caspnz posted the only difference being that you shouldn t extends ontouchlistener in this case

6868299
viewdidload	viewwillappear
your problem may stem from the fact that your view s size in viewdidload isn t guaranteed to be the same is it will be when it eventually gets displayed
uikit resizes the view to fit the context in which it s being displayed just before viewwillappear

6869852
intersect	contains
with the .net 3.0 requirement the intersect linq extension method is not available but you can provide your own extension method
all you need is the matchingrows extension method see below in the demo code and then do then you can loop over unchangedzipcodes which will contains only those rows with zipcodes in common between dtexistingzipcodeindb and dtcsvexcelsource

6871237
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nscfstring class is not a subclass of nsmutablestring .
it s just another class of nsstring cluster

6872467
queue	fifo
if you create your queue using dispatch_queue_create you get a serial queue and you are then guaranteed fifo behaviour
fwiw although you shouldn t rely on this behaviour if you run that on the iphone i suspect you ll see serial queue behaviour because your iphone is single-core

6877488
multiplying	subtract
for example after insert 2 10 insert 1 5 insert 3 100 insert 4 20 the tree might look like 2 135 1 5 4 120 3 100 now to find the weighted median multiplying 135 by 0.5 and get 67.5 as the desired index
starting at the root 2 we find that 5 is less than 67.5 so the item is not in the left subtree and we subtract 5 to obtain 62.5 the index into the remainder of the tree

6878979
pascal	delphi
not all the code in the repository is equally well designed but as a source of ideas and well written pascal code there is a lot of greatness inside the synopse opensource fossil project
some bits of the repository contain projects that only build in delphi 7 and are not unicode ready but the main part i would point you to is the delphi orm+sqlite3 framework

6878979
pascal	delphi
it s not typical delphi vcl application code though it has a very rest architecture driven focus and the demo uses hand-coded forms in object pascal rather than using the traditional delphi dfm based form ui
i don t know of something that i would recommend that is all of the things you said above plus has excellent unit test coverage plus is suitable for beginner reading which also sticks enough to idiomatic delphi to not be teaching against what i most want to teach delphi beginners

6881575
ati	nvidia
if you were going purely off opencl being the requirement i would say you go with ati because they have a released version of opencl 1.1 drivers where as nvidia had beta drivers almost instantly when the spec was published but has not updated them since and they have a couple bugs from what i ve read in the nvidia open opencl forums
personally i chose nvidia because it gives me all the options

6883102
qtreewidget	qtreeview
possibly you re looking for qtreewidget which inherits from qtreeview and does have an itemchanged signal albeit one that has an as a parameter not a
qtreeview doesn t have an itemchanged signal so your qobject connect call will fail

6883375
ubuntu	linux
font rendering is generally handled by the os libraries rather than the application so you need to tell ubuntu not to anti-alias that particular font
it s been a few years since i worked much on linux but if things haven t changed you can configure this by editing a file maybe something like etc fonts fonts.conf or .fonts.conf or something similar

6883552
rvm	bundler
se then the binary path should be configured accordingly and rvm will of course properly set gem_home and gem_path for us as well
the only thing that really needs to be set is the bundle_gemfile one since bundler cannot autodetect it from the rackup file and the cwd of the fcgi process is garbage

6888202
lisp	scheme
when common lisp was designed i would guess it was not clear what that should do and how it should work
if foo is a function then it was clear common lisp took the ideas from scheme behind lexically scoped first-class functions and integrated it into the language

6891767
super	extends	implements	extends
in other cases usually when you implements an interface there is no implementation that you override only declaration and therefore there is no need to call the super method
one more thing sometimes you override a method and your purpose is to change the behavior of the original method not to extends it

6894244
fgets	fread
if you need to read in the entire file at once use fread instead of fgets
unlike fgets fread will not stop reading on occurrence of a newline

6895520
inline	inlining
you are not going to change your inline method without changing the subsystemlist member and a recompile is necessary in both cases
inlining does not affect encapsulation since the method is still a method with a public interface

6897479
allocator	stl
for whoever is not satisfied with the current state of stateful allocator in stl i recommend to consider boost.intrusive and boost.container
looks like the feature of stateful allocator in stl containers is widely supported already

6897479
allocator	stl
looks like the feature of stateful allocator in stl containers is widely supported already
in most cases statefullness of the allocator does not cause trouble

6902604
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
embedding a uitabbarcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller is not supported
apple has a careful hierarchy of container view controllers and a uitabbarcontroller must be the root of its view controller hierarchy

6906181
innodb	myisam
you cannot create foreign keys in innodb tables referencing myisam tables
foreign keys definitions are subject to the following conditions both tables must be innodb tables and they must not be temporary tables

6907195
floating-point	fractions
a separate floating-point stack really helps just about everything does it that way and a brief prelude can implement an fp stack in software should you ever want to port your code to one of the very rare systems that presents you with a unified fp stack
all of that aside here is a second answer to your question you don t need floating-point numbers to deal in fractions values and in some cases like money you not only don t need them but don t want them

6908874
dbcontext	objectcontext
you cannot use dbcontext for that - dbcontext api is just dumb wrapper with only most needed functionality
for everything more complex you must convert dbcontext back to objectcontext and use it

6913516
punctuation	words
roman texts english swedish and most cyrillic texts russian are divided on whitespace and certain punctuation period comma dash but not hyphen
japanese detecting words boundaries in cjk texts requires knowledge of the language at a fluent level

6917950
richfaces	trinidad
if you have oracle support license and you ve requested for the adf source you can see there that the base classes of richfaces components eventually go back down to the trinidad packages
as far as i can tell adf faces has more features than trinidad but usage of adf requires some license fees when you are not deploying to a weblogic server

6923345
svg	vml
it s a good library which does not use html5 canvas but instead embedded svg on browser which support this
on other browsers ie vml is used

6924871
onchange	onblur
the onchange event was not triggered until the onblur event which is when the selectedvalue would get changed but this is not what the display is changed to
if we were to reset our value in the onchange event this event might get called again

6930332
realloc	memmove
if you get your memmove wrong or don t check any realloc returns expect a crash
using memmove is certainly efficient and not significantly less secure than iterating over the array

6933483
nsmutablestring	nsstring
don t know if this might be the problem but note that if you were using a mutable object like nsmutablestring with copy you would not increment the retain count you would effectively create a new object so what would happen
edit as noted in the comments nsstring being immutable won t cause the copy to allocate a new object

6935287
prepare	execute
when an execute command is subsequently issued the prepare statement need only be executed.thus the parsing rewriting and planning stages are only performed once instead of every time the statement is execute more information about prepare statemnet please vist
i m not sure if it is right from my personal opinion if use a bind variable in your application then postgresql server will reuse the esisting query plan without parsed rewritten the plan again another way is that use prepare statement in your appplication when the prepare statement is execute the specified statement is parsed rewritten and planned

6936927
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
just wanted to add a few more considerations that i didn t see mentioned yet. edit ooops didn t see mike steder s answer if you want to try using a non cpython implementation like pypy ironpython or jython then ctypes is about the only way to go
pypy doesn t allow writing c-extensions so that rules out pyrex cython and boost.python

6936927
cpython	ironpython
pypy doesn t allow writing c-extensions so that rules out pyrex cpython and boost.python
for the same reason ctypes is the only mechanism that will work for ironpython and eventually once they get it all working jython

6937678
trie	tree
this is a strange question maybe you should add more informations but you can use a trie data structure not only for strings but also for many other data types
the definition of a trie is to make a dictionnary with an adjacent tree model

6940618
pascal	delphi
it should not be too hard to convert the ones for pascal back to c
with a compiler like embarcadero s c++builder you could have it done by the delphi compiler that comes with it

6941020
concave	convex
but first a comment on previous answers since your shape is usually kidney-shaped not convex calculating the area of its convex hull won t do and an alternative is to determine its concave hull see and calculate the area of that
but determining a concave hull is far more difficult than a convex hull

6944621
jar	war
you can even zip and unzip the war with jdk jar -xvf tobe_extracted.war
this obfuscation does not affect the other files inside the war like properties files xml files and such

6945032
vim	emacs
here are some ides for c++ that you can pick from in the order of my preference emacs qt creator vim codeblocks one particularly good ide but works on mac only is xcode
here are some java ides that support c++ eclipse netbeans intellij idea my personal opinion is that every ide except emacs vim and qtcreator is not worth using

6946496
mp4	webm	h.264	webm
internet explorer 9 supports all profiles of h.264 video and either aac or mp3 audio in an mp4 container
it will also play webm video if you install a third-party codec which is not installed by default on any version of windows

6946655
udp	tcp
as documented in the man page msg_trunc is only valid for packet sockets udp so this will not work as you want for your tcp socket which is stream based
there are literally hundreds of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere that talk about preserving application message boundaries on tcp hint you need to do this yourself tcp is a byte stream interface and doesn t so i won t go into the details here suffice it to say you need a mechanism to know how big an application message or packet is on the recv side to enable you to do what you want over tcp or you need to switch over to udp

6947530
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
this test was done on a modest i3 laptop but it reviewed varnish ats apache traffic server nginx lighttpd etc
the interesting point is that using a high-end 8-core server gives a very little boost to most of them apache cherokee litespeed lighttpd nginx g-wan as the tests were done on localhost to avoid hitting the network as a bottleneck the problem is in the kernel which does not scale - unless you tune its options

6947769
nunit	mstest
i have other minor quibbles with mstest and have blogged a bunch of workarounds for using mstest in general i found this question as i am switching us to nunit from mstest because we can t trust the result of our ci build anymore because of mstest
switching to nunit will allow us to finally trust that a ci build failure is real not another mstest glitch

6947849
dictionary	map
suggestion something that might give you a lot more bang for your buck is a striped dictionary java s stripedmap is a pretty good place to start and it shouldn t be very hard to understand
the basic idea behind the stripedmap stripeddictionary is that you have an array of locks you should stripe your map with sufficiently large number of stripes in order to allow the number of threads you have to enter the method without collision

6950284
prepare	execute
think of it this way at prepare time the sql parser must know all the syntax your query uses and also which tables and columns you re using
it is supposed to give you any errors related to non-existant tables at prepare time not at execute time

6950284
prepare	execute
it is supposed to give you any errors related to non-existant tables at prepare time not at execute time
so when you provide a string mytable for your 6th parameter value it s as if you execute a query select .

6950997
client-side	server-side
i would recommend against using an ashx handler for returning json to the client-side unless you re piping json strings back from a third-party service
if you re returning your own server-side objects it doesn t make sense to incur the extra code to manually convert to and from json when scriptservices and page methods do it automatically

6951267
shadowing	named
x in child is only shadowing over the base class not overriding it
the base class member variable is not altered only hidden by a separate variable in the child class that happens to have the same named

6958169
onclick	onsubmit
use return in the onclick call to cancel submission if false is returned by verifydata
it is not possible to check the button clicked through the onsubmit event

6960389
client-side	server-side
having become accustomed to mustache i ve chosen the hogan parser by the twitter guys 100 dry even the client-side mixins and i18n-bundles come from the same source
moreover hogan can precompile the templates server-side and open a connection to the client so the client doesn t have to parse the template anymore on first connect

6960666
django	web2py
that being said having not used frameworks i would say to with web2py unless you need certain modules that only exist in the django world
web2py probably has a little more gradual learning curve

6960666
django	web2py
i don t think there is anything that web2py can do that django can t except db migrations -- but i think you can make django do them with some 3rd party code or vice versa
django favors a explicit is better than implicit development methodology which requires to you import various modules and doesn t have all the magic of web2py

6960666
django	web2py
django favors a explicit is better than implicit development methodology which requires to you import various modules and doesn t have all the magic of web2py
using django you will be more aware of exactly what is going on under the hood

6960772
rsa	aes
rsa is suited to key encipherment not bulk data encryption
instead of encrypting messages with rsa most protocols generate a key for a symmetric cipher like aes and encrypt the message with that

6961688
django	web2py
also as for the directory structure django is not actually true mvc -- it s mtv model template view
i find web2py s organization a little more straight-forward

6964213
ubuntu	linux
just as i wanted it p just don t know how reliable it is and whether it will be possible to use in avr-gdb which is what i need this for edit version of avr-gdb in ubuntu 11.04 is currently 6.4 which doesn t recognize the python command well hope this helps someone cheers

google-chrome	firefox
so from what you say happens it s easy to imagine that in google-chrome the second parameter is being checked with and in firefox they use
so it s not entirely that firefox got it wrong like felix suggests they just assume undefined would never actually be passed in directly as the 2nd parameter

6969130
junit	testng
junit is notorious for not dealing properly with threads
i ve only been able to get them to work using testng

6972258
strcpy	malloc
strcpy s 2 string2
as already mentioned you can not malloc an array of class objects because this function does not invoke any constructors

6974180
mri	rubinius
i don t know why would you want such a feature and this is very implementation-specific but on mri 1.9 you can ab use object_id for an explanation of why does it work check out the relevant lines in mri gc.c
note that this will not work on other implementations jruby rubinius and may very well break in future versions of ruby

6974180
jruby	rubinius
note that this will not work on other implementations jruby rubinius and may very well break in future versions of ruby
also there may be no way at all to get the address in some implementations i suspect that you cannot in jruby

6978177
dictionary	map
i m not sure if there are any online resources which have generic points for each country but you could look them up on google and the make a dictionary which holds all of those centre points and sizes for each country with the name of the country being the key for those points
then when the user selects a country you look it up in the dictionary and load those centre points and sizes into your map and that will display that country

6978813
realloc	malloc
if you realloc the libc doesn t do anything special. 1 if it can realloc within the same page you get memory on the same node
good but rare especially for large buffers. 2 if it realloc in a different page most of the cases for large buffers it depends if the corresponding page have already been allocated in physical memory by the malloc lib in the past malloc ed and freed in virtual memory but still allocated in physical memory 2.a if the virtual page has been allocated it may have been allocated on another node for various reasons in the past you re screwed. 2.b if the new virtual page has not been allocated yet the default is to allocate on the current node

6980067
dropbox	icloud
however the dropbox api documentation at the time of writing says web applications using the dropbox api are currently not officially supported
icloud api is in beta and only available to members of the ios and mac developer programs so i am unable to review it s possibilities

6982101
inline	inlining
btw don t confuse the inline hint keyword with actually inlining functions
you can mark a function inline and it may not be physically inlined

6982101
inline	inlining
you can mark a function inline and it may not be physically inline
so even if it were true that main cannot be inline and strictly speaking it is not true though inlining main would be rather awkward and pointless as explained in other answers it could theoretically still support the inline hint keyword just fine

6983120
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately according to this table of versions javascript 1.7 has not been implemented in google-chrome
but it should be there in firefox 2.0+ ie 9 opera 11.50

6983163
backgrounding	multitasking
if your app has no backgrounding use it should not need to know when the user kills it through the multitasking kill
this may help applicationwillterminate in ios 4.0 the closest thing to what your asking is that if your application is backgrounding enabled then the will be called on the user exiting your app

6984146
richtextbox	textblock
here is a link to info about the richtextbox
you cannot do this until you start to develop for mango and then you would not use the textblock to do so but the richtextbox

6984146
richtextbox	textblock
you cannot do this until you start to develop for mango and then you would not use the textblock to do so but the richtextbox
a textblock can only have one styling

6984579
profiling	debugging
you will find a renew option on your provisional profiling page of your profile. you need not request for new license
also once you have downloaded the renewed license you have to debugging your code and send the team with the new application

6984756
union	distinct
if not it may take a long time as the query engine generates the first result set generates the second result set filters out all the dupes which is half the records in a hash table if duplicates aren t a concern and using in means they won t be then use union all which removes the expensive sort filter step
union is really doing a distinct on all fields in the combined data set

6985328
inline	inlining
the c++ standard says that the main function cannot be inline per tomalak geret kal s reply
this response discusses possibility of inlining of the main function were the restriction in the standard removed

6985328
inline	inlining
also of note functions that are not tagged by the programmer may also be inline by the compiler
inlining the main function since there is only one invocation of main allowed how it is linked is up to the compiler

6985456
inline	inlining
you are asking whether the function can be inline which commonly is understood to insert the code of a called function completely or partially into the calling function
just marking a function inline doesn t imply inlining that function at all

6985896
unicode	ucs
this recent presentation covers all sorts of issues with unicode in popular languages and isn t kind to javascript the good the bad the mostly ugly he covers the issue with two-byte representation of unicode in javascript the utf 16 née ucs 2 curse like several other languages javascript suffers from the utf 16 curse
except that javascript has an even worse form of it the ucs 2 curse

6985977
set	bag
2 you can try to use bag instead of set but be careful to not call methods like obj.mybag.size related question hibernate - how to persist a new item in a collection without loading the entire collection
1 you can remove set mapping from meter class

6986267
inline	inlining
basically main is called from the basic initialization routine of the runtime and only from there. that code was obviously compiled without knowing that your main was inline
modern compiler technology is capable of inlining across module boundaries but it s an advanced feature not supported by many older compilers

6988219
partcover	opencover
you may also find that opencover will work better than partcover as it has 32 and 64 bit support as well as supporting .net2 and .net4 - and copes much better with target processes that spin off more processes to do the actual testing
as i mentioned in the comments i suspect you are using a very old version of partcover which does not have .net4 support

6994242
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side technology and cannot do anything on the server
you could however use ajax to call a server-side script php which could return the information you need

6996123
base	fractions
some numbers looks nice when displayed in base 10 like 1.3 for example but others don t for example 1 3 0.333333333..
it s the same in base 2 some numbers looks nice in base 2 usually when composed of fractions of 2 and other not

6996710
google-chrome	safari
i pondered the problem again and then speculated whether you might not need custom cloning or serialization for google-chrome or webkit if you simply create a dummy xml dom document and then importnode the element from the html dom document
so i wrote and indeed both google-chrome 13 and safari 5.1 at least perform the transformation

6998118
bmp	png
if it has to be a bmp you could try checking this out for changing the data to a bmp
live demo this is a partial solution as it does not convert it to a bitmap but a png

6998515
allocator	stl
this was a great resource to get me started with custom memory allocator for stl i also remember that ogre3d has some custom allocator for the stl containers which could be a great example to get you started
i d recommend to look into custom allocator for stl if you run into any memory performance issues which is not likely to happen in the first place as deadmg mentioned

6998515
allocator	stl
i d recommend to look into custom allocator for stl if you run into any memory performance issues which is not likely to happen in the first place as deadmg mentioned
i personally use stl with custom memory allocator that again use my own memory manager so that i can keep track of the memory used by the stl containers strings i use

7002007
mongodb	bson
in order to read the data back out you need to connect to the running mongodb server
the bson gem is for parsing the data returned by the server not parsing the files themselves

7003021
direct3d	gdi
one workaround - disable direct3d for java2d the direct3d pipeline can be disabled by running java with the option as per this guide on java2d system properties and also the aforementioned troubleshooting guide
i think this disables direct3d but not directdraw which can be disabled with and then all operations will be performed with gdi but this doesn t noticeably improve initialization time

7003021
direct3d	gdi
i think this disables direct3d but not directdraw which can be disabled with and then all operations will be performed with gdi but this doesn t noticeably improve initialization time
for example i might use a command like the following to run myjar.jar without direct3d with the code posted in the question which initializes a window and then 2 jframe objects i get results like this 0 for first window 47 for first jframe. 0 for second jframe. instead of results like this 547 for first window 31 for first jframe. 0 for second jframe. note that time is in milliseconds and is measured with system.currenttimemillis on windows which i think has a resolution of around 15 to 16 ms. opengl vs direct3d opengl is used instead of direct3d if the option is used

7004223
cassini	iis
probably something to do with the fact that when you re running cassini it s your domain account that s querying the ldap
it is strange that it would work in iis sometimes though and not others

7004432
awt	swing
when you use repaint the awt system will call the canvas update method which will clear the graphics by painting a rectangle in the background color and then call paint
this is for awt s heavy-weight components like canvas - for swing it is a bit different. so an easy workaround will be given by overriding update to not clear the component note that old painted strings still may go away when the system decides your component has to be invalidated after another window covered it

7008196
apache-poi	docx4j
i m afraid that apache-poi isn t near as far in the handling of word files than it is in handling excel documents
if you are in the early stage of development maybe you could consider moving to docx4j

7008938
redmine	trac
latest versions i used in production were trac 1.0.1 and redmine 2.2.3
but redmine has some serious drawbacks over trac installation is not easy you cannot use debian ubuntu package system for production use as configuration is not separated from application code whenever you get package updates they will overwrite your changes

7008938
ubuntu	debian
but redmine has some serious drawbacks over trac installation is not easy you cannot use debian ubuntu package system for production use as configuration is not separated from application code whenever you get package updates they will overwrite your changes
debian had 5 security holes at the beginning of 2013 january where some still unfixed in unstable and testing

7008938
redmine	trac
administration is not easy considering making a backup in trac this is a one-liner in redmine you have to backup configuration attached files and database content all separately
additionally often it is stated that redmine supports multiple projects so its easier to setup a new project and configuration is not duplicated

7008938
redmine	trac
this is not possible with redmine
furthermore with trac you can backup the projects separately and of course you can separate them incase one of your 50 projects become popular so it will need an own server

7008938
redmine	trac
redmine cannot do this
recently a new plugin came up supporting multiple user projects in one trac instance look at beside that there is a project using trac to build this feature bloodhound version control system i think installing a plugin is not that hard and for almost every vcs there is a plugin for trac git perforce mercurial darcs monotone subversion bazaar

7008938
bazaar	git
recently a new plugin came up supporting multiple user projects in one trac instance look at beside that there is a project using trac to build this feature bloodhound version control system i think installing a plugin is not that hard and for almost every vcs there is a plugin for trac git perforce mercurial darcs monotone subversion bazaar
furthermore i would favour a small core framework with plugins over a big framework with integrated support for git mercurial etc.

7011654
textmate	sublimetext
i also use rubymine and webstorm a lot they are excellent but not all purpose like textmate
sublimetext is awesome excellent search features very fast and lightweight

7012162
mayavi	matplotlib
you can use mayavi instead
matplotlib cannot plot 3d image

7012920
jar	manifest.mf
as this question is specifically related to signing an apk jar file i will answer in that context
assuming that you have performed all the following setup steps generated a valid manifest.mf generated a valid cert.sf have a valid pfx file loaded into an x509certificate2 variable named cert have the binary contents of the cert.sf file in a byte array named manifestsfbytes the following code will generate a valid detached pkcs7 signature which is effectively your cert.rsa content this code relies on the system.security.cryptography.pkcs namespace and does not require bouncycastle

7013832
getdate	datepart
with months as select dateadd day -datepart day getdate +1 getdate as monthstart union all select dateadd month -1 monthstart as monthstart from months then you can join to in your above query
i m not going to try to parse all your case statements but essentially you can use a group by on the date and the monthstart fields like group by datepart year monthstart datepart month monthstart and aggregate by month

7015103
super	extends
super is definitely wrong here as your not storing supertyes of content but subtypes
extends on the other hand wouldn t add any additional value

7015131
implements	extends
if this doesn t work try implements onload instead of onattach since onload will be called after the image is added to dom so that it definately should work
extends the image class and implement onattach method

7015700
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is apparently reads my mind.
since my success callback was part of a json object firefox couldn t find whatever default it was looking for and therefore didn t fire anything

7016940
libstdc++	libc++
see the status page you could probably link against gnu s libstdc++
i believe libc++ doesn t support all exception functions yet

7017638
vb.net	vb6
unlikely this is a real concern reason but i know i ve many-a-time copy and pasted example c# code into my vb.net project and anything that doesn t cause road blocks in the translation process usage of yield makes my life easier. while completely inconceivable they are going away as most of these keywords statements are a basic language construct they do feel more likely to become marked obsolete than any of their core framework counterparts
especially as vb6 is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the vb.net language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing

7023178
daemons	systemd
edit in your question comments you say using would be unsafe as the application wouldn t restart if it failed crashed but that s the same with any other daemons on your systemd for example if apache crashed it would nt restart by itself
if you want to restart your application if it crashes you would have to write a 2nd daemons that would check at regular intervals if your application is still running and restart it if needed

7023490
pthreads	fork
i took your question as a challenge to write this in portable shell code with a pthreads shell in mind no bashisms such as arrays avoid calling externals like the plague
there s not a single fork in the script

7023697
inline	inlining
if the optimizer inline the function calls you might well find that all the variables of all the functions inline are wrapped into one big stack frame
any compiler worth using is capable of inlining so the fact that it can happen doesn t depend on compiler

7024688
uiview	caanimation
3 for those types of simpler animations that uiview can handle it is usually a simpler api to use than that of caanimation
1 there is not much difference in terms of memory expenses between uiview s animation blocks and calayers s caanimation nor in terms of the objects themselves

7024688
uiview	caanimation
1 there is not much difference in terms of memory expenses between uiview s animation blocks and calayers s caanimation nor in terms of the objects themselves
2 there are limitations to the type of animations you can achieve with uiview s animation so you might be forced to use caanimation anyway

7026365
translation	localization
first of all you need to accept two things a all content is loaded at all time not talking about translation but features
b use proper standard localization methods but no need to translate all features to all languages

7027492
translation	localization
in a simple scenario cms not much or shared business logic you are dealing with just content in different languages and layout left to right vs right to left - you will have two css files localized translation content layout css can be in separate files and be pulled in depending on the user account s culture or site region setting
localization can reside in different assemblies - one for each culture or in separate string table files as already mentioned

7028163
dns	spf
4 if your domain dns has an spf record be 100 sure it lists every ip that might send email for your domain
if unsure do not use spf records because a bad spf record will hurt delivery rates

7030593
udp	tcp
i would not use udp for file transfer period
it would be less complex to open tcp sockets on each end and roll your own file transfer protocol on top of it than to implement reliable transfer on top of udp

7030931
content-length	content-type
in particular the host and content-length headers are not optional and the content-type header is usually needed to tell the server how to interpret the body
a well formed post request will look like it s still up to the server to recognize the content-type header and parse the body that way

7031927
nhibernate	queryover
hql or raw sql are the only options unless you are looking into extending nhibernate
nh linq provider and the criteria queryover api do not support conditional deletes updates

7033259
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
i m guessing that this is only working because you re overriding paint and not paintcomponent and calling repaint on the jscrollpane all the time so that it paints itself again after its components are painted
perhaps you want to use a jlayeredpane and have it hold the jscrollpane and paint on it

7033347
clang	llvm
as a note -o4 will invoke lto on your program which you may not want it will increase compile time greatly and clang defaults to c99 mode so that flag isn t necessarily needed either
you definitely don t need to use the various different llvm-ar etc programs set cmake_ar usr bin llvm-ar set cmake_linker usr bin llvm-ld set cmake_nm usr bin llvm-nm set cmake_objdump usr bin llvm-objdump set cmake_ranlib usr bin llvm-ranlib these are made to work on the llvm internal format and as such aren t useful to the build of your application

7036252
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can override activity method onkeyup you don t have to pay attention on what keycode was sent to your method cause this does not matter
also you can override onkeydown instead of this

7038017
multiplying	division	multiplying	modulo
if the numbers your using could be to 2dp the modulo should still work if not multiplying both by 100 first then carry out the above check
you can use the modulo to find the remainder after a division and then if the remainder is equal to zero the it s a multiple

7038155
implements	extends
for example in swing when implements a mouselistener you might not want to treat all the mouse events
in this case you can extends mouseadapter and treat only the events you are interested in

7039777
slug	permalinks
when creating an article you need logic to properly slug the article and store that with the article a custom route constraint using irouteconstraint would be a way to check at request time whether or not a user is getting a valid slug right
however this is more work and leads to more database hits unless you have a good caching mechanism but that leads to other potential problems your permalinks route should be at the bottom of your routes if there are other routes that define the behavior as in

7041441
touchesmoved	touchesended
iphone does not do this iphone does not give a touchesmoved for the last touchesended ie touch down move finger lift if you do it fast enough on iphone you wont get the intermediate event for touchesmoved your finger where as on the android you do
android iphone equivalent s action_up touchesended action_down touchesbegan action_move touchesmoved also i noticed on android there is some point history functions

7041518
config	ini
there isn t really a one true config format in perl
yaml ini files a simple name value list or a custom xml schema are all in common use

7043445
implements	extends
the difference to your customers is using the extends keyword instead of the implements keyword minor not being able to extends some other class of their choosing to use your api could be minor could be major - if it s acceptable then go for it
define an abstract class that implements your interface and defines final equals hashcode methods and have your customers extends that instead notice that by making your class abstract you can implements the interface without defining the interface s methods

implements	extends
declare the function as a pure virtual function and then just trivially implements it in the derived classes by forwarding the call but that does not mean that you cannot achieve what you are trying to do
if you want to implements that operation in another class and use inheritance you can do it in two different ways intermediate type implements an intermediate type that provides the functionality then each derived type can extends either the original a or the intermediate i type virtual inheritance alternatively you can use virtual inheritance of the three options i would avoid this

7044447
postgresql	mysql
it has worked for me with odbc transfers to sql server and postgresql
so i don t see why it wouldn t work with mysql too

7046428
activemq	rabbitmq
activemq requires specific destination configuration because the jms spec doesn t cover any of the administration side of things
besides that rabbitmq s system configuration is erlang-esque while activemq is usually configured in xml

7047807
antialiasing	transparent
the reason that text on opaque backgrounds can use spaa is that the text is pre-rendered with sub-pixel antialiasing before the layer texture is stored on the gpu
this is not possible if the background of the text is transparent

7048365
inline	inlining
if performance is your ultimate goal and you really know what you are doing and really do a thorough analysis of your code what one really needs is a way to tell the compiler to inline or not inline on a per-call basis not a per-function hint
in practice i have managed this by using compiler specific force_no_inline type hints for cases i don t want inlining and a separate force_inline copy or macro in the rare case this fails of the function for when i want it inlined

7048802
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
but this method is not working in google-chrome and opera
how do you resize an ie browser window to 1024 x 768 the reason from the javascript resizeto function not working in google-chrome and opera is the resizeto method is disabled by default in several browsers and i know that it can also be manually disabled in firefox

7049617
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and other linux versions have case-sensitive file names while windows xp doesn t
this means while loginimage.png and loginimage.png are the same in windows they are not the same in ubuntu

7049934
mdpi	hdpi
yet the tab does not report its density as mdpi but as hdpi so the layout looks exactly as in the second screenshot
if they used mdpi the icons would be .28 wide with hdpi they are .42 wide not a big deal and i must admit the layout does look prettier this way

7051042
g++	gcc
so mtouch extra argument should look like -cxx will ensure g++ gets used instead of gcc - and that should solve your issue
it can be a bit confusing but -cxx is an extra parameter to mtouch not for --gcc_flags which are directly passed to gcc compiler

7052641
profiler	perf
another way would be to actually run an mvc application under a profiler but that s a bit more advanced topic though if you search for it you ll get some good hits
in the end you have to trust us that we are doing the right thing we have already optimized a lot of the perf issues and the remaining reflection usage just does not have that much of an impact

7055367
mvp	presenter
one well-known design where you might need setmodel function but getmodel doesn t make sense is model-view-presenter mvp pattern or its variants such as mvc mvvm etc for last one year i m mostly working on ui where i ve implemented mvp following prism architecture wpf and silverlight
our design goes something like this that is its the presenter which calls the setmodel function of the view to set itself as model for the view but there is no getmodel function in view class because it doesn t make sense at all

7055522
ienumerable	iqueryable
your result variable is not an ienumerable - it is an iqueryable
the result is changing when you manually change the type to ienumerable since you now do the following contains query with linq to objects and not on the database with linq to entities or linq to sql

7056566
vbo	normals
from a performance point of view it s about minimizing bottlenecks for a single square you are probably not able to measure any differences but when you think about 1 million squares or triangles thinks get a little more complicated if all of your triangles change position relative to each other you are probably better off with changing the vbo because you can push the data directly to the graphics card s memory instead of having a million opengl calls which are very slow
if all your triangles stay at the same position relative to each other like it is the case in a normals 3d-model you should just change the transformation matrix

7058926
backgrounding	multitasking
if you want to run constantly in the backgrounding sending e-mail then it ll almost certainly be a reject if they spot it - this isn t something they envisage being done on the iphone
if you re just completing a task the user loads the app to send some e-mails then quits before they re all sent you re fine - that s what the task completion multitasking mode is for

7059384
fgetc	fread
when you read a chars the value is read as an unsigned chars and converted from there to int 7.19.7.1 2 if the end-of-file indicator for the input stream pointed to by stream is not set and a next chars is present the fgetc function obtains that chars as an unsigned chars converted to an int and advances the associated file position indicator for the stream if defined
this particular quote is for fgetc -- getc getchar and fread are all required to read data as if by calling fgetc

7059852
udp	tcp
from wikipedia a field that specifies the length in bytes of the entire datagram header and data. the minimum length is 8 bytes since that s the length of the header. the field size sets a theoretical limit of 65 535 bytes 8 byte header + 65 527 bytes of data for a udp datagram. the practical limit for the data length which is imposed by the underlying ipv4 protocol is 65 507 bytes 65 535 8 byte udp header 20 byte ip header . check the return value of getsockopt udp doesn t have tcp segments so it should definitely return with an error
tcp has segments udp has datagrams

7059876
uiview	subviews
i think your best bet would be to have a view hierarchy like this - containerview plain uiview that your uiviewcontroller loads |-- overlayview catches touches |-- uitableview that being said i ve got a suspicion that uiscrollviews use a different method for grabbing touches to other uiview not touchesbegan etc.
this is dangerous because it will scroll with the cells uitableview is a sub-class of uiscrollview and because the uitableview adds and removes subviews itself too so you can t control the order that the views are in

7059968
implements	extends
it is not good to replace capabilities of visitors in virtual functions like printreport smsreport etc where you will have too many methods to implements
using visitor you could extends the capabilities in other way without affecting the object

7059973
memcpy	strcpy
if you want to overwrite the first element of the array with the last one and zero out the memory of the last element which is not used anymore you can use memcpy and memset zeroing out the memory of the last element is not strictly necessary though because you shouldn t be accessing it in the first place
instead of overwriting the first element with the last using memcpy it can also be done with strcpy and assignment of the priority like in your remove

7061183
opennlp	stanford-nlp
for groups of individual tools that work together stanford nlp opennlp nltk and lingpipe are perhaps the main choices
my opinion on which is easier to use is biased but regarding ivan akcheurov s answer we only released stanford-nlp in oct 2010 so it isn t very old

7061343
udp	mtu
this is a bit of a stab in the dark since you don t provide enough code to really say what s going on definitively but there s one major reason why you might consistently see some udp datagrams not be delivered over a wan while others always arrive successfully
this reason is mtu

7061549
g++	gcc
it does appear that you are trying to run the source file directly however you will need to compile using a c++ compiler such as that included in the gcc gnu compiler collection which contains the c++ compiler g++ for the mac
it is not included with the mac you have to download it first from to install the gcc compiler download the xcode package from

7062245
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
the maximum possible udp datagram payload size is 65535-28 65507 as per yi_h s answer
in practice it is further limited by the nic s mtu and by the intermediate routers in exactly the same way that tcp s mss is however it is not negotiated across the length of the path like a tcp mss is

7062502
g++	gcc
just compile latest g++ from source there is a helper script that downloads gcc dependencies and builds it for you
the version of g++ you are using doesn t support c++11 features such as extended enums

7062579
required	placeholder
of course as it is right now the acceleration method could be rewritten as or the arguments could be removed completely though that would required the places where the method is called to be updated to not contain any arguments. this isn t a style of programming per se but i have seen this type of placeholder code put into books before
i think the author may be using the method acceleration as a placeholder perhaps for updates on a subsequent chapter

7064487
thunk	trampolines
you then write a trampolines that manages calls to thunk it applies a thunk until the thunk returns a result as opposed to another thunk then all that s left is to freeze thunk all your recursive calls from the original cps function to let the trampolines unwrap them in proper sequence
your function now returns a thunk without recursion and discarding its own frame at every call sadly this does not go that fast recursive mergesort 0.126505711079 this trampolined version 0.170638551712

7066830
emacs	aquamacs
put the following code in your emacs init file to globally disable this cua-mode 0 alternatively if you want to keep cua-mode and cua-mode s rectangle functionality but not the keybinding you can change the keybinding by customizing the global variable cua-rectangle-mark-key which is set by default to control return
aquamacs enables cua-mode by default which is what is setting the cua-set-rectangle-mark keybinding

7068096
pbkdf2	whirlpool	pbkdf2	md5
instead use salt hash stretched with pbkdf2 preferably sha2-512
for reference here is a classification of the listed hash see wikipedia for details encryption not a hash function des non-cryptographic checksums laughable adler32 crc32 crc32b broken md2 md4 md5 sha1 probably broken tiger snefru gost haval probably safe sha2-256 384 512 ripemd-128 256 ripemd-160 320 whirlpool note that the strength refers to the attack of finding any password that matches a known hash preimage attack

7070069
innodb	myisam
fixing innodb is not as trivial as a click of a button
myisam is

7070069
innodb	myisam
under the hood optimize table will do this to a myisam table called mytb create empty temp table with same structure as mytb copy myisam data from mytb into the temp table drop table mytb rename temp table to mytb run analyze table against mytb and store index statistics optmize table does not work that way with innodb for two major reasons reason #1 innodb storage layout by default innodb has innodb_file_per_table disabled
everything innodb and its grandmother lands in ibdata1

7070919
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you cannot add a uinavigationcontroller to your uiviewcontroller but rather the other way round
both uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are controllers of controllers they manage multiple uiviewcontrollers

7071612
jboss	glassfish
one that immediately sprung to my mind regarding ejb - if you want to see if they really have some experience with ejb ask them when ejb 3 was introduced - tell us about the troubles you had deploying your first ejb3 applications on different application server implementations with regard to differences of the actual implementations and the official specs. we had endless problems where jboss and oracle application server etc
and even glassfish did not behave the way they were supposed to

7073432
aggregate-functions	sum
where only works for columns or expressions if you want to filtering with an aggregate-functions like sum you have to use having
for example this query doesn t really make sense without a valid grouping by but you get the point use having to filtering with an aggregate-functions

7073950
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in ib you should create a uinavigationcontroller and then set the existing uiviewcontroller as the root controller of the new uinavigationcontroller
you shouldn t modify a uiviewcontroller to be a uinavigationcontroller

7073950
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you shouldn t modify a uiviewcontroller to be a uinavigationcontroller
even though a uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller its job is to manage other view controllers not views

7075009
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
it is still not a good idea to catch all runtimeexception s.
an attempt at simplifying your code by catching throwable i assume you wish to catch all unchecked-exception

7075459
g++	gcc
g++ will compiler files ending in .c as c++
the obvious problem is that you re linking with gcc rather than g++ . gcc doesn t link against the c++ standard library

7075459
g++	gcc
the obvious problem is that you re linking with gcc rather than g++ . gcc doesn t link against the c++ standard library
you can add it manually but the simplest is simply to use g++ for everything unless you have actual c code

7076231
ubuntu	linux
for example ubuntu does not support notifications that require user interaction
these are the most important libraries o linux pynotify

7077268
hex	binary
therefore +-------------------------------------------------------+------+----------+-------+ | status | hex | binary | fired | +-------------------------------------------------------+------+----------+-------+ | no flash | 0x0 | 00000000 | no | | fired | 0x1 | 00000001 | yes | | fired return not detected | 0x5 | 00000101 | yes | | fired return detected | 0x7 | 00000111 | yes | | on did not fire | 0x8 | 00001000 | no | | on fired | 0x9 | 00001001 | yes | | on return not detected | 0xd | 00001011 | yes | | on return detected | 0xf | 00001111 | yes | | off did not fire | 0x10 | 00010000 | no | | off did not fire return not detected | 0x14 | 00010100 | no | | auto did not fire | 0x18 | 00011000 | no | | auto fired | 0x19 | 00011001 | yes | | auto fired return not detected | 0x1d | 00011101 | yes | | auto fired return detected | 0x1f | 00011111 | yes | | no flash function | 0x20 | 00100000 | no | | off no flash function | 0x30 | 00110000 | no | | fired red-eye reduction | 0x41 | 01000001 | yes | | fired red-eye reduction return not detected | 0x45 | 01000101 | yes | | fired red-eye reduction return detected | 0x47 | 01000111 | yes | | on red-eye reduction | 0x49 | 01001001 | yes | | on red-eye reduction return not detected | 0x4d | 01001101 | yes | | on red-eye reduction return detected | 0x4f | 01001111 | yes | | off red-eye reduction | 0x50 | 01010000 | no | | auto did not fire red-eye reduction | 0x58 | 01011000 | no | | auto fired red-eye reduction | 0x59 | 01011001 | yes | | auto fired red-eye reduction return not detected | 0x5d | 01011101 | yes | | auto fired red-eye reduction return detected | 0x5f | 01011111 | yes | +-------------------------------------------------------+------+----------+-------+
i believe if you convert the hex value to binary the right most digit then indicates if the flash actually fired or not

7077403
onchange	onfocus
update use the onfocus to get the value before it changes . in this handler you could register the following onchange and have that value stored in the closure onfocus s scope object
update 2 i knew something was a bit suspicious but didn t have time to inspect if the user doesn t move to another element or click somewhere the element is still in focus and the onfocus will not be called while onchange will if the user changes the value with the wrong prev value

7077607
margin	text-align
for older versions of ie below 7 margin 0 auto is not supported add text-align center
to your body and text-align left

7079211
interpolation	splines
aha according to the classic paper on splines cited in the numpy code splines of order n and their derivatives are related by so using scipy s splines interpolation i could get my derivatives by also maintaining a lower-order prefiltered volume and querying that a couple of times per derivative
this means adding a fair amount of memory maybe competition with the main volume for cache but presumably evaluation of the lower order splines is faster so it s not obvious to me whether it would be faster or not overall than the central differencing using small offsets i m doing currently

7079572
scheme	racket	lisp	scheme	lisp	racket
mit scheme has a bunch of environment-management functions that you can peruse here i tested this on mac os x 10.6.7 with mit scheme 9.0.1 installed via the pre-built binary from the gnu site with the following repl session i think that different implementations have different conventions but i don t think there s anything quite like common lisp s packages
if you re not wedded to mit scheme you should check out racket and dr racket which is a nice ide that might be more powerful than a plain repl at the command line and i think it has some kind of module system

7079572
scheme	racket
if you re not wedded to mit scheme you should check out racket and dr racket which is a nice ide that might be more powerful than a plain repl at the command line and i think it has some kind of module system
racket is its own dialect of scheme so depending on what you re doing it might not be appropriate

7079572
scheme	racket
racket is its own dialect of scheme so depending on what you re doing it might not be appropriate
the default language module in racket is not the same as mit scheme i ve struggled with all this recently past few months when i went looking for a scheme that could run the code from lisp in small pieces which has a bunch of weird macros

7079898
skip-lists	tree
note copies of the tree are very cheap i do not know any implementation in c++ of either a concurrent skip-lists or a concurrent semi-persistent binary search tree
binary tree are not particularly suited to multi-threading because the rebalancing can degenerate in a tree-wide modification

7083667
floating-point	fractions
arithmetic first of all the decimal number 5.6 cannot be represented exactly in binary floating-point
it is rounded to the exact binary fractions 3152519739159347 2 49

7085104
firefox	safari
after some quick testing it appears that support is as follows firefox supported tested in 5 not sure since which version internet explorer supported since ie8
ie7 and below do not seem to support it chrome not supported all versions as far as i can tell safari not supported all versions as far as i can tell opera supported tested in 11.5 not sure since which version more information can be found in the mdn article on the property although the article claims that the property is not supported in ie even though it is since ie8

7085104
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
ie7 and below do not seem to support it google-chrome not supported all versions as far as i can tell safari not supported all versions as far as i can tell opera supported tested in 11.5 not sure since which version more information can be found in the mdn article on the property although the article claims that the property is not supported in ie even though it is since ie8
the css2.1 specification states that min-width and max-width for that matter apply to all elements but non-replaced inline elements table rows and row groups so it would seem that google-chrome and safari are the ones not conforming to the standard

7085147
bash	subshell
if you enclose your for-loop in double quotes the start and end variables will be dereferenced when you echo the string and you can ship the string right back to bash for execution
needs to be escaped with s so it is not evaluated before being sent to the subshell

7085902
jar	manifest.mf
if it has and there is at least a manifest.mf with the right format in it it is a jar file
but being a jar file is nothing special this knowledge does not really give you anything

7088390
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
otherwise asp.net-mvc treats this as a ordinary method call not a method that outputs html
you need to prefix before html.actionlink

7088695
collabnet	svn
i had created my repository using collabnet svn about a year ago and was unable to open the repository from within zend studio
i think the best solution at least for my case where i want to work with zend studio and not fight with it is to recreate your repository with the old version of svn

7089919
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead or add memset after
malloc does not initialize the memory so this might be uninitialized

7090172
move	drag
it is the user and not your application the is in control and the behaviour you describe where the mouse pointer cannot move over the task bar when dragging a window isn t something i have experienced
however when the user drag the image in the canvas you can constrain the movement of the image so it stays inside the canvas even when the user moves the mouse pointer outside the canvas

7093198
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
not all web servers respect case in urls but most do and you can t easily tell by looking. assuming you need to store more than a domain name use a case-sensitive collation
if you decide to store the url in two columns--one for the domain name and one for the resource locator--consider using a case-insensitive collation for the domain name and a case-sensitive collation for the resource locator

7095183
octal	decimal
javascript is interpreting 07 08 09 as octal numbers
decimal 7 and octal 07 evaluate to the same number while 8 9 do not

7096516
inline	inlining
the overhead of a function call won t be noticeable even if it isn t inline
you don t have much control over the inlining of a function the best way to know is to try it and find out

7097844
memcpy	memmove
copy everything after the index since the multiplication by the size of is done by the compiler that s pointer arithmetic also when moving overlaying memory areas use memmove and not memcpy
cnicutar is right +1 but also you write while it should be memmove temp+ indextoremove temp+ indextoremove+1 sizeofarray - indextoremove

7100121
innodb	myisam
if you are using single-row inserts you aren t using transactions and you have durability enabled the default setting in innodb then you are likely to see innodb performance severely limited by the requirement to commit each transaction to durable storage disc after each row insert
myisam has no such problem because it is not durable anyway if the machine crashes you are more-or-less guaranteed to lose some recently written data which the database had previously claimed was written successfully if not the whole table

7100699
vsto	add-in
in order to run it obviously needs the relevant framework installed v4 is far better for this than earlier version because of dynamics optional arguments that were added under pressure from the office group and the nopia setting besides that it also needs the vsto runtime installed
all of these dependencies could be incorporated into the installer but they are required you haven t specified what you used to create those com add-in my guess is c++ or vb6 and i can t tell how large they are and how much overhaul they need so it s not really possible to give advice if now is the time to make the change

7103776
persistent	transient
hibernate will automatically persistent the state of an attached object at the end of the transaction when executing a query whose result might depend on the new state of the object when calling flush explicitely on the session an attached object is an object that you have retrieved from the session from a call to get load or from a query or that you have made persistent via persistent save update or merge in this latter case the passed object is not attached but the returned object is
it s useful to make a transient or detached object persistent an object which is not attached to a session either because it s new or because it was attached previously but became detached when the session closed

7104233
django	web2py
you will get web2py working faster than either django or ror without a shadow of a doubt
unlike the previous poster especially if you are new to web development and do not have extensive programming background i would recommend that you try web2py

7104307
oncreate	setcontentview
if you use startactivity in the new activity s oncreate you will also set the contentview
so with respect to time setcontentview alone is faster since it doesn t start a new activity

7104845
backgrounding	multitasking
with multitasking you can implement applicationwillresignactive delegate method in your app delegate which gets called during temporary interruptions such as an incoming phone call or sms message or when the user quits the application and it begins the transition to the backgrounding state
without multitasking for applications that do not support backgrounding execution or are linked against ios 3.x or earlier applicationwillterminate method is always called when the user quits the application

7104845
backgrounding	multitasking
without multitasking for applications that do not support backgrounding execution or are linked against ios 3.x or earlier applicationwillterminate method is always called when the user quits the application
for applications that support backgrounding execution this method is generally not called when the user quits the application because the application simply moves to the backgrounding in that case

7107809
inline	inlining
maybe make the function a static function to provide an extra hint that it won t be used anywhere else or even mark it as inline knowing that this will not force inlining but avoid using special attributes that will force inlining as the compiler probably does it better than any simple heuristic that can be produced without looking at the code
if your bottleneck is in a recursive function and assuming that the level of recursion is not minimal average recursion is not just a few levels you are better off in working with the algorithm in the function rather than with inlining

7111826
punctuation	words
another issue is that scanner will include punctuation so file1 i am happy and sad will not find happy if file2 is you are happy.
i also changed it to use sets since you don t seem to be worried about how many times a words matches

7115080
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for the sake of completion these browsers definitly do it by default google-chrome ie9 compat opera update future versions of ecmascript might include an option of some sort since yes discussion is going on but that will not fix the problem in older browsers
yes most browsers do this but then again like you said some don t firefox so don t count on it

7115918
ssl	https
if the connection to the server is ssl secured it s harder for anybody to mess with the data but by far not impossible
one of the advantages of an https connection is that the identity of the server is confirmed

7116942
requestfactory	gwt
you will need to decouple data access and use either requestfactory gwt-rpc or some other kind of rpc to connect with your web server which will perform these operations
you cannot directly call mysql jdbc jpa libraries from gwt code

7118661
set	bag
use a set if it suits your requirements instead
you are using a bag for your collection a bag can contain duplicates does not maintain order and there is no way to identify an individual entry in the bag distinctly with sql

7120656
onclick	onchange
onclick is not supported for option s
you should use onchange of the select

7120919
express	node.js	connect	geddy
for frameworks some popular ones are connect a middleware component for managing http requests express a view engine router build on connect
socketstream a fast real-time web framework for node.js zappa not your mom s node framework grasshopper a mvc framework geddy a web framework spludo another mvc framework i ve only used express and i can vouch it is fantastic

7121964
coldfusion	railo
if that token were not included in the request coldfusion will throw an exception
railo 3.2.x does not support the verifyclient method

7123010
pascal	delphi
of these innosetup uses a pascal variant as its scripting language and so is a very popular choice amongst delphi developers
delphi isn t the natural choice for writing an installer

7123027
pbkdf2	md5	scrypt	md5
no you shouldn t even do that you should right away use bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 for that
in java you can use expression.sql the same should work in c# something like where value is the hex-encoded value of your md5 hash

7124542
intersect	contains
this will require a bit of handling separately to get an intersect call that will work
you could do this in stages note that this will return duplicates if collectionb contains duplicates but not collectiona so it will have slightly different results than your looping code

7124813
implements	extends
nothing personal here the first time i programmed irr as a server side script it was using brute force and a day later my web host called me as said they were taking my site offline as the code was consuming 100 system resources what follows is a step by step irr calculation using newton raphson method and you can follow it and implements the ideas in cold fusion
extends to what jason said you would need to implements a code that works efficiently and not rely on the brute force algorithm that falconeyes suggested

7127251
decimal	ieee
you can also choose to use other types like decimal that has extremely good precision on decimal places - but is also very large compared to floats and doubles
whether you believe it or not this is intended behaviour and conforms to some ieee standard

7128926
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you re presenting a uiviewcontroller that s not on the same navigation stack managed by the original uinavigationcontroller you would have to apply the same tintcolor to its uinavigationbar
that could happen if you re presenting a uiviewcontroller modally uiviewcontroller method presentmodalviewcontroller animated

7132519
implements	extends
your code is very messy but want to point out some glitches i found that maybe will make your code work first when you create your buttons in a single instance of customscreen they are linked to the same variable customscreen.custbutton then custbutton is the one who have the listeners and not the reference of the linked buttons creditsbutton and settingsbutton so everytime you create a button you link custbutton to other object also linking the listeners and the previous button become unlinked and not listening for events i recommend you to create a real button class wich every button must derive from this mother class must to implements it s own listeners and dispatch events for the mouse events you like.
this is what i do first create a button interface if u want some order then create the button class wich every kind of button must derive from next every time you want to create a button just extends the button class above and it will automatically have it s own listeners already setup see this example of a menubutton extends the button class

dbcontext	objectcontext
if you want to track changes in an independent association the situation will become harder because dbcontext api doesn t provide operations to track them
you must revert back to objectcontext api and its objectstatemanager

7135085
innodb	myisam
so in summary small tables never need optimize table large tables can never use optimize table or indeed myisam it is possible to achieve roughly the same thing in innodb simply using an alter table statement which makes no schema changes normally alter table t engine innodb
it s not as quick as myisam because it doesn t do the various small-table-which-fits-in-memory optimisations

7136415
super	self
calling super without an instance as the second argument returns a reference to the class itself not an instance constructed from your subclass instance
super returns an instance of the base class so self gets implicitly passed to __init__ like in any other method call

7137589
lisp	scheme
one can easily implement this in common lisp but by default it is not a provided mechanism in common lisp
see syntax case in scheme

7138298
inline	inlining
having said so it is prudent to let the compiler actually decide whether to inline or not inline a function call even constructors and destructors most of modern day compilers will appropriately optimize functions through inlining
apart from the reason oli mentions in his answer the book probably guides on not inlining constructors and destructors because even seemingly trivial or empty functions might often contain lot of implicitly generated code by the compiler and the actual function definition might end up being quite large this might result in code bloat

7140434
udp	tftp
i suspect that you are not receiving the response because you used connect on a udp socket which made it so that you only accept datagrams from the connected destination
since the tftp reply does not come from port 69 but rather from an ephemeral port the acknowledgement is never received

7141837
super	self
super snippet self .save ... calls that class s save method with self bound to the first argument
so super snippet self .save ... will not call snippet s save method

7141837
super	self
it is tempting to think this other class is the parent class or superclass of snippet that is models.model but that may not be true and it is absolutely wrong to apprehend super this way
which class super snippet self ultimately represents depends on self and in particular its class s mro

7142522
daemons	systemd
however if a daemons is not written carefully enough or has different ideas from the systemd administrator about what permissions should be used but it does set umask to 0 or another known value the systemd administrator maybe left without a method to override the default permissions set by the daemons
one advantage of open source is that the systemd administrator could if need so be modify the code to obey his requirements

7145427
ssl	https
but with one condition if your site uses ssl because you charge for access to your application or because your application is not publicly accessible to all users you must still purchase a maps api premier license
google does allows https access for maps api v3 static maps api and maps api web services

7146319
super	extends	super	self
i can also add that the super instruction only works if the class you inherit from extends from object otherwise you get an exception
i won t explain again what unutbu explained on super classes however you obtain the same effect with the following code models.model.save self force_insert force_update this is not a better way to write it since if you come to change the class inheritance by adding an intermediate class between model and snippet you would also have to change this line which you would most likely forget

7147217
implements	extends
if iactivation does not have to be an interface you can turn it into an abstract class this changes the actual meaning of the code but allows you to say update the main issue i can think of is if you have a class that extends something else and implements this interface it won t work you can t inherit from two classes
you could then create an interface and an abstract class that implements the abstract class but that s getting a little silly

7149303
visualvm	yourkit
it is commercial but with trial period two weeks . actually i ve firstly tried visualvm as axel22 suggested but our remote server was ssh ed and we had problems with connecting via visualvm not saying that it is impossible i ve just surrendered after a few hours
yet another profiler is yourkit

7149867
webkit	gecko
i m not sure if webkit follows the same rules but there is a precedent
in gecko 1.8 or earlier any two file uris are considered to be same-origin

7150362
innodb	myisam
to use foreign keys in mysql you need to be using the innodb engine
using myisam will not allow foreign keys but you can still join the tables as demonstrated to achieve a similar result

7152139
g++	gcc
similarly for g++
non-cygwin programs can t usually read cygwin symbolic links which is why running gcc works in a cygwin bash but not in the windows command prompt cmd.exe

7152976
rpm	yum
you can as hasturkun points out install both of them in the same command rpm -uvh libfoo-2-1.i386.rpm foo-1-1.i386.rpm fwiw if you creaate a yum repo and used that to update you would find that updating one rpm would automatically drag in the other
rpm shouldn t and doesn t allow you to update these rpms individually as the the state between installing the first rpm and the second is not valid

7158028
onkeyup	onkeydown
so input should become i ve added onkeyup also for extra measure
you should try with onkeydown because it triggers when user hits the keys not when it releases them

7163701
innodb	myisam
see you can also use bulk inserts of course if you want them to queue behind selects use a syntax like insert low priority into table1 field1 field2 values 1 1 2 2 3 3 ... or insert delayed into ..... note that delayed does not work with innodb
also note that low priority is not recommended when using myisam

7164706
apache	nginx
similarly to apache where you need to install a module for php on nginx you need to install something like php fpm
nginx does not know how to execute php code so instead your browser will just be given a text file with php in it

7164786
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you re looking for a single character and it is not case-sensitive use the overload that works with a char
searching for a single case-insensitive char is quicker than a sub-string

7165004
shadowing	named
generally however i would not want to disable shadowing messages since shadowing is a serious problem
shadowing simply means that there is more than one context currently on the symbol search path containing symbol s with the same short named

7168772
wordpress	expressionengine
wordpress is great when you can just create or customize a theme and when a site s data relationships aren t overly complex
expressionengine has been great for larger sites and is great with complicated dynamic relationships thanks to great add-ons like playa and matrix

7171246
google-chrome	safari
in fact as of 2011-12-24 it works with safari on mac os and google-chrome on mac os but not with google-chrome one windows safari on windows was not verified as stated on issue 106662 of the chromium bug tracker
lexically google-chrome on windows will accept the -webkit-optimize-contrast value in a css style sheet but it won t have any effect

7173865
gridview	repeater
here are two tutorials on how to use it update repeater doesn t have pagination included so you would have to add it other option would be to just use a gridview which has pagination included
i would recommend to you to use the repeater since you can customize it s design very easily to suit your needs

7174176
svg	vml
raphael isn t a 100 svg implementation
it only uses svg vml as a base

7181330
apache	nginx
i recommend you to use nginx as an reverse proxy since the configuration is easier and the performance is much better than apache
if you still want to use apache make sure you do not run php on the proxy machine and use mpm_worker instead of mpm_prefork

7182478
imperative	declarative
that should go without saying but for some reason people forget to use x for cognitive chunking letting whitespace group related things just as you do with imperative code
even though they are declarative programs not imperative ones even moreso do patterns benefit from full problem decomposition and top-down design

7186214
clang	llvm
most assuredly you will have your llvm trunk checkout and under the tools path you have checked out clang trunk as well explained under building clang via
makefile build guide on os x the build set up is a bit different but on debian linux i m building it daily as follows .. trunk configure --enable-target x86_64 arm cpp cbe --with-built-clang --enable-pic --enable-polly --enable-shared --with-cxx-include-arch x86_64 --enable-optimized --with-optimize-option -os --enable-assertions --disable-bootstrap --disable-multilib --enable-jit --enable-threads --no-create --no-recursion then applying the make -j n+1 number of cores on the command for my pentium d 945 system make building against autotools make -j n+1 doesn t always building llvm cleanly as it does against cmake

7188085
realloc	malloc
dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does
on some embedded systems you d never dream of calling malloc in the first place

7188085
realloc	malloc
if your embedded system has a poor allocator or not much ram then realloc might cause fragmentation problems
which is why you avoid malloc too cause it causes the same problems

7189702
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
think on the lines of say collection interfaces where in if a null is not allowed the javadoc says that a nullpointerexception will be thrown although it is never part of the method signature
while i agree with the answer that the runtime exception should be allowed to be percolated from a design and usability perspective it would be a good idea to wrap it into a illegalargumentexception rather than throw it as numberformatexception

7192631
implements	extends
you ll have to provide some more code to be sure but you have to make sure every object you want to transfer between your service implements the parcelable correctly
an arraylist for example does not implement the interface you ll have to extends it and do the necessary plumbing to make it work

7193549
fseek	getline
if the file doesn t change between sessions you can store the pointer in the file using ftell basically how far into the file you ve read and later jump to that position via fseek
you could also have your getline method store the offsets as it reads each line so you build an array of lines offsets as you go

7197098
invokelater	invokeandwait
you can test it with there exists invokeandwait but till today i just my view can t find a reason for using invokeandwait instead of invokelater except hard changes into gui jtree jtable but just with substance l f excellent for testing consistency of events on the edt basic stuff concurrency in swing all output from background tasks must be wrapped in invokelater
swing is single threaded and all changes to the gui must be done on edt basic usage for invokelater main methods should be always wrapped in invokelater delayed but asynchronously action event to the end of eventqueue if edt doesn t exists then you have to create a new edt by using invokelater

7197184
implements	extends
a very near duplicate from implements runnable vs
extends thread except the third point which i m really not familiar with either

7197950
innodb	myisam
because the table were converted by the signal any migration error would fail to unapply - if you need to use or create innodb tables where the default is myisam this be solved with or if you do not mind the performance hit
see also i have had the same kind of error happen to me when working with a mysql setup whose default table storage engine is myisam and i wanted to use innodb using the recipe found in above link we used the post_syncdb signal to trigger the conversion code

7198763
dictionary	map
it may have become clear to you now that a dictionary isn t what you are looking for
mostly because you have a need for multiple key types and a need to map keys to other keys

7199399
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you declare savestring as an nsmutablestring but initialize it as an immutable nsstring
you re then not using that string at all but replace it with the autoreleased and immutable nsstring that s returned from absolutestring causing the original string to leak

7200533
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
on windows all files are ultimately opened via the createfile api - if the file_flag_posix_semantics flag is passed to the call and the file system being accessed is natively case-sensitive then the file will be opened based on an exact name match
if file_flag_posix_semantics is not passed then the filesystem does a case-insensitive file open and will open one of the files with a matching name

7202375
rar	zip
it then continuously reads all zip jar war rar files in the directory choosing the file based on a rotating counter mynumber is not very maintainable but never exits the loop
if you re requirement is to read zip files using a number of threads then i would go about it a different way

7202892
collabnet	svn
replacing collabnet svn with visualsvn including a couple of reboots did the trick
i know this is not a pretty solution as it caused me to uninstall collabnet svn - a prettier solution might have been doing modifications to the path env

7202949
ssl	https
if you really need to you could try writing your own custom tomcat valve which acts like a filter to take care of this special case and redirect the users to ssl
okay i tested using confidential but it still does not redirect the http on 8443 to https

7205326
implements	extends
edit with one minor caveat you need to call toarray on data representing an array to convert it to an array as the class internally needs to covert array data to an instance of itself to allow access with the object property operator eh that s not really necessary anymore of course since it implements arrayaccess now
- edit edit 2 the config class can even be greatly simplified by extends arrayobject

7207036
queue	fifo
you can create your own serial queue that will execute in fifo order with dispatch_queue_create
you do not need to specify that it is a serial queue

7207153
ssl	https
update 2014.12.17 now that ssl is encouraged for everyone and doesn t have performance concerns this technique is now an anti-pattern
if the asset you need is available on ssl then always use the https asset

7209151
profiling	debugging
original answer i doubt you ll find much on this actually mainly cause lj2 is still in beta and thus most profiling are done naively as there are no debugging hooks for lj2 specific things like the trace recorder
on the plus side the new ffi module does allow direct calls to high resolution timers or profiling apis like vtune codeanalyst you can profile that way but anything more requires extensions to the lj2 jit core which should not be too hard as the code is clear and commented

7209606
uiview	subviews
so you can write a category of uiview and add a method called that will recursively create new uiview and goes trough its children recursively but be carefuly you will need to create as many categories as there are different type of views in your main window uibutton uilabel ... and add their properties accordingly for example on uilabel
not sure to understand your question you get your main window subviews by doing now if you want to copy these subviews it s a bit trickier because as peylow rightfully mentioned uiview doesn t respond to the nsmutablecopying protocol

7211199
trie	tree
whenever the user walks off the digit trie or chooses a word that isn t the number one word you could just insert that word into the digit trie by creating the appropriate series of nodes in the trie then inserting the word into the correct priority queue
if you make your priority queues out of a balanced binary search tree that stores a pointer to its smallest element you can implement finding the fastest word for a series of n digits in o n time and can then list off all of the other words with that prefix in amortized o 1 time apiece

7212032
rdf	owl
note that ogp doesn t actually use rdf type so you ll need to find a statement with ogp type and output an rdf type along with the mapped class
another way to approach the whole thing would be to create an vocabulary with owl equivalentproperty equivalentclass assertions and perform owl entailment to add appropriate triples to the original graph

7214212
dbcontext	objectcontext
you must either use directly or you must first convert your context to objectcontext and create the problem with first approach is that dbquery doesn t offer parameters collection - just another example of simplification in dbcontext api which only makes it harder to use
that is because your _database is derived from dbcontext and your accountsofmonth is

7214351
inline	inlining
inlining could in theory improve the performance but the users functions cannot be inline a compiler cannot inline code that hasn t been written yet
if you don t compile your library but distribute it as source code there s a possibility of some performance benefit due to inlining

7215091
move	drag
about efficiency depending on how fast your determine which divs are showing algorithm ends up being you can try handling the intersection detection only when the user stops dragging not on the mouse move
you should also preload the areas immediately around your current view window so that if the user doesn t drag too far away they will already be loaded

7215778
udp	tcp
if you want to wrap an rpc layer around your protocol no reason why you can t do that create a login method that sends the login udp packet and receives the appropriate response and returns it
the use of rpcs as an abstraction do not preclude the use of udp as the transport layer rmi is an rpc abstraction that generally used tcp under the hood last time i looked

7215778
udp	tcp
the use of rpcs as an abstraction do not preclude the use of udp as the transport layer rmi is an rpc abstraction that generally used tcp under the hood last time i looked
i d suggest just coding up a java layer to talk your udp protocol you can use any one of many libraries to do it and you don t have to discard all your existing work

7216599
setinterval	settimeout
using this syntax is not recommended for the same reasons as using eval delay is the number of milliseconds thousandths of a second that the setinterval function should wait before each call to func
as with settimeout there is a minimum delay enforced

7218155
innodb	myisam
i think innodb implements a true acid and does a lot of fsync s to save the data
and myisam is not a true acid and does less fsync s

7218449
nfa	dfa
more exactly a nfa non-deterministic... is vaguely like a graph version of the regex and is probably how you imagine regular expressions work
matching with a nfa does require backtracking but you can translate the nfa into a dfa which does not

7218773
octal	binary
8 is not an octal digit no more than 2 is valid in binary or g is valid in hexadecimal
leading zero means the value is in octal

7220405
comparator	comparable
your code snipper initialize a comparator but doesn t do anything with it
and this comparator only works as the javadoc says if the elements of the collection implement the comparable interface

7222058
postgresql	mysql	innodb	myisam
i suggest you use innodb or if that s feasible switch to postgresql - not only does it provide foreign key constraints it also has full support for transactions unlike mysql which will silently commit a pending transaction whenever you do something that s not supported in a transaction with potentially devastating results
if you have to want to use mysql i suggest you use innodb for everything unless you know you need the extra performance you can get out of myisam and you can afford the caveats

7222256
guava	lambdaj
original pre-java 8 answer the effect can be achieved with guava the function implementation is already more verbose than what you have keep in mind that lists.transform returns a view that will apply the function lazily - if you want an immediate copy you need to copy the returned list into a new list. so this doesn t help you shorten your code but it s an example of how verbose it is to achieve your desired affect in java
edit you might have a look at lambdaj a library that seems to approach what you re looking for

7227303
client-side	server-side
this has nothing to do with jquery or any quirk of client-side script code
it is a server-side issue the server -side application is not sending the expected http content-type header field value for the client-side script resource

7227303

7230027
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the javadoc states note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

7230029
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
extract from the java.util.sortedset javadoc note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equal

7230029
equals	compareto
hence in other words sortedset breaks or extends the general contracts for equals and comparable.compareto
see the contract for compareto it is strongly recommended but not strictly required that x.compareto y 0 x.equals y

7230029
comparator	comparable
see the contract for comparator it is strongly recommended but not strictly required that x.compareto y 0 x.equals y
generally speaking any class that implements the comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact

7230491
viewdidload	viewdidappear
try playing the movie in viewdidappear instead of viewdidload
at the point viewdidload is called the view is not yet in the view hierarchy

7230781
implements	extends
and you actually want a class c that implements both interfaces a and b
class c doesn t need to extends anything or to use any particular pattern or whatsoever

7232416
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
note that this is a hybi spec version 9 and will only work with browsers that support the new hybi technology eg google-chrome for sure and i think ff7 might as well
it will not work with firefox 6 or safari and of course ie has no native websockets support as of yet

7234963
rsa	aes
use rsa for nothing else than symmetric key wrapping and digital signatures in all remaining cases where you want to actually encrypt sensitive data you use a symmetric cipher aes is a good choice - 128 or 256 bits doesn t really matter
the workflow would look like this generate a symmetric key for aes 16 32 bytes if you use aes-128 256

7235040
client-side	server-side
add-ons and their dependencies should be always added to web-inf lib to make the server-side classes available to the application and client-side code available to the gwt compiler
on possible cause of the problem is unnecessary dependency to client-side class which is not available in the server at runtime

7235653
division	addition
since the association between persondivision and person is mapped as onetoone wouldn t it be easier to just map the division as a field in person
in addition to that if you define the division as follows you should be able to access the parent division with the same ease to get the parent name

7237583
mp3	wav
this article shows the native support per browser edit wav seems to be the most heavily supported - but is probably going to come with size impacts compared to mp3 and still isn t supported by ie
not all browsers will be able to play mp3 files natively

7238654
google-chrome	firefox
strictly speaking you cannot execute mysql statements in firefox although you can in google-chrome for the moment
in firefox you can create and use indexeddb databases -- a more supported browser-db approach that is actually in the html5 spec

7240830
ssl	https
there are a lot of free ssl certificate providers out there - or maybe your host provides ssl to your webspace
facebook will not allow to add a new app that doesn t have a secure tab url https if facebook will remove all old apps that do not have a secure tab url is not known at the moment

7241203
prepare	execute
step 1 prepare your statement putting a placeholder where you currently have e step 2 loop through err in the body of the loop you will set the place holder to be the current value of e by doing this you not only address the sql injection issue you can potentially avoid the overhead of having to parse and optimise the query each time it is execute although bear in mind that this may not be a significant overhead in your specific case
some actual code would look as follows one final point if you want to simply execute the query once instead of executing it inside the loop this is possible but again may not yield any performance improvement

7241901
indexof	hasownproperty
a bit simpler would be it just checks that k is not a method as if target is array you ll get a lot of methods alerted indexof push pop etc.
hasownproperty is used to check if your target really has that property rather than having inherited it from its prototype

7242281
opera	firefox
firefox controls these kind of items with several internal -moz- css properties so it s possible that opera does the same i don t really know
however there are possibly several browsers not only opera that highlight remembered passwords this way as well as focused items and it s fairly difficult to keep track

7243917
cpython	pypy
if you are 100 sure that the algorithm you are going to use is already the best one this is the most important thing and that your computation is really cpu bound then options are for example using pypy instead of cpython using cpython writing a c++ module and interfacing it with sip if possible implement your algorithm with numpy simd approach if possible move the computation on gpu hardware using for example pycuda
cpython the standard python implementation doesn t do this kind of optimization

7243971
uiview	subviews
in order to get the uitableviewcell s subviews you need to determine the which subviews belong to a uitableviewcell using iskindofclass in your print loop and then loop through it s subviews edit this blog post on easy uiview debugging may potentially help
the reason the subviews in a uitableviewcell are not printed is because you must be outputting all the subviews in the top level

7243980
gif	png
quoting from the imagemagick manual -quality value jpeg miff png compression level. that means that using the quality level will only work on the aforementioned image types which do not include gif
for gif s your easiest option is to use the -colors command to reduce the number of colors used in your image

7244420
inline	inlining
no this has nothing to do with the function being inline
inlining the function would not change observable behaviour

7247160
couchbase	couchdb
disclosure i work for couchbase perry krug
i d also add that couchdb s append-only log format really doesn t have much relation to whether application writes are new items or updates

7250826
base	fractions
in fact whether a number is rational or not never has anything to do with the base
all rational numbers can be represented as a fractions where the numerator and the denominator are integers

7251630
sudo	passwd
if you think the user should already be root then omit the sudo
this chooses an operation that does no damage if it succeeds the shadow passwd file is not supposed to be executable

7251725
profiler	gprof
the profiler output is generated via a function call from your application so you can decide how and when the output is generated
your customer does not need to run gprof

7252854
equals	compareto
hash table based collections like hashset and hashmap call hashcode whereas sorted collections like treeset and treemap call compareto method in addition to equals
whether or not you need to provide equals and hashcode implementations for your dto classes depends on how you use them

7255796
prepare	execute
mysql examines the data and inserts into the prepare statement
by knowing where the data was supposed to be placed and how long the inserted data was mysql can determine the character ranges in a query that don t need execute read the data . so when a hacker tries an sql injection mysql doesn t even worry about evaluating anything that is bound to the prepare statement

7255796
prepare	execute

pdo says to mysql mysql finds the location where id was in the prepare statement

7256651
jar	war
those classes can then be packed in a jar that is included in the webapp war as well as any other clients modules you have that need them
it s not normal or indeed recommended to package servlets in a jar or to use them as libraries

7258030
udp	tcp
for connection-less protocols like udp you can record data with tcpdump and resend it with netcat
for connection-oriented protocols like tcp i think it s not that easy because tcp expects your packets to have proper values in confirmed acknowledgment numbers which will differ between your recorded packets and freshly established tcp connection

7258066
wordpress	joomla
imho creating templates for joomla is the easier than most other cms i know typo wordpress modx as you simply have to replace parts of the static version with joomla tags menu content etc. it still needs some time to get used to the system but its not that hard
just like any other cms joomla makes editing easier for people who don t know html css and offers many extensions for any kind of features like image galleries commenting guestbooks whatever

7259897
postgresql	mysql
it is possible with a single query in postgresql using a recursive common table expression
this is not possible in mysql as it is one of the few database to not support recursive ctes

7260341
lisp	racket
i know that in common lisp these are very problematic especially immutable bindings since cl loads code by side-effecting it into place
but such features will help simplifying things and they re not inconceivable see for example the racket implementation that has immutable pairs and other data structures and has immutable bindings

7260590
rspec	capybara
i am not sure if you can test file uploads using rspec alone
it s easy to test file uploads using capybara s attach_file method from a request spec

7262079
queue	fifo
because the definition of queue doesn t support such interface
queue is a fifo data structure which means fifo

prepare	execute
also look into prepare statements for your update it will probably be more performant and secure
you cannot execute another sql query on the same statement you re currently iterating over with a resultset

7265454
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
as others have pointed out floyd-warshall runs in time o n 3 and running a dijkstra s search from each node to each other node assuming you re using a fibonacci heap to back your dijkstra s implementation takes o mn + n 2 log n
however you cannot always safely run dijkstra s on an arbitrary graph because dijkstra s algorithm does not work with negative edge weights

7270006
client-side	server-side
jslint is built for client-side javascript only
in my experience making it play nice with server-side code isn t worth the trouble - at least compared to the relatively low overhead of switching to something like jshint

7272002
scrypt	md5
the correct way to handle password matching is to use a salt to alter the original password in some simple way so that simple dictionary passwords will now no longer result in values that can be easily reversed by a google lookup and then use use a cryptographic hashing algorithm like bcrypt scrypt or if your really have to sha1
do not use md5

7273022
implements	extends
something like this this is not tested and there s other code you ll need to implements but this is the idea
extends your simplecursoradapter and check for null of the borrowed val in your overrided bindview method

7273195
implements	extends
this is because whenever you implements an interface or extends an abstract class with a concrete implementation you re declaring that the concrete class fully describes the interface s behavior
of course abstract extensions don t have to implements the interface completely abstract extensions of interfaces abstract classes aren t forced to implements the interface in entirety

7274064
addition	modulo
in addition to being somewhat faster this second approach does not keep a large number of definitions around
and you do not really need them in order to generate more elements because this iteration can be resumed using a pair from the last elements make sure they start at 0 and 1 modulo 8

7274866
cdr	cons
b let c mult a cdr b if zero
it s cons 0 c not cons 0 c

7277025
ubuntu	linux
i ve been doing development on a mix of windows 7 mac os x and ubuntu linux and my experience is that native windows is by far the slowest rails environment
i have found linux under a vm to be not so bad but that s clearly out of the picture for you

7277927
mef	prism
both mef and unity containers are thread-safe in the sense that resolve can be called independently from multiple threads for the same type
theoretically you could have some other kind of servicelocator which was not thread-safe in this respect but i would be surprised to find one because it would make thread synchronization across a prism app a real chore

7279527
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
your uiviewcontroller is not responsible for its own navigation controller
use uinavigationcontroller s -initwithrootviewcontroller where you create your uiviewcontroller object and add the navigation controller s view to the window

7280582
dictionary	map
as an illustration suppose you have then if i m not mistaken doing this out of the blue the symbol dictionary will list a declaration of dummy at 1 a usage of integer at 1 2 a declaration of i at 2 a usage of i at 4 5 6
the context map will have a block for the function the main block and the while loop

7281591
equals	gethashcode
in most cases such behaviour has to do with the equals or and the gethashcode method of your items the objects in your listval enumeration
make sure you have not multiple objects in your list that return true for a call to equals of one object

7281591
equals	gethashcode
make sure you have not multiple objects in your list that return true for a call to equals of one object
make also sure you have not objects that return changing values for gethashcode some random values

7281718
interpolation	splines
instead of simply passing all the touch coordinates directly into a uibezierpath you should first interpolation them to avoid these sharp lines that occur when you rapidly move your finger across the screen
this is not too difficult although does require some knowledge of how bezier curves work and splines interpolation

7283935
implements	extends
in our last project we had to implements a splitter but we approached this from a bit different perspective
we decided that creating a hdividedbox component is not flexible enough - imagine the case where you ll need to extends the ui with an additional splitter so that you have 3 areas divided by 2 splitters.

7284337
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
screenshot from google-chrome 13 same as firefox 4 win firefox 3.6 and opera 11.5 do not round the corners of the image
yes they will round the corners of a border if applied but the image will stick out the corners. screenshot from firefox 3.6.21 however even in the browsers that round the image as soon as you start to apply a border to the image the effect starts to get lost

7284643
multiplying	multiplication
next multiplying the result by 11 and use that
so we have hash count large_prime 536870912 11 the multiplication by 11 protects against most data entry errors - if any digit is typed wrong the result will not be a multiple of 11

7285053
pascal	delphi
some features of the delphi compiler and rtl are not supported by free pascal
ios applications firemonkey ios applications are written in delphi projects for ios do not have a target platforms node in the project manager

7285895
nodevalue	innerhtml
your nodevalue doesn t have a value because it doesn t exist
you should use innerhtml or textcontent instead

7288485
g++	gcc
if the ping function uses any stl or exceptions new etc it probably links against libstdc++ which is automatically linked in when you use g++ as the linker
you may have to use g++ as the linker not gcc

7288741
super	self
using super childclass self .method args allows you to walk the method resolution order and -- if everyone but the last parent uses super -- call every class in the hierarchy exactly once
not that super only works with new-style classes. using parentclass.method self args calls one specific class

7290280
union	distinct
left join distinct left join with group by in clause exists clause inner join to an inline view with a union to a left join
since you seems to want distinct projects but not the associated comment data there are several of ways to accomplish this

7291146
google-chrome	firefox
won t work in google-chrome if you are doing it in offline mode
i also got frustrated why the json file not being processed even if i don t use google-chrome - i use firefox or ie

7291634
hash-collision	key
since you know of as deadlock case the attached xml use it as investigation base restore a point-in-time copy of the database with stop at 2011-09-02t19 00 29.690 run dbcc traceon 3604 -1 using inspect the values in slot 174 using dbcc page 1 140302 3 inspect the values at slot 31 run and pass in the values read above compars the resulted lock hash values if they match then you have a hash-collision and this caused the deadlock
process 9196a8 has page 151867 slot 174 in x mode and wants page 140302 slot 31 in s mode process 88b5b8 has page 140302 slot 31 in x mode and wants page 151867 slot 174 in s mode the two deletes run under so the deadlock occur on the base heap of the table rid locks instead of key locks implies a heap not a btree

7293381
super	extends
if you do not specify calling a super constructor then java will automatically put in a call to the no argument super constructor
b extends a so first we call the constrcture of a that supposed to print a1 this statement is incorrect. in class b your no arguments constructor calls the constructor of the superclass class a which takes an int parameter

7295004
hex	binary
3 you many not need to convert to hex format though that depends on your target loader
for example u-boot based systems support kermit file transfers of the binary data

7295093
django	web.py
i started off with django and moved to web.py
web.py is not that hard as one might think

7295345
dictionary	map
if you re making a few very large lists that are then not changing much obviously never changing but i mean changing set of references to heads of lists that are used in your domain algorithm then it may make sense to just have a dictionary off to the side of reference-to-list-head length tuples and consult the dictionary when asking for lengths doing the real work to walk them when needed but caching results for future asks about the same list
finally if you really are dealing with some algorithm that needs to be constantly updating the lists in play and constantly consulting the lengths then create your own list-like data type yes you ll also need to write map filter and any others

7295408
uiview	subviews	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this uiview may then be added to the uiviewcontroller s view as seen above
the thing to note is that any uiviewcontroller s views that are added to the uinavigationcontroller will all have their content constrained to navview s bounds not the frame of the subviews added to the uinavigationcontroller so the content in each subviews should be created to properly display for the navview s bounds

7296944
setinterval	settimeout
you just have to remember the return value from the original call to setinterval and you can then pass that to clearinterval in order to stop the timer
sometimes when you want more control it s easier to not use setinterval but to use settimeout and just repeatedly call settimeout on each successive timer until you want it to stop

7296994
implements	extends
so i noticed this wired spring aop s behavior - if your class implements some interfaces then it will use jdk s proxies to implements them and delegate all calls to target but if class does not implements any interfaces then it will use cglib to extends your class and delegate each method call
the problem is that my public service classes does not implements any interfaces but aop was not working properly

7297838
super	implements	super	extends	implements	extends
i recently used javassist to implements a transparent cache for method return values by intercepting all method invocations and only delegating to the super implementation on the first invocation
note that java.lang.reflect.proxy can generate proxy classes at runtime but can only implements interfaces not extends a class

7298922
hex	binary
you need to convert the data to hex or something like that - which you need to do explicitly
for example you could use the hex class from apache commons codec not that if this is arbitrary binary data you should not use inputstreamreader to convert it to a string in the first place

7298922
hex	binary
for example you could use the hex class from apache commons codec not that if this is arbitrary binary data you should not use inputstreamreader to convert it to a string in the first place
inputstreamreader is designed for binary data which is encoded text data - and imo you should specify the encoding too

7299347
mp3	ogg
firefox doesn t support mp3 files
you should use ogg format instead

7301963
jruby	mri
but unless you really need to use the c-ruby mri i would greatly recommend you to avoid any of the approaches above and just use jruby as delving into native code will lead to possible segfaults memory management issues and all options above force you to run in a single thread while you could build a multi-threaded solution by using jruby
as commented above you can not do this directly from the ruby runtime calling java from ruby requires you to be either on jruby or call java indirectly using the c c++ jvm api that allows you to call java code from c

7302423
addition	multiplication
you can see there can be no carry over from the addition of t5 and p1
a further reduction can be gained by realizing that p1 cannot be 0 the first digit must be something and if it were a 2 multiplication with 9999 would cause a 8 or 9 if a carry occurs in the result for t which is not allowed either

7303442
imperative	declarative
so it s not unusual for some parts of a program to be written in a more declarative style but for the speed-critical parts to be more imperative
as you might imagine the language you use to write a program affects how declarative you can be - a language that has built-in smarts for working out what to do given a description of the result is going to allow a much more declarative approach than one where the programmer needs to first add that kind of intelligence with imperative code before being able to build a more declarative layer on top

7305145
client-side	server-side
there isn t really a way to protect any sort of client-side code whether it is an android .apk a java .jar file or a bit of javascript code that runs in your user s browser
the best way to protect yourself from piracy is to make the application dependent on some server-side computation that you provide

7309301
equals	gethashcode
this means that if two objects compare as equals with equals then their gethashcode must return the same value
if some of the 6 string properties are not strictly read-only they cannot take part in the gethashcode implementation

7310190

valgrind	gprof
i think you wouldn t need a new compiling if you use valgrind
if you can compile them again you could use a profiler such as gprof or valgrind with its callgrind tool

7314616
client-side	server-side
filip is confusing server-side java with client-side java
he is correct that you cannot share sessions between two server-side platforms such as java j2ee and asp.net without using a custom approach

7317374
vim	emacs
i don t know about emacs but vim can be used in easy mode like this vim -y yourfile.php
vim is one of the two best editors out there learning its basics is not that hard

7318724
primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
my personal taste prefers primefaces but i haven t tried richfaces since it turned jsf 2 ready
there is one thing against icefaces a lot of components and functionality are only available in the enterprise version which is commercial not free but that might as well be a good thing since you get support etc

7319113
nsmutablestring	nsstring
still casting an nsstring to an nsmutablestring is not a good idea what really needs to be done is find where it is becoming an nsstring and fix that
simply at this point in the code soapresults is not a nsmutablestring

7319113
nsmutablestring	nsstring
simply at this point in the code soapresults is not a nsmutablestring
perhaps somewhere else in the code it is inadvertently replaced with a nsstring

7320929
prng	random
that combines part of not all the current state of the prng with the new seed data so to some degree all of the past times and cut values and number of uses of the prng can affect the state not just the most recent
pouring more information into the seed value in this way could be considered more random than a seed involving less information and hence fewer plausible values

7322141
prepare	execute
the sql text of a prepare statement with parameters is the text at the time the query was prepare so it contains parameter placeholders not the values used when the statement is execute
getqueryparams returns an array of parameter values used when executing a prepare query

7323376
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
and the viewcontroller itself i guess your problem is not on the uiviewcontroller itself but on your memory managment
don t forget for example to set your iboutlets to nil in the viewdidunload method so that when your app receive a memorywarning and releases views that are not onscreen typically views attached to viewcontrollers that are not the topmost viewcontroller of the uinavigationcontroller your iboutlets stops pointing to objets and views that don t exist anymore probably causing the crash because your app tries then to access memory that has been deallocated since ps note that your crashlog is not entirely symbolicated the most interesting part the one that correspond to your own code in your holler app is still represented as adresses to methods instead of the method names.

7325153
g++	gcc
yes g++ will add the c++ library in the linker phase but that s not the unique difference more on this later
to explain how changing the extension solved it please take a look in this text straight from gcc s manual compiling c++ programs c++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes .c .cc .cpp .cpp .c++ .cp or .cxx

7329342
udp	tcp
consider udp can technically be faster due to less overheads but modern hardware is not fast enough to saturate even 1 gige channels with smallest packet size
tcp is pretty much accelerated by any card from checksumming to segmentation through to full offload

7329342
udp	tcp
use udp when you need multicast distributing to say more than say a few recipients
use udp when tcp windowing and congestion control is not optimised such as high latency high bandwidth wan links see udt and wan accelerators for example

7329925
udp	tcp
there are still plenty of open source implementations of things like xmodem zmodem kermit ymodem and many others still floating around since most of these can and did work with byte streams then it shouldn t be too difficult to make them work with a byte stream over udp instead of a byte stream over a serial port
in all honesty i think it s going to be just a difficult to get the tcp side of things working as it is to tackle this question and since tcp is designed to do what your asking then i personally would take the right tool for the right job approach

7330975
mathml	mathjax
webview cannot render mathml tags
i tried using mathjax but it needs 16mb of files to render mathematical equations

7331472
postgresql	mysql
mysql can do it so can postgresql firebird and plenty others but not the likes of sqlite
i d pick postgresql myself

7332586
translation	localization
cons for database required more initial work to set-up requires a database and matching service requires a means of putting the translation into the right places see above link for our solution
i know this will get a lot of traditional answers but i would also like to put forward something completely original we tried and succeeded doing ourselves for more efficient localization of silverlight using attached properties instead of binding link localization of silverlight projects after completion we found resources and binding solutions to be tedious and not flexible as they all require the translation to be set in the project and therefore needs a re-deploy of the app when it changed

7332586
translation	localization

traditionally translation are sent out in batches and managed by language with unique keys translator notes etc

7333408
spaces	delimiter
the default of one blank spaces is not relevant here
the job opens the file for writing truncates existing file or creates a new file set the field and record delimiter then writes the same line twice using two different calls

7334300
dictionary	map
a few things gethashcode is used by the dictionary to figure out where to store the key internally but it s not an exact match scenario
in ideal circumstances the hash code should map each key to a unique slot index making lookups extremely quick

7335774
innodb	myisam
that said an article from the mysql performance blog is perhaps relevant to your particular interests high rate insertion with mysql and innodb to a lesser extent this so question as well myisam vs innodb
edit there is also a webinar about migrating from myisam to innodb although i have not watched it

7335774
innodb	myisam
edit there is also a webinar about migrating from myisam to innodb although i have not watched it
the description seems to deal with mysql 5.5 having made innodb the default though so again perhaps it will be useful

7341170
ssl	https
when you connect to an https server you can trust that the server is the owner of that certificate because the server must be holding the private key and hopefully nobody else has it because otherwise the ssl connection is not possible
if the server did not hold the private key that pairs with the public key of its certificate it could not present you with a valid ssl connection

7341622
udp	tftp	udp	tcp
if you are going to implement this on a lan or possibly even over the internet it is worth considering udp over tcp - in a chat application it is not usually absolutely mission critical that messages arrive in the right order and even if it was users would probably not be able to type faster than the variations in network latency probably 100ms
then for file transfers you could either negotiate a seperate tcp socket for the data exchange like ftp or implement some kind of udp ack system like tftp

7343982
backgrounding	multitasking
as for backgrounding tasks you have to implement backgrounding functionality like playing music or downloading something or sending local notifications by yourself
iphone 3g doesn t support multitasking only 3gs 4 and ipads

7344113
union	distinct
in particular if you are using sql server you will find a difference between the results of the following two statements #1 with data f as select abc union all select def union all select abc select f row_number over order by f from data group by f #2 with data f as select abc union all select def union all select abc select distinct f row_number over order by f from data if you aren t you can still see the results for yourself using stack exchange data explorer . both statements are meant to return distinct items ranked
however only the first statement with group by returns the results as expected while the latter with distinct returns all items

7346455
daemons	systemd
fsc starts a daemons process which stays alive between calls to compile so it doesn t have to do all the initializing work each time
you can t actually run the compile on a completely separate box unless you have a shared file systemd

7347117
notepad++	scite
here s some new information scite 2.29 has a version of scilexer.dll that doesn t crash notepad++ 5.9.3 and also interprets the single quote correctly
i downloaded it from here - the file you need is wscite229.zip you can copy the new scilexer.dll from the scite download into the notepad++ folder

7349645
equals	gethashcode
objects with different gethashcode must not be equals
gethashcode is not supposed to guarantee uniqueness though it helps for performance if as unique as possible

7349645
equals	gethashcode
now given your example above you do not implement equals this will make every object distinct regardless of the hash code because the default implementation of equals from object is a reference equality check
if you haven t go ahead and override equals for each of your types as well they can inherit your implementation of gethashcode if you like or have new ones and there you can make sure that the type of the compare-to object are the same before declaring them equal

7350501
super	implements
if you really want to guarantee that users call super it would be better to make the superclass abstract clearly designate an abstract implementation method for them to override and have the super control the flow of execution
if you want to define a default implementation so that not all users need to subclassing provide implements that method you could define a default implementation class for people to use

7351638
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the new demo work already very good in internet explorer 9 8 firefox and opera
in webkit-based browsers google-chrome and safari it has still the above listed restriction column headers which has multiheaders have to have the same size and be not resizable

7354146
multiplying	division
for instance if you want to use the bottom-right quadrant of your texture assuming top-left is origin you could use the following matrix 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 0.5 1.0 then in the vertex shader you multiplying the texture coordinates by that matrix like so in.texcoord and out.texcoord being float2 input and output texture coordinates respectively
the division by z is optional if you are only doing affine transformations translations scaling rotations and skews so feel free to remove it if not needed

7355050
profiling	debugging
note that for whatever reason the build target is not set to the same build configuration as the profiling target and this has tripped me up more than a time or two
i had this issue today and solved it this way edit scheme click on profiling on the left this is the important step change build configuration to debugging that should do it

7355276
guard	autotest
what you want is easy to accomplish in guard just write a guardfile in the project root and mention the directory to watch obviously tailoring it further to your need
i m sorry for not providing a direct answer but i ve stopped using autotest myself and switched to guard

7355276
guard	autotest
i m sorry for not providing a direct answer but i ve stopped using autotest myself and switched to guard
guard is a plain ruby process that sits outside test unit or rspec and as such it s much more configurable

7355494
mongodb	bson
and finally if you are interested in the dynamic aspects of it well the closest i ve found to that so far is my own blog post on using dynamic objects with mongodb
if you are interested in the single file aspects of it then it shouldn t be too hard to create something using the bson serializer deserializer code provided in the mongodb driver to store bson documents in the file system

mongodb	bson
if you are interested in the single file aspects of it then it shouldn t be too hard to create something using the bson serializer deserializer code provided in the mongodb driver to store bson documents in the file system
if you are interested in the query aspects of it sql isn t the right language to query a document store like mongodb

7355640
udp	tcp
udp is an unreliable protocol which means it doesn t provide a means of finding out if delivery was successful or not
one option is to switch to a reliable protocol like tcp

7356667
apache	nginx
i believe the previous answer isn t the right way to go because as far as i can tell apache isn t handling the downloads at all when this solution is applied instead the rails process is
that s why the nginx directive which shouldn t work appears to

7360003
ati	nvidia
the open source amd ati drivers radeon have reached an acceptable state but still are not on par performance wise
for nvidia gpus the only drivers that makes sense to use productively are the propritary ones

7361154
serializable	deserialization
i bet that if you modify it in the following way you ll get a run-time exception with a message similar to can t cast objectproxy to servicerequest if that s the case then the reason you get this is because the amf serializable doesn t preserve the type information when serializing the servicerequest -instance
in order to fix this you need to call flash.net.registerclassalias before the serialization deserialization

7361204
bash	zsh
as fredrik has mentioned though bash does in fact have a place where it does stash the exits status so in bash you can
if you do have a shell with process substitution bash does posix shell is not than should do the trick except bash it does not wait for the sed it seems zsh does but i only tried it not checked the doc so the output of date can get before the last line of sed output

7361285
swt	swing
swt by itself is pretty low-level and it uses the platform s native widgets through jni
it is not related to swing and awt at all

7362889
realloc	malloc
third you can t call free filedata in func1 since you by calling realloc inside your func2 function have changed the value of where the memory is pointing and you are not passing the actual memory address for the original filedata variable by reference to your func2 function
in other words if the call to malloc in func1 returned a value of let s say 0x10000 and you called realloc on that allocated memory somewhere else in the code the memory that was allocated at 0x10000 has now moved somewhere else but the value of filedata in the context of the local scope of func1 is still 0x10000

7363857
inline	inlining
i m assuming gcc and so the link you are looking for is and to quote this may not be what you were getting at -findirect-inlining inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at compile time thanks to previous inlining
this option has any effect only when inlining itself is turned on by the -finline-functions or -finline-small-functions options

7363875
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is definitely a very good alternative to mysql
in my opinion postgresql is actually the better choice anyway looking at all the things that mysql doesn t get right and the number of sql features that they still don t have

7365666
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 14 also uses the new hybi protocol series
here is the most recent version of the websockets protocol although firefox 6.0 is actually this one but there aren t really that many real changes mostly textual changes to the spec itself

7366703
jar	manifest.mf
if you have a closer look at the example it excludes the junit junit jar which means that classes in the junit will not be in your uberjar
update you need to specify the main-class attribute in the manifest.mf in your jar

7366815
persistent	transient
then it fails when persistent desk and you think that it fails in the path parent.desks i which is configured as cascade but maybe the fail doesn t come from this path
looking at your description i think that the persistence system tries to persist first in this order first the parent.children i each children i has a transient pointer to desk

7366815
persistent	transient
looking at your description i think that the persistent system tries to persistent first in this order first the parent.children i each children i has a transient pointer to desk
the system fails to persistent it because you have not configured it as cascade.persist

7368156
cpython	ironpython
this package still requires that you have a local cpython runtime on your machine. see the full readme for more info
python for .net pythonnet may be a reasonable alternative to ironpython in your situation. from the site note that this package does not implement python as a first-class clr language - it does not produce managed code il from python code. rather it is an integration of the cpython engine with the .net runtime

7370379
innodb	myisam
innodb tables area transactional and only useful where you may need to revert a commit in case something goes wrong specifically in a rdmbs environment
based on the information you have provided which is not to none if your only requirement is fast reads and writes i would say go with myisam

7370495
profiling	debugging
if you have adhoc debugging release distribution profiling then please make sure that you have developer provisioning certificate for adhoc and debugging profiling
also in code signing entitlements do not include the entitlements for adhoc as well as for debugging

7374513
nfa	dfa
what you are describing is a dfa-based parser or a thompson nfa
i m not a php developer but the pcre library does indeed come with a dfa mode. most linux distros will come equipped with pcretest. if you don t have it it comes with the pcre library

7377302
google-chrome	firefox
it does in google-chrome
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such

7378140
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
so if you re looking for low latency apache in front would not be good
apache has a rather big foot print compared to nginx or lighttpd etc

7378140
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
apache has a rather big foot print compared to nginx or lighttpd etc
putting apache in front does not improve performance

7378929
sudo	passwd
update 2 sudo appears to interfere with emacs terminal handling
in particular it tries to read passwd from dev tty and doesn t get input from emacs mini-buffer

7380651
ubuntu	linux
theses options solved the problem force rdp4 bitmap update connect to console rdesktop xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -g1680x960 -0 -b -4 on ubuntu 11.04 rdesktop 1.6.0
on linux with rdesktop i couldn t use visual studio 2008 on win xp

7380816
punctuation	words
note your current regex does not correctly handle the case where a short words is immediately followed by a punctuation character
you can change it slightly to do that apart from that you also have to take care of the fact that the resulting array may contain empty strings because deleting consecutive short words separated by spaces will end up leaving consecutive spaces in the string before it s split

7383539
implements	extends
so you should not assume that all browsers or user agents support prototype inheritance some in common use do not nor that those that do support it will continue to do so in a way that is compatible with how it is implements today
before you go extends dom objects best read these articles by kangax what s wrong with extends the dom extends built-in native objects

7385117
serializable	deserialization
the javadocs for java 5 still states that it is needed if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

7385234
equals	compareto
for two instances of custom with equals ranks and identical names you should not expect to be able to store them both as keys within the same map - this violates the contract of map
the problem is that your implementation of compareto is not consistent with equals which is required by treemap

7385234
equals	compareto
the problem is that your implementation of compareto is not consistent with equals which is required by treemap
from the api docs note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface

7388627
ssl	https
we just came across an issue of this nature with ie7 throwing a mixed media error with yt videos embedded over ssl
the truth is their native player over https is not ssl at all

7391509
ienumerable	iqueryable
the list t implements ienumerable t but not iqueryable t
ienumerable t works with delegates while iqueryable t works with expression trees

7392125
apache	nginx
apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance. with nginx you need to think a little different so might be able to skip some of your extensions
the virtualhost-file does not exist in nginx it s all static in the config-file

7393164
innodb	myisam
first make sure that both tables are innodb
even if create statement indicates innodb if this engine is not installed mysql will use myisam instead

7393164
innodb	myisam
even if create statement indicates innodb if this engine is not installed mysql will use myisam instead
so check if they are actually innodb

7393956
realloc	fgetc	fgets	fgetc	fgets	fseek
even if you can t use getline you can use fgets and monitor whether it reads to end of line each time and if it doesn t you can allocate and reallocate space to hold the line as needed malloc realloc and eventually free from
your specific questions are largely immaterial if you adopt anything of the approach i suggest but using fseek and in extremis rewind will move the read pointer for fgetc and all other functions unless the file does not support seeking eg a pipe provided as standard input

7394549
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
on linux which uses a case-sensitive file system you can do it
on windows which uses a case-insensitive file system you can not do it because windows can not distinguish between the two cases

7394837
multiplying	multiplication
for one the compiler did not complain that you are attempting to multiplying a string by a number and refuse to compile the program such as would happen in languages like c c++ c# and java
it produced code to forward the arguments and 2 to the multiplication operator just like you asked and moved on

7396817
equals	icomparable
while iequatable t should generally not be implemented by unsealed classes since such derivation would play oddly with inheritance unless the implementation simply calls equals in which case it would be pointless the opposite situation arises with the generic icomparable t
the semantics for equals and iequatable t imply that whenever iequatable t is defined its behavior should mirror that of equals aside from possibly being faster and avoiding boxing

7396942
postgresql	mysql
mysql tends to play fast and loose with the standards postgresql tends to be much stricter
you should be quoting string literals with single quotes in postgresql not double quotes double quotes are for quoting identifiers such as table and column names

7397043
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you can almost certainly get away with not free ing allocated memory when your program terminates since it will be reclaimed by the operating system but just as a matter of style and good practice you should still match malloc s with free s. i m ignoring calloc and realloc calls
there needs to be a call to free for each successful call to malloc

7397388
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml
scala and sml don t suffer from haskell s inability to do diamond multiple inheritance which is critical and i understand is why so many functions in the haskell prelude are repeated for different types
i don t think it is the main factor that will affect how popular scala will become because scala has a lot of power and its syntax is not as foreign to a java c++ php programmer as haskell ocaml sml lisps etc

7398230
required	placeholder
for method modifiers the java language spec notes that it is it is customary though not required that they appear in the order consistent with that shown above in the production for methodmodifier
which is annotation public protected private abstract static final synchronized native strictfp addition recommended order for field modifiers as of jls 8.3.1 annotation public protected private static final transient volatile recommended order for class modifiers as of jls 8.1.1 annotation public protected private abstract static final strictfp annotation is not a modifier it s a placeholder for any annotation

7398650
opera	firefox	opera	safari
gecko1_8 has been removed in gwt 2.1.0 and doesn t list ie9 whose support has been added in gwt 2.3.0 and last but not least i believe only the latest version of opera is supported whereas the list talks about opera 9
because there wasn t any cross-browser way of doing it until a few years ago firefox 3 safari 4 to point at the last players in the game having added support document.activeelement

7398650
firefox	safari
because there wasn t any cross-browser way of doing it until a few years ago firefox 3 safari 4 to point at the last players in the game having added support document.activeelement
gwt still officially supports 1 safari 3 i believe safari 2 support has been deprecated and maybe even firefox 2 no devmode plugin but that doesn t mean the browser isn t supported opera is supported but has no devmode either so it s not possible to provide such a feature that would work in all supported browsers

7403327
super	extends
because of you are extends a jcomponent you need first call super.paintcomponent g inside your overridden paintcomponent method for what concern the class extends componentui you should even there call explicitly the method paint on the super class edit a little suggestion when you want to override a method it s quite useful to put the override notation before the signature this way you will be notified by the compiler with an error message in the case you are defining a new method and not overriding an existing one
there are several problems with your code for what concern the class extends jcomponent isn t a valid signature so you are not overriding the method paint but create a new paint method

7403590
ssl	https
iow using ssl tls from a client to a server does not require the client to do anything special with the certificate besides using https as the scheme since the operating system provides everything trusted roots you need to secure the data transmission
if you re not using client certificates and you can access your server using https then your code should look like as long as your base_url uses https then all the data to and from the server will be encrypted

7403743
firefox	safari
or in firefox tools - options - content -enable javascript advanced - allow scripts to change status bar text
the status property does not work in the default configuration of ie firefox chrome or safari

7404181
pascal	delphi
i have not produced loads of software but i ve achieved more in the last year using lazarus and free pascal than i ever did with any other language - python and delphi included
i can easily create cross-platform gui s that run on all os es with powerful procedures that i couldn t make with python and or delphi

7404558
innodb	myisam
you can t separate innodb data by database but you can separate it by table and the tables are stored under the respective subdirectory just like myisam tables would be
see but regardless of whether you use a central tablespace file or file-per-table you should not back up or restore innodb databases by moving files around on the filesystem

7407489
selecteditem	selectedindex
use selecteditem instead
when you are navigating via selectionchanged you need to reset the selectedindex edit selectedindex is not available in longlistselector

7414224
translation	localization
imho i would not waste time in delivering localized ide versions i d use those resources to deliver a translation repository for the rtl vcl which would be much more useful
a long time ago iirc it was delphi 5 borland released a translation repository file for its own localization tool supporting some languages but not chinese though

7416714
stateless	stateful
http requests themselves are stateless and therefore static methods allow access to controllers as functional requests from client code
the model classes on the other hand are pure oo and as a result are not static heavy. some of the utility methods such as findall or findbyid are static but these again are not stateful and are utility methods on the class

7419003
trie	dawg
don t forget that of course you only have to compute the trie dawg once if the dictionary is not changing over time
it can be time-consuming to build the trie out of the dictionary so you might want to do so once and then figure out some way to store the trie on disk in a form that is amenable to rebuilding it quickly from disk

7423771
listview	gridview
i m not sure if you want to add your style to the scrollviewer inside the template of the listview or if you want to disable that scrollviewer and place the listview in a separate scrollviewer
to apply the style to the scrollviewer in the template and place the scrollbar to the left you can modify the default template when using gridview

7424448
apache	nginx
the article shows you how to set it up for pow and nginx but setting up for apache and passenger isn t too dissimilar
the apache config is different

7426147
uilabel	uitextview
edit a user cannot type into a uilabel
you need to use either a uitextfield or a uitextview

7427877
ssl	https
yusuf it is important to use ssl to protect your facebook application and allow people who are accessing your app from https not leave it or have to switch to http instead
there are two ways for you to do that buy ssl certificate from your hosting provider

7428806
tiff	png
please remember that android does not support tiff natively
try using png or jpeg

7431650
helpers	actioncontroller
i think the issue might be that the url_for method that you re used to calling in your views and defined on actionview as a helpers is not the same url_for method that gets called when you re in a controller
actioncontroller base has its own similar but not the same method called url_for method

7432356
google-chrome	firefox
as an example safari 5.1 just introduced a popup corresponding to google-chrome s browser_action but we have already an alternative solution that works for previous versions
firefox does not support html5 websql but we have an api for it

7432356
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
we also provide a way to bring webapps to firefox and soon to safari. the objective is to have google-chrome api as a reference and mimic it on all the other browsers
without pushing you towards our solution i might add that the time to fully cover the google-chrome api on both safari and firefox is probably not worth it - unless you plan to convert several extensions

7432658
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
- supported in ie 5.5+ opera and safari 4 and google-chrome verifed please check before downvoting
firefox is the only major browser that does not support zoom check here but you could use the proprietary -moz-transform property in firefox 3.5

7433160
onclick	onchange
ie does not support onclick for
the workaround is to use onchange on

7433873
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf
it looks like the issue might be that your war doesn t have a dependency for your ejb jar defined
it s best to define a class-path entry your war s meta-inf manifest.mf for your ejb jar files if you have not

7435052
xstream	jackson
xstream for example is good for xml but produces ugly json and slowly at that . going from xml to json is error-prone due to format impedance and i have yet to see an xml-processing lib that produces json clean json efficiently or even just clean or efficiently
i would recommend using jackson as it is superior to other recommended alternatives when producing json and for xml either use a jaxb implementation with jaxb annotations jackson can optionally support jaxb annotations as well so very little overhead of 2 libs use jackson xml-databind module to produce xml using jackson itself in format that is usually identical to jaxb produced i do not think that you absolute must use a single library or framework and the result is often better if you just choose best choice for each separately

7436684
rspec	capybara
if i retrieve the page with rspec s own get some path then response.body.should have_selector works as you say but page.should does not
to make capybara page work and to make capybara interactions like click_button or fill_in work instead of retrieving with rspec s get you need to retrieve with capybara s visit visit some path page.should have_selector works page a capybara method only gets set when using visit a capybara method

7440253
implements	extends
also something to note is that most clojure sequence types vectors sets maps are not in themselves sequences they do not implements clojure.lang.iseq so you have to do more than just add to clojure.lang.iseq if you wish to support them
if you re trying to add behaviour to existing types either write normal functions that deal with seqs or use multimethods or extends to do what you want

7440967
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is just like stack which handle each and every added uiviewcontroller i.e traversing like back and forth. ex
actually barfoon..your navigation controller does not contains any uiviewcontroller

7440967
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
actually barfoon..your navigation controller does not contains any uiviewcontroller
first of all create new uiviewcontroller and than add it to uinavigationcontroller

7442539
tcpdf	fpdf
the third option was not supported with tcpdf a few years ago however this might have changed by now
as i mentioned it is also not supported in core fpdf - however it is supported in mpdf and tfpdf which i have successfully used in many projects

7442539
tcpdf	fpdf
on a side note another reason for me not using tcpdf was unfriendly and unhelping attitude of mr
asani developer in contrast with fpdf mpdf tfpdf community oliver ian ... help on fpdf forum

7447713
uiview	subviews
well this worked but i m not sure i can get away with it since nextresponder is not one of the uiview methods you re encouraged to override in a subclass
then in interface builder i made the direct subviews of the scroll view one of these and hooked up its newnextresponder to skip the scrollview and point directly to the view controller

7449795
lxml	elementtree
for example lxml maintains parent relationships for every element and elementtree does not
you can add parent relationships to elementtree but it is not an easy example to start with

7451583
udp	tcp
you ll have to handle retransmissions reordering and the like and since webbrowsers can only talk via tcp you re not getting any of the advantages of udp
you cannot send udp datagrams from a webbrowser javascript

7451786
udp	tcp
and as phihag hinted at udp isn t good for this sort of application because udp does not guarantee your packet will get to its destination
you definitely want to use tcp sockets in this case

7456099
dxcore	coderush
not sure now but i think is called dxcore
you can download it and play with that to make your own extension for coderush

7456622
allocator	stl
there are a few reasons for this the most obvious is that the code is not optimized the memory allocator functions in the debug crt library perform additional checks to detect heap corruption and other issues so they are slower
many stl functions perform additional validations and assertions on debug builds which make use of stl containers very slow i ve had success debugging apps that make heavy use of memory and stl using the following method use the release build for debugging yes this works fine

7457126
rsa	aes
does it have not enough computing power memory to do modular exponentiation which is used in rsa dsa diffie-hellman
rfc 4279 defines cipher suites with pre-shared key authentication where the tls_psk_with_aes_128_cbc_sha looks like if needs only aes and sha-1 no modular exponentiation

7457575
config	ini
the traditional database is not the best way overkill of storing config data
all the formats ini json yaml xml that zend_config supports are serializable so they are easy to store retrieve and manipulate

7458091
consistency	acid
it is not a reliable information store nor does it offer the data-integrity consistency found in a relational database
even cache systems which can persist data do not necessarily have acid guarantees heck even myisam isn t fully acid

7458740
allocator	stl
also remember that the stack is very fast allocator and access while the heap is a lot worse on allocator and slightly not so sure about that tbh on usage so in day to day situations you want to prefer the stack
yes look up stl allocators

7459092
allocator	stl
however i know nothing about the sfml allocator requirements so it might not work if the space is very limited
in that case i suggest marshaling fancy word for copying the data over to the custom-allocated regions when needed tangentially related eletronics art has a port of stl for game development

7463097
equals	gethashcode
for reference types equals is reference equality
for value types gethashcode is based on the fields again not necessarily all of them

7463281
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
from the treemap javadoc note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

7463664
inline	inlining
if you think about inlining and its consequences you ll realise it avoids a function call with all the register saving frame adjustment exposes more context to the optimizer dead stores dead code common sub-expression elimintation... duplicates code bloating the instruction cache and the executable size among other things when deciding whether to inline or not the compiler thus performs a balancing act between the potential bloat created and the speed gain expected
this balancing act is affected by options for gcc -o3 means optimize for speed while -oz means optimize for size on inlining they have quasi opposite behaviors

7465478
imperative	declarative
however every referentially opaque language allows mutable data structures is imperative and not declarative and will not scale to wan bottom-up uncoordinated compositionality and security
in other words imperative languages are compositional and security spaghetti w.r.t

7467644
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you shouldn t have to simulate a memory warning to see a decrease in allocations after releasing your controllers. i attached a screenshot showing how my application looks after pushing and popping a uiviewcontroller three times using a uinavigationcontroller
edit to answer your comments uiviewcontroller belongs to uikit and is not thread safe which means you should not be creating one in a background thread

7471322
realloc	malloc
stl vector should be the winner in this case because it doesn t realloc every time vector guarantees o 1 amortized insert time
however it might be similar if your malloc implementation is optimized for this kind of usage

7473038
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
well the bufferedreader only reads stuff it doesn t have the ability to write data back out
so what you would need is a bufferedreader to get stuff in and a bufferedwriter that takes all the input from the bufferedreader and outputs it to a temp file with the corrected appended data

7473189
serializable	deserialization
this means that you have to avoid using private properties for the entities you want to serializable use protected entities instead
also if a lazy-loaded entity is not loaded at serialization time it won t be loadable after deserialization

7476038
boost	allocator
if you are just creating this as one batch then throwing the whole map out using a custom pool allocator may be a good idea here - eg boost s pool_alloc
custom allocator can also apply optimizations such as not actually deallocating any memory until the map s completely destroyed etc

7476266
ilist	icollection
your collection might be an ilist that is accessible via an index in o 1
in that case you can use a normal for -loop if you know the count but cannot access via indices thus result is an icollection you can count yourself by incrementing an i in the foreach s body and comparing it to the length

7477127
move	drag
you can change what is being shown at the bottom by clicking buttons but i ve never seen a way to move screen real estate around resize etc
as far as i know you cannot drag drop

7477473
.htaccess	httpd.conf
now we have to setup a map for this by using rewritemap however the catch is we can only use it in the server config or a virtual host config and not inside a directory files or the .htaccess
so you set this up somewhere in your httpd.conf or your virtual host file rewritemap access_list txt home ip.allow now you can access the map access_list in any .htaccess by using a rewritecond that accesses this map and a rewriterule that does nothing except issue a forbidden the rewritecond here just tries to find the as a key to the map file

7479392
division	addition
in addition to cheeken s answer you can put the following at the top of your modules from __future__ import division doing so will make the division operator work the way you want it to i.e always perform a close approximation of true mathematical division
the default behaviour of the division operator where it performs truncating integer division if the arguments happen to be bound to integers was inherited from c but it was eventually realised that it was not a great fit for a dynamically typed language like python

7480101
config	ini
make a test page called test.php containing point your browser to test.php and look for this variable include_path . usr share php usr share pear you can also find which php.ini file is being used loaded config file etc php5 apache2 php.ini i don t have an answer for the class methods question
if you re running from the command line and not through the browser you can check the ini file using php -r phpinfo

7481137
mvp	presenter
so i have tried to aplly the mvp approach to my widget implementation which worked well for me
this one below is a very simple example not for production use just for the sake of demonstration define a presenter and a view interface as in mvp pattern

7482331
google-chrome	firefox
for table-layout fixed with css below shows the result left google-chrome
right firefox stackoverflow doesn t allow me to post image

7482734
acs	adfs
if you want to use acs not clear in your post why you need it though you need to have your wcf service trust acs and then configure acs to trust an sts that can authenticate users agaist sql
you cannot use adfs for that as it currently only supports authentication with ad

7483151
implements	extends
you can only export use as remote objects instances of classes that explicitly implements an interface which extends remote
it is in particular not sufficient to have a class extends unicastremoteobject ---even though that one implements remote

7483347
google-chrome	firefox
