mail things this setup doesn t cover i don t have mac os 10.4 i only test the latest version of opera not any earlier versions due to it s small userbase i test safari 3 and safari 4 both one on windows and one on the mac not both versions on both platforms

816676
opera	safari
mail things this setup doesn t cover i don t have mac os 10.4 i only test the latest version of opera not any earlier versions due to it s small userbase i test safari 3 and safari 4 both one on windows and one on the mac not both versions on both platforms
now safari 4 is still in beta anyway

818854
jruby	mri
some gems target specific platforms mongrel there s a mri one and a jruby one
also jruby cannot use gems that have native extensions c code unless they use the ffi which most do not - yet

820351
typemock	nmock
typemock can do this because it utilizes the clr profiler to intercept and redirect calls
rhinomocks nmock and moq cannot do this because these libraries are simpler

820823
punctuation	words
if there are other characters besides spaces that you don t want to match some kinds of punctuation stick them in the construct as well of course
aniz in organization is not a complete words -- it s a part of a words

821614
realloc	strcpy
also dont forget you should check that realloc doesn t return null
i take this is a code snipet consequently i guess that you are alredy including string.h strcpy is defined as in lines num_righe-1 is a char not a char so it should be strcpy lines + num_righe-1 line

823338
haskell	ocaml
haskell s type system is ambitious and powerful but it is continually being improved which means there is some inconsistency as a result of history
f# essentially uses the .net type system plus ml-like hindley-milner polymorphism see question what is hindley-milner . ocaml is not quite consistent on whether it thinks variants should be statically typed or dynamically typed so it provides both algebraic data types and polymorphic variants

823380
config	ini
the zend framework contains a config parses that parses files that are written in the ini format zend_config_ini it sounds like this is what you are using
the config file should not be located in your document root and if it is not in your document root then no re-write rules are required since no-one can access it anyway

823380
config	ini
the config file should not be located in your document root and if it is not in your document root then no re-write rules are required since no-one can access it anyway
the ini format is specialized to provide both the ability to have a hierarchy of configuration data keys and inheritance between configuration data sections

824472
daemons	systemd
bugs with thread.sleep under windows if timing is crucial to your application then an inelegant but practical way to get round these bugs is to leave a daemons thread running throughout the duration of your application that simply sleeps for a large prime number of milliseconds long.max_value will do
this way the interrupt period will be set once per invocation of your application minimising the effect on the systemd clock and setting the sleep granularity to 1ms even where the default interrupt period isn t 15ms

824586
mvp	presenter
based on what you ve told me i would recommend that you use the passive mvp model mentioned in the article above
my main assumptions are your dealing with an existing codebase of webforms apps you need to use thirdparty .net controls for existing functionality your working on existing apps and don t have time to re architect them any asp.net web apps you work on in the future you can incrementally apply the passive mvp and get the benefits of tdd straight away your view codebehind + aspx essentially become dumb and just perform simple tasks take information given by the presenter responds to events and provides information back to the presenter i ve used this model extensively for web forms development and i couldn t imagine not being able to unit test my model and presenter code

824603
set	bag
this is done like this create your class like this in your mapping you specify this since you use inheritance you should definitly have a look at the different posibilities regarding inheritance-mapping in nhibernate and choose the strategy that is best suited for your situation inheritance mapping regarding set bag semantics - when you map a collection as a set you can be sure that all the entities in the mapped collection are unique
that is nhibernate will make sure that while reconstituting an instance the collection will not contain duplicates. - when you map the collection as a bag it is possible that your collection will contain the same entity more then once when loading the object from the db

825218
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if the user has ie without javascript or is using opera then tough luck they won t get rounded corners but in the spirit of progressive enhancement this shouldn t ever be a problem
this is what i m doing on several projects for firefox and webkit based browsers although beware google-chrome has bugs in this area use their css border-radius based styles for native rounded corners -webkit-border-radius 20px

826813
webkit	gecko
webkit and blink-based browsers support the -webkit-user-select property
this of course is not supported in browsers that do not use the gecko rendering engine

827859
haskell	ocaml	haskell	sml	ocaml	sml
sml ocaml f# and haskell allow closed sealed algebraic types to be defined to strengthen static typing by conveying more specific constraints implicitly
ocaml and f# also allow open sum types whereas sml does not and haskell requires an elaborate workaround described by oleg kiselyov

829258
vim	kate
for editing in a shell when i cannot use vim i look immediately for pico or nano but i would not recommend them for continuous development for rapid editing they are perfect
i love kate because it has several interesting features already cited usually found in heavier ides

830428
innodb	myisam
unfortunately you cannot disable at least i don t know how the key-updates with an innodb table
with a myisam table you could do something like i actually did not test if these settings would affect the query duration

831653
spaces	linefeed
spaces characters for unused positions in the field aren t stored
as hypoxide suggested they may not in fact be spaces edit i suspect that the last character in the field is a carriage return or linefeed character

833871
direct3d	directx
with direct3d 10 they ve split many of the functions that were in idirect3d9 relating to for example adapters into the directx graphics infrastructure dxgi
in other words direct3d 10 still uses com but no there isn t a counterpart of idirect3d9

835052
config	ini
i tend to use define for environmental config since referencing a constant should be faster than calling a new function
it s also conceptually in line with what i m doing another option is to use ini files make sure they are not in the web root and the parse_ini_file function although you should only run this once and use a singleton to access the variables after that

836670
gif	png
lawyers are the most important people to talk to in this case. but i d still say don t store it. if necessary i d suggest storing the contract in a format from which you cannot extract the original gif
such as taking a png file for the whole document or some other solution

837564
allocator	stl
generally try to reduce the number of allocator that stick around
it reduces overhead. assuming stl look at the overhead difference between std map and std unordered_map the latter may or may not be available to you at the moment

838071
g++	gcc
you can have multiple versions of gcc on your box to select the one you want to use call it with full path instead of g++ use full path usr bin g++ on command line depends where your gcc lives
for compiling projects it depends what system do you use i m not sure about xcode i m happy with default atm but when you use makefiles you can set gxx usr bin g++ and so on

839544
addition	modulo
this is true but doesn t explain why a plus-like symbol is used for something that isn t addition
the answer is that for modulo addition of 1-bit values 0+0 1+1 0 and 0+1 1+0 1

842610
interpolation	splines
finding a local maximum of an interpolation splines is an easy enough thing
note that you should generally use a true splines here not a pchip interpolant

842984
set	bag
if you remove the id column but don t wipe out duplicates you end up with a bag of rows not a set
if the application somehow doesn t prevent duplicates from getting into that bag then the bag is not in 1nf

843116
punctuation	words
then you process one sentence at a time after removing all punctuation commas semi-colons colons and so on
then when you re left with an array of words it becomes simpler that s it pretty simple after initial massaging of the text block which may not be as simple as you think

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
however you have to pass touchesbegan to uiscrollview because you want it to remember a base coordinate for future horizontal scrolling if you later decide it is a horizontal scrolling
you won t be able to send touchesbegan to uiscrollview later because you cannot store the touches argument it contains objects that will be mutated before the next touchesmoved event and you cannot reproduce the old state

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you won t be able to send touchesbegan to uiscrollview later because you cannot store the touches argument it contains objects that will be mutated before the next touchesmoved event and you cannot reproduce the old state
so you have to pass touchesbegan to uiscrollview immediately but you will hide any further touchesmoved events from it until you decide to scroll horizontally

845427
postgresql	mysql
the generated identification numbers will be unique. regardless of whether you use sequences like in postgresql and oracle or if you use another mechanism like auto-increment of mysql
however sequences are most often acquired in bulks of for example 20 numbers. so with postgresql you can not determine which field was inserted first

846356
postgresql	mysql
setting a delimiter is easier than using postgresql s dollar sign quoting when writing a stored proc
in mysql you connect to all databases not just one at a time

848997
collabnet	svn
if they are not important to you and you re comfortable using standard svn command line commands collabnet is a nice option
collabnet works great but it doesn t have the visual interfaces for management that are included in visualsvn

853492
serializable	deserialization
not too much code and you get to use the serializable techniques already tested and coded in the .net framework
you could use the .toarray property on the list and then serialize the array - that could then be dumped to disk or network and reconstituted with a deserialization on the other end

854180
comparator	comparable
the treeset uses the comparator try this make the comparator always return 0 and everything will be removed
same happens if not using a comparator but implementing comparable

854511
ocaml	sml
i am amazed you are not considering ocaml and f# given that they address so many of your concerns
sml is way behind and f# is way ahead of all other fpls in that respect

855510
actionscript	mxml
each mxml file is a full fledged actionscript class
you re not including those mxml files you re actually creating properties in your main mxml class and those properties types are of the child mxml objects

855685
komodo	aptana
komodo edit is one of the best ides i ve ever used and it has rails support although maybe not as good as aptana radrails
if you have money to spare i d highly recommend komodo ide as it has some great extra features but if not komodo edit has everything you need

855856
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
look at tutorials regarding uiviewcontroller or viewcontrollers in general they will have discussion about uitabbarcontroller
1 i m not sure if you can modify the size of the tab bar of uitabbarcontroller - i don t think that displaying just text will shrink the tab bar size for that you probably need to look at other solutions

855885
vb.net	vb6
notice vb.net collection is not included thread 179998
if you are using vb.net you are not using vb6 collections

855885
vb.net	vb6
if you are using vb.net you are not using vb6 collections
the vb.net collection is functionally equivalent to the vb6 collection but they are not the same

855885
vb.net	vb6
the vb.net collection is functionally equivalent to the vb6 collection but they are not the same
has a comparison of the various .net collection types with the vb6 collection including the vb.net collection

856170
mvp	presenter
the idea behind mvp is decoupling presenter from views so that you can switch the view more easily if you need to for example supporting both web application and a desktop application but that doesn t mean you have to make it dynamic
one suggestion i usually supply the iview as a constructor parameter to the presenter

856834
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
asihttprequest was originally designed just for this purpose tracking post progress since in the 2.x api this isn t possible with nsurlconnection
it will definitely be easier to integrate than rolling your own with cfnetwork and you get lots of other stuff for free progress tracking across multiple requests resuming downloads etc

858183
csc	vbc
go to the project directory i assume .net framework is in your path if you want to compile a bunch of c# source files not in a project you d use the csc command
vbc is vb.net compiler

858549
client-side	server-side
if so passing id is not enough as .net does not assign the same server id as client-side id
you need to access the clientid property of the .net control server-side to get it s real client-side id the above code shows how you would attach some javascript please don t call it java

860202
vsto	add-in
the bottom line is that you need to use visual studio 2005 or visual studio 2008 plus visual studio tools for office vsto plus outlook 2003 of course to build an adddin for outlook
add-in are quite complicated to write mostly because outlook has eccentricities that are not well documented

860296
client-side	server-side
if it is i would attach the javascript handler for the client-side stuff to the button and have the handler return false to prevent postback
when javascript is not enabled the button will perform the standard html form function of triggering a postback and that will then let you do things server-side instead

860406
apache	nginx
if you re concerned about memory usage you should see a smaller footprint from nginx than apache and the lastest version of passenger will download compile and install nginx for you with minimal headaches
if you are not tied to apache for something else i would also try nginx with phusion passenger

863294
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
it works on ubuntu debian 5 and mac os x
on linux it will report that it cannot delete non-empty directories which is exactly the desired result

864692
prepare	execute
using prepare statements with bind variables is much faster because it means that oracle doesn t have to parse compile sql statements again and again
oracle stores all the execute statements together with the execution plans in a shared hash table for reuse

865005
freebsd	linux
you can with pain handle this by running the svn connection through a bandwidth-throttled virtual router such as dummynet on freebsd
you can also route the traffic through an http proxy such as squid that can limit bandwidth or use built-in linux iptables functions using tc for traffic control to limit bandwidth but this is often not easy to configure use

869153
multiplying	multiplication
it doesn t need to multiplying them now because it already has the results
it s an optimization and presumably an important one on the iphone all those multiplication operations add up when you do a million or two of them

871372
union	distinct
if you put an order by limit after a union it gets applied to the whole union and indexes cannot be used in this case
if id is a primary key this query will be instant but this one will not also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

871443
stateless	stateful
you could view static methods as a bunch of simple stateless services that execute locally
a service has a much broader meaning that includes but is not limited to being stateful

871802
boost	stl
i m not particularly familiar with the boost libraries so there may be a more standard way to do this but i think you can do what you want with iterators and the stl transform function template
the introduction to the ublas library documentation says its classes are designed to be compatible with the same iterator behavior that is used in the stl

873374
g++	gcc
the easiest way to avoid undefined symbols while linking is to link with g++ not gcc
you can still compile your .c file with gcc though

873439
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if not make sure you specify rewriteengine on somewhere in your .htaccess
edit just noticed you said mod_rewrite.s instead of mod_rewrite.so - hope that s a typo in your question and not in the httpd.conf file

873692
equals	gethashcode
the equals method is intended for value equality so it s not wrong to implement it that way
if you have a mutable object there isn t much point in overriding the gethashcode method as you can t really use it

877560
lxml	libxml2
i just tried my app uses py2app and lxml with a similar setup on another mac without development libraries installed and it works so there must be something wrong in your system
my guess is that py2app picks the wrong version of libxml2 i see it comes bundled with the iphone sdk for example which is probably not the version you want

880612
gtk	cairo
gtk is huge and very useful but not at all shoes-ish
_why has written shoes mostly on top of cairo which is what recent versions of gtk use for widget drawing also so it appears he purposely stepped back to the core of ui design and created a different framework from the ground up for a solidly different reason than one would use gtk for

881185
cvs	svn
it seems that the tools to do those respective transitions have been more thoroughly shaken out than a direct cvs to git transition
i ve not tried this myself but friends have reported good success converting first from cvs to svn and then from svn to git

881433
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the view will not appear until just before viewdidappear bool animated is called
if you have dynamic content configure it in viewwillappear bool animated

883376
cruisecontrol	teamcity
oh and if cruisecontrol does not support a command line runner or project types other than java you should have a look at teamcity as a replacement
i don t know cruisecontrol since we re using teamcity but cruisecontrol should be able to perform a command line build just call make

884249
uiview	calayer
in the case of uiview the view itself is the delegate and like you found should not be changed
if you create your own calayer then you can use the delegate to provide contents or manually draw to the layer

885424
freebsd	linux
on the freebsd box could give you the login name from the failed login
on my linux machine i get the lines like the following from the frequent ssh attacks this is from sshd but i would be surprised if not rshd is not able to log something similar although it might be off by default and needs to be enabled

885785
vim	emacs
as far as i know vim vi has always had the set nu feature to show line numbers along-side the lines themselves
by default emacs only had line-number-mode which showed the line-number of the current line in the mode-line not the same thing

887477
implements	extends
in the example above fooobject is an abstract class which doesn t implements the bar method
instead of creating a private class that extends fooobject we create an instance of the abstract class and provide the implementation of the abstract method in line with the rest of the code

892017
gridview	objectdatasource
i m not sure exactly what your question is you need to be more specific but the general flow is as follows your gridview is linked to an objectdatasource
your objectdatasource is linked to a biz logic layer via the typename property - this is the class that will be instantiated for performing data operations

893266
textmate	jedit
textmate - costs money people love this program but i haven t used it enough to see what all the fuss is about
jedit - java based text editor has some nice features but the startup time isn t great due to java

894539
opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and opera have this feature
ie doesn t apple safari doesn t either

900178
listview	gridview
in a project i was developing i was using a gridview but replaced with the listview as i wanted very specific paging requirements that couldn t be provided by the gridview
i could have used a 3rd party gridview to provide the paging requirements but i wanted to minimise the reliance of 3rd party code

900203
passenger	thin
sinatra doesn t have to be deployed with passenger but can easily be custom tailored to be fast
if you use things like enterprise ruby and thin you could proxy to either nginix or lighthttpd

900203
passenger	thin
it ll give you more control than i think passenger would
not to mention better performance. i find passenger on dreamhost to give relatively poor performance when compared against running threads by either rack mongrel or thin

900236
hex	binary
some will show it up as a stream of hex which probably isn t very meaningful
you could use pl sql and perhaps utl_file to write the binary data out to a file on the server

900970
uilabel	nsstring
when the data comes back it calls a custom delegate method on itself to update its internal uilabel objects and then calls setneedslayout
in the case where the data needs to change inside of the cells i do not use the dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier nsstring identifier method

904759
uiview	subviews
i made the uiview 0.01 x 0.01 big while it does not clipstobounds
as i clicked on subviews that were drawing outside the bounds of their superview the uiview no touch events where received on these subviews

906474
.htaccess	httpd.conf
g day as mentioned above the context for the virtualhost directive explicitly excludes its use in .htaccess files from the apache 2.2 manual server config .
means that the directive may be used in the server configuration files httpd.conf but not within any or containers

907220
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
also java.util.calendar is pretty slow so getmonth and getyear on date might be be usefully quicker
while i wouldn t recommend doing so i think it s worth pointing out that although many methods on java.util.date have been deprecated they do still work

908571
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
oh for animations you should look at css animations and they perform much better than any js implementations but they re only present in safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox 3.5 -- definitely not in ie - in terms of javascript performance avoid with and getter setter like the plague and you should be fine in most modern js implementations
this sounds more like you want to improve the dom interaction performance rather than javascript so in that vein yes document.write is bad it blocks additional loading any js executing before your pages has finished loading basically requires all other processing to stop -- modern browsers like safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox do a degree of content preloading in order to prevents loads from blocking but subsequent style resolution etc is largely blocked

908571
firefox	safari
this sounds more like you want to improve the dom interaction performance rather than javascript so in that vein yes document.write is bad it blocks additional loading any js executing before your pages has finished loading basically requires all other processing to stop -- modern browsers like safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox do a degree of content preloading in order to prevents loads from blocking but subsequent style resolution etc is largely blocked
document.createelement is in general the best solution although their are certain cases where just manipulating innerhtml on an element may be faster -- but that is not yet cross browser compatible i think innerhtml doesn t exist till firefox 3.5 and the perform characteristics are tricky

908784
strdup	malloc
so using strdup doesn t help
worse you don t know in advance how many words there are going to be so it is not trivial to malloc the space you need

909269
erlang	lisp
and there are even more fields specially supported by languages that are important to understand parallelism in erlang or scala declarative templates in c++ or prolog dynamic languages javascript at at last you should always know what goes on under the hoods so you better have a look at assembler
it is not the languages rather the paradigms you should know procedural like c pascal object-oriented like java c++ smalltalk functional like lisp ml scala if you understood one of these paradigms in one language it is easy to learn another language in the same paradigm

910522
serializable	deserialization
this means that less storage would be needed to save the serializable object
of course this may or may not be desirable depending on the requirements of the system -- this is just an example. at the time of deserialization the readobject method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object back to the state at which the serialization occurred

910788
daemons	systemd
as jimb mentions you have the daemons write a pid file
you can tell if it s running or not by sending it a signal 0 via either the kill 2 systemd call or the kill 1 program

912286
required	placeholder
pro dead easy works with existing show actions etc might even be faster depending on savings w parallel vs sequential requests and memory load etc cons you can t always easily save the page together with whatever-it-is iframes will break out of the host page s javascript namespace so if they required that you may need to give them their own minimalist layout
they also won t be able to affect the surrounding page outside their iframe might be slower depending on ping time etc potential n+1 efficiency bug if you have many such modules on a page version 2 do the same thing using js calls to replace a div with a partial à la same as above except pro doesn t lock it into an iframe thus shares js context etc allows better handling of failure cases con requires js and placeholder divs

912729
inline	inlining
next if you want to mark a function as inline there s no reason not to do it in debug builds as well
the inline keyword has almost nothing to do with the compiler actually inlining functions

912729
inline	inlining
and that makes it easire for the compiler to inline calls to the function
finally inlining is not always a performance improvement
