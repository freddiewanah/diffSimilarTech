vim	gedit	vim	emacs	vim	emacs
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
it is daunting at first as i m sure vim is too but the question was about text editors on linux besides vi.
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

matlab	s-function	matlab	simulink
i don t think it can be done using existing simulink blocks
i think i am going to have to take the xpcserial c code that comes with matlab take the code that sets the rs-232 speed and wrap it in my own s-function
