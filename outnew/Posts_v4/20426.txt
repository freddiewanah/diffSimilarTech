these numbers get painfully large very quickly

you ll need to provide two runtime arguments corresponding to x and y

dns	spf
the spf website includes a wizard to generate the dns information for your site
check your reverse dns to make sure the ip address of your mail server points to the domain name that you use for sending mail
make sure that the ip-address that you re using is not on a blacklist make sure that the reply-to address is a valid existing address

maven	pom.xml

maven helps quite a lot with this problem when i m coding java
we commit the pom.xml to the scs and the maven repository contains all our dependencies. for me that seems like a nice way to do it

568
int	chars
meaning if you made a new integer you could call some method on i whereas with an int you cannot call any methods on it because it is simply a primitive
so would produce an error because int is not an object
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others

568
int	chars	int	chars
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others
i m not 100 sure but i m thinking that the int object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property like the tostring method for example
so int is a fancy way to work with an int just as perhaps string is a fancy way to work with a group of chars

put	get	versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script but if we have to recreate the db we don t need to run 100 scripts to get there
depending on how i m deploying the db changes i ll also usually put a versioning table in the db that holds the versioning of the db
then rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run whatever code i have running the create upgrade scripts uses the versioning to determine what to run

669
hash	md5
with incremental crackers the time depends on how fast you can make the password hash function run
the better you can optimize your password hash function the faster your password hash function gets the weaker your scheme is
md5 and sha1 even conventional block ciphers like des are designed to be fast

877
x86	64bit

you ll need to compile with the target cpu set to x86 to force your code to use the 32 bit version of the vfp ole db provider
microsoft has stated that there are no plans on releasing a 64bit edition of the visual foxpro ole db provider

put	get
if you get lazy and don t notify the people in charge of translations or you embed strings without going through your localization system it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later
similarly if localization is an afterthought it will be very difficult to put in place
bottom line if you don t have all visible strings stored externally in a standard place it will be very difficult to find all that need to be localized

1114
put	get
there is no single-point solution to this kind of error
you need to put a real exception handler a catch block upstream of all places where this error occurs and forward it to for example a global handler method class that will determine if it is safe to simply report and continue based on exception type and or content
edit it is possible to disable hack the error-reporting mechanism built into windows so the mandatory crash and burn dialog does not get displayed when your app goes down

1269
cvs	svn

the subversion book has an appendix that details important differences from cvs which may help you make your decision
the two approaches are more or less the same idea but svn was specifically designed to fix long standing flaws in cvs so in theory at least svn will always be the better choice

emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs is very usable and looks pretty good
supports both traditional mac os style keyboard shortcuts command-o command-s and the control meta shortcuts for those raised on traditional emacs
it is definitely more mac-like than carbon emacs

1517
emacs	aquamacs
i can t speak to the extensiveness of the included elisp packages either
someone syncs carbon emacs with the upstream tree quarterly i think
aquamacs has a more irregular schedule but it s seen some pretty major updates over the last year

emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs has a more irregular schedule but it s seen some pretty major updates over the last year
gnu emacs for osx can be found at emacsformacosx.com
in addition to the latest stable release there are also pre-release test builds and nightly builds and atom-editor feeds are provided for tracking all three release types

phpunit	simpletest
the framework will run all the tests against your code and then report back success or failure of each test
phpunit is run from the linux command line by default though there are http interfaces available for it
simpletest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running imo

1718
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running imo
in combination with xdebug phpunit can give you automated statistics for code coverage which some people find very useful
some teams write hooks from their subversion repository so that unit tests are run automatically whenever you commit changes

1821
nunit	mstest
crazy good i guess
for the conservative types me nunit is still available and still more than capable
for the microsoft-types mstest is adequate but slow and clunky compared to nunit

1894
versioning	upgrade
should a client or customer call you with a problem with versioning 1.0.1 and you are using 1.0.2 bringing the database back to his versioning will not be a problem
in your database create a table called schema where you put in the current versioning of the database
then writing a program that can upgrade or downgrade your database for you is easy

2067
mvp	presenter
mvp designs have the presenter access the model and interact with the view
having said that asp.net mvc is by these definitions an mvp framework because the controller accesses the model to populate the view which is meant to have no logic just displays the variables provided by the controller
to perhaps get an idea of the asp.net mvc distinction from mvp check out this mix presentation by scott hanselman

2068
mvp	presenter

i blogged about this a while back quoting on todd snyder s excellent post on the difference between the two here are the key differences between the patterns mvp pattern view is more loosely coupled to the model
the presenter is responsible for binding the model to the view

2069
mvp	presenter

mvp model-view-presenter mvc model-view-controller both presentation patterns
they separate the dependencies between a model think domain objects your screen web page the view and how your ui is supposed to behave presenter controller they are fairly similar in concept folks initialize the presenter controller differently depending on taste

vbscript	vb6

whatever your things are need to be written outside of vbscript
in vb6 you can write a custom collection class then you ll need to compile to an activex dll and register it on your webserver to access it

2562
wmv	flv
don t let me even start ranting about that pile of .
the only other alternative of flash that i would personally consider is silverlight which allows streaming wmv videos
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

ubuntu	linux

i bounce about between mac windows and ubuntu and while emacs used to be my editor of choice i m finding that in my old age i prefer to something gui-based using command-line for the shell is still fine by me
my preferred editor is komodo edit which the advantages of being free as in beer available for mac windows and linux syntax highlighting for a boatload of languages including c++ and php i m using it for ruby python and php myself code completion even for classes i defined myself ability to remote save via ftp sftp or scp support for organizing your files into projects tabs and other interface niceties i m not sure how lightweight it is but it certainly feels snappier than eclipse

2883
versioning	upgrade
i used the extra line in my cfg as folows it allows me to xm console hostname from dom0
i think this was from a problem with the xen setup in the versioning prior to 8.04 i m not sure which versioning that was
i m not sure if the same change is necessary in 8.04 as i m an upgrade and didn t change any of my domu configs after the upgrade

2905
vim	emacs	vim	emacs	vim	gedit
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
it is daunting at first as i m sure vim is too but the question was about text editors on linux besides vi.
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

3580
installation	upgrade
you can skirt this to some extent by creating installers for the components however with clickonce deployment you have to create the logic to update said component installers
i ve in a previous life used wise for windows installer to create installation packages
while creating upgrade with it were not automatic like clickonce is they were more precise and less headache filled when it came to other components that needed to be registered added

3806

besides the already mentioned robocopy xxcopy has a free version
its syntax is backwards compatible with xcopy but has tons of additional options xxcopy help x create a 42kb file with all the options available

perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
visual sourcesafe - i m not much in the microsoft world so i have no idea about this one other than people like to rag on it as they rag on everything from microsoft
sccs - for historical interest we mention this the great-grandaddy of many of the above rcs - and the grandaddy of many of the above my recommendation you re safest with either git svn or perforce since a lot of people use them they are cross platform have good guis you can buy books about them etc
dont consider cvs sccs rcs they are antique

mvp the view is in charge

websphere	ibm
was 6.1 as installed with rational application developer 7 the documentation is very poor in this area and there is a dearth of practical examples
using the websphere application server was ant tasks to run as described here you need to run them from your server profile bin directory using the ws_ant.sh or ws_ant.bat commands
command . ws_ant.sh -buildfile ibm rationalsdp7.0 workspace mywebappdeploy applist.xml a deployment script notes you can only run this once

google any column longest layouts
the best way is to put the left and right cols inside a wrapper div float the left and right cols and then float the wrapper - this makes it stretch to the height of the inner containers - then set background image on the outer wrapper
but watch for any horizontal margins on the floated elements in case you get the ie double margin float bug

this article has some of the best ways to lock things down some highlights make sure no one can browse the directories make sure only root has write privileges to everything and only root has read privileges to certain config files run mod_security the article also takes some pointers from this book apache securiy o reilly press as far as distros i ve run debain and ubuntu but it just depends on how much you want to do
i ran debian with no x and just ssh d into it whenever i needed anything

inherited	properties
they might as well be fields properties have other advantages over fields
they re a more explicit contract they re serialized they can be debugged later they re a nice place for extension through inherited
the clunkier syntax is an accidental complexity -- .net 3.5 for example overcomes this

wadl	wsdl
restful web services do not not use wsdl because the service can t be described by it and the feeling is that rest is simpler and easier to understand
some people have proposed wadl as a way to describe rest services
languages like python ruby and php make it easier to work with rest

versioning	upgrade

6382
versioning	upgrade
these scripts will upgrade the current production database to the new versioning in development
your build process can restore a copy of the production database into an appropriate environment and run all the scripts from source control on it which will update the database to the current versioning
we do this on a daily basis to make sure all the scripts run correctly

6405
free	malloc	free	realloc
i think the cleanest solution here is to avoid using realloc when trying to modify the function caller s input
just malloc a new buffer return that and let the caller decide whether or not to free the old text
this has the added benefit of letting the caller keep the original string

6671
junit	testng
the biggest advantage testng has is annotations.
which junit added in version 4 anyways


6713
junit	testng	junit	testng
i spent sometime considering which move was better and eventually we realized that testng has no killer features
it s nice and has some features junit 4 doesn t have but we don t need them
we didn t want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know testng because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests

6713

we didn t want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know testng because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests
also junit is pretty much the de-facto standard in the java world

don t use server-side code to do this because that would require a postback
instead of using visibility false you can just set a css property that hide the button
then in javascript switch that property back whenever you want to show the button again

i agree with mike though i m a vim die-hard
i ve been using gedit quite frequently lately when i m doing lightweight ruby scripting

8381
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i use it daily and it s great although not without it s share of bugs
for the rails side of things though i d actually suggest a virtual machine running linux. ubuntu works well the only caveat is that you have to install rubygems manually as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology - i suggest this because if you want to do advanced things such as installing imagemagick rmagick or memcached or a number of other plugins which require native c libraries it becomes very painful very quickly if you re on windows
a second reason is that unless you are very atypical your production server will likely be running linux too

8570
implements	extends
please don t extends interfaces
an interface is a clean contract that a class should implements and your usage of said classes must be restricted to what is in the core interface for this to work correctly
that is why you always declare the interface as the type instead of the actual class

9218
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
let the nice package maintainers from linux distros such as debian or ubuntu do the work for you
install from the distro s precompiled packages and staying current becomes a matter of issuing the occasional apt-get update apt-get -u dist-upgrade command or using whatever fancy gui tool ubuntu provides


10232
ant	maven
that being said if you re already using ant it can be a little tricky to transition over to maven
so if you re in that position i would recommend using the flexunit tasks available here ant task both of these libraries do basically the same thing they launch a generated flexunit test runner mxml application in a window and open a socket connection back to the build process using a junit test runner
amazingly enough it works pretty well

lisp	scheme

nathan i ve upmodded the common lisp links because you asked about lisp especially with reference to emacs lisp
however common lisp is very different from scheme

10536
lisp	scheme
as you mentioned sicp is for learning scheme not lisp or at least not common lisp and not emacs lisp
there are some overlap in principles however you can t simply cut and paste code from sicp and expect it to run on any common lisp or emacs lisp system

moq	typemock
when i needed to unit test a web forms app that wasn t designed for testability typemock saved my life

it is so simple to use and so simple to teach others

10956
accessor	properties
if the class isn t sealed you can create a harness for it by extending it and then exposing all your internals within the child class
alternatively you could use reflection yech or use mstest s accessor generators
you need to clone your object and then go through every single properties and variable that your object has and determine if it was copied correctly or cloned correctly

oj has basically summed up a really good process of learning i d just add that having a good foundation in geometric math vectors matrices as a minimum cannot be underestimated - but it s not as hard as people sometimes make out

to get a truly unicode friendly implementation it appears you must go outside the std library

vmware	virtualbox
that being said you should probably try them out with the particular environment and apps you will be using and see which one is best for you

implements	extends

daniel keep in mind that just because something is possbile in iis and via any number of off box solutions like hardware load balancers and ssl doesn t mean that it is supported by sharepoint or that it is implements in the same way

range	minimum
an excerpt from the art of software testing by glenford j
myers if an input condition specifies a range of values write test cases for the ends of the range and invalid-input test cases for situations just beyond the ends
if an input condition specifies a number of values write test cases for the minimum and maximum number of values and one beneath and beyond these values

13251
implements	extends

the upcoming release of the framework design guidelines 2nd edition will have some guidance for implements extension methods but in general you should only define extension methods where they make semantic sense and are providing helper functionality relevant to every implementation
you also should avoid extends system.object as not all .net languages will be able to call the extension method as an extension

actionscript	mxml
it s more terse bindings are extemely easy to set up etc
however bindings in pure actionscript need not be that much of a pain
it will never be as simple as in mxml where a lot of things are done for you but it can be done with not too much effort

14412
junit	testng
testng s other big draw cards for me include test parameters data providers annotation transformers and more than anything - the vibrant and responsive user community
whilst on the surface one might not think all of testngs features above might not be needed once you start to understand the flexibility bring to your tests you ll wonder how you coped with junit
disclaimer - i ve not used junit 4.x at all so am unable to really comment on advances or new features there

14462
disk	ram
you will notice a big performance improvement if your app uses a lot of memory and the pc has enough ram to keep up with it
i ve found that 32bit .net apps tend to start throwing out of memory exceptions when you get to around 1.6gb in use but they start to thrash the disk due to paging long before that - so you end being i o bound
basically if you re bottleneck is cpu then 64bit is unlikely to help

srp	principles
as long as you re avoiding jury-rigging an element to take the responsibilty of something it wasn t primarily designed for or doing some other ad-hoc thing that dilute the simplicity of an object then violate whatever principles you want

personally i prefer home username .bin this way the bin folder is hidden but you can still add it to the path and execute all scripts with the x-bit inside
i like my home directory to be clean at first glance with very few folders

mouse	keyboard
but by going an all javascript route you could be making it easier for one group of people users with co-ordination difficulties but making it difficult for others anyone with javascript turned off for some reason

keyboard based control via access keys and the like for others

equals	gethashcode
then call the full slow equals method
then the two items are definitely not equals
all you want is a gethashcode algorithm that splits up your collection into roughly even groups - it shouldn t form the key as the hashtable or will need to use the hash to optimise retrieval

17579
accessor	properties
this has a purpose it allows other types to infer what methods and properties are available for an object following an interface
giving them protected internal accessor defeats the purpose of an interface
if you are adamant that you need to provide an access modifier for a method either leave it out of the interface or as you said use an abstract class

17601
next	except
just encapsule your text as wordobjects per word and give them a method getwidth then start at the first word adding up the rowlength until it is greater than the available space
if so wrap the last word and start counting again for the next row starting with this one ecetera
with hyphenation you need hyphenation rules in a common format like hy-phen-a-tion then its the same as above except you need to split the last word which has caused the overflow

17942
client-side	server-side
compare this to many of the other languages and you can see why using server-side javascript to provide a plugin architecture is so enticing
a secondary popular solution one which can be seen through a project like jaxer is that a common problem of web applications that do client-side validation is that since javascript is easily bypassed in the browser validation has to be run once again on the server
a system like jaxer allows you to write some validation functionality that is reusable between both server and client

to read the 2nd bit of a bitset you need to find the int that contains the bit you want in this case it s the first int bitwise and that int with 2 value 0x02 to find out if that bit is set however if memory is a bottleneck and you have a lot of boolean using a bitset could make sense if you re target platform is a mobile phone or it s some state in a very busy web service note a std vector of bool usually has a specialisation to use the equivalent of a bitset thus making it much smaller and also slower for the same reasons
so if speed is an issue you ll be better off using a vector of chars or even int or even just use an old school bool array

put	get
values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction
simply put when you are using this isolation level and you are performing multiple queries on an active table as part of one transaction there is no guarantee that the information returned to you within different parts of the transaction will remain the same
you could query the same data twice within one transaction and get different results this might happen in the case where a different user was updating the same data in the midst of your transaction

21277
int	double
a similar technique can be used for double
the trick is to convert the floats so that they re ordered as if int and then just see how different they are
i have no idea why this damn thing is screwing up my underscores

21326
inline	inlining
any function can be declared inline and putting the function body in the class definition is one way of doing that
you could also have done however it s up to the compiler if it actually does inline the function
vc++ pretty much ignores your requests for inlining

21326
inline	inlining
vc++ pretty much ignores your requests for inlining
it will only inline a function if it thinks it s a good idea
recent versions of the compiler will also inline things that are in seperate .obj files and not declared inline from code in different .cpp files if you use link time code generation

21619
moq	nmock
this is much faster than storing the state of the database and resetting it after every test
i highly recommend moq as your mocking framework
i ve used rhino mocks and nmock

21619
moq	nmock
i ve used rhino mocks and nmock
moq was so simple and solved all the problems i had with the other frameworks


21668
emacs	aquamacs
in much the way that aquamacs makes an os x-friendly version of emacs the emacsw32 project makes emacs out-of-the-box work just like a windows text editor
mind you all of emacs power and complexity is there but if you don t already have muscle memory built up there s no reason not to use ctrl-c x v as copy cut paste instead of m-w c-k c-y just to be cool
emacsw32 also brings windows-compliant open save dialogs sane crlf file handling and quite a bit more

22219
cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
however one big difference between the java and python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case no circular references objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date
for example i can write sloppy non-portable code in cpython such as and the file descriptor for that file i opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed
of course if i run jython or ironpython or possibly pypy then the garbage collector won t necessarily run until much later

22765
onclick	onsubmit
so it s not an expected behaviour since it only occurs when you have just one textbox and you have the focus on the textbox
i m afraid you ve found a bug on the browser and you ll have to find a workaround or avoid using the onclick event in that case
i use the onsubmit event for validations because it s a safer event that is more likely to work on different browsers and situations

23008
put	get
always start with a .sql file that is the source of your stored procedure
put it in version control once you have written your code
the next time you want to edit your stored procedure get it from your source control than your database

23048
mockito	jmock

i ve had good success using mockito
when i tried learning about jmock and easymock i found the learning curve to be a bit steep though maybe that s just me

23048
mockito	jmock
when i tried learning about jmock and easymock i found the learning curve to be a bit steep though maybe that s just me
i like mockito because of its simple and clean syntax that i was able to grasp pretty quickly
the minimal syntax is designed to support the common cases very well although the few times i needed to do something more complicated i found what i wanted was supported and easy to grasp

23137
post	get
from 1
in ruby this will be very bad performance wise with lots of post
a better way would be to retrieve the post read by the current user and then use activerecord calculations to get a count without retrieving all the post in the database this should go into your post model to follow best practices of not having finders in the view or controller post.rb then your view will just be

23335
lisp	smalltalk
also objective is smalltalk
in functional school we would have nearly functional some considered them to be impure lisp family and ml family and many purely functional haskell erlang etc
by the way there are many general languages such as perl python ruby

23557
hash	salt
now both of our password hashes are the same
so if i see the stored hash codes i will know your password is the same as mine jeff
so we can add a salt string to the password

23693
put	get
this example also shows range creation and the list reduction meta-operator combined with the numeric infix multiplication operator
it also shows that you can put in the signature instead of returns uint after it
you can get away with starting the range with 2 as the multiply operator will return 1 when called without any arguments

23702
versioning	upgrade
it would be pretty easy to write a script that would tag both repositories with the same id each time you upgrade the library and used it in the project
then if you need to roll back to a previous versioning you just see what its most recent tag was and roll the library back to that versioning
update sorry i ve been in mercurial land for a while and forgot that subversion doesn t directly support tagging

23804
versioning	upgrade
you see some versions of mysql had different commands that were used in various versions
so what compatibility mode allows you to do is take a database and export the sql to be compatible with another versioning of mysql
thus you may want to upgrade your mysql 3 server to 4 - this compatibility mode allows for the export your database or individual tables to create a sql file that can import into a mysql 4 versioning server should work in 5 also

23960
put	get
if you have something like fxcop available to you run it do what it says or have a darn good reason why you aren t
then we can look at how the code is put together how it functions and things that we can do to improve upon it
in this way you get a different perspective on how to solve a problem and why someone thinks that way

23997
des	aes
they can be m n m bit input n bit output. for example in the aes s-box the number of bits in input is equal to the number of bits in output
in des m 6 and n 4
the input is expanded from 32 to 48 bits in the first stages of des

24269
pascal	delphi
i spent six years in delphi and loved it to bits
the main strength for me of c# over object pascal is the syntax - it s much cleaner
there are some really great new features in c# 3 dotnet 3.5 - checkout linq

24308
inherited	properties
you can t really argue against those properties - there is no trade-off made and it is always a cleaner way to modulize things
other aspects of oop including inherited and polymorphism are important too but as others have alluded to those are commonly over used
ie sometimes people use inherited and or polymorphism because they can not because they should have

24446
int	chars

ensure you don t use incremting int for session ids
much better to use a guid or some other long randomly generated chars string

24476
goto	break
exiting nested loops if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks
low-level performance improvements this is only valid in perf-critical code but goto statements execute very quickly and can give you a boost when moving through a function
this is a double-edged sword however because a compiler typically cannot optimize code that contains gotos

24884
for-loop	loops

there is a compiler switch which enables c99 mode which amongst other things allows declaration of a variable inside the for-loop
to turn it on use the compiler switch or as oysterd says declare the variable outside loops

24908
strdup	malloc
suppose you have a strdup function that duplicates a string and you call it like this you can see that the program works but you have allocated memory via malloc without freeing it up
you have lost your pointer to the first memory block when you called strdup the second time
this is no big deal for this small amount of memory but consider the case you have now used up 11 gig of memory possibly more depending on your memory manager and if you have not crashed your process is probably running pretty slowly

25105
freebsd	linux

noting the lack of bsds here i figured i d chip in the design and implementation of the freebsd operating system dead-tree book unix and bsd courses courses and videos freebsd architecture handbook online book i haven t taken any of the courses myself but i ve heard marshall kirk mckusick speak on other occasions and he is really good at what he does
and of course the bsd man pages which are an excellent resource as they are maintained to a far greater extent than your average linux man-page

26068
apache	lighttpd
you may not want to server all files using apache and use lighttpd lighty to server static files
apache can do this
multiple sites on same server virtual server hosting on apache

26315
vbscript	vb6
1 you can use com components developed in vb6 or the like to separate some of your business logic from your ui
2 you can create classes in vbscript
there is no concept of inheritance and other more advanced features are missing from the implementation but you can encapsulate logic in classes that helps reduce the spagehtti-ness of your app

26350
lisp	scheme
both provide a very simple and intuitive introduction to both scheme and functional programming that proves far simpler for new students or hobbyists than any of the typical volumes that rub off like a nonfiction rendition of war peace
once they ve moved beyond the schemer series sicp and on lisp are both fantastic choices


26597
put	get
if you are really worried about performance don t use .htaccess files those are slow
put all your rewrite rules in your apache config which is only read once on startup
.htaccess files get re-parsed on every request along with every .htaccess file in parent folders

26682
profiling	instrumentation

my only experience profiling c++ code is with aqtime by automatedqa now smartbear software
it has several types of profilers built in performance memory windows handles exception tracing static analysis etc. and instrumentation the code to get the results

26942
swt	swing
combined with the free nsis installer you can build a nice package for your windows users
edit did not see that you use swt
don t know if it works with swt as well because i used only swing in my apps

27051
ubuntu	debian
however you must make locale files for en_nz
for ubuntu edit var lib locales supported.d local and add en_nz iso-8859-1 to the file
if your system is another distribution including debian the location will be different

27256
jquery	scriptaculous
to put some names out there prototype scriptaculous jquery dojo yui ...those all seem to have active users and contributers so they are probably worth reading up on to see if they meet your needs
jquery is good but with a little extra effort maybe you ll find that something else works better for you
good luck

27281
post	get
it would look like this then to get the selected key you could do or if you are using xhtml then you can create a custom namespace
since you say the keys can repeat using the value attribute is probably not an option since then you wouldn t be able to tell which of the different options with the same value was selected on the form post


27340
post	get

should i added variables to the query string or post the data i need to send
i d like to come up with a solution that would prevent a person with basic computer skills from accidentally or intentionally accessing the page directly considering the callback is buried in the client code it would take someone with equal determination to get either the querystring or the post request

27429
put	get

create a prototype instanace of each class and put them in a hashtable inside the factory with the string you expect in the xml as the key
so createtask just finds the right prototype object by get ing from the hashtable

27440
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
mysql is much more commonly provided by web hosts
postgresql is a much more mature product
there s this discussion addressing your better question apparently according to this web page mysql is fast when concurrent access levels are low and when there are many more reads than writes

27450
client-side	server-side

in that case yes the third line is the simplest you can get at client-side
in addition you can serve out additional server-side objects from the myserverobject instance if you include public accessors for them in iremoteserver interface so accessing those objects become the simple matter of method calls or property accesses on your main server object so you don t have to use activator for every single thing

29748
apache	lighttpd
what you do is that you start your django fastcgi server in a separate process and then configures apache via rewrites to call this process when needed
or you can serve django without using apache but with another server that supports fastcgi natively the documentation mentions that you can do this if you don t have any apache specific needs
i guess the reason must be to save memory. lighttpd this is the server that runs youtube

29770
vim	emacs

in the meantime i ve tried it two tools that have some sort of integration with vim
the first is rope a python refactoring library that comes with a vim and emacs plug-in

29801
post	put
prior to using hibernate or other orms when i would do sql directly in jdbc or odbc i would put all the sql statements as either public fields of an object with a naming convention or in a property file also with a naming convention for the values say prep_stmt_xxxx
and use either reflection or iterate over the values at startup in a test cases b startup of the application some rdbms allow you to pre-compile with prepared statements before execution so on startup post login i would pre-compile the prep-stmts at startup to make the application self testing
even for 100 s of statements on a good rdbms thats only a few seconds

29801
versioning	upgrade
different name
anyway i came in in versioning 2..
it was costing a lot of money to do upgrade

29900
bazaar	git

i d look at either mercurial or bazaar
i m told git also works on windows but i suspect the windows port is still a second class port at best

29923
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it
most of the people were reluctant to move over as they have to type in two commands to commit and push bazaar ci + bazaar push
also it was difficult for them to understand the concept of branches and merging no one uses branches or merges them in svn

29972
cruisecontrol	teamcity
teamcity makes it easy to setup the ci server part and nant build script makes it easy to do a number of tasks as far as report generation is concerned
here is an article i wrote about using ci with cruisecontrol.net it has a nant build script in the comments that can be re-used across projects continuous integration with cruisecontrol

firefox	safari
here s the relevant documentation for gears workerpool api whatwg has a draft recommendation for worker threads web workers and there s also mozilla s dom worker threads update june 2009 current state of browser support for javascript threads firefox 3.5 has web workers
some demos of web workers if you want to see them in action simulated annealing try it link space invaders link at end of post moonbat javascript benchmark first link the gears plugin can also be installed in firefox
safari 4 and the webkit nightlies have worker threads javascript ray tracer chrome has gears baked in so it can do threads although it requires a confirmation prompt from the user and it uses a different api to web workers although it will work in any browser with the gears plugin installed google gears workerpool demo not a good example as it runs too fast to test in chrome and firefox although ie runs it slow enough to see it blocking interaction ie8 and ie9 can only do threads with the gears plugin installed

30243
emacs	textmate
easy to set up and really customizable i use it for just about everything
there s also a lot of talk about emacs plugins if you re already using that normally
gedit how to set up like textmate

30598
subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends
in this way i am saying that foouser subclass is not an account but does act like an editable object
likewise baraccount extends from account but is not a user subclass but implements editable listable and also versionable
adding all of these apis for editable listable and versionable into the abstract-class itself would not only be cluttered and ugly but would either duplicate the common interfaces in account and user or force my user object to implement versionable probably just to throw an exception

30841
subtract	add
you cannot use this running total field in the page header too however because crystal will add the value in the first row on the page to it first so in your example it would show 9 rather than 4 at the top of page 2
to work around this create a formula field which subtract the current value of the value field from the running total #rtotal - tablename.value and put this formula field in your page header


31042
perforce	svn
i use perforce right now and for some reason i like svn better
perforce definitely gives me a better indication that there s going to be merge conflicts and even has built-in tools to help me resolve the merges
it has the same problem where if someone makes tons of changes over a long time the merge will be more difficult

31288
accessor	properties
cocoa s collection classes which all have mutable an immutable variants are nsarray ordered can contain an object multiple times nsdictionary unordered mapping from keys to values keys are copied nsset unordered can contain an object only once nscountedset unordered can contain an object multiple times the immutable variants help a lot with efficiency
the standard pattern for accessor of classes that have mutable variants is to copy rather than retain
this is codified in the properties mechanism by using the copy attribute on the properties this means that if you pass a mutable array to something that takes an array it will be copied and if you pass that to something else it will be copied again

31574
spaces	delimiter

note single quotes even no quotes if the value doesn t contain a spaces is valid according to the w3c html spec
quote by default sgml requires that all attribute values be delimiter using either double quotation marks ascii decimal 34 or single quotation marks ascii decimal 39 .

32062
public	protected
fwiw i ve never seen anyone use protected class inheritance and if i remember correctly i think stroustrup even considered the protected level to be a mistake in c++
there s precious little you cannot do if you remove that protection level and only rely on public and private


32219
accessor	properties
my problem with this is that adding more logic later requires that you add blanket logic that applies to all properties accessed with the getter setter or that you use if or switch statements to evaluate which properties you re accessing so that you can apply specific logic
i like your solution and i applaud you for it--i m just not satisfied with the limitations that php has when it comes to implicit accessor methods


32477
cpu	processors
this class has methods to set processoraffinity or even set a preferred processors -- not sure what that is
disclaimer i ve experienced a similar problem where i thought the cpu s were under utilized and researched a lot of this stuff
however based on all that i read it appeared that is wasn t a very good idea as evidenced by the comments posted here as well

32521
prng	random

there is a half-way house here which has some use which is to seed your prng with a constant
that allows you to generate random data which is repeatable

32572
put	get
this gets you comfortable with the make-up of the object and helps you get intimately knowledgeable about how it ll look from various positions
that may not apply directly to what you re doing but it should give you an indicator as to the amount of discipline that may be involved in getting to the point you seek. definitely put together a library of stuff that you can look to for inspiration
value physical media that you can flip through over websites

32775
gmail	hotmail
if hotmail server goes down gmail server wiil try to resend the message it will depend on server software configuration
if the process terminates ok then ok if not gmail server will notify you that he wasn t able to deliver the message


32865
inherited	properties
if your using a web site project no project file then start by checking that both your page and your control both set the classname properties in the first line of your aspx ascx file and that you specify the full name of the class including the namespace
example control language vb autoeventwireup false classname yourprojectname.yourusercontrol inherited yourprojectname.yourusercontrol codefile yourusercontrol.ascx.vb many times not setting all of these will still work but you will get odd compiler errors and behavior in vs
if you using a web site application project try deleting the designer file manually and then right click on your project and choose convert from web application. this will should recreate the designer file for you

33010
equals	compareto
it s generally a bad choice when equals can be overridden because that breaks the symmetry property
option #2 allows the class to be safely extended without overriding equals or breaking symmetry
if your class is also comparable the equals and compareto methods should be consistent too

33010
equals	compareto
if your class is also comparable the equals and compareto methods should be consistent too
here s a template for the equals method in a comparable class


33180
public	protected
c++ allowed all three kinds
public inheritance implied an is-a type of relationship and private inheritance implied a is-implemented-in-terms-of kind of relationship
since layering or composition accomplished this in an arguably simpler fashion private inheritance was only used when absolutely required by protected members or virtual functions required it - according to scott meyers in effective c++ item 42

33503
put	get

my cdrecord method did support dvd burning i just looked over the code and boy did i forget how much time and effort i put into that class
cdrecord has no problem burning just about any type of media you throw at it but since it is a stand alone application i had to do a lot of parsing to get useful information

33507
put	get
the difference is that i had the cache do the cloning
when you put an object into the cache the cache will clone the object first and store the cloned version so you can mutate the original object without poisoning the cache
when you get an object from the cache the cache returns a clone of the object instead of the stored object again so that the caller can mutate the object without effecting the cached canonical object

33570
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

i d warn again doing a double for-loop to pull out each datacell s data and writing out individually to an excel cell
instead use a 2d object arrays and loops through your datagrid saving all your data there

34338
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest also ships with a very simple html gui which is quite easy to extend if you want to
as far as i know phpunit does not include a html gui but there are gui s available to download such as cool


34645
inherited	properties
there are two kinds of limits soft limits are simply the currently enforced limits hard limits mark the maximum value which cannot be exceeded by setting a soft limit soft limits could be set by any user while hard limits are changeable only by root. limits are a properties of a process
they are inherited when a child process is created so system-wide limits should be set during the system initialization in init scripts and user limits should be set during user login for example by using pam_limits
there are often defaults set when the machine boots

34681
hash	md5
the principle source of weakness in both of these designs is that the second property which i outlined above does not hold for these constructions
if an attacker can generate two messages m and m that both hash to the same value they can use these messages against you
sha-1 and md5 also suffer from message extension attacks which can fatally weaken your application if you re not careful

34681
hash	md5
sha-1 and md5 also suffer from message extension attacks which can fatally weaken your application if you re not careful
a more modern hash such as whirpool is a better choice
it does not suffer from these message extension attacks and uses the same mathematics as aes uses to prove security against a variety of attacks

34905
post	get
i sort of follow these basic rules
only do modifying sql actions such as insert update delete through post
never get

34969
next	except
all we re talking about is an expression whose value is a function
a simple example using scala for the next line is where the argument to the foreach method is an expression for an anonymous function
the above line is more or less the same as writing something like this not quite real code but you ll get the idea except that you don t need to bother with declaring the function somewhere else and having to look for it when you revisit the code later

35057
folder	directory
unlike in com gacutil copies the file to an opaque directory under systemroot assembly and that s where they run from
it wouldn t make sense to ask gacutil register a folder not that you can do that with regsvr32 either
you can use a batch for command such as if you place that in a batch file you must replace a with a

bazaar	git

i ve had the best luck with bazaar followed by mercurial
never could get git to work correctly

my favorite general less academic online tutorials the haskell wikibook which contains all of the excellent yet another haskell tutorial
this tutorial helps with specifics of setting up a haskell distro and running example programs for example. learn you a haskell for great good in the spirit of why s poignant guide to ruby but more to the point

35517
xsl-fo	xslt

as you are sure about needing to represent the presentational side of things it may be worth looking at the xsl-fo w3c recommendation
this is a full-blown page description language and the deeply unfashionable other half of the better-known xslt

35605
filesystems	ntfs
there is no unix and windows file systems
the nix family of filesystems include ext3 zfs ufs etc
windows primarily has had support for fat16 32 and their own filesystem ntfs

35627
filesystems	ntfs

i m not at all familiar with the inner workings of the unix filesystems as in how the bits and bytes are stored but really that part is interchangeable ext3 reiserfs etc
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

35710
client-side	server-side

you should do as much client-side processing as possible
this will enable your application to scale better than doing processing server-side

35770
xfce	gnome	xfce	gnome
it s also important to make the distinction between gnome libraries and gtk and likewise kde libraries and qt
if you write the code to use gtk or qt it should work fine for users of any desktop environment including less popular ones like xfce
if you use other gnome or kde-specific libraries to do non-widget-related tasks your app would be less portable between desktop environments

35967
apache	lighttpd
if you have spare physical resources and have the technical skills and experience to maintain production machines running different operating systems i d recommend going running lighttpd on either linux or freebsd
a light os install with a static file optimized server will perform faster than apache or iis on a heavy os
however unless you are extremely comfortable with these solutions just stick to iis on windows

36615
direct3d	gdi

i think you can still use all of the normal direct3d tools but you won t be able to render to a surface associated with the screen
you ll have to render to a dib or some such and blt it with gdi to a normal window hdc

37046
put	get
the threads are only allowed to return from o.wait one-by-one but they each will get their turn
simply put it depends on why your threads are waiting to be notified
in some cases all waiting threads can take useful action once the wait finishes

37364
post	get

regrading the preserve transparency then yes like stated in other post imagesavealpha have to be set to true to use the alpha flag imagealphablending must be set to false else it doesn t work
also i spotted two minor things in your code you don t need to call getimagesize to get the width height for imagecopyresmapled the and should be -1 the value since the cordinates starts at 0 and not 1 so it would copy them into an empty pixel

37407
public	protected

generally if something is not deliberately conceived as public i make it private
if a situation arises where i need access to that private variable or method from a derived class i change it from private to protected

37408
daemons	systemd
the use of a unix-domain socket means that the erlang daemons could be launchd on-demand by launchd and the cocoa front-end could find the path to the socket to use via an environment variable
that makes the rendezvous between the app and the daemons trivial and it also makes it straightforward to develop multiple front-ends or possibly a framework that wraps communication with the daemons
the mac os x launchd systemd is really cool this way

37410
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux

i am writing this on a centrino 1.5ghz 512mb ram running ubuntu
it s debian based and is the first linux distro i have tried that actually worked with my laptop on first install

37606
queue	fifo
some reasons why msmq doesn t work when you need to change the logic of the queue to not fifo but something like the oldest red message or the oldest blue message you can t do it
i know what people will say you can do it by having a red queue and a blue queue
it adds a point of failure and deployment nightmare the queue is a point of failure and you need to deal with setting the right permissions on all boxes to read write messages etc in enterprise software you pay in blood for these type of things

37660
postgresql	mysql
i use postgresql and my answer works correctly there i tried it
see the postgresql update docs under parameters expression where it mentions that expressions on the right hand side of set clauses explicitly use the old values of columns
i see that the corresponding mysql update docs contain the statement single-table update assignments are generally evaluated from left to right which implies the behaviour you describe

37716
hash	md5
random bit strings are obtained by taking a md5 hash of the contents of this pool
the one-way hash function distills the true random bits from pool data and hides the state of the pool from adversaries
the dev random routine maintains an estimate of true randomness in the pool and decreases it every time random strings are requested for use

37724
postgresql	mysql
mysql select concat field1 field2 from table
postgresql select field1 || || field2 from table


37854
postgresql	mysql
if you trace microsoft sql server back to its roots i think you ll find ingres - one of the very first relational databases written in the 70s
and postgresql was originally written by some of the same people in the 80s as a successor to ingres
oracle goes way back and i m not sure where mysql came in

38350
ubuntu	linux
i d like a response from a linux user preferably developer who has experience with coming up with similar looking fonts
i really don t want to have to give ubuntu firefox users any sans-serif

post	get

gregg miskely has a blog post on this
you might get it to work if both local accounts have the same user name and password

google-chrome	firefox
but the new internet explorer 8 beta 2 and the just announced google-chrome browser are heading in that direction so i suppose firefox will be heading there too
here is a post google-chrome process manager by john resig from mozilla and jquery fame on the subject


39034
implements	extends
the idea is that anyone can extends behavior without the need to know the behind the scenes stuff
a lot of frameworks rely on this behavioral pattern asp.net where you have to implements the hooks in a page or a user controls such as the generated page_load method which is called by the load event the template method calls the hooks behind the scenes
there are a lot more examples of this

39786
cvs	svn

both subversion and cvs call them keywords
have a look in the svn manual here scroll down to svn keywords or here for cvs

39963
hash	salt	hash	md5

.httpasswd files are just text files with a specific format depending on the hash function specified
if you are using md5 they look like this that s the login a colon apr1 the salt and 1000 times md5 encoded as base64

39963
hash	salt	hash	md5	hash	md5
if you are using md5 they look like this that s the login a colon apr1 the salt and 1000 times md5 encoded as base64
if you select sha1 they look like this that s the login a colon the string sha and the sha1 hash encoded with base64
if your language has an implementation of either md5 or sha1 and base64 you can just create the file like this here s more information on the format

put	get
i would start by applying the principles of mvc to any new code that you are able to work on ie
move business logic to something akin to a model put all your layout view code in one place as you gain experience with new code in mvc you can start seeing opportunities to change the existing code subtly so that it also falls in line
it can be a very slow process but if you can show the benefits of this way of doing it then you will be able to convince others and get the entire team on board

40336
cpu	processors

to answer your question as stated would require digging into the instruction timings of the particular cpu that this code will be running on which therefore require me to make a bunch of assumptions around the state of the caches in the system and the assembly code emitted by the compiler
it would be an interesting and useful exercise from the perspective of understanding how your processors of choice actually works but in the real world the difference will be negligible

40699
google-chrome	firefox

google-chrome does support the netscape plugin api but that is for displaying certain kinds of content
you seem to be after a extention api really firefox is the only major browser to encourage and support third party extentions to browsing capability that aren t simply new toolbars nothing in the developer documentation points to a browser enhancing api - google seem to want to keep a tight reign on the look and feel of the application

40708
button	checkbox
keep send source of current page and send screenshot of current page checkbox selected
click the send report button to report a google chrome bug
i don t see any reference to public bug tracking.

40828
post	get
i was able to get past the exceptions however although probably not in a way that will work will great for you
but here s what i found this mailing list post had a discussion of what looks to be the same issue you are experiencing
from there i added a couple dummy classes in the main program.cs file and then added the using lines into timedefparser.cs and timedeflexer.cs with that the exceptions would bubble into the fake exception classes and could be handled there but there was still an exception being thrown in the mtokens method in timedeflexer.cs

41357
ienumerable	ilist
i imagine that for ilist implementations count simply reads the number of elements directly while any has to query the ienumerable.getenumerator method create an instance and call movenext at least once
edit matt i can only assume that the count extension method for ienumerable is doing something like this yes of course it does
this is what i meant

41521
button	checkbox
one is the usual click button and the other is a toggle button that acts similar to a checkbox
the default property of the commandbutton is actually the value property that indicates whether a button is toggled
by setting the property the click event is generated

41932
google-chrome	firefox
see for example - v8 tracemonkey squirrelfish ie8 benchmarks .
needless to say google-chrome s v8 blows away all the current builds of the next-generation of javascript vms
just to be clear webkit and firefox engines haven t even hit beta but it looks like the performance bar has just been set to an astronomical height by the v8 team.

42047
metaphone	soundex
as noted soundex was developed in the 19th century for american names
metaphone will give you some results when checking the work of poor spellers who are sounding it out and spelling phonetically
edit distance is good at catching typos such as repeated letters transposed letters or hitting the wrong key

42912
google-chrome	firefox

google-chrome s approach is difficult to write and requires forethought from the developers
ie and firefox are both attempting to move to a process-per-tab model but due to backwards compatibility are not able to transition quickly

42912
google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox are both attempting to move to a process-per-tab model but due to backwards compatibility are not able to transition quickly
google-chrome being an entirely new browser build on a clean rendering engine webkit was easier to write in this way


43213
matlab	s-function	matlab	simulink
i don t think it can be done using existing simulink blocks
i think i am going to have to take the xpcserial c code that comes with matlab take the code that sets the rs-232 speed and wrap it in my own s-function


43300
for-loop	arrays

i would use unsafe code and run the for-loop comparing int32 pointers
maybe you should also consider checking the arrays to be non-null

44289
cvs	svn	cvs	svn
merging and branching are very different and if you branch and merge frequently unless you have svn 1.5 running on your server have to know when you branched this isn t very clear in the tortoise svn dialogs
michael says the branching and merging is intuitive i would argue that after using cvs for 10 years it is not
if your are running the svn server on linux it may be hard to get your sa to move to svn 1.5 as the default install 1.4.x

44303
equals	compareto
compareto ends up calling a compareinfo method that does a comparison using the current culture
equals is called by the operator
if you consider overloads then things get different

44357
sorting	filtering
wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise
finally if your data is typically noisy and you re getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output or even referenced just not differential and if you re averaging lots of observations into each data point try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains
there are a host of such outlier elimination tactics that can be really useful

44576
profiling	debugging

i choose to log deliberately as i go as this means the log data is meaningful depending on logging framework you can add level severity category information so that the log data can be filtered you can make sure that the right level of information is present not too much not too little you know when writing the code which the most important things are and can therefore ensure they are logged using some form of code injection profiling or tracing tool to generate logs would most likely generate verbose less useful logs that would be harder to dive into
they may be useful as a debugging aid however

45272
daemons	systemd
in that way the work which is being done does not block the acceptance of more requests
as you point out the term load balancing carries the implication of multiple servers - what you want to look for is information about how to write a linux network daemons
the two kes systemd calls you ll want to look at are called fork and exec

45421
ogre	irrlicht
recently irrlicht has acquired official .net bindings allowing users to develop in .net languages such as vb.net c# and boo
there is also ogre 3d and also axiom engine


46015
post	put
the uri that the post request is sent to should not be the uri for the resource being modified
you should either post to a collection resource that adds a newly created resource each time with the uri for the new resource in the location header and a 202 status code or post to an updater resource that updates a resource with a supplied uri in the request s content or custom header
if you re using an xmlhttprequest object you can set the method to put and submit the data to the resource s uri

46102
move	drag
all you then have to do is drag and drop the file from one folder to the where you want it
it ll ask you to add a commit message and it defaults it to move file folder remotely


46290
versioning	upgrade
it s the namespace alias qualifier extern alias youraliashere
you can use it to load multiple versioning of the same type
this can be useful in maintenance or upgrade scenarios where you have an updated version of your type that won t work in some old code but you need to upgrade it to the new version

46614
post	get

use post for destructive actions such as creation i m aware of the irony editing and deletion because you can t hit a post action in the address bar of your browser
use get when it s safe to allow a person to call an action

46639
post	put	post	get
a restful app will use puts for operations which are not safe but idempotent
i know the question was about get and post but i ll return to post in a second
typically a put is used for editing a resource editing a question or an answer on stack overflow for example

46639
post	put	post	put
typically a put is used for editing a resource editing a question or an answer on stack overflow for example
a post would be used for any operation which is neither safe or idempotent
typically a post would be used to create a new resource for example creating a new so question though in some designs a put would be used for this also

46639
post	put	post	get
typically a post would be used to create a new resource for example creating a new so question though in some designs a put would be used for this also
if you run the post twice you would end up creating two new questions
there s also a delete operation but i m guessing i can leave that there discussion in practical terms modern web browsers typically only support get and post reliably you can perform all of these operations via javascript calls but in terms of entering data in forms and pressing submit you ve generally got the two options

46639

in a restful application the post will often be overriden to provide the put and delete calls also
but even if you are not following restful principles it can be useful to think in terms of using get for retrieving viewing information and post for creating editing information

46971
phpunit	simpletest
there is a command line test runner and web-based test runner and there is even an eclipse plugin to let you run unit tests from the ide itself
i found the zend to phpunit connection much harder to get working especially with the debugger
the way we use simpletest in-house is with a continuous integration script that we wrote ourselves

47273
put	get

it s really late and i only spent about 10 minutes on this so its extremely sloppy however it does work and will give you a good jumping off point i put these classes in an assembly to test it and it generated the following sql create table fakedataclass id bigint anint bigint astring nvarchar 255 afloat float afkreference bigint create table fkclass id bigint afkint bigint go alter table fakedataclass with nocheck add constraint fk_afkreference foreign key afkreference references fkclass id go some further thoughts...i d consider adding an attribute such as sqltable to your classes that way it only generates tables for the classes you want
also this can be cleaned up a ton bugs fixed optimized the fk checker is a joke etc etc...just to get you started

47472
goto	break

i can only recall using a goto once
i had a series of five nested counted loops and i needed to be able to break out of the entire structure from the inside early based on certain conditions i could just have easily declared a boolean break variable and used it as part of the conditional for each loop but in this instance i decided a goto was just as practical and just as readable

47735
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
different browsers implement this differently since it is not a common status code
alas unlike the opera and firefox developers the ie developers have never read the spec and even the latest most secure ie7 will redirect the post request from domain a to domain b without any warnings or confirmation dialogs
safari also acts in an interesting manner while it does not raise a confirmation dialog and performs the redirect it throws away the post data effectively changing 307 redirect into the more common 302

47909
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
also the tcp header contains a lot of overhead intended for different signals and message delivery detection
for a message exchange udp will probably suffice if a small chance of failure is acceptable
if receipt must be verified tcp is your best option

47929
udp	tcp
for more information i recommend the simple but very comprehensible skullbox explanation tcp vs
udp


48001
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
another wrinkle in subclassing naming is multiple-level hierarchies
... rather than blindly prepend the modifiers to the immediate superclass think about the name from the reader s perspective
use that superclass as the basis for the subclassing name. interface two styles of naming interfaces depend on how you are thinking of the interfaces

48050
post	get
for one any links in them are quite likely to have rel nofollow attributes so seeing that within a block might imply that it s a comment
the main interesting thing to look for would be changes in the structure of post for m the same site
for example there s also a very good chance that each comment will have its own anchor so people can link directly to it so you could look at the differing numbers of a name xxx tags in a given page on the same site to get an idea of the relative numbers of comments

48074
profiling	debugging

unless you really need high performance on multiple embedded platforms don t change how you code for performance reasons until you profiling
code that s written awkwardly to optimize for performance is hard to debugging and hard to maintain

48074
profiling	debugging
code that s written awkwardly to optimize for performance is hard to debugging and hard to maintain
write a test case and profiling it on your target
once you know the actual cost of modulus then decide if the alternate solution is worth coding

48093
division	modulo
all the assembly language i have seen x86 68000 implement the modulo using a division
actually the division assembly operation returns the result of the division and the remaining in two different registers


48103
division	subtract	division	modulo	division	modulo
processors with multipliers have interesting division routines using the multiplier but you can get from division result to modulo with just another two steps multiply and subtract so it s still comparable
if the processor has a built in division routine you ll likely see it also provides the remainder
still there is a small branch of number theory devoted to modular arithmetic which requires study if you really want to understand how to optimize a modulo

48228
post	get
you can submit form on the web page from you program by sending post get request to a website
typical login form looks like you can send a post request to the website providing values for username password fields
what happens after you send your request is largely depends on a website usually you will be redirected to some page

49151
post	get
... messagebox.show hello world
also as per this other stack post in visual studio expand the project in solution tree right click on references add reference select system.windows.forms on framework tab
this will get the messagebox working in conjunction with the using system.windows.forms reference from above

49256
des	aes
it has been analyzed extensively and is now used worldwide as was the case with its predecessor the data encryption standard des .
so as a rule of thumb you are not supposed to use des or its variants because it is being phased out
as of now it is better to use aes

49290
implements	extends
here is a summary of what he says existing classes can be easily retrofitted to implements a new interface
all you need to do is implements the interface and add the required methods
existing classes cannot be retrofitted easily to extends a new abstract class

50220
mouse	keyboard

for the mouse you can use gpm
i m not sure off the top of my head for keyboard or joystick

50435
hide	show

someone else said this somewhere on here a few days ago and i concur - use javascript to simply hide the button instead of disabling it
you could show a spinner image in its place which lets the user know what is going on

50459
vb.net	vb6
but the array is still 0-indexed like c# or c++ instead of 1-indexed like vb6
that means that if you move to vb.net from a different language your array instincts are probably wrong no matter which language it is
in vb.net dim arr 3 3 as integer actually creates a 4x4 array

50590
pop-up	dialog

one way to handle this would be to use the context menu s pop-up event to grab the selected index of the combobox launching the menu
when the dialog form closes reset the selected index

50809
post	get
a side-effect might be updating the state of a web application or it might be charging your credit card
if an action has side-effects another method post should be used instead
so a user or their browser shouldn t be held accountable for something done by a get

50846
google-chrome	safari

there are a number of known incompatibilities between tinymce and webkit the rendering engine used by google-chrome
if you re using tinymce 2.x you might want to try the safari plug-in to tinymce

51063
post	get
you ll need the process id which you can get from task manager by adding the pid column to the processes tab display
once you have that run the following commands you can then either inspect that dump using windbg and sos or if you can post the dump somewhere i d be happy to take a look at it
in any case you ll want to likely take two dumps about a minute apart

51196
ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist
you may want to consider just returning an iqueryable customer instead of an ilist customer from your data-access method
since iqueryable t inherits from ienumerable t the rest of your app should be able to deal with it quite well
you can also convert it to a list when you really need to

51240
lxml	beautifulsoup

i ll always use lxml for such tasks
you could use beautifulsoup as well

51410
awt	swing

1 awt made for horrid uis
swing improved on that but it was too late because.

51511
disk	ram
this should only be a big problem if you have a very popular application
both database and filesystem session stores are usually backed by disk so you can have a lot of sessions cheaply because disk are cheap but requests will often have to wait for the data to be read because disk are slow
memcached sessions use ram so will cost more to support the same number of concurrent sessions because ram is expensive but may be faster because ram is fast

51753
outputstream	inputstream
so you have inputstream in
outputstream out
ioutils.copy in out

52255
vb6	vba

i don t have a copy of vb6 to hand but i think you need the typename function.
i can see it in excel vba so it s probably in the same runtime

52266
int	chars
chars s
unsigned int kc
int quit 0

52266
mouse	keyboard	switching	screens
one more point you can grab the pointer as well and other resources
if you had one controller running on the box in front of which you sit you could use keyboard and mouse input to switching it between open sockets with different renderers
you shouldn t need to resize the output window to less than full screens anymore with this approach ever

52565
boost	stl
really c++ templates are the enabling technology for stl and much of boost and c doesn t have them
i ve seen many c-interface libraries for things like image processing 3d graphics networking etc. but never a real general-purpose library like boost
you can find pieces though - threading libraries string libraries etc

52633
width	margin
your problem is that the 100 width does not include any padding or margin values
these values are added on top of the 100 width thus the overflow


52896
width	margin	width	margin
the correct box model states that the width applies only to the content and padding and margin add on to it
so therefore your are getting 100 plus a 20px right and left padding equaling 100 +40px as the total width
the original ie box model also known as quirks mode includes padding and margin in the width

52896
width	margin
the original ie box model also known as quirks mode includes padding and margin in the width
so the width of your content would be 100 - 40px in this case
this is why you see two different behaviors

53056
equals	gethashcode
if it isn t say all your arrays are equally long you can go with something cheap like looking at the first and last value and xoring their values and then add more complexity as you see fit for your data
a quick way to see how your hashfunction performs on your data is to add all the data to a hashtable and count the number of times the equals function gets called if it is too often you have more work to do on the function
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for trivia the worst performance i have ever seen was when someone by mistake returned a constant from gethashcode easy to spot with a debugger though especially if you do lots of lookups in your hashtable

53125
folder	directory

to me adding a symlink pointing to your development folder seems like a tidy solution to the problem
if the main project is on a different machine webserver you could use something like sshfs to mount your development directory into the right place on the webserver

53210
hide	show
at the very least you have to compensate for too fast frame rates unlike 80 s games running in the 90 s way too fast your main loop should be parameterized by the timestep anyhow and as long as it s not too long a decent integrator like rk4 should handle the physics smoothly some types of animation keyframed sprites could be a pain to parameterize
network code will need to be smart as well to avoid players with faster machines from shooting too many bullets for example but this kind of throttling will need to be done for latency compensation anyhow the animation parameterization would help hide network lag too the timing code will need to be modified for each platform but it s a small localized change though some systems make extremely accurate timing difficult windows mac linux seem ok variable frame rates allow for maximum performance
fixed frame rates allow for consistent performance but will never reach max on all systems that s seems to be a show stopper for any serious game if you are writing a networked 3d game where performance matters i d have to say bite the bullet and implement variable frame rates

53937
lisp	scheme
in emacs lisp and common lisp you have the position function in scheme here s a tail recursive implementation from drscheme s doc but if you re using a list as a collection of slots to store structured data maybe you should have a look at defstruct or even some kind of lisp object system like clos
if you re learning lisp make sure you have a look at practical common lisp and or the little schemer
cheers

54046
datamapper	activerecord

sqlalchemy is more full-featured and powerful uses the datamapper pattern
django orm has a cleaner syntax and is easier to write for activerecord pattern

54596
public	protected

differences between a class and a struct in c++ are that structs have default public members and bases and classes have default private members and bases
both classes and structs can have a mixture of public protected and private members can use inheritance and can have member functions

54968
prepare	execute

from the documentation a prepare statement is a server-side object that can be used to optimize performance
when the prepare statement is execute the specifie statement is parsed rewritten and planned

55351
int	chars
filter all inputs to a white list of known good chars alnum basic punctuation and more importantly output filter data from your query results to neutralize html metacharacters to html entities quot lt gt etc
use long random hard-to-guess identifiers anywhere you re currently using simple int row ids in query parameters and make sure user x can t see user y s data just by guessing those identifiers
test every query handler in your application to ensure that they function only when a valid logged-on session cookie is presented

55509
folder	directory
assuming you have a client named client a directory named foo located at your project root and you wish to ignore all .dll files in that directory tree you can add the following lines to your workspace view to accomplish this - depot foo .dll client foo .dll - depot foo ... .dll client foo ... .dll the first line removes them from the directory foo and the second line removes them from all sub directory
now when you reconcile offline work... all the .dll files will be moved into excluded files folder at the bottom of the folder diff display
they will be out of your way but can still view and manipulate them if you really need to

55578
vmware	virtualbox	disk	ram
download the ie developer disk images which are free from microsoft extract the disk images using cabextract which is available from macports or as source code thanks to clinton
download q.app from and put it in your applications folder you will need it to convert the disk images into a format vmware virtualbox can use at this point the process depends on which vm software you re using
virtualbox users open a terminal.app on your mac you can find it in applications utilities and run the following sequence of commands replacing input.vhd with the name of the vhd file you re starting from and output.vdi with the name you want your final disk image to have applications q.app contents macos qemu-img convert -o raw -f vpc input.vhd temp.bin vboxmanage convertdd temp.bin output.vdi rm temp.bin mv output.vdi library virtualbox vdi vboxmanage modifyvdi output.vdi compact start virtualbox and create a new virtual machine select the new vdi file you ve just created as the boot hard disk vmware fusion users open a terminal.app on your mac you can find it in applications utilities and run the following commands replacing input.vhd and output.vmdk with the name of the vhd file you re working on and the name you want your resulting disk image to have applications q.app contents macos qemu-img convert -o vmdk -f vpc input.vhd output.vmdk mv output.vmdk documents virtual machines.localized this will probably take a while it takes around 30 minutes per disk image on my 2.4ghz core 2 duo macbook w 2gb ram

i m using gedit with various plugins for the development environment
and as of late 2010 i m making the push to use vim for development even over textmate on os x
a large amount of the rails developers are using gasp macs which has actually got me thinking in that direction

55927
hash	salt

is there really need to save the hash password into the file
can t you just use the password or hash password with some salt and then encrypt the file with it

56413
put	get
however what you can do in java and presumably c++0x is have an interface instead of a enum class
then put you standard values in an enum that implements the feature
obviously you don t get to use java.util.enumset and the like

56486
next	except
if your constantly locking the same resource each frame you could also try creating a pool of textures kinda like triple-buffering except with textures
you would let the render use one texture and on the next update you pick the next available texture in the pool that s not being used in to render
unless of course your memory constrained or your only making diffs to the animated texture

56902
implements	extends
your petbase abstract class may implements ipet pets have owners and idigestion pets eat or at least they should
however petbase will probably not implements imammal since not all pets are mammals and not all mammals are pets
you may add a mammalpetbase that extends petbase and add imammal

57099
folder	directory
copying source-controlled directory into other source-controlled trees on the other hand is unsafe
if you will be overwriting any .svn folder you ll most probably be corrupting your target copies


57262
versioning	upgrade

i always use the most up-to-date versioning of the framework
this may be a small up-front burden on users but the app has a much longer life between upgrade

57668
goto	break

goto can be used as a continue but not the reverse
you can goto anywhere thus break flow control arbitrarily

57775
terminate	timeout
if the user hits enter after the timeout expires the worker thread will attempt to signal the event which throws an objectdisposedexception
the exception is thrown from the worker thread and if you haven t setup an unhandled exception handler your process will terminate


57806
goto	break	goto	break
but continue and break are enforced by the compiler and have their own associated rules
goto has no such limitations though the net effect might almost be the same in some circumstances
i do not consider continue or break to be harmful per se though i m sure either can be used poorly in a way that would make any sane programmer gag

57829
post	get
if it s working don t re-write it
if you have to go in to change add bits then refactor towards oo practices there are lots of post on so about refactoring when you are changing code anyway and not just for the sake of it
in practise if you haven t done a lot of oop then you ll want to start small and get a feel for it

58091
post	put

if every method is just a static call straight to the data source then the post class is really a factory
you could certainly put the static methods in post into the post class this is how csla works but they are still factory methods

i would say that a more modern and accurate name for the post class would be postfactory assuming that all it has is static methods
i guess i wouldn t say this is a procedural approach necessarily -- it s just a misleading name you would assume in the modern oo world that a post object would be stateful and provide methods to manipulate and manage a set of post objects

memcached	apc
both are in-memory caching solutions with dead-simple apis and lots of libraries
the trouble with those 2 is you need to install them on your web server or another server if it s memcached
apc pros simple fast speeds up php execution also cons doesn t work for distributed systems each machine stores its cache locally memcached pros fast ish can be installed on a separate server for all web servers to use highly tested developed at livejournal used by all the big guys facebook yahoo mozilla cons slower than apc possible network latency slightly more configuration i wouldn t recommend writing your own there are plenty out there

put	get	put	get
then there s an ie way to get the cursor position that also works in opera and an easier way in firefox
in ie the basic concept is to use the document.selection object and put some text into the selection
then using indexof you can get the position of the text you added

vmware	bootcamp
for me it runs vista vs2008 code rush just fine using bootcamp
i haven t run the vista partition in os x with vmware yet...i just haven t needed to with my work workflow
even so other vm images xp ubuntu etc run perfectly well with it

58785
robocopy	xcopy

robocopy robocopy or robust file copy is a command-line directory and or file replication command
robocopy functionally replaces xcopy with more options

59033
salt	md5
use a standard hashing algorithm sha-1 not md5
with a salt value so that rainbow attacks are impossible


59047
hash	salt	hash	md5
the salt prevents attackers from building a list of hash values for common passwords
md5 and sha1 are frequently used cryptographic hash functions
there is much more that you can read on the subject on that page

59051
hash	md5

there is truth in that if you hash something yes there will be collisions so it would be possible for two different passwords to unlock the same account
from a practical standpoint though that s a poor argument - a good hashing function md5 or sha1 would be fine can pretty much guarantee that for all meaningfully strings especially short ones there will be no collisions

59054
hash	salt
it s often better not to keep the data at all but to keep the hashed version so bad guys can t easily use it
as your co-worker suggests this can be trivially defeated by running the same hash algorithm against a dictionary and using rainbow tables to pull the info out
the usual solution is to use a secret salt plus additional user information to make the hashed results unique- something like as long as your salt is secret or your attacker doesn t know the precise creation date of the user s record a dictionary attack will fail- even in the event that they are able to pull down the password field

59132
junit	testng

there s a standalone junit runner that has a ui but i recommend using one of the builtin test runners in the java ides eclipse netbeans and intellij all have good ones
they all support junit and most support testng as well

59600
versioning	upgrade
another option would be to upgrade to a more resent versioning of delphi for .net and port your code to .net that way
once you get it working in delphi for .net which will be pretty easy except for the embedded db unless they have a .net versioning you can use .net reflector and file disassembler reverse the il to c#
you will still be using the vcl but you can use c# instead of object pascal

60077
children	parent

as far as i know a process doesn t have an explicit list of its children s pids but it can easily be built since a process should know which child processes it spawns
for example the unix fork call returns the child pid in the parent process and 0 in the child process createprocess on windows returns iirc the pid of the new process created

60119
cassini	iis

cassini does not support https
however you can use iis to do this if your using iis 5.1 download the ms iis toolpack for iis 6.0 it comes with a tool to create self signed ssl certificates

60400
vb.net	vb6
measures metrics for source code written in c++ c c# vb.net java delphi visual basic vb6 or html
includes method and function level metrics for c++ c c# vb.net java and delphi
saves metrics in checkpoints for comparison during software development projects

60496
prepare	execute
another benefit of using prepare statements is that if you execute the same statement many times in the same session it will only be parsed and compiled once giving you some speed gains
while you can still use prepare statements for the query parameters the structure of the dynamic query itself cannot be parametrized and certain query features cannot be parametrized
for these specific scenarios the best thing to do is use a whitelist filter that restricts the possible values

60531
folder	directory

the default folder is actually the same as the current working folder for the buffer it can be different for every file you work with
say that the file you are working with is located in c dir_a then the working directory for that buffer will by default be c dir_a

60759
hash	salt
if your hash algorithm includes the username replacing the password hash with another one will not work
unix stores hash in a a text file etc shadow which is accessible only to privileged users
passwords are encrypted with a salt

60815
postgresql	mysql
i know that postgresql sqlite mysql and oracle have the ability to order by a random function so you can use this in sqlalchemy from sqlalchemy.sql.expression import func select select.order_by func.random # for postgresql sqlite select.order_by func.rand # for mysql select.order_by dbms_random.value # for oracle next you need to limit the query by the number of records you need for example using .limit
bear in mind that at least in postgresql selecting random record has severe perfomance issues
here is good article about it

60864
salt	md5

i d go with 2 but use some salt
some pseudocode it is important to use a well known hash function such as md5 or sha-1 implemented in a library

61127
lisp	scheme

ditto lisp
or scheme even if you don t ever use it it s handy

61138
lisp	scheme
in terms of memory management unlike everything else i ve listed it s not garbage collected though that s now an option on mac os x 10.5 but it does have a reference counting scheme which makes life significantly simpler than managing memory by hand
lisp - i ve never learnt it myself beyond what i needed for minor emacs hacking
as i understand it the libraries were nice in their day but though the language remains supremely elegant they ve fallen a little behind the times

61196
inherited	properties
in the following example we create a class pet and define some properties
we also override the .tostring method inherited from object
after this we create a dog class which extends pet and overrides the .tostring method again changing it s behavior polymorphism

61651
post	get	post	get
off the top of my head the code would look like this untested note using prototype s method to get the selected item values
it returns an array for multiple-select boxes using ajax.request to send the data to the server as a post
to the server this looks exactly the same as just submitting a normal form using form.serialize to get the data out of the form and stick it in the request s body

62097

just because one tiny module does something slightly faster doesn t mean rewriting your app in another language is a good idea

possibility to run remote debugging sessions better compiler optimizations many bug fixes faster builds on multi-core multi-cpu systems improved ide user interface with many nice features improved macro support in the ide
dte allows access to more ide methods and variables updated mfc library in vs2008 service pack 1 support for openmp easy multithreading only in vs2008 pro. disadvantages of moving to visual studio 2008 the ide is a lot slower than vs6 intellisense still has performance issues replacing it with visualassistx can help side-by-side assemblies make app deployment much more problematic the local offline msdn library is extremely slow as mentioned here there s no profiling in the professional version in the spirit of joel s recent blog post i ve combined some of the other answers posted into a single answer and made this a community-owned post so i won t gain rep from it
i hope you don t mind

62684
getter	setter
depending on who s writing the code some people change the meaning of the getter setter methods
i ve seen variable initialization and other validation as part of getter methods
in order to test this sort of thing you d want unit tests covering that code explicitly

62848
g++	gcc
but i m pretty sure g++ v4 is the standard development c++ compiler if you install the c++ development environment at all
g++ v3 is usually just available as a special install
for opensuse 11 gcc 4.3 is the current package installed when you pick the base development pattern

63187
try-catch	exception-handling

if you are iterating through any kind of a result set and performing operations on said results for e.g within a for each and if one particular result caused a problem its rather useful in capturing an expected error via try-catch logging it and moving on to the next result via continue
continue is especially useful imo for unattended services that do jobs at odd hours and one exception-handling shouldn t affect the other x number of records

accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
for synthesized accessor just do this this tells the compiler to synthesize the foo properties using the_foo ivar
if you write your own accessor then you just use the underbar ivar in your implementation and keep the non-underbar method name


64422
cpu	processors
to do this count the number of cpun entries where n starts at 0 and increments
don t count the cpu line which is a combination of the cpun lines
in my example you can see cpu0 through cpu3 for a total of 4 processors

64422
cpu	processors	cpu	processors
in my example you can see cpu0 through cpu3 for a total of 4 processors
from now on you can ignore cpu0..cpu3 and focus only on the cpu line
next you need to know that the fourth number in these lines is a measure of idle time and thus the fourth number on the cpu line is the total idle time for all processors since boot time

64422
cpu	processors
do calculate that you need to read this file twice 1 second apart.then you can do a diff of the fourth value of the line
for example if you take a sample and get cpu 2330047 0 2365006 1063853632 9035 9463 96114 0 then one second later you get this sample cpu 2330047 0 2365007 1063854028 9035 9463 96114 0 subtract the two numbers and you get a diff of 396 which means that your cpu had been idle for 3.96 seconds out of the last 1.00 second
the trick of course is that you need to divide by the number of processors

64446
hash	md5

the easiest way would seem to be to hash each line on the way in storing the hash and the original data and then compare each new hash with your collection of existing hash
if you get a positive you could compare the actual data to make sure it s not a false positive - though this would be extremely rare you could go with a quicker hash algorithm like md5 or crc instead of something like sha which is slower but less likely to collide just so it s quick and then compare the actual data when you get a hit

65415
implements	extends
javascript uses prototype-based object orientation and provides the ability to extends types at runtime an object delegates all access to attributes that it doesn t contain itself to its prototype another object
this can be used to implements inheritance but is actually more powerful even if more cumbersome


65472
perforce	cvs
the caveat is that they re fairly new technology and not many people will be familiar with their use
if you want to stick to the older centralized model i d recommend perforce if you can afford it or subversion if you don t want to pay for perforce
i d recommend subversion over cvs because it s got enough features to make it worthwhile but is similar enough that devs who already know cvs will still be comfortable

children	parent
let s assume that the class node is the base class of the entire solution
if you need to only navigate down the tree then a node class needs a list of children
if you need to navigate up the tree then the node class needs a link to its parent node

66956
children	parent
if you need to navigate up the tree then the node class needs a link to its parent node
build an addchild method that takes care of all the minutia of these two points and any other business logic that must be implemented child limits sorting the children etc.

free	malloc	free	malloc
for example when overriding malloc new you can create a record of the caller s address the amount of bytes requested the assigned pointer value returned and a sequence id so all your records can be sequenced i do not know if you deal with threads but you need to take that into account too
when writing the free delete routines i also keep track of the caller s address and the pointer info
then i look backwards into the list and try to match the malloc new counterpart using the pointer as my key

70423
quicksort	heapsort

quicksort is the fastest sorting algorithm in practice but has a number of pathological cases that can make it perform as badly as o n2
heapsort is guaranteed to run in o n ln n and requires only finite additional storage

70428
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort	mergesort	in-place	heapsort	in-place

from the wikipedia entry on quicksort quicksort also competes with mergesort another recursive sort algorithm but with the benefit of worst-case θ nlogn running time. mergesort is a stable sort unlike quicksort and heapsort and can be easily adapted to operate on linked lists and very large lists stored on slow-to-access media such as disk storage or network attached storage. although quicksort can be written to operate on linked lists it will often suffer from poor pivot choices without random access
the main disadvantage of mergesort is that when operating on arrays it requires θ n auxiliary space in the best case whereas the variant of quicksort with in-place partitioning and tail recursion uses only θ logn space

70428
mergesort	in-place
the main disadvantage of mergesort is that when operating on arrays it requires θ n auxiliary space in the best case whereas the variant of quicksort with in-place partitioning and tail recursion uses only θ logn space
note that when operating on linked lists mergesort only requires a small constant amount of auxiliary storage.


70430
quicksort	mergesort

wikipedia s explanation is typically quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other θ nlogn algorithms because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures and in most real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the probability of requiring quadratic time
quicksort mergesort i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is ω n that quicksort implementations don t have

70739
equals	gethashcode

using the + operator might be better than using because although you explicitly want aa bb and bb aa to explicitly be the same you may not want aa aa and bb bb to be the same or all equals pairs for that matter
the as fast as possible rule is not entirely adhered to in this solution because in the case of nulls this performs a gethashcode on the empty string rather than immediately return a known constant but even without explicitly measuring i am willing to hazard a guess that the difference wouldn t be big enough to worry about unless you expect a lot of nulls

70741
subtract	addition
in the first loop you can use plain addition since you are only ever oring with single bits and you can narrow the scope of by iterating over indices
in the second loop you can subtract 1 from the index instead of producing an unnecessary 0th output list element that needs to be shift ed off and where you unnecessarily iterate m n times where m is the number of output lists and n is the number of unique elements iterating over the unique elements would reduce the iterations to just n which is a significant win in typical use cases where m is much larger than n and would simplify the code
note also that once thought of in this way the result gathering process can be written very concisely with the aid of the list part module but note that list_compare is a terrible name

versioning	upgrade
firstly the different versions of oracle you re using is the reason for the table statistics error - i had the same issue when some of our oracle 10g databases got upgrade to release 2 and some were still on release 1 and i was swapping .dmp files between them
the solution that worked for me was to use the same versioning of exp and imp tools to do the exporting and importing on the different database instances
this was easiest to do by using the same pc or oracle server to issue all of the exporting and importing commands

76789
innodb	myisam
you need to benchmark your own application myisam vs innodb
using the innodb transactional engine exclusively gives other benefits too
in my testing innodb will use up typically about 150 more disc space than myisam- this is because of its block structure and lack of index compression

76789
innodb	myisam
in my testing innodb will use up typically about 150 more disc space than myisam- this is because of its block structure and lack of index compression
if you can afford it just use innodb instead

these numbers turn into a 3x3 projection matrix

77625
innodb	myisam
i found that the table-level locking in myisam caused serious performance problems for our workload which sounds similar to yours
unfortunately i also found that performance under innodb was also worse than i d hoped
in the end i resolved the contention issue by fragmenting the data such that inserts went into a hot table and selects never queried the hot table

bazaar	git

mercurial and bazaar resemble themselves very much on the surface
they both provide basic distributed version control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git

77794
bazaar	git
git well is not for the uninitiated
it is much faster than both mercurial and bazaar and was written to manage the linux kernel
it is the fastest of the three and it is also the most powerful of the three by quite a margin

77943
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
git is fastest but all three are fast enough
bazaar is the most flexible it has transparent read-write support for svn repositories and cares a lot about the user experience
mercurial is somewhere in the middle

77945
quicksort	mergesort
with o n 2 worst case that rarely happens quicksort is potentially far slower than the o nlogn of the merge sort
quicksort has less overhead so with small n and slow computers it is better
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases

atoi	strtod	atof	strtod

atoi and atof will convert the number even if there are trailing non numerical characters
however if you use strtol and strtod it will not only skip leading white space and an optional sign but leave you with a pointer to the first character not in the number

78627
strtol	atoi
atoi and atof convert the initial part of the string but don t tell you whether or not they used all of the string
strtol strtod tell you whether there was extra junk after the characters converted
so in both cases remember to pass in a non-null tail parameter and check that it points to the end of the string that is tail 0

78920
xslt	xquery

advantages of xslt domain-specific to xml so for example no need to quote literal xml in the output
supports xpath xquery which can be a nice way to query doms in the same way that regular expressions can be a nice way to query strings

79488
jquery	scriptaculous

stack overflow uses jquery if that matters
scriptaculous tries pretty hard to do everything that you can do in flash

79771
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for example 0.72 is represented as the integer 72
addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as 0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiply followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

79916
put	get

simply put
it comes down to comparing the time left and productivity you will get from someone excluding the amount of time it takes the additional resources to come up to speed and be productive and subtracting the time invested in teaching them by existing resources

80358
put	get
i don t know that you can get someone started with alt.net per se
to me it is an attitude born of experience not something you can put on like a coat
but that is my opinion subject to change

80597
nsis	uninstaller
this is fine for internal distribution inside a company
use launch4j and an installer like nsis
this gives you a lot more control although the user can still do stupid stuff like uninstaller the java runtime

80740
cpu	processors
other architectures such as intel itanium processors have multiple stacks
in this sense the stack is an element of the cpu architecture


81398
folder	directory
it is unlikely that two call to millisec will be the same and filename is more userfriendly when accessing
the date strategy can be convenient if you decide to remove old and unused files you only have to get the 2006 folder and remove all that has not been accessed in the last year according to your log. this also can be a good indication for your users as they will know if it is a fresh file or not. the folderxyz is only a variant of this one replacing date with a tag each n files
the threshold subfolders helps you to keep the number of entries of your directory low so access is faster

81537
decoder	encoder
the first step before anything will be to get the ffmpeg decoder to support he-aac
currently it can only be decoder through faad
i don t believe there is any he-aac encoder on any platform with a more permissive license than nero s at this point in time

81544
profiling	debugging
the only reasons you might want flexbuilder are flex charts step-through debugging
profiling i haven t used it visual style editor however the code-completion and general bloody-awesomeness of flashdevelop s code-completion and syntax highlighting knocks the gimpy eclipse crap out of the water
so pretty much what todd said except for the code-completion part

81765
put	get
using a wrapper library as was already proposed in other answers might be a better solution to manual treatment depending on the complexity of your application
to complete the answer and i forgot to put that in at first thanks to the edit function
the best way of doing it natively is to get into a final variable check for null and put it back in with a 1

82230
vb.net	vb6
you can use overloading just repeat the declarations for each different data type you wish to pass
vb.net picks out the one that matches the argument you pass in your call
this is better than as any was in vb6 because the compiler can still do type-checking

83771
post	get
it worked
if anyone is having the same problem here s what i did this executes only two queries and loads all tags for each post
the idea is to get some value to limit the query at the last post that we need in this case the publishdategmt column will suffice and then limit the second query with that value instead of take

84438
distance	polygons

you could start by comparing the distance between the bounding boxes
testing the distance between rectangles is easier than testing the distance between polygons and you can immediately eliminate any polygons that are more than nearest_rect + its_diagonal away possibly you can refine that even more

84547
imperative	declarative
however imperative languages are much more intuitive for many people and we are deeply entrenched in imperative legacy code
the fundamental issue is that pure functional languages express side-effects explicitly while side effects are expressed implicitly in imperative languages by the order of statements
i believe that techniques to declarative express side effects in an object oriented framework will allow compilers to decompose imperative statements into their functional relationships

84961
int	chars	int	boolean
also the compiler will pad objects to maintain the alignment of record components
components follow int 8 16 or 32 bit twos-complement signed numbers float 32-bit ieee format long_float 64-bit ieee format fixed-point 8 16 or 32 bit
however the range and delta specified can affect being 16 or 32 enumerations int usually first element is represented by 0 boolean enumeration object 8 bits long the lsb stores the value 0 false 1 true chars enumeration object 8 bits long unsigned 0 through 127 access types 32 bits 32-bit value of 0 represents null arrays stored contiguously in row-major order size depends on base type

85077
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
for one thing this expression is extremely inefficent #theobject.get_item row .get_properties .get_item col .get_count -1# take the first part for example get_item row - your code causes cf to go retrieve the row and its properties for each iteration of the #columnlist# loops
and to top it all you re doing that twice per iteration of columnlist once for-loop and again for the inner cfset
if you think about it it only needs to retrieve the row for each iteration of the outer loops from #sfstart# to #cfend

85192
serializable	deserialization

arguments in rmi calls a serializable
deserialization on the server creates a copy of the lists

85344
put	get

i echo the answer by dmitriy - very well put
for those who are worried about the performance overhead fk s often bring there s a way in oracle you can get the query optimiser advantage of the fk constraint without the cost overhead of constraint validation during insert delete or update

85413
int	chars
read in the number one chars after another and first find all digits
do that in int arithmetic
also keep track of the decimal point and the exponent

85803
postgresql	mysql

we did a move from a mysql3 to postgresql 8.2 then 8.3
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok

85846
ssl	https

use to tell if it is ssl and redirect to the right place if not
and remember the page that displays the form does not need to be fed via https it s the post back url that needs it most

85878
submit	submission
if you have a form page that is served up via http i m going to be nervous about submission data -- i can t see if the submit goes over https or http without doing a view source and hunting for it
serving up the form over https along with the submit link isn t that heavy a change for the advantage


86350
put	get
an example the batch element is the root element of the xml
inside you can put different methods
these should get a unique id which is used to report errors back to you and a command which can for instance be new or update

86350
put	get
these should get a unique id which is used to report errors back to you and a command which can for instance be new or update
inside the method you put field elements that specify the value for each field
for instance the title field gets the value abcdef

86693
distance	polygons

this screening technique is intended to reduce the number of distance computations you need to perform in the average case without compromising the accuracy of the result
it works on convex and concave polygons

86693
distance	polygons
it works on convex and concave polygons
find the the minimum distance between each pair of vertexes such that one is a red vertex and one is a blue
call it r

86693
distance	polygons	distance	polygons
construct a new region from the red polygons where each line segment is moved outward by r and is joined to its neighbors by an arc of radius r is centered at the vertex
find the distance from each vertex inside this region to every line segment of the opposite color that intersects this region
of course you could add an approximate method such as bounding boxes to quickly determine which of the blue polygons can t possibly intersect with the red region

86881
equals	gethashcode	equals	gethashcode
when two object are the same the equals method returns true they must have the same value returned from gethashcode
when two objects have the same hash value they can be the same object equals returns true or be different objects equals returns false
there are no other guarantees on the result of gethashcode

87099
client-side	server-side
if your application is using eval to create an object from some json which has come back from an xmlhttprequest to your own site created by your trusted server-side code it s probably not a problem
untrusted client-side javascript code can t do that much anyway
provided the thing you re executing eval on has come from a reasonable source you re fine

87182
post	put
the manual_sort column is there just in case you want to enforce a particular order other than by name or value
btw whenever i try to post the words list and option connected with an underscore the preview window goes a little wacky
that s why i put a space there. the query would look something like select b.option_name b.option_value from list a list_option b where a.name states and a.list_id b.list_id order by b.manual_sort asc you ll also want to create an index on list.name if you think you ll ever use it in a where clause

87648
range	minimum
if you are using character types as numbers use signed char which gives you at least the -127 to 127 range
-128 to 127 is common unsigned char which gives you at least the 0 to 255 range
at least because the c++ standard only gives the minimum range of values that each numeric type is required to cover

87861
x86	64bit

since you re on x86 you need 4 mull instructions
split the 64bit quantities into two 32bit words and multiply the low words to the lowest and 2nd lowest word of the result then both pairs of low and high word from different numbers they go to the 2nd and 3rd lowest word of the result and finally both high words into the 2 highest words of the result

88049
hash	salt
a http response is started such as as a webservice user fetches get ticket number for user account
username donkey key 99754106633f94d350db34d548d6091a server checks if his calculated hash is the same as the one submitted
advantages of this method -server never knows password only salt hash

88049
hash	salt
advantages of this method -server never knows password only salt hash
-even the hash is never transmitted through the wire - no replay attacks


88632
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
from that point i consider the market share and try to ensure a reasonable support level for all other browsers
for example even .net developers occasionally use firefox maybe even opera
safari and google-chrome are possibilities too now

88868
np-hard	np-complete
finding a hamilton path is an np-complete problem
some np-hard problems can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming but to my knowledge this is not one of them


89265
put	get
this is not the forum to talk deeply about gc mechanics as it s a non-trivial problem but that s the basics of how a copying collector works
a generational copying gc will put older objects in different heaps and those end up being collected less often than newer heaps
the theory is that the long lasting objects get promoted to older generations and get collected less and less improving overall gc performance

89307
inherited	properties

something i have done before has been to create a custom page class actually i do this part on every project that each asp.net page inherited
this page class contains an isadmin properties

89311
debian	linux

i have no issues with debian on a 64 bit platform
the only issues i ve had with 64 bit linux environments is related to things like the flash plugin for firefox

89311
debian	linux
the only issues i ve had with 64 bit linux environments is related to things like the flash plugin for firefox
edit i used debian on a server and a laptop
the firefox problem was only on the laptop

89677
udp	tcp

if you re connecting to a named instance and udp is not available when connecting to it then you may need to specify the protocol as well
example tcp 192.168.1.21 sql2k5 1443

89714
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
ones that are definitely not dead are ie6 starting to push it ie7 ie8 latest opera 9.x latest firefox 3.x latest safari 3.x and others that have about the same capabilities
firefox 2.x isn t dead either and is needed for win9x users if they don t want to use opera


89848
profiling	benchmarking

which just goes to show if you don t know how to do proper code profiling don t be doing this stuff
the speed difference of these two methods are within the same big o speed as proven by leon timmermans opcode analyisis - the benchmarking are just going to show differences based on other local conditions not necessarily your code

90040
put	get
you could not get a 100 but still have tested all your 80 freq used code-paths
having tests that test every throw exceptiontypex or similar defensive programming guard you ve put in is a nice to have not a must have so trust yourself or your developers to be thorough and cover every path through their code
be pragmatic and don t chase the magical 100 coverage

90062
umbraco	dotnetnuke

umbraco gets my vote as a good cms that comes close to joomla in maturity and out of the box functionality
i m not that fond of dotnetnuke but it s been at least a year since i ran it thru its paces

90068
inherited	subclassing
this makes sure that other classes that want to use the class that implements the iterator interface that it will indeed have methods that iterators should have such as hasnext
also it should be noted that since java does not have multiple inherited the use of interface can be used to emulate that feature
by implementing multiple interfaces one can have a class that is a subclassing to inherit some features yet also inherit the features of another by implementing an interface

90213
multiplying	modulo

easy one is to just choose two big relative primes a and b then keep multiplying your random number by a and adding b
use the modulo to keep the low bits as your random number and keep the full value for the next iteration

90441
put	get
this means that if you execute a pipeline you ll only get the exit code of the last process in the pipeline
another approach is to do this set -e set -o pipefail if you put this at the top of the shell script it looks like bash will take care of this for you
as a previous poster noted set -e will cause bash to exit with an error on any simple command

90655
superclass	subclassing
the folder structure of your class must match the package name
in java to refer to the superclass you use the reserved word super instead of base gotcha #7 - chaining constructors to a base constructor you don t have this in java
to subclassing a class in java do this that means class a is a subclassing of class b

90655
int	chars	int	double
and the #1 gotcha in java the primitive types int float double chars and long are not object s like in c#
all of them have a respective object representation like int float double etc
that s it

90782

put	get
php-initialized google project there s the hope that with a bit of attention we can get this behaviour implemented in php itself
so put your 2-cents on the php mailing list bug system feature requests and see if we can encourage its integration


91848
versioning	upgrade
the 2005 versioning only installs into visual studio 2005
to download the 2008 versioning see the following link note that if you have previously applied sp1 of visual studio 2008 then you will need to run it again once installing team explorer
for what it is worth i would encourage you to upgrade to tfs 2008 on the server side as soon as you can

91937
pascal	delphi

you could also try free pascal
it is a free l gpl object pascal compiler which is compatible with the delphi -compiler

91993
boost	allocator
you may see a factor 10 speed-boost just plugging a simple pool allocator into the dictionary template
afaik boost has a component that can be directly used
another option if you know only 64.000 entries in your integers exist you can write those to a file and create a perfect hash function for it

92135
put	get

since you have been programming in object-oriented languages let me put it this way
you get object a instantiate object b and you pass it as a method parameter to object c

92840
folder	directory
if you want to add both code directory in your one directory add this to your web.config and then add a folder named vb_code and another folder named cs_code in your app_code directory
then throw all you vb c# code in your folder and your good


92951
public	protected

the members and base classes of a struct are public by default while in class they default to private
note you should make your base classes explicitly public private or protected rather than relying on the defaults

93005
width	height

setq initial-frame-alist append width
263 height

93459
rss	feed
if you are trying to generate your rss feed for others to consume you will need to read the spec if you are trying to consume it that link will also help
then you ll need to look into an xml rss parser
if you can provide more details i can update my answer

93673
n-gram	words	n-gram	words
in practice i m guessing you re analyzing a document of actual natural language english words and you actually want to do something with the data you collect
in this case you might just want to do a quick n-gram analysis for some small n such as just n 2 or 3
for example you could tokenize your document into a list of words by stripping out punctuation capitalization and stemming words running runs both - run to increase semantic matches

93696
rsa	aes
as i said above the key bit of knowledge is that the cert doesn t matter so long as it s generated with an algorithm that supports aes 256-bit encryption rsa
just to make sure that we re on the same page for my testing i generated my self-signed cert using the following keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg rsa now you have to make sure that your java implementation on your server supports aes-256 and this is the tricky bit
i did my testing on an os x os 10.5 box and when i checked to see the list of ciphers that it supported by default aes-256 was not on the list which is why using that cert i generated above only was creating an aes-128 connection between my browser and tomcat

93822
move	drag
drag or momentum can just be encoded as a basic resistance to motion and amount to throttling the movements
it can be applied differentially things can move slower based on how far they ve gone where they are in space how many other nodes are close etc.
hope this helps

94419
inherited	subclassing
a method in a subclassing that used to override the superclass method will no longer do so due the changed method signature
this can sometimes cause strange and unexpected behavior especially when dealing with complex inherited structures
the override annotation safeguards against this

94447
superclass	subclassing
suppose this method is changed in the parent class to this change will not cause any compile time errors or warnings - but it completely changes the intended behavior of the subclassing
to answer your question you should use the override annotation if the lack of a method with the same signature in a superclass is indicative of a bug


95168
range	minimum

xrange only stores the range params and generates the numbers on demand
however the c implementation of python currently restricts its args to c longs note that in python 3.0 there is only range and it behaves like the 2.x xrange but without the limitations on minimum and maximum end points

95522
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing

you could make an annotation enforceauthor with inherited on the superclass and use compiler annotations since java 1.6 to catch up at compile time
then you have a reference to the subclassing and can check if another annotation author is missing

95573
try-catch	exception-handling
you should find the correct place to handle the exception-handling actually do something like catch-and-not-rethrow and then log it
you can and should include the entire stack trace of course but following your suggestion would litter the code with try-catch blocks


95586
serializable	deserialization
the url was aydsman s answer is correct more info here i can t think of any use-case for an exception with non-serializable members but if you avoid attempting to serialize deserialize them in getobjectdata and the deserialization constructor you should be ok
also mark them with the nonserialized attribute more as documentation than anything else since you are implementing the serializable yourself


96436
put	get

what we do is to put it in a separate directory on the server you could use something like config opt config root config home username config or anything you want
when our servlets start up they read the xml file get a few things out of it most importantly db connection information and that s it

96469
put	get

web-inf is a good place to put your config file
here s some code to get the absolute path of the directory from a servlet

96574
svg	vml
your options are to use regular divs absolutely positioned in the right places or find write a font layout engine example or wait for a new standard to be implemented that lets you draw text
svg deals with this much better
in ie you have explorercanvas to simulate the canvas api with ie s own vml markup

96576
rpm	yum

if you re running on redhat or debian consider packaging up your code into rpm s or debs
then build a yum or dpkg repository and put your packages there

96835
opera	firefox	opera	safari
you can test in other browsers but don t worry about fixes until it works just how you want it in firefox
then move on to the other standards-based browsers namely safari and opera
if you ve written good html and css it shouldn t require much work in these browsers

97431
google-chrome	safari
it is not real ie it s mainly only its rendering engine html+css+js plus web client http and some more protocols control itself has no menu bookmarks etc
google-chrome is full featured browser
so you should be asking for webkit rendering engine google-chrome use developed by safari s guys control

97630
implements	extends
a couple points from that chapter pertinent to your question assuming you want to serialize the state of the non-serializable field in myclass2 that field must be accessible to myclass either directly or through getters and setters
myclass will have to implements custom serialization by providing readobject and writeobject methods
the non-serializable field s class must have an api to allow getting it s state for writing to the object stream and then instantiating a new instance with that state when later reading from the object stream. per item 74 of effective java myclass2 must have a no-arg constructor accessible to myclass otherwise it is impossible for myclass to extends myclass2 and implements serializable

98244
getter	setter
essentially if you have getters and setter for each and every private field you are making those fields as good as public
you d be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that getter
moreover from a strictly oo point of view objects should be responding to messages methods that correspond to their hopefully single responsibility

98589
int	chars
so for genuine portability issues which mostly are implementation-dependent rather than unspecified or undefined but i think that falls into the spirit of the question chars is not necessarily un signed
int can be any size from 16 bits
floats are not necessarily ieee-formatted or conformant

98683
allegro	sdl
your choice of engine library framework should dictate your collision detection choices as they are likely far more optimized than what you could produce alone
for allegro there is collegro
for sdl there is sdl_collide.h or sdl-collide

98881
implements	extends
the i naming notation is historical from c++ it was used to indicate an abstract virtual class and was carried over to java but is more significant in c# because there is no easy way to tell what is a base class and what is a interface from a c# class declaration public class dog animal imammal while in java it was more obvious public class dog extends animal implements imammal multiple inheritance is very tricky so interfaces were derived to simplify it
a c# class can only inherit from one base class but can implements n amount of interfaces
in c++ interfaces can be simulated by using pure virtual classes

99194
for-loop	loops

i would agree that the for-loop is clearer and more appropriate when iterating
the while loops is appropriate for polling or where the number of loops to meet exit condition will change based on activity inside loops

99221
x86	mips
weather learning mips assembly is useful to you depends on what career you plan to follow
personally i think x86 x64 popular in pcs directly applicable if you write c++ or c# on pc ppc gaining popularity used in game consoles and also exposes you to risc or arm used in a lot of embedded devices such as mobile phones might be better choices to learn


99235
x86	mips	x86	mips
most compilers will dump assembly code for you on request instead of going on to machine code and linking. that said mips asm is probably useless because almost nobody uses mips now
sgi used to but now their machines are all on x86 ia-64 chips. if you find assembly language appealing and want to work in assembly further learn the arm instruction set
arm is only a little more complex than mips and virtually all mobile phones smart phones and pdas now use arm chips made by dozens of manufacturers

99745
getter	setter

i prefer to keep members private as long as possible and only access em via getter even from within the very same class
i also try to avoid setter as a first draft to promote value style objects as long as it is possible

100334
rss	feed
enterprise search
the indexing capabilities provided by sharepoint s enterprise search technology are extensive rss web part
allows you to consume and apply xslt transform to any rss feed and output the result on any sharepoint page page viewer web part

100740
octree	quadtree
a quadtree is best for when you use a height map for terrain etc
an octree is best for when you have clumps of geometry in 3d space such as a solar system


100838
vb.net	vb6

when i moved from asp3 to asp.net i finally choosed to use c# instead of vb.net
i wrote basics for years ms-basic gw-basic quick-basic visual basic vbscript and it was very difficult to use vb.net because i always try to write things as i used to do with vb6 or vbscript

100937
lisp	scheme

it s a foerign-function interface ffi that lets you call .net libraries from your lisp code
they are most probably much less mature than any common lisp or scheme implementation but there are lisp dialects for .net l# and dotlisp

101561
mvp	presenter
this is to allow mocking of the view in a unit test
one common attribute of mvp is that there has to be a lot of two-way dispatching
for example when someone clicks the save button the event handler delegates to the presenter s onsave method

102292
multiplying	multiplication
if the filter is large it may also make sense to use the fact that convolution in the spatial domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency fourier domain
this means that you can take the fourier transform of the image and the filter multiplying the complex results and then take the inverse fourier transform
the complexity of the fft fast fourier transform is o n log n while the complexity of a convolution is o n 2

102421
lisp	scheme
for scheme there s gnu guile which is licensed under lgpl
for common lisp there s ecl also under the lgpl
both use a c interface for interoperability so you can pretty much embed them into any other language

102717
extjs	gxt
there is a difference extjs gwt is the one that is actually produced by the company that wrote extjs the javascript library
gwt extjs is a gwt wrapper around the extjs library
gxt is native gwt

102717
extjs	gxt	extjs	gxt
however the future is with gxt as it s native gwt and actually developed by the company that made extjs
gwt extjs is somewhat crippled as the license changed on the extjs library thus slowing the development of gwt extjs
overall i think gwt gxt is a good solution for developing a web application

103227
hash	salt

comparing hash is a good solution
make sure that you don t just salt all the credit card numbers with the same constant salt though

103227
hash	salt
the point of a salt or nonce if you prefer is to make each password unique and long enough that brute force attacks are a waste of time
so the user s password instead of being stored as the hash of myspace1 ends up being stored as the hash of 128 characters of random unicode string + myspace1
you re now completely immune to rainbow table attack

103579
hash	salt

pci dss states that you can store pans credit card numbers using a strong one-way hash
they don t even require that it be salt

103579
hash	salt
however it is computationally expensive
if you make it more expensive to crack your hash then it wouldn t be worthwhile for anyone to bother
even if they had the salt hash and the method you used

103653
hash	salt
step 2 if the simple check hits use the salt get the hash value do the in depth check
the last 4 digits of the cc# are the most unique partly because it includes the luhn check digit as well so the percentage of in depth checks you will do that won t ultimately match the false positive rate will be very very low a fraction of a percent which saves you a tremendous amount of overhead relative to the naive do the hash check every time design


103658
rsa	aes
this will the third-party to encrypt data with your public key and then only you can decrypt the data with your private key which you do not disclose
there should be implementations of rsa available for all the languages you mentioned
if you don t care if the third-party can decrypt the data then aes is the way to go

103768
ssl	https
if you only allow https you can take the password out of the document completely and put it into an http basic authentication header instead
it s secured by ssl during transmission and not stored on your system in the clear you only store a one-way hash for authentication purposes
http basic authentication is simple widely supported and will be much easier for you and your partners to implement than ssl client certificates

104095
cassini	iis

cassini is ment to be a light waight test webserver
the idea is that a developer does not need to have iis installed and configured to test his application

if you do implement iequatable however you should also override equals as the iequatable remarks section states if you implement iequatable t you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable t .equals method
if you do override equals object your overridden implementation is also called in calls to the static equals system.object system.object method on your class
this ensures that all invocations of the equals method return consistent results

innodb	myisam

according to the man page if you are dumping innodb tables you can use the --single-transaction option --lock-tables -l lock all tables before dumping them
the tables are locked with read local to allow concurrent inserts in the case of myisam tables

104628
innodb	myisam
the tables are locked with read local to allow concurrent inserts in the case of myisam tables
for transactional tables such as innodb and bdb --single-transaction is a much better option because it does not need to lock the tables at all. for innodb db


105059
public	protected

most of the time you should be able to test a class by exercising its public methods
if there is significant functionality that is hidden behind private or protected access that might be a warning sign that there s another class in there struggling to get out

105339
int	chars	int	double
8 bit numbers chars don t need to be converted
also these are only defined for unsigned values they work for signed int as well
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

105391
ant	maven	ant	maven
maven is an all around build and deployment management tool
it s biggest strength is that it makes build scripts significantly eaiser to maintain than functionally comparable ant files or shell scripts
there are a lot of advantages to using maven the biggest being it s preference of convention over configuration

105419
doc	rtf

it is capable of storing pdfs but your word documents will be converted to the the google doc format
which then can be converted back to word or rtf or pdf etc

105570
maven	m2e	maven	cargo

maven would be just fine for what you want to do
unlike most build tools maven uses conventions wisely well better than many others at least and it has plugins for every area you mentioned unit tests maven surefire plugin eclipse integration m2e deploying war file war plugin and deploy plugin maven can also help you in integration tests on tomcat if you have some since you can start stop or deploy a war using the cargo plugin

postgresql	mysql

i like postgresql maestro
i also use their version for mysql

106334
postgresql	mysql
in your example you would want something like this select o.id o.address o.otherdetails group_concat concat e.firstname e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql - edit postgresql 9.0 is equally simple now that string_agg expression delimiter is built-in
here it is with comma-space between elements select o.id o.address o.otherdetails string_agg e.firstname || || e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql before 9.0 allows you to define your own aggregate functions with create aggregate
slightly more work than mysql but much more flexible

106469
public	protected
other languages in c++ you simply specify a modifier before the base class of private public or protected
this makes all members of the base that were public to that specified access level
it seems silly to me that you can t do the same in c#

107415
post	put
an http put is supposed to accept the body of the request and then store that at the resource identified by the uri
an http post is more general
it is supposed to initiate an action on the server

107450
post	put
http 1.1 rfc location for post difference between post and put the rfc itself explains the core difference the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is reflected in the different meaning of the request-uri
the uri in a post request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity
that resource might be a data-accepting process a gateway to some other protocol or a separate entity that accepts annotations

107450
put	get
using the right method unrelated aside one benefit of rest roa vs soap is that when using http rest roa it encourages the proper usage of the http verbs methods
so for example you would only use put when you want to create a resource at that exact location
and you would never use get to create or modify a resource

107520
rpm	yum
combined into one example on at least one rh system with rpm v4.8.0 yum v3.2.29 and repoquery v0.0.11 repoquery -l rpm prints nothing
if you are having this issue try adding the --installed flag repoquery --installed -l rpm
dnf update to use dnf instead of yum-utils use the following command

107542
post	put

to give examples of rest-style resources post books with a bunch of book information might create a new book and respond with the new url identifying that book books 5
put books 5 would have to either create a new book with the id of 5 or replace the existing book with id 5

107542
post	put	post	put
put books 5 would have to either create a new book with the id of 5 or replace the existing book with id 5
in non-resource style post can be used for just about anything that has a side effect
one other difference is that put should be idempotent - multiple puts of the same data to the same url should be fine wheras multiple posts might create multiple objects or whatever it is your post action does

107831
filtering	grouping
you can define profiles and grouping execute them together
you can set filtering on file types names etc
and execute commands programs after the job execution

107883
factors	mean
if instead we want to say that a function grows exactly as quickly as some other function we use theta to make that point i ll write t f n to mean theta of f n in markdown
t g n is short hand for being bounded from above and below by g n again up to a scaling factors and asymptotically
that is f n t g n f n o g n and g n o f n

108030
udp	tcp

there are various standard reliable udp protocols out there what experiences do you have with them
i think you really need to prove to yourself that tcp is in fact too slow for your needs if you need reliability in your protocol

108157
hide	show
this way the actual control will not be visible and whatever you put under it will show through
but since the control is positioned above that button it will still capture the click events this is why you want to use opacity not visibility or display - browsers make the element unclickable if you use those to hide it
this article goes in-depth on the technique

108421
vmware	virtualbox
intel-based macintoshes can boot windows and apple provides windows drivers for their various devices as part of a href rel nofollow noreferrer boot camp. a alternately you can buy a href rel nofollow noreferrer parallels a or a href rel nofollow noreferrer vmware fusion a for less than 100
i use vmware fusion
there is also a mac version of a href rel nofollow noreferrer virtualbox a from sun which is free though i have never used it

108451
udp	tcp
tcp is generally as fast as it gets for reliable streaming of data from one host to another
however if your application does a lot of small bursts of traffic and waiting for responses udp may be more appropriate to minimize latency
there is an easy middle ground

108511
spaces	linefeed	spaces	delimiter

the humble for command has accumulated some interesting capabilities over the years note that overwrites the default spaces and tab delimiter so that the output of the date command gets gobbled all at once
to capture multi-line output it can still essentially be a one-liner using the variable linefeed as the delimiter in the resulting variable to capture a piped expression use |

108706
datamapper	activerecord
doctrine 1.2 implements activerecord
doctrine 2+ is a datamapper orm
also check out xyster

108781
post	get

it seems fitting i post an answer since i left the comment p basically if you forget to include stdlib.h the compiler will assume malloc returns an int
without casting you will get a warning

108959
multiplication	exponent
it is probably the best you can do as a general method that works for all exponent values but for a specific exponent value there might be a better sequence that needs fewer multiplication
for instance if you want to compute x 15 the method of exponentiation by squaring will give you this is a total of 6 multiplication
it turns out this can be done using just 5 multiplication via addition-chain exponentiation

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
cairngorm just skips over things like event bubbling and instead opts for solutions involving global variable
in short cairngorm is the visualbasic of flex it works but will teach you a lot of bad habits
puremvc isn t so bad it just isn t a very good fit for writing flex applications

109508
lisp	scheme
stalin is a scheme compiler which does ridiculously aggressive optimisation
all common lisp implementations that i know of except clisp compile to native code
whether one ought to consider cl a functional language depends on what is meant by the term functional however. mlton is a highly optimising compiler for standard ml

109593
put	get

if you re really serious about it and are willing to put in some time to actually learn to program in cocoa the way i would do it would be a combination of reading all the stuff apple has to offer along with a couple good books both for reference and more conceptual big picture getting into the cocoa mindset stuff
if you just want to try to hack something together that works than you ll probably do best with a combination of apple s sample code and lots of questions on various forums when you get stuck

109979
ubuntu	linux
on linux your choices for server virtualization include vmware server -- it s commercial freeware mature and provides the most hardware device and guest os support of any solution
available with ubuntu
xen -- it s open source

109979
vmware	virtualbox
for myself i stick with vmware workstation 7+ years and vmware server for my linux-hosted virtualization needs
at work it s vmware workstation on windows vmware server on windows and vmware esx on bare metal
i ll probably have another look at xen kvm and virtualbox at some point but for right now compatibility between work and home is paramount

110029
pascal	delphi
this is a series of delphi components free source code you can see an example of this here view markup - it s the staruml projects code and they have among other things a way to get at the history favorites etc using the ie mshtml interfaces
it s written in object pascal but it shouldn t be too hard to figure out what s going on
if you download the embedded web browser components package take a look at the stuff in embeddedwb_d2005 source - there s all sorts of goodies there

110037
jxtable	jtable

look into jxtable
jxtable is an extension of jtable that supports multi-column sorting as well as other functions that jtable doesn t provide

110162
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a pretty popular database lots of tools are available and lots of books
sqlite and postgresql are also quite popular and also free open-source


110296
inherited	properties
if you want to apply the properties in the first set of brackets to .d as well it will need to be specified in the selector list
you also need to separate the selectors with commas so they become a list not an inherited
example

110366
post	get

to complement greg s post if you re on a posix system which includes macos linux unix etc
you can use os.uname to get a better feel for what kind of system it is

110416
tcpreplay	wireshark
next get yourself a copy of tcpreplay
this should also include a tool called tcprewrite . tcprewrite will allow you to split your previously saved capture files into two - one for each side of the handshake. you can then use tcpreplay to play back one side of the handshake so you have a consistent set of packets to play with
then you use wireshark again to check your responses

110621
accessor	properties

you can use reflection you can get a methodinfo object for the get set accessor and call it s invoke method
the code example assumes you have both a get and set accessor and you really have to add error handling if you want to use this in production code for example to get the value of properties foo of object obj you can write to set it so you can pass obj.gettype .getproperty foo .getaccessors 0 to your method and execute it s invoke method

110942
post	get

if you are passing things like passwords or other sensitive information always use post and make sure you are using ssl so that data doesn t travel between the client and server in clear-text
security-wise the downside of using get is that all the submitted data will be in the url and therefore stored locally on the client in the browser history

111332
int	chars
so you d do something like chars buffer 4096
int num_read
while num_read src.read sizeof buffer 0 dst.write buffer num_read

111593
post	put
for accessibility s sake you could even put hidden text so that people using screen readers would know not to fill it in
bots almost always fill in all fields so you could block any post that filled in the invisible field


112138
vbscript	jscript
you need to use jscript but it s close enough
same environment also allows for vbscript
to run a program you can execute something like cscript foo.js the windows system api is a bit weird and frustrating if you expect the same flexibility as with basic js objects but they do have thorough documentation if you can handle digging through the msdn pages and seeing all the examples in vbscript

112256
post	get
even when you access the tables in the same order you may still get deadlocks 1
i wrote a post on my blog that elaborates through some approaches that will help you avoid and resolve deadlock situations
if you want to ensure two statements transactions will never deadlock you may be able to achieve it by observing which locks each statement consumes using the sp_lock system stored procedure

112465
short	base

in short yes it is possible to over interface a project
take into account when the situation really calls for an abstract base class and an interface while they both are similar there are distinct advantages to using both see here

112781
post	get
this is in line with bert bos s argument that any symbol processing in css take place at the point of authoring not not at the point of interpretation
the full setup along with all the code would be a bit too complicated to post here but might be appropriate for a blog post down the road
here s the comment section from the macro which should be enough to get started

113048
width	margin

you ll need to make sure that all your cells float either left or right depending on their internal ordering and they also need a fix width
also make sure that their row has a fixed width which is equal to the sum of the cell widths + margin + padding

113128
client-side	server-side
you don t have to use the server-side piece
the client-side create a script piece is generally enough


113397
client-side	server-side

in addition to the above i would like to point out that client-side validation html code javascript etc. is never enough
also check the length server-side or just don t check at all if it s not so important that people can be allowed to get around it then it s not important enough to really warrant any steps to prevent that either

113420
try-catch	exception-handling

i think you can just do an explicit try-catch in your test code instead of relying on the expectedexception attribute to do it for you
then you can come up with some helper method that will read the resource file and compare the error message to the one that comes with the exception-handling that was caught

113519
hash	md5
it is not currently computationally feasible to generate a hash collision for a specific md5 value but it is possible to generate two different inputs that will produce the same md5 therefore not triggering your code
it is also possible to generate two different strings with the same prefix that hash to the same value
if that kind of attack can lead to the integrity of your system being compromised and that s a concern you want to explore other options

113675
serializable	deserialization
ensure that you implement the three standard exception constructors
ensure that you mark your exception with the serializable attribute
ensure that you implement the deserialization constructor

113843
short	base

short answer no
long answer it is not the base class or the number of ancestors a class has in its hierarchy that affects it speed

113912
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if the collation is case-insensitive you need to explicitly declare the collation mode you want to use when performing a search replace
here s how to construct an update statement to perform a case-sensitive search replace by specifying the collation mode to use this will match and replace thecontent but not thecontent or thecontent


114000
inline	inlining

functions called using virtual dispatch are not inline there is one kind of penalty for virtual functions which is easy to forget about virtual calls are not inline in a common situation where the type of the object is not know compile time
if your function is small and suitable for inlining this penalty may be very significant as you are not only adding a call overhead but the compiler is also limited in how it can optimize the calling function it has to assume the virtual function may have changed some registers or memory locations it cannot propagate constant values between the caller and the callee

114023
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort
you just need to implement the second part of the heapsort algorithm
this should be faster than using quicksort on the heap array
if you are feeling brave you could have a go at implementing smoothsort which is faster than heapsort for nearly-sorted data

114061
heapsort	in-place

just use heapsort
it is in-place

114215
datalist	repeater
however to actually show the images you re best bet could be to create a datatable of these images and then use a datalist or repeater to display them
then on your aspx page you would have a datalist control called dlimages defined like


114372
put	get	gif	png	bmp	png
getdimensionsgdip get dimensions in tsize-struktur in pixel
savepicgdiplus saves picture objekt in file as bmp gif png or jpg jpg with given quality arrayfrompicture returns a byte array of picutre to put pic into ole field of table arraytopicture creates byte array of ole field of table containing a picture


114544
postgresql	mysql
these databases are very different - mysql is speed and simplicity postgresql is robustness and concurrency
it will be easier for you to learn postgresql it is not that hard


114736
versioning	upgrade

finally i found a solution - i m posting it here for other people who might have the same problem all 5 of you change the product id to under product add the following under installexecutesequence add from now on whenever i install the product it removed previous installed versioning
note replace upgrade id with your own guid

114753
mvp	presenter

from your description it s a bit like how i do mvp but with the events going the other way
i usually have a very thin view that hides behind an interface and that knows nothing about the presenter

115600
post	get

here s a nice little post on c-charpcorner by krishnan ln that gives basic code to grab the text from a word document using the word primary interop assemblies
basically you get the wholestory property out of the word document paste it to the clipboard then pull it from the clipboard while converting it to text format

115944
getter	setter
therefore if there is no business logic for example when a getter simply returns a value or a setter sets it then there is no point in writing a test
if however there is some logic getter changes the data in some way before returning it then yes you should have a unit test. as a general rule i believe one should not write tests for beans that do not contain any business logic


115946
folder	directory
this isn t a ntfs-specific problem in fact it s commonly encountered with user home mail files on large unix systems
one obvious way to resolve this issue is moving the files to folder with a name based on the file name
assuming all your files have file names of similar length abcdefghi.db abcefghij.db etc create a directory structure like this abc def abcdefghi.db efg abcefghij.db using this structure you can quickly locate a file based on its name

116066
try-catch	exception-handling
these errors generally happen when an exception-handling in thrown on the webserver and there s no logic to catch it so it spits out an http 500 error
you can usually resolve the problem by placing try-catch blocks in your code


116106
folder	directory
however instead of setting svn ignore to . on the cache directory you may want to include cache in the parent directory s svn ignore property in case the cache directory is not always present
i do this on a number of throwaway folder


116114
stdout	stderr
backticks use minimal syntax for what can be a heavy command
one reason users might be temped to use backticks instead of system is to hide stdout from the user
this is more easily and flexibly accomplished by redirecting the stdout stream further getting rid of stderr is easily accomplished in situations where it makes sense to use backticks i prefer to use the qx in order to emphasize that there is a heavy-weight command occurring

116255
versioning	upgrade
so any breaking change would already be affecting .net 2.0 websites without any explicit upgrade step
scott hanselman posted a good explanation of the difference between clr versioning and .net runtime versioning here a while back
one final comment - you should be aware that when using vs 2008 to target .net 2.0 you are actually compiling against the updated .net 2.0

116730
opera	firefox	opera	safari
tweak it to look right in at least firefox and ie and now you ve covered 90 + of the people that will be using your website
don t get me wrong here - i m not trying to dismiss the users of opera safari or any other browser
but if you want the most results for the least amount of work then there ya go

116739
hash	salt
however don t feel bad if you use sha-1
don t just hash the password but put other information in it as well
you often use the hash of username password salt or similar rather than just the password but if you play with this then you make it even harder to run a dictionary attack

116753
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5

add a unique salt to the hash password value store the salt value in the db
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement

116767
salt	md5
the ready availability of cloud computing and powerful parallel-processor graphics cards means that passwords up to 8 or 9 characters hashed as md5 or sha1 are now trivially breakable
now a long salt is a must as is something tougher like sha512
however all sha variant hashes are designed for communication encryption - messages back and forth where every message is encrypted and for this reason they are designed to be fast

116873
mouse	keyboard
make it obvious which input box failed validation or formatting rules and tell the user why their input failed
do not steal the mouse pointer focus when providing feedback
keep tab order in mind so that when keyboard oriented users complete a field they can hit tab and go to the next logical input selection field

117186
next	except
select tasks- generate scripts
click next twice
on the options window choose set it to generate create statements only and put everything to false except for the foreign keys

117186
next	except
on the options window choose set it to generate create statements only and put everything to false except for the foreign keys
click next
select tables and click next again

117741
boost	stl
in particular use stl strings and collections unless you have a very very good reason not to
get to know auto_ptr and the boost smart pointers library very well understand under which circumstances each type of smart pointer is intended to be used and then use smart pointers everywhere you might otherwise have used raw pointers
your code will be just as efficient and a lot less prone to memory leaks

117834
opera	firefox	opera	safari

safari 1.3+ opera 9.2+ konquerer and ie8 all support it at least to some degree
firefox apparently still does not

117836
folder	directory
use tortoise mercurial setup local repo 1 download and install 2 open an explorer window to the base directory of you project 3 right-click - tortoisehg - create repository here - ok 4 right-click - hg commit.
5 type your commit comment select which files to track and click commit setup remote repo over file share other transport methods available 1 open explorer window to remote folder 2a right-click - tortoisehg - clone a repository 2b alternatively just copy your local repo over updating remote repo after committing local 1 open explorer window to remote folder 2 right-click - tortoisehg - synchronize 3 select update to new tip in pull menu 4 enter the path to your local repo into the remote path input box 5 click pull


118049
post	get
since you are calling this multiple times you may get better performance copying the list once and destructively deleting from it
alternatively looking back over your original post it is a little confusing.
you say you remove all elements bigger than x but your code looks like it is attempting to remove all elements x is bigger than

118325
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

i use firefox with ie tab and google-chrome
firefox with ie tab because those are the two browsers with the most market share and google-chrome because it is one of the few windows browsers that use webkit meaning it should display similarly to safari

118689
rss	feed

the point of rss is to be display agnostic
you should not be putting style attributes on your feed

118819
put	get
that does not mean that you hire them on the spot but it does mean that they should be able to breeze through it and get on to the meat of the interview
to put it another way anybody who takes the time to read coding horror is worth interviewing further
and then move on to the next question

118965
width	margin
say you have a main pane on which all your page s content lies
you want it to be centered in the window always and 80 of the width of the window
simply do this #centerpane margin auto

118965
width	margin
simply do this #centerpane margin auto

put	get

for very simple cases you can put your business logic in stored procedures
usually even the simple cases tend to get complicated over time

119626
put	get
usually even the simple cases tend to get complicated over time
here are the reasons i don t put business logic in the database putting the business logic in the database tightly couples it to the technical implementation of the database
changing a table will cause you to change a lot of the stored procedures again causing a lot of extra bugs and extra testing

120052
bazaar	git
difficulty with git has been understanding the implications of the distributed model
i did glance briefly at other dvcses like bazaar and mercurial and they seemed to be somewhat more newbie-friendly
anyway as others have said subversion is probably the easiest way to get used to the version control mindset and get practical experience of the benefits of vcs rollback branches collaborative development easier code review etc

120084
int	chars	int	double
example to cater for possible alignment requirements of the otherclass you may need to use __declspec align x if working in visualc++ or to use a type other than chars like .
where type is int double long long or whatever describes the alignment requirements


120140
maven	pom.xml
p.s
if you use maven there is an argument for saying that the .project and .classpath files are derived artifacts
this is only true if you generate them every time you do a build and if you have never had to tweak them by hand or inadvertently changed them by changing some preferences after generating them from the pom.xml

120284
lisp	prolog
random examples of what you can implement as a user library using lisp metaprogramming these are actual examples of common lisp libraries extend the language with delimited continuations hu.dwim.delico implement a js-to-lisp-rpc macro that you can use in javascript which is generated from lisp
it expands into a mixture of js lisp code that automatically posts in the http request all the referenced local variables decodes them on the server side runs the lisp code body on the server and returns back the return value to the javascript side
add prolog like backtracking to the language that very seamlessly integrates with normal lisp code see screamer an xml templating extension to common lisp includes an example of reader macros that are plugins for the lisp parser a ton of small dsl s like loop or iterate for easy looping

120508
maven	cobertura
i try to write self documenting test cases but will use javadocs to comment something that is not obvious
tracking making the results available i integrate the unit testing into my maven build cycle using the surefire plugin and i use the corbertura plugin to measure the coverage achieved by those tests
i always generate and publish a web-site including the surefire and cobertura reports as part of my daily build so i can see what tests failed passed

120901
post	get	post	get
you will need flash 6 or later on the player to get this to work
example geturl _top post
to get information out of scripts two-way information flow if you want to get information back into your flash application from your script you can use loadvariables with similar arguments the only difference is the second argument which is the target for the variables to load into

120916
inherited	subclassing
if you want to call a superclass constructor with an argument you must use the subclassing s constructor initialization list
unlike java c++ supports multiple inherited for better or worse so the base class must be referred to by name rather than super
more info on the constructor s initialization list here and here

121242
mouse	keyboard
you really do need to touch-and-feel your app on a real device
a ui that works great while pointing and clicking with a mouse might be terrible when used with thumbs and fingers
if there is any text entry you need to feel how painful it is to type using the onscreen keyboard to determine whether it makes sense to provide alternative data-entry methods

121601
post	get
here s a nice tutorial to get you started
as an example here s a script i wrote that causes links in phpbb3 post to open in a new tab in the default skin the xpath expression used in the code identifies all a elements that 1 do not have an onclick attribute 2 whose href attribute is not set to # and 3 are found inside div s whose class attribute is set to content


121657
put	get
you can set up one in web.xml
when the request comes acquire the connection put it into threadlocal
during the request get the connection from threadlocal but never close it

121720
folder	directory
in order to recursively zip an archive you will need to use the addfoldercontent function
for example to create a c sample.zip and add the c temp folder to it use the following important note the addfoldercontent function is not functional as included in the xzip library
it will recurse into the directory structure but fails to add any files to the zip archive due to a bug in the paths passed to zipadd

121950
exponent	addition
it s a way of thinking of every number as a possibly fixed base raised to an exponent
operations are performed on the exponent alone
this means that you can do multiplication and division by doing addition and subtraction of the logs

gridbaglayout	boxlayout

i ve found that for any non-trivial gui i use multiple layouts with nested sub-panels where the main panel may have a gridbaglayout and each sub-panel typically without a border or indication that it is a panel uses a simpler layout where possible
typically i ll use borderlayout flowlayout and boxlayout for smaller simpler sub-panels

122063
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
typically i ll use borderlayout flowlayout and boxlayout for smaller simpler sub-panels
by dividing small sections of the gui into sub-panels and using the simplest layout possible to control that section of the gui you can create complex well arranged displays without too much headache from gridbaglayout s many options
also by grouping like display functionality into a panel it creates more readable code

spaces	linefeed
it is undefined in css 2.1 what happens if a style sheet does contain a character with unicode codepoint zero. if a character in the range 0-9a-f follows the hexadecimal number the end of the number needs to be made clear
there are two ways to do that with a spaces or other whitespace character 26 b b
in this case user agents should treat a cr linefeed pair u+000d u+000a as a single whitespace character. by providing exactly 6 hexadecimal digits 000026b b in fact these two methods may be combined

lxml	celementtree	lxml	elementtree
it s pythonic comes in the box with python 2.5 including the c version celementtree xml.etree.celementtree which is 20 times faster than the pure python version and is very easy to use
lxml has some perfomance advantages but they are uneven and you should check the benchmarks first for your use case
as i understand it elementtree code can easily be ported to lxml

put	get
the hook and directions are intended for use on the central server
if you are the only one working in your repository or don t mind commit not showing up in fb until after you do a pull then you can add the hook locally to your primary clone if you are using your primary clone then you need to do something slightly different from what they say here you can put your fogbugz.py anywhere you want just add a path line to your fogbugz section of that repositories hgrc file just make sure you have python installed
you may also wish to add a commit hook so that local commits to the repository also get into fb

instances of exception should be reserved for cases where a data or processing error has taken place but can be recovered from by user or system intervention
instances of runtimeexception should be reserved for those occasions when no intervention within the confines of your application can resolve the issue
these two types are thusly known as checked and unchecked-exception

you can try mvp if you want to put the logic of the ui in a separate class

inherited	subclassing
multiple dispatch allows for subtyping polymorphism of arguments for method calls
single dispatch also allows for a more limited kind of polymorphism using the same method name for objects that implement the same interface or inherited the same base class
it s the classic example of polymorphism where you have methods that are overridden in subclassing

125553
matlab	simulink

you might be surprised at the number of people that use matlab for this and as it could be considered a programming language and certainly manages its own memory with support for huge data sets etc then it should seriously be considered as a solution here
so once you arrive at an algorithm you want to package up you can have it generate the c code to perform the work you originally had in your m script or simulink model

lisp	scheme
but i have one misconception about lisp that really shocked me when i read lisp s history specifically history of lisp and the evolution of lisp
lisp is known to be a slow interpreted language my many people but in reality it had a compiler something about less than one year after having its first working interpreter i think and the following history is a long list of work targetted at optimization that resulted in some lisp implementations beating fortran at number crushing
most probable source of the myth is that many people get only to know lisp from a cs course about scheme where they write themselves an interpreter

126771
lisp	scheme
most probable source of the myth is that many people get only to know lisp from a cs course about scheme where they write themselves an interpreter
and probably many of them get to hate the course because it teaches them beautiful but complex concepts about computability or recursion and they then assimilate their issues with the course with their issues with lisp


126773
lisp	scheme
nothing could be farther from the truth
first of all lisp depending on the meaning intended by the speaker isn t really a language at all but a language family
there are a couple of more or less well-known and widespread members of this family scheme common lisp emacs-lisp and autolisp are the traditional ones

126773
lisp	scheme
it s certainly true that schemers seem to favour a functional style and discourage iteration in favour of recursion
however as far as i can tell schemers are actually a minority in the lisp world at least when considering practical usage of lisp as a programming tool as opposed to a research or study subject
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming

126773
lisp	scheme
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming
in fact common lisp features the most powerful class-based object system that i know of incorporating stuff like aspect-oriented programming out of the box
lisp seems to me to actually be the language family that most encourages experiments in new directions and most easily incorporates programming paradigms that aren t supported from the get-go

it is an unsigned integer capable of expressing the size in bytes of any memory range supported on the host machine
it is typically related to ptrdiff_t in that ptrdiff_t is a signed integer value such that sizeof ptrdiff_t and sizeof size_t are equal
when writing c code you should always use size_t whenever dealing with memory ranges

looping through wouldn t be your only option - you could perform subtraction to figure out the total number of days and subtract one for each of your skipped dates every week range in between that contains one of those days
by the time you figure out whether a day lands on one of the partial weeks at the beginning or end of the range and add your code will be more complicated than it would be if just counted but if you re expecting to have huge date ranges it might perform better

the meaning of this is pretty simple to deduce if this is used inside a constructor function and the function was invoked with the new keyword this refers to the object that will be created
this will continue to mean the object even in public methods
if this is used anywhere else including nested protected functions it refers to the global scope which in the case of the browser is the window object

boost	stl
the library documentation itself gives you an up-front example of what it is there for where produces a function object that when called writes its first argument to the cout stream
this is something you could do with a custom functor class std ostream_iterator or an explicit loop but boost lambda wins in conciseness and probably clarity -- at least if you are used to the functional programming concepts
when you over- use the stl you find yourself gravitating towards boost bind and boost lambda

135367
boost	stl
so use stl algorithms write your own functors and then translate them into inline expressions using boost lambda
from a professional standpoint i believe the best way to get started with boost lambda is to get usage of boost bind understood and accepted
use of placeholders in a boost bind expression looks much less magical than naked boost lambda placeholders and finds easier acceptance during code reviews

prng	random
my guess is that this is unlikely to be faster than dev random where that s available
if you want a prng do something like this securerandom.getinstance sha1prng
what strings are supported depends on the securerandom spi provider but you can enumerate them using security.getproviders and provider.getservice

137288
prng	random
it isn t especially fast as prngs go but prngs will just be crunching numbers not blocking for physical measurement of entropy
the exception is that if you don t call setseed before getting data then the prng will seed itself once the first time you call next or nextbytes
it will usually do this using a fairly small amount of true random data from the system

137344
inherited	subclassing
editors are logical subclassing of viewers but since all viewers are subclassing - textviewer imageviewer etc. editor does not derive from viewer thus allowing the final texteditor imageeditor classes to avoid the diamond
in cases where the diamond is not avoidable using virtual inherited
the biggest caveat however with virtual bases is that the constructor for the virtual base must be called by the most derived class meaning that a class that derives virtually has no control over the constructor parameters

137444
prng	random
the sophisticated big sister of this hashing operation is called an entropy collector and all good oses have one
if you re using the data to seed a prng though and the prng can use arbitrarily large seed input then you don t have to hash because it will do that for you
you still have to estimate entropy if you want to know how random your seed value was - you can use the best prng in the world but its entropy is still limited by the entropy of the seed.

post if you want to set the url to a view during a post action you can do it using a redirect in an action invoked by a button or commandlink
notes note that externalcontext.encodeactionurl is used to encode the string

140107
union	distinct
create vw_view_fields6to10 as select id from employees where field6 is not null or field7 is not null or field8 is not null or field 9 is not null or field10 is not null
etc select id from vw_view_fields1to5 union select id from vw_view_fields6to10 ..
etc you d have to take a distinct or something to cut down the rows that fall into more than one view of course

boost	stl

boost thread is great i m not sure whether you can say its part of the language though
it depends if you consider the crt stl boost to be part of c++ or an optional add-on library

142163
post	get
thus you don t attach events to a control that get executed in a code-behind like you would in asp
it relies on the standard http post to do that
it does not use the viewstate object

142214
post	get
if it s really important to get the full string to display in the titlebar of a form then only way i can think of to ensure that the entire title is displayed would be to get the width of the titlebar text and use that to increase the width of your form so that it can accommodate the complete title string
i may come back and post code for this if i can find the right api incantations but it might look something like this in the form_load event


142587
move	drag
by design a detail row only contains records that match the master you cannot for example change an order to belong to a new customer because the detail row does not contain any customer information
if you want to move a detail row to another master you have to create a new detail row for the new master copy the data from the old detail row and delete the old detail row
if you re ambitious you could support cut and paste or drag and drop of detail rows but internally you have to create copy delete

142641
boost	stl
update once you re comfortable with the stl and start needing to do things that require a lot of code with the stl or are just plain tricky then head over to boost
buy a book on boost and read it and understand it well


142657
.htaccess	httpd.conf

the documentroot directive cannot appear in a .htaccess
put it in httpd.conf instead

142667
put	get
being modern frameworks it s easy to get started on a new site and start throwing together pages
python is famously fast to develop and debug and i would put any python framework as having a shorter development time than any other setup i ve worked with including php perl embedded perl and c# asp.net
barriers to entry - developer training and infrastructure if you know python and are willing to watch a 20 minute video tutorial you can create a fairly complete wiki-type site from scratch

142738
mvp	presenter
when working on the presenter the view and model are typically defined as interfaces and mocked so your initial focus is on defining how the user is interacting with your objects
i generally like to work in this way even if i m not doing a strict mvp pattern
i find that focusing on user interaction helps me create business objects that are easier to interact with

142778
.htaccess	httpd.conf
also check that .htaccess is readable by the httpd process
check the error_log - it will tell you of any errors in .htaccess if it s being used. putting an intentional syntax error in .htaccess is a good check to make sure the file is being used -- you should get a 500 error on any page in the same directory
lastly you can enable a rewrite log using commands like the following in your httpd.conf rewritelog logs rewritelog rewriteloglevel 7 the log file thus generated will give you the gory detail of which rewrite rules matched and how they were handled

142870
dbcontext	objectcontext
it is hilarious that the object team made a datacontext and the data team made an objectcontext and on to dataquery vs objectquery etc. naming is hard
update for .net 4 with ef4.1 you might also be interested in dbcontext when working with linqtoentities
see also

142993
put	get

put them on github as public projects and see what the reaction is
you may get more interest on github rather than on sourceforge because there are fewer projects and i think more people like to browse through the available projects on github

143221
bitarray	bitvector

bitarray was the best answer i found when i recently had a similar need
it s a c extension so much faster than bitvector which is pure python and stores its data in an actual bitfield so it s eight times more memory efficient than a numpy boolean array which appears to use a byte per element.

143267
maven	pom.xml
using your build scripts to deploy automatically via the manager interface that comes with tomcat
here are the two ways for maven use the tomcat plugin
you don t need to include it in pom.xml just issue the goal mvn tomcat deploy the plugin is included in maven 2

143271
cout	cin
you can open a file for reading and replace cin s rdbuf with the one from the file
see the link for a example using cout
on unix-like os you could close the 0 file handle stdin and open another file

143381
lisp	scheme
an introductory course in the scheme programming language a dialect of lisp presented as a text adventure - or to put it another way a scheme interpreter with a wee scrap of text adventure wrapped around it
since it s z-code and the first z-code games were written in another lisp variant there s an odd circularity to it all. - carl muckenhoupt

bmp	ppm	bmp	ppm
render your font using whatever arrange the characters in a grid and save the image in a simple uncompressed format like ppm bmp or tga
if you want antialiasing make sure to use a format that supports transparency bmp and tga do
ppm does not

144089
ienumerable	icollection
however many linq methods special case for when the object implementing ienumerable actually implements icollection
i ve seen this for ienumerable.contains at least. in practice this means that linq ienumerable.contains calls the fast hashset.contains for example if the ienumerable actually is a hashset
you can use reflector to check exactly how the linq methods are defined that is how i figured this out

144141
int	chars

the user input is treated as a string that needs to be converted to an int using atoi or another conversion function
atoi will return 0 if the string cannot be interptreted as a number because it contains letters or other non-numeric chars

144245
width	font-size
in many cases it seems more natural to use em rather than points or pixels because it is relative to the font size
for example you might define a text-column to have a width of 40em
if you later decide to change the font-size the column will still keep the same number of letters per line

144332
fgets	atoi
if you re using a gui the function may already deal with conversion to integer and reporting errors and so in an appropriate manner
if you re working with standard c it is generally easier to read the value into a string perhaps with fgets and then convert
although atoi can be used it is seldom the best choice

144594
avr	microcontroller
i have no experience with programming microcontroller in assembly
if you want to try that the avr might be more suitable because of it s bigger user community
as far as i know the cheapest way to program an avr using atmel s tools is the atmel avr isp mkii for 35

144704
put	get
for most users this will probably require them contacting their host or looking up help files in order to get it all setup
so while www.tomsite.com could transparently serve up pages hosted at www.mywebapp.com the users will have to put some kind of effort in
to make it a completely seamless you will need some kind of arrangement with the users web host smugmug appear to have such an arrangement with godaddy

144723
gtk	cairo	kde	gnome

mono does not use qt kde or gtk gnome widgets because they don t match up with the winforms api
mono implements winforms on top of their system.drawing implementation which in turn uses cairo

144890
quicksort	mergesort

all things being equal i d expect most people to use whatever is most conveniently available and that tends to be quicksort 3
other than that quicksort is known to be very fast on arrays just like mergesort is the common choice for lists

144997
inline	inlining
most c++ compilers are smart enough now to inline functions for you
the inline keyword is just a hint to the compiler
some will even do inlining across translation units where they decide it s helpful

145127
factors	mean
and by need i mean have a specific case for the performance profile and specific metrics that indicate that any change will address the issue
if you have an application where memory is going to be the limiting factors then ruby may not be the best choice
that said i have found that my rails apps generally consume about 40-60mb of ram per mongrel instance

145200
ironruby	ironpython
i suspect the team will go for language-completeness rather than performance first
this will allow you to run ironruby run most ruby programs when 1.0 ships then they can improve perf as they go
i suspect ironpython has a similar story

145310
profiling	instrumentation

there are quite a few profiling out there
here are some of the ones i know of red gate s ants yourkit s .net profiler jetbrains dottrace if you go on with using system.diagnostics.stopwatch you will be able to instrumentation and measure only particular points of your code where you explicitly put the start stop around

145331
vim	textmate

you may scoff at this but cream is a very un-vimlike offshoot of vim
here is an article written specifically for textmate and e fans who want to try it

145466
put	get
svnserve if you use svnserve there is a file in each repository which is called svnserve.conf where you can define the password file in use
you could put a password file in the server root and point all your repositories there
it would look like this c svn passwd c svn project1 conf svnserve.conf c svn project2 conf svnserve.conf then in both svnserve.conf files a section like should do the trick and will still keep different acls authz file for each repository apache that is a bit more complicated but as long as you use the same authuserfile for each svn enabled location you will get your result

145503
put	get
after all english or french are natural languages too
- as said above put them under a subsidiary section technology seems to be a good term
looking at my own resume not updated in a while i have made a section just called languages so i can t get wrong.

145503
put	get
looking at my own resume not updated in a while i have made a section just called languages so i can t get wrong.
-d i have put x html and css xml dtd schema and svg at the end of the section clearly separated
in french i have a section langages programming and markup and another langues french english

145843
many-to-many	one-to-many
relational design patters include things like one-to-many relationships master-detail parent-child relationships using a foreign key
many-to-many relationships with a bridge table
optional one-to-one relationships managed with nulls in the fk column

145897
nginx	lighttpd
it s similar to linux-vserver so you might want to compare those two when going this route
i ve setup a webserver with a proxy http server nginx which then delegates traffic to different openvz containers based on hostname or requested path
inside each container you can setup apache or any other webserver nginx lighttpd .. . this way you don t have one apache for everything but could create a container for any subset of services per project

145952
inline	inlining	inline	inlining
it slightly breaks your encapsulation 2 c++ inlining is resolved at compile time
which means that should you change the code of the inline function you would need to recompile all the code using it to be sure it will be updated for the same reason i avoid default values for function parameters when used in a header it makes your header file larger and thus will dilute interesting informations like the list of a class methods with code the user don t care about this is the reason that i declare inline functions inside a class but will define it in an header after the class body and never inside the class body
inlining magic the compiler may or may not inline the functions you marked as inline

145952
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
inlining magic the compiler may or may not inline the functions you marked as inline
it may also decide to inline-functions not marked as inline at compilation or linking time
inline works like a copy paste controlled by the compiler which is quite different from a pre-processor macro the macro will be forcibly inlined will pollute all the namespaces and code won t be easily debuggable and will be done even if the compiler would have ruled it as inefficient

146209
factors	mean

factors out common styles
not styles that just happen to be the same styles that are intended to be the same - where changing the style for one selector will likely mean you ll want to change the other as well

146374
inherited	subclassing
but if instances of a class are supposed to be immutable then making it final is one good way of making sure they really are all immutable that there aren t mutable instances of subclassing kicking around which can be used anywhere that the parent class is called for
i don t think the article you referenced should be taken as an instruction that all immutable classes must be final especially if you have a positive reason to design your immutable class for inherited
what it was saying is that protecting immutability is a valid reason for final where imaginary performance concerns which is what it s really talking about at that point are not valid

146695
sorting	grouping
following oli s example that makes it easy to follow the file structure especially with enough whitespace and clearly marked comments between grouping though not as easy to skim through quickly and easy to edit since you don t have to wade through single long lines of css for each rule
understand and use the cascade and specificity so sorting your selectors alphabetically is right out
whether i split up my css into multiple files and in what files depends on the size and complexity of the site and the css

147112
opera	firefox
addeventlistener input is a direct-user-initiated filtered version of domcontrolvaluechanged
unfortunately domcontrolvaluechanged is only supported by opera currently and input event support is broken in webkit
the input event also has various bugs in firefox and opera

147161
int	double
but here goes start the exponent off at 52 and choose a 52-bit random unsigned int assuming 52 bits of mantissa
if the most significant bit of the int is 0 increase the exponent by one shift the int left by one and fill the least significant bit in with a new random bit
repeat until either you hit a 1 in the most significant place or else the exponent gets too big for your double 1023

147195
put	get
the uri may have a key depends on whether you are doing singleton get or list get
sql select put updates an existing object
the uri has a key

147195
post	put	post	get
further post uri s have no key where put must have a key
when i post i expect a 201 created
if i don t get that something s wrong

147195
put	get	put	get
if i don t get that something s wrong
similarly when i put i expect a 200 ok
if i don t get that something s wrong

147195
post	put	post	get	put	get
if i don t get that something s wrong
i suppose you could insist on some ambiguity where post does either post or put
the uri has to be different

147195
post	put	post	get	put	get
if you re not building a restful interface then it s typical to only use get and post for retrieve and create update
it s common to have uri differences or message content differences to distinguish between post and put when a person is clicking submit on a form
it however isn t very clean because your code has to determine if you re in the post create case or post update case

147281
clang	llvm

under development for now but clang does c analysis and is targeted to handle c++ over time
it s part of the llvm project

149050
int	double
the best native c++ type to use here would be long double
the problem with other approaches that simply use an int is that you have to store more than just your cents
often financial transactions are multiplied by non-integer values and that s going to get you in trouble since 100.25 translated to 10025 0.000123523 apr is going cause problems

149087
decimal	ieee

look in to the relatively recent intelr decimal floating-point math library
it s specifically for finance applications and implements some of the new standards for binary floating point arithmetic ieee 754r

149252
.htaccess	httpd.conf

the documentation says that this can only be set in the php.ini not in .htaccess
you can see this by looking at the table where it says php_ini_system which means - entry can be set in php.ini or httpd.conf

149437
range	max

know your range of data
a float is only good for 6 to 7 digits of precision so that means a max of about +-9999.99 without rounding

149442
google-chrome	safari

at first i believed it was a built-in feature of the wysiwym markdown editor but shog9 is correct it s not baked-in at all but is courtesy of the jquery plugin textarearesizer i was lead astray by the browser was using to check on the editor demo because google-chrome itself adds the expandable functionality on textareas mdash
much like the safari browser does

149699
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri
mri 1.8 have supported them as far as my memory reaches ruby 1.9 yarv does it too so does rubinius
jruby and ironruby don t have continuations and it s quite unlikely they will get them jvm and clr use stack-instrospection for security ruby as a language supports continuations via callcc keyword
they re used for example to implement generator class from standard library

149811
post	get

it should so long as you set your httpservice s method property to post
if you omit it it will default to get and the parameters will be sent as part of the query string not as post data

149918
16-bit	64bit

here is a compilation of verified information from the various answers and cited references in this thread command.com is the 16-bit command processor introduced in ms-dos and was also used in the win9x series of operating systems
cmd.exe is the 32-bit command processor in windows nt 64bit windows oses also have a 64bit version

150009
unsigned	short

i believe that compiler takes a hint to disable padding when you use the unsigned int wwindow 16 syntax
also note that a short is not guaranteed to be 16 bits

150148
filtering	grouping
filtering and binding are done on another class dataview dotnet datagrid hides this a little
extract method is the nearest a datatable provides in termes of filtering it returns an array of pointers to datarows
grouping is not so powerful as in tclientdataset as also indexing is poorer

150195
put	get
privacy of your private keys
keytool doesn t have key export built in to avoid accidental disclosure of this sensitive material so you might want to consider some extra safeguards that could be put in place to protect your exported keys
here is some simple code that gives you unencrypted pkcs #8 privatekeyinfo that can be used by openssl see the -nocrypt option of its pkcs8 utility if you need other formats you can use a keyfactory to get a transparent key specification for different types of keys

150196
hide	show

by default asp.net web applications will hide errors from remote machines accessing the site and will only return the generic runtime error
asp.net will only show application specific error messages when the site is accessed locally if the asp.net application server is running on your local development machine or if you open up a web browser on the server hosting the asp.net web application

150283
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
so for learning scheme lisp javascript isn t a bad start
note though that functional languages like lisp are quite different from pure functional languages such as haskell
apart from first-class functions meaning that functions are values that can be assigned to variables lexical scope is also an inherent part of what makes a functional language

150593
firefox	safari
safari 3.1 for webkit opera for presto
i m pretty sure firefox will start supporting html5 partially in 3.1 all support is extremely partial
check here for information on what is supported

150835
filesystems	ntfs

please note however that using the default filesystems under both win32 and nix there is no way to guarantee the atomicity of the operation if you check for the existence of files a b and c some other process or thread might have deleted file a after you passed it and while you were looking for b and c
filesystems such as transactional ntfs can overcome this limitation

150879
ssl	https
compare http with https on the same setup
the latency can be mitigated to some extent by ensuring that your server is using http keepalives - this allows the client to reuse ssl sessions which avoids the need for another handshake reducing the number of requests to as few as possible - by combining resources where possible .js include files css and encouraging client-side caching reduce the number of page loads by loading data not required into the page perhaps in a hidden html element and then showing it using client-script


150883
put	get
the variables do not get assigned to null in this case
if you put this code at the start of the loop it will correctly fail faster if you change your code to fetch a key without joining and then fetching the related data by key in a second query you ll win


150940
folder	directory

you can go into iis 6 and the properties for your website s folder you want to protect
click directory security tab and uncheck allow anonymous

150988
floating-point	integer
note that doing this correctly requires multiple-precision integers at least a certain percentage of the time in order to handle corner cases
algorithms for going the other way printing the best decimal number from a floating-number are found in burger and dybvig s printing floating-point numbers quickly and accurately downloadable here
this also requires multiple-precision integer arithmetic see also david m gay s correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions for algorithms going both ways

151336
installation	upgrade
simple reason is that msi files are not pe files they are sort-of database
msiexec.exe then interprets this database to do the actual installation
the version property you mention is used by msi engine internally for upgrade uninstalls etc and is never displayed

151612
boost	stl
implementing the iterators is the most challenging
i used boost iterator_facade to implement the iterators
using boost iterator_facade you can easy adapt any cached on disk data structures to have a stl container interface

151912
postgresql	mysql

this is the sequence solution for postgresql you d have to do it in a stored procedure or on your application code of course
for mysql the transaction is important not to trip on your own feet in case you re using the same connection for more than one insert

151938
inline	inlining

there are several situations where the compiler is not able to determine categorically whether it is appropriate or beneficial to inline a function
inlining may involve trade-off s that the compiler is unwilling to make but you are e.g code bloat

152132
versioning	upgrade
it uses more disk space but disk is cheap
doing it this way we can stay with versioning 1 of a project until upgrading to versioning 1.5 is absolutely necessary
you still have the job with adding dll s when deciding to upgrade to a other versioning of the dll though

152425
put	get
but don t just take my word for it in access-ordered linked hash maps merely querying the map with get is a structural modification the linked hash map s javadoc if you are absolutely sure that there are no caches no collection statistics no optimizations no funny stuff at all - you don t need to sync
in that case i would have put a type constraint on the collection don t declare the collection as a map which would allow linkedhashmap but as hashmap for the purists a final subclass of hashmap but that might be taking it too far...


152502
post	get
it s just like ivalueconverter except that it works with multibinding to pass more than one value into a class and get back a single value
here s a post i found with a run-through on imultivalueconverter and multibinding edit if imultivalueconverter isn t available it looks like silverlight only has ivalueconverter then you can always pass your entire bound object eg your person object to an ivalueconverter and use various properties from that to return your brush


153015
udp	tcp
since ip has become the dominant protocol a port in networking terms has become synonomous with either a udp or tcp port number - which is a portion of the socket address
udp is connection-less - meaning no virtual circuit between the 2 endpoints is ever created
however we still refer to udp sockets as the endpoint

153200
stateless	stateful
object orientation is stateful --you refer to an object and can call methods on it while maintaining state within a session where the object is still in scope
rest is stateless --everything you want to do with a resource is specified in a single message and all you ever need to know regarding that message is sent back in a single response
in object-orientation there is no concept of universal object identity --objects either get identity from their memory address at any particular moment a framework-specific uuid or from a database key

153386
put	get
you can get the statement handle to tell you what has gone wrong with it by calling when sqlexecdirect returns something other than sql_success or sql_success_with_info you ll have to allocate the variables you see here of course.
i suggest you put a throw away line after the sqlgetdiagrec call and assign a breakpoint to it
when it breaks there you can look at state s value that will align with the diagnostics section here

153411
profiling	debugging
lesson initialize your locals
if someone barks performance at you show them this comment and tell them that you d rather spend two weeks running profiling code and fixing bottlenecks rather than having to track down bugs like this
debugging tools and heap checkers have gotten way better since i had to do this but quite frankly they got better to compensate for bugs from poor practices like this

153477
webclient	httpwebrequest	webclient	httpwebrequest
for instance in the httpwebrequest object this method is overloaded to provide the content-type header
i m not sure what instance of webresponse the webclient is using
if you only want html files your best of using the httpwebrequest object directly

153906
profiling	instrumentation
in the kind of applications i ve worked on adding instrumentation often slows the product down so much that it doesn t work anymore true story start app go home come back next day app still initializing
also with non instrumented profiling you can react to live problems
for example with vtune remote date collector i can start up a sampling session against a live server with hundreds of simultaneous connections that is experiencing performance problems and catch issues that happen in production that i d never be able to replicate in a test environment

153935
datamapper	activerecord
in a situation like yours consider delving into patterns of enterprise application architecture by martin fowler
at first sight it looks like you want to create a datamapper
but consider alternatives like activerecord s that might be enough for your needs

154070
client-side	server-side
if you re generating the link on the server we would need to know what server-side language you re using to give more specific advice
if you re generating the tag client-side as a string in javascript don t do that use document.createelement use the string.replace method on the argument string to pick out characters that will break the syntax you re generating and replace them with escaped versions


154490
int	chars
store each number- word in a multimap you need to allow for multiple value on single key while scanning the wordlist compute the hash in the same way for each word then get the word s associated with the computed key on the hashmap
using int as key you have a retrieval of o 1
this way you could find in a really quick way if the processed word has some anagram you multiplied chars inside the map

155000
put	get
consider this slightly modified example if you want the parseall method to return null if there are any errors like the original example you d put the try catch on the outside like this in reality you should probably return an error here instead of null and generally i don t like having multiple returns but you get the idea
on the other hand if you want it to just ignore the problems and parse whatever strings it can you d put the try catch on the inside of the loop like this


155189
post	get

i was going to comment on bkimmel s post but apparently i don t have enough so cool points yet
if excel is already open you can get that annoying personal.xls is already open message

156024
x86	64bit
bootstrapper contains main entry point for the executable and it registers a custom assembly resolver in current appdomain program is the real implementation of the application note that app.run was invoked at the end of bootstrapper.main step 4 compile the main application on command line cmd.exe from note 2 csc reference platform x86 library.dll out program.exe program.cs bootstrapper.cs step 5 we re now finished
the structure of the directory we created should be as follows if you now run program.exe on a 32bit platform platform x86 library.dll will be loaded
if you run program.exe on a 64bit platform platform amd64 library.dll will be loaded

156413
stdout	fflush

by default if stdout or cout is printing to a console the output is line buffered
this means that every newline that is printed will fflush the output

156466
inline	inlining
whether a function is inlined is at the discretion of your compiler
in my experience most modern compilers are good at determining when to comply with a user s request to inline
in many cases inlining a function will improve its performance

156652
public	protected
and you can set up state invoke delegate methods easily to test them
you also don t have public vs
protected vs

156772
inherited	properties
if the object is an data entity ie
you are binding its values to something in the xaml tree then there is no need to inherited from dependencyobject
if the properties on the object are read-write you may want to implement inotifypropertychanged which will allow bindings to automatically update when the value changes

157180
folder	directory
first create a directory inside your eclipse installation folder for example opt eclipse called links
within this folder you can create .link files for example emfplugins.link
each link file points to a product extension location

157456
perforce	svn
it s easier to set up and get running
some of our members really like the ms office plugin for perforce i m on a mac so i can t use it
but the svn clients are better especially the eclipse plugin

157456
perforce	svn
but the svn clients are better especially the eclipse plugin
perforce is more expensive
these are merely opinions so perhaps this is a poor answer if i was already using one or the other i d be very hard pressed to switch since neither seems to offer really significant benefits over the other but the disruption in switching could be large

157551
perforce	svn

i have used both and in my experience perforce makes a lot of sense if you have a big team and or codebase
otherwise i would pick svn - it is easier to set up and maintain

157625
perforce	svn

it has features analogous to those available in perforce but is free foss
either is a great alternative to svn when working with a large team

157718
stdout	stderr
in that case my advice would be to use stderr rather than stdout
it is unbuffered by default and you can redirect it separately from stdout putting your output in one place and your logging in another


157949
client-side	server-side
a form should always have server-side validation
client-side validation is only there as a convenience
a malicious user could easily post data to your form bypassing any client-side validation that you have in place

158824
pdfbox	itextsharp	pdfbox	itext
if you re looking for something a little more diy there s the itextsharp library - a port of java s itext - and pdfbox yes it says java - but they have a .net version by way of ikvm.net
here s some codeproject articles on using itextsharp and pdfbox from c#
and if you re really a masochist you could call into adobe s pdf ifilter with com interop

158905
ssl	https

if you can t get an answer on the rewriterule syntax here are two other options for you write an custom irule on bigip see f5 devcentral that looks for 301 responses and convert them to ssl
let the url pass into your websphere server and do a programmatic redirect that sends out https

158905
ssl	https
let the url pass into your websphere server and do a programmatic redirect that sends out https
however because f5 terminates the ssl connection you have to set a custom header that you configure see pq86347 so the java request.getscheme works as you would expect


158997
actionscript	mxml
actionscript is used to program behaviors components and other things outside or what mxml does
thus if you want to attach an event to a component one would write actionscript code
hope that helps

159073
unsigned	short
read the following link
also the standard says that it is implementation-defined which integral type is used as the underlying type for an enum except that it shall not be larger than int unless some value cannot fit into int or an unsigned int
in short you cannot rely on an enum being either signed or unsigned

159308
unsigned	short
here s what the c++03 standard iso iec 14882 2003 document says in 7.2-5 enumeration declarations the underlying type of an enumeration is an integral type that can represent all the enumerator values defined in the enumeration
it is implementation-defined which integral type is used as the underlying type for an enumeration except that the underlying type shall not be larger than int unless the value of an enumerator cannot fit in an int or unsigned int
in short your compiler gets to choose obviously if you have negative numbers for some of your ennumeration values it ll be signed

159394
post	get
i started using eclipse by jumping into the deep end of the pool writing an rcp before ever learning the ide
the ide was intuitive to use and when i found the right news groups to post to - most of my questions were already answered
the hardest thing for me and frustrating admittedly was knowing how to phrase my search terms in order to get to the answer that was already posted

159454
width	height	width	height
you need to listen for width changes on the content composite mparent compute the minimum height again given the new content width and call setminheight on the scrolled composite with new height
in listening for size changes note that we ignore any resize events where the width stays the same
this is because changes in the height of the content do not affect the minimum height of the content as long as the width is the same

159489
ssl	https
the redirect will be returned to the client in http mode rather than https causing the ssl session to fail
following is an example of how an http 302 redirect response causes the ssl session to fail to request an ssl session a user types without a trailing slash
the client browser sends an ssl request to the clientssl virtual server which resides on the big-ip ltm system

159489
ssl	https	ssl	https
when the client receives the http 302 redirect response it sends a new request to the big-ip ltm virtual server that specifies http not https
as a result the ssl connection fails
configuring an http profile to rewrite urls in big-ip ltm version 9.x you can configure an http profile to rewrite urls so that redirects from an http server specify the https protocol

159507
swt	swing	swt	swing
as for java both netbeans and eclipse ides are good choices. to design guis in java you can use swt awt or swing widget toolkits
i heard that some people experienced problems with swt projects running on netbeans
however netbeans comes with a built-in gui builder for swing a very powerful widget toolkit. of course there s also a plug-in for eclipse that allows you to build swing guis so it basically comes down to which ide you prefer.

160021
versioning	upgrade
i got all the right python scripts to upgrade all the versioning history and we have been using svn happily for nearly 4 years
that s right the heavy lifter of the versioning control systems sourcesafe
i would definately stick with svn or even look at some of the newer distributed systems such as mercurial

160067
cvs	svn
getting all the branches and tags exactly correct might be a bit more work but if you want to just save revision history for a few branches it should be pretty easy
i m also of the opinion that you won t really gain anything by switching back to cvs but if you want to do so then you ll likely be writing your own script
the svn export command will undoubtedly be useful in this endeavor

160407
accessor	properties
if you do want them in a java file despite the shortcomings already mentioned it s a lot easier to write a program to morph the properties file into a java source file than it is to try and extract the strings from free-form java source
all you then need to do is modify the accessor class to use the in-built strings in the separate class rather than loading them at run time


160899
rss	feed
you could use the fetch page module trim it to just the items inside the news feed loop though each list item and use an item builder module to mangle the relevant bits as a proper rss feed
then in the head of your document you d put in an rss link like so this is of course completely ass-backwards but would work for a quick fix or in situations where you had no control over the body of the page


161358
persistent	transient	persistent	transient
but when you have a transient object there is no session involved
in these cases you need to use merge for updates and persistent for saving
persistent as mentioned above this is used on transient objects

161464
maven	pom.xml

one of the main benefits of using maven is that you need to specify the dependencies build-setup and deployment methods once and then you can run them in multiple environments
in particular you can have your continuous integration nightly build environment run these tasks simply by using the pom.xml file

161503
cassini	iis
in this case you need to change the regional settings of the account under which the asp.net app is running
if you are developing with vs2005 or later you re probably running under the cassini web server under the identity of the current user - so just change the current user s settings
if you re using iis you probably want to change the regional settings of the aspnet account - you can do this from regional settings in the control panel by checking the checkbox apply to current user and to the default user profile

161767
ubuntu	centos

ubuntu should get the job done but you might consider a slightly more server oriented distro
in my shop we use centos 5 which is more of an enterprise-oriented distro

161983
struts	stripes
i don t want to start some kind of flame development platform war but in my opinion stripes is a far superior and easier to use framework than struts we migrated from struts a year ago and have never looked back
that said yes you can integrate gwt with struts without too many hassles in fact if you do your entire ui in gwt you don t even need struts you can just rpc straight to your java back end
if you just want to make small components then gwt will work well for that too and i guess you could shudder pass it your struts forms if you wanted to

162664
struts	stripes
servlets is the most basic of the action frameworks and is the basic upon all of the others are built
struts is the most popular action framework but i can t in good conscience recommend it to anyone
struts 2 and stripes are more modern and very similar to each other

162996
perforce	cvs

pretty much any modern version control system will allow this subversion perforce vault git mercurial tfs etc.
the only ones i can think of that won t or that have major caveats are cvs and vss

163084
distance	polygons
i am not putting down mysql spatial only letting you know of the pitfalls before you get too far along on this
if you are dealing strictly with points and only the distance function this is fine
if you need to do any calculations with polygons lines or buffered-points the spatial operators do not provide exact results unless you use the relate operator

163277
implements	extends
it is however extremely useful and important to comment the code with references to the records in the defects tracking system or to that extends to any km repository you might have
sometimes a code is changed to implements a workaround to a certain issue with the application behaviour
sometimes the introduced workaround is in no way logical

163395
google-chrome	firefox
after noticing that some of you are still trying to get this to work i decided to try a new approach
my results are far better this time around - at least on google-chrome on linux
i no longer have a windows pc available to me so i can only test on google-chrome firefox on ubuntu

163411
hide	show
this icon allows you to select cells in the workbook to pull the data from
when you click it the wizard temporarily hide itself except for the field you are working in allowing you to interact with the workbook
select the appropriate sheet in the workbook and then select the fields with the data you want to show in the chart

163483
prepare	execute

you should be able to prepare a sql query to validate the syntax and get result set metadata
preparing a query should not execute it

163544
int	chars	int	chars
this would print whatever is found on memory address 120 and go on printing until a null chars was found
it is wrong and illegal to perform this printf statement but it would probably work anyway since a pointer actually is of the type int in many environments
imagine the problems you might cause if you were to use sprintf instead and assign this way too long chars array to another variable that only got a certain limited space allocated

163891
put	get

i have found the technical debt metaphor very useful when trying to talk non-technical people into put money to support the improvement of the code base
the basic idea is that producing more features by letting the quality of the code suffer is like getting a loan in order to take advantage of an oportunity you can do it but if you never pay back the loan you will get overhelmed by the interests

164013
int	chars
however in practice with compilers for many 32-bit machines you will find - chars 8 bit short 16 bit int 32-bit long 32-bit long long 64-bit if supported the c standard basiucally says that a long can t be shorter than an int which can t be shorter than a short etc.
for 64-bit cpus those often don t change but you must beware that pointers and int are frequently not the same size


164502
content-length	content-type
first the http headers involved content-type multipart form-data content-length this depends on the sum of the bytes of the contents then you have to build a string with the contents of a post form
lets assume you have the input named file file filename.txt you now add the content of the file after that carriage return you calculate the length of this string and put on the content-length above
ok a complete http request would look like this now some code from the php manual knowing me i ve probably messed the format for the content but this is the general idea

164870
public	protected
attributes that begin with _ in python are generally accepted to be protected in that things that are closely bound and intimate with its implementation can use them but things that are updated with the implementation must change when it changes
however there is a way through the public interface that you can access the key for your reference-property so that it will be safe in the future
i ll revise the above example when you access properties via the class it is associated you get the property object itself which has a public method that can get the underlying values

165182
int	boolean

you re right that it is checking if the variable x is equal to well maybe int 0
however if this is true then it doesn t return the absolute value of y it returns a boolean the result of the operator

165432
put	get
i printed out a keyboard layout and taped it below my monitor so i could refer to it without looking down at the keys
later once i learned where the keys were i printed out stickers and put them on the keys caps
to this day i just rely on the os layout switching to get dvorak

165651
put	get

a better way might be to put title attributes in your html
that way if someone has javascript turned off they ll still get a tool tip albeit not as pretty flexible as you can do with jquery

166336
lisp	scheme
on the other hand a c programmer may well consider cl a functional language
most code written in any lisp dialect is certainly much more functional in style than your usual block of c code after all
likewise scheme is very much an imperative language as compared to haskell

167036
cpu	processors
however for processing-intensive tasks more threads than processors actually creates overhead
it seems like your threads are doing all cpu work so i d stick to one thread per core - test to find the optimal number though
the biggest overhead created is from context switching freezing one thread and loading the execution context of the next one as well as cache misses when threads are doing tasks with different memory if your thread can use the cpu cache effectively

167062
put	get
you want everything in one repository if you don t need that level of access control especially if you need to be able to copy or move files between projects projects might share code
put your trunk tags branch split at whatever level corresponds to a chunk of code you might release as a single package think of where you would tag
this isn t critical to get right at first since these no different internally from any other folder so you can just move things around later though of course it s neater not to have that problem

167303
put	get
you could use transactions to make sure that updates are resolved correctly that you do not get partial updates but you would probably lose the first set of changes as it will be overwritten by the second
two options you probably have are implement some locking mechanism on the application level when someone start editing a record put some flag somewhere which would prevent another user from doing the same implement version control so each time someone writes to the database a new record is created
this way both sets of data will be in the database and you could have a logic in your application to merge them or select the one you like

167308
inherited	properties
is if you can somehow separate the properties that you want to set .
according the inherited hierarchy of the element you want to set multiple styles on .
you might have a workaround

167434
boost	stl
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost
boost only provides the tr1 containers for those compilers that do not yet include tr1


167536
accessor	properties
moreover simply making all your properties atomic does not make your application thread-safe
also note of course that if you don t specify nonatomic and implement your own accessor methods rather than synthesising them you must implement them in an atomic fashion


168060
range	max	range	min
it is possible to define an enumeration that has values not defined by any of its enumerators. so for example defines an enumerated type where e min is 1 and e max is 4
if the underlying type is signed int then the smallest required bitfield has 4 bits and if ints in your implementation are two s complement then the valid range of the enum is -8 to 7
if the underlying type is unsigned then it has 3 bits and the range is 0 to 7

168129
scheme	racket

plt scheme features a built-in continuation-based web server
update plt scheme is now called racket

168366
onclick	onsubmit	submit	submission	submit	submission
unlike your form this is a plain old postback - it s not using anything client-side to trigger the form submission no client-side validation etc
if i attach an onclick handler to the submit button i can see that the button is being clicked - but if i attach an onsubmit handler to the form i get nothing
if i make the button onclick handler submit the form through javascript it works fine - it s just the direct submission that s not working

168723
profiling	debugging

sql server profiling is my tool of choice but only for the db end obviously
it should be noted this is for optimizing queries and performance and debugging

169351
ant	maven

forget ant
maven is the way to go if you ask me

169351
maven	pom.xml
you specify your dependencies in the maven pom.xml project object model - its basically an xml description of your project and maven automatically downloads compiles against them and packages them with your app
other really nice features are release management and distribution publication - perform releases using maven console commands
this feature will tag your code base in source control

169516
put	get

if the drives support raid configurations in your bios you should do one of the following raid 1 mirror - since this is a dev machine this will give you the fault tolerance and peace of mind that your code is safe and the environment since they are such a pain to put together
you get better performance on reads because it can read from both either drive

169755
boost	allocator
with boost you can pick and choose what you use
we use smart_ptr and boost bind in all of our projects
we write software for cheap cell phones . and if windows ce can run on your hardware i would expect that parts of boost would be applicable. there are parts of boost that have no allocator and you might find them useful

171324
put	get

put this at your start ob_start
and to get the buffer back value ob_get_contents

171371
multiplying	multiplication
iir filter
the fir filter works by keeping a series of samples and multiplying each of those samples by a fixed coefficient which is based on the position in the series
the results of each of these multiplication is accumulated and is the output for that sample

171376
lisp	scheme
the make-array definition with examples however if you must be functional that is you want to keep around both the old and new lists you want the old and new to share as much memory as possible
then you should use the common lisp equivalent of hazzen s code this looks slow because it is and that s probably why it s not included in the standard
hazzen s code is the scheme version which is useful is that s what you re using

171443
ubuntu	linux
the three overlay filesystems that i know of in linux are unionfs aufs and minifo
unionfs is included in recent ubuntu kernels


171644
free	malloc
a pwsz frequently has different semantics for those
2 a bstr must be allocated and free with the sysalloc family of functions
a pwsz can be an automatic-storage buffer from the stack or allocated with malloc new localalloc or any other memory allocator

171994
post	put	post	get

html forms support get and post
html5 at one point added put delete but those were dropped. xmlhttprequest supports every method including chicken though some method names are matched against case-insensitively methods are case-sensitive per http and some method names are not supported at all for security reasons connect

172007
versioning	upgrade
virtualenv allows you to have multiple different python library trees
at work we use virtualenv with a bootstrapping environment to quickly set up a development production environment where we are all in sync w.r.t library versioning etc
we generally coordinate library upgrade

172269
pull	push
as a distributed version control system through its push pull system it helps developers to create a source code eco-system which helps to manage a large pool of developers working on a single project
for example say you trust 5 developers and only pull codes from their repository
each of those developers has their own trust network from where they pull codes

172270
accessor	properties

always use accessor methods
declare accessors using properties you make life much simpler for yourself if you always use accessor methods to assign values to instance variables except in and dealloc methods

172280
post	put
first add the following to your web.config in the newtelligence.dasblog.urlmapper section now you can create a directory in your content directory called static
from there you can create html files and the file name will map to the url like this will map to a file called content static filename.format.html you can place anything in that file that you would normally place in itemtemplate.blogtemplate except it obviously won t have any post data
but you can essentially use this to put other macros and still have it use the hometemplate.blogtemplate to keep the rest of your theme wrapped around the page

172399
put	get
there is also the question of logging for auditing a log file can be written containing information on what the user is doing - so you can use that to narrow down the possibilities to debug a problem or even to verify the user s claims if you get a report that the system is broken xyz didn t happen you can look in the logs to find out the operator failed to start the process or didn t click the right option to make it work then there s logging for reporting which is what most people think logging is for
if you can tailor the log output then put everything in logs and reduce or increase the amount of data that gets written
if you can change the output level dynamically then that s perfect

172899
wordpress	joomla
you can check out that site at chhobi.net
if you don t have many complex requirements i think wordpress is not a bad idea
if you need to expand the site later on and add different functionality like forums gallery polls etc. you better go for a proper cms solution like joomla drupal and likewise

172929
g++	gcc
as i understand both decide whether to compile a program as c or as c++ based on the filename extension
both are capable of linking against the c++ standard library but only g++ does this by default
so if you have a program written in c++ that doesn t happen to need to link against the standard library gcc will happen to do the right thing

172929
g++	gcc
so if you have a program written in c++ that doesn t happen to need to link against the standard library gcc will happen to do the right thing
but then so would g++
so there s really no reason not to use g++ for general c++ development

172961
post	get
also i can easily create one for you if you want just leave a comment on this answer you ll get 10 off and i a month free
i won t post the directly here because it may seem that was the intention behind this post - which was not
this account is unmanaged but it provides root access

173007
g++	gcc	g++	gcc
gcc gnu c compiler g++ gnu c++ compiler the main differences gcc will compile .c .cpp files as c and c++ respectively
g++ will compile .c .cpp files but they will all be treated as c++ files
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this

173090
floating-point	fractions
its only possible purpose for existing is for winning an obfusticated code contest
there s no significance to the long numbers you posted -- they re an artifact of the underlying floating-point implementation filtered through god-knows how many intermediate layers
bit-shifting by a fractions number of bytes is insane and i m surprised it doesn t raise an exception -- but that s javascript always willing to redefine insane

173101
int	chars	int	chars
multiple table example however if you wanted to allow a single player to have multiple different chars you would want to split this data across two different tables
for example you might do the following -- track information on the player create table players id int not null username varchar2 32 not null password varchar2 32 not null email varchar2 160 constraint pk_players primary key id
-- track information on the chars create table chars id int not null player_id int not null chars varchar2 32 not null status varchar2 32 hitpoints int constraint pk_characters primary key id

173406
firefox	safari
currently i believe that safari is the only shipping browser to support any of these and i believe it only supports the client side databases and local storage parts
edit olliej correction firefox 3 supports the application cache but alas not the client side db


173419
profiling	benchmarking
into your code allowing you to arbitrarily benchmarking any section of code note only recommended for short sections not things taking dozens of milliseconds or more
its accurate to the clock cycle though in some rare cases it can change how the code in between is compiled in which case you re better off with a profiling though profiling are generally more effort to use for specific sections of code
it only works on x86

174568
spaces	delimiter	spaces	delimiter
the only problem i haven t resolved is the comma delimiter
here is a query on a similar structure that separates the tags using a spaces
edit here is the complete version using your tables and using a comma delimiter i suppose for future reference i should explain a bit about what is going on

174728
boost	allocator	boost	stl
as evan mentioned writing proper allocator can help with this but if you re counting every byte used or concerned with memory fragmentation it may be wiser to hand-roll a solution that s tailored for your specific problem as the stl has been optimized for the most general usage
you may also choose not to use stl for a particular case because more applicable containers exist that are not in the current standard such as boost array or boost unordered_map


175435
ubuntu	linux
however in my experience and observation more sites running php are running on linux than windows
getting apache and php setup on something like ubuntu or fedora is a cinch and testing everything is pretty simple too
i prefer to do development on the platform it will be running on whenever possible

175787
int	chars
+num returns the numeric value of the string or nan if the string isn t purely numeric chars examples + 12 12 + 12. 12 + 12.. nan + .12 0.12 + ..12 nan + foo nan + 12px nan to convert a string loosely to a number useful for converting 12px to 12 for example parseint num extracts a numeric value from the start of the string or nan. examples parseint 12 12 parseint aaa nan parseint 12px 12 parseint foo2 nan these last two may be different parseint 12a5 12 from what you expected to see
floats bear in mind that unlike +num parseint as the name suggests will convert a float into an int by chopping off everything following the decimal point if you want to use parseint because of this behaviour you re probably better off using another method instead + 12.345 12.345 parseint 12.345 12 parseint 12.345 12 empty strings empty strings may be a little counter-intuitive
+num converts empty strings to zero and isnan assumes the same + 0 isnan false but parseint does not agree parseint nan

google-chrome	safari
it is a good idea to read the new web standards and take in account what microsoft prepares for ie8
then you can try to be compatible with google-chrome
finally there should be a very specific customer request to invest the time and money making support for the other browsers like opera safari e.t.c

one of the elements you can put in that node is
so you should be able to pass in something like i may be off a bit syntatically didn t try to build and run a query when making this post but the general idea should be sound
you can see more details on this in the msdn getlistitems reference

176071
google-chrome	firefox
if the interface does not rely heavily on javascript then it must degrade gracefully enough to be usable in text based and mobile browsers such as opera mobile links lynx iphone etc this includes any necessary optimisations for the screen size informational non-application sites must be at least tested with a screenreader i will put no significant effort into supporting firefox 1 and ie5.5 or below
new functionality must be tested and at least working with upcoming browsers such as ie8 and google-chrome
it s pointless ignoring these as they are both likely to become very popular in the coming months and years

176144
opera	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
my support list in order of priority currently looks like this unless a client expresses a need to expand it safari 3 firefox 2 firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 beta public-facing functionality works looks correct in ie 6 google-chrome the reason i take this approach is that first it s best to work in a standards-compliant browser before tweaking to broken engines
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

176144
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also a side effect of targeting safari first ie is likely to be less painful as the webkit team has gone to great lengths to comply with existing practices wherever possible
google-chrome comes last because it s so likely to just work if safari is good to go
edit firefox 2 comes before firefox 3 because its support set is more restricted

176181
integer	unsigned
note that the calls that use a constant int that don t specify a type suffix will resolve to so you ll get an error calling foo 1 if you don t specialize on int
if this is the case callers using a literal integer constant will have to use the u suffix to get the call to resolve this might be the behavior you want
otherwise you ll have to specialize on int and use the u suffix or cast it to an unsigned int before passing it on to the unsigned int version or maybe do an assert that the value isn t negative if that s what you want

176193
versioning	upgrade
so upgrade to delphi 2007 or 2009 and get it built in
they are both very stable versioning with a lot of new features


176271
client-side	server-side

never never never use javascript or any other client-side technology for the only validation
you can use client-side validation to save some load on your server or make your app seem more responsive by showing the error sooner when validation fails but you should always validate using server-side code

176285
client-side	server-side

depending on the requirements of your project you may or may not want to implement client-side validation
however server-side validation should always be implemented

177234
free	malloc
ie if we were managing 10 byte buffers we might make a single malloc that contained space for 100 of these buffers to reduce fragmentation and the number of underlying mallocs needed
at the front of each buffer would be a pointer that would be used to chain the buffers in a free list
when the 100 buffers were allocated each buffer would be chained together in the free list

177376
hash	md5
personally i d use md5 if you need to store in text or a 256b 32b hash such as sha256 if you can store in binary in this situation
truncating another hash algorithm to 33b works too and may increase the possibility of generating hash collisions
it depends alot on the algorithm

177584
put	get
if your customer wants similar html output of a different data source say you can get away with coding a new controller that provides a different data set to the same old html view which gives the same html report just with other data
if you keep your view detached from specific controllers and put the knowledge about which view to call from your controller you re well on your way


178368
inherited	properties

consider just using composition instead of trying to simulate multiple inherited
you can use interfaces to define what classes make up the composition eg isteerable implies a properties of type steeringwheel ibrakable implies a properties of type brakepedal etc

178687
post	get

if you can output to post script some printers will print anything that gets ftped to a certain directory on them
we used this to get past the print credits that our university exposed on us but if your service outputs to a ps then you can just ftp the ps file to the printer

178956
for-loop	arrays
usually this is how people create associative arrays or hashes because js doesn t natively support that data structure
though note that it is still a fully-fledged object you can even add functions as properties and you can iterate through the properties using a for-loop


179126
post	get
this is the reason why you get internet explorer 6 when you uninstall internet explorer 7
chris wilson internet explorer architect addressed this issue in a blog post multiple ies on one machine
chris states that on-the-fly replacement of mshtml.dll might work for css rendering ...but it s not the same as having a full set of new internet explorer system dlls installed and would certainly not be considered a definitive solution

verilog	vhdl
for hdl choice verilog is to c as vhdl is to ada
so verilog is easier to get started with but you can make mistakes more easily
check your simulation and compilation warnings to avoid those problems

180462
inherited	properties

i also heavily recommend looking into a component based design using composition rather than inherited
the gist of the idea is to model object based on their underlying properties and allow the properties to do all of the work for you

180634
inherited	subclassing

i ve always used inherited rather than super
probably due to a delphi background and i always make it private to avoid the problem when the inherited is erroneously omitted from a class but a subclassing tries to use it

180872
prepare	execute
then execute select my_column from my_table where search_column in select value from myvalues ugly but a viable alternative if your list of values is very large
this technique has the added advantage of potentially better query plans from the optimizer check a page for multiple values tablescan only once instead once per value etc may save on overhead if your database doesn t cache prepare statements
your inserts would need to be done in batch and the myvalues table may need to be tweaked to have minimal locking or other high-overhead protections

181118
client-side	server-side
you can then use the link button s server-side click event
if you re looking for a client-side click event - just type it into your server control markup asp.net will emit additional attributes in the html markup that generates


181245
bash	zsh

it serves as a good warning to those of us that don t use bash as our shell because we we ll forget that a feature that s in our day-to-day shell isn t going to be available when this code is run at the appointed time
the use of there is perfectly valid zsh but not sbin sh

matlab	simulink
however if one really needs speed than he can choose to implement the tested logic in c c++ etc
for further comparison with python i can say that matlab provides a full package for you to do your work without the need of looking around for external libraries and implementing extra functions
one last point about matlab which i see is not mentioned in the answers here is that it has a very powerful visual modeling simulation environment called simulink

181492
post	get
you ll quickly get a feel for when you want to crunch plot or explore in matlab and when you want to have all that python offers
lots of engineers turn to pre and post processing in python or perl
occasionally even just calling out to matlab for the hard bits

181801
innodb	myisam
i d definitely make sure you are familiar with indexing techniques and the specifics of the database you plan to use
with regards to your slow count on the huge table i would assume you were using the innodb table type in mysql
i have some tables with over 100 million records using myisam under mysql and the count is very quick

181807
disk	ram
if your server has plenty of ram consider increasing mysql s buffer size
make sure your disk are configured correctly -- dma enabled not sharing a drive or cable with the swap partition etc


181815
firefox	safari

for me both the bbc sites you link to get the proper characters in the window title bar using firefox or ie on windows
i suspect you don t have the right fonts installed though i m not sure entirely what fonts it is that you would be missing to cause this problem particularly not if safari works

182092
int	boolean
a sql parameter can only be a single value so you d have to do where buildingid in buildingid1 buildingid2 buildingid3... which of course requires you to know how many building ids there are or to dynamically construct the query
as a workaround i ve done the following which will replace the text of the statement with the numbers ending up as something like where buildingid in 1 2 3 4 note that this is getting close to a sql injection vulnerability but since it s an int array is safe
arbitrary strings are not safe but there s no way to embed sql statements in an integer or datetime boolean etc

182113
put	get
something like the following in c# because i m not comfortable with the linq syntax in vb you ll get back a list of anonymous types containing that projection and you can bind the appropriate column to somepropertyfromb

the latest versions of ubuntu include an installer called wubi which installs ubuntu as a windows application ie it can be uninstalled from add remove programs and sets up the dual boot for you
it s great for those who want to give linux a try without a system overhaul

182684
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

as a slight aside when looping through an arrays or other collection in .net i find to be more readable than the numeric for-loop
this of course assumes that the actual counter int itself isn t used in loops code

182776
getdate	datepart
dateadd datepart number date datediff datepart startdate enddate if you run just the most inner call to datediff you get the current month number since timestamp 0
select datediff m 0 getdate
1327 the next part adds that number of months plus 1 to the 0 timestamp giving you the starting point of the next calendar month

184285
put	get
when this happened to me the culprit was in the class that i wrote to wrap unsafe calls to an external api
i put cleanup code in the class s destructor expecting the code to be called when the object went out of scope
but that s not how object destruction works in .net when an object goes out of scope it gets put in the finalizer s queue and its destructor doesn t get called until the finalizer gets around to it

184540
realloc	malloc
the only way i could think that would be beneficial to use malloc would be if you needed to change the size of your buffer of data
the new keyword does not have an analogous way like realloc
the realloc function might be able to extend the size of a chunk of memory for you more efficiently

184540
free	malloc	free	realloc
the realloc function might be able to extend the size of a chunk of memory for you more efficiently
it is worth mentioning that you cannot mix new free and malloc delete

if you wanted to get really anal about optimization without using breaks then will run faster in the average case than the existing option #1
and of course it s personal preference but i prefer to never put any extra evaluations inside the head of a for-loop
i find it can cause confusion while reading code because it s easy to miss

185365
terminate	timeout
the timeout has to be big enough to delays in delivering the initial data from the client in the tls ssl handshake so it ll make establishing ssh connections slower
if the http proxy in your company is smart it ll actually eavesdrop on the expected tls ssl handshake when you connect to port 443 and when it detects that it s not an tls ssl handshake it might terminate the ssh connection attempt
to address that you could wrap the ssh daemon into an tls ssl tunnel stunnel but they you ll need to differentiate requests based on the tls ssl version in your client request to determine whether to route the tls ssl connection to the web server or to the tls ssl-tunneled ssh daemon

we use it a lot to automate our software registration system and it d be no problem to splice it into a bit of excel vba okay so it s email rather than sms but it s a start

186279
inherited	properties
adding a properties to the prototype of a function object will make it available to the constructed object as well as to all of the objects which inherit from it
advantages there may not be a hard and fast rule as to why prototypal inherited is an advantageous form of code-reuse
code reuse itself is advantageous and prototypal inherited is a sensible way of going about it

186376
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
this overhead in reality is small unless you do a lot of loops
in some cases though the compiler will replace foreach with a for-loop i believe when iterating over arrays
i personally prefer foreach in my asp.net mvc code for clarity as many have said here but often use the for-loop too. joe duffy recently posted an interesting article about the cost of enumerating

186632
prng	random
there s no need to test whether the output is random since far more research has been done on the algorithm by others than you are capable of reproducing
if you have invented your own prng algorithm then you have a rather different problem because quite aside from testing your code you also need to test your new algorithm
there are various things to do -- i think the most important are statistical testing on the output and peer review by other cryptographers

firefox	safari	folder	directory	folder	directory
on mac there is a directory for browser plugins
no matter if you use safari or firefox or possibly another browser it is standard or mac that browsers search their plugins in that folder
it is named library internet plug-ins and as always on mac this directory exists twice

186703
inherited	subclassing
at that point you have to decide whether to replace type code with subclassing or replace type code with state strategy
when you have set up the inherited structure you can use replace conditional with polymorphism. here is one approach to using polymorphism in your situation define an abstract method in abstractnode named something like display
then actually implement display in each of the sitenode and sitesubnode classes

186771
prng	random

plesae be aware if you have invented your prng you will probably have got it wrong and produced something that has a less than optimal distribution
the basic test for how random your generator is is the chi-square test

instead perhaps it s worth considering mitch s idea and let the character s weapons be help in a property bag
remember that a character has-a set of weapons
to me it seems like composition may be the way to go

versioning	upgrade
a variation of this share a dll between all the projects needing these objects should work for you
watch out for versioning issues though
unless you have full control of both ends an upgrade to one end could cause headaches if you re not careful

187043
ssl	https
http you will need an http server on the windows machine and a page that would allow upload iis plus some asp page should suffice and use libcurl to dialog with it
more complicated scenario when security is a concerm would require the use of scp or sftp over and ssl connection
also the libcurl with https could provide a good enough solution

188466
pop-up	dialog
as david mentioned flex is single-threaded so you can t have your function block while the dialog is being processed
your best bet might be to use a javascript pop-up
you ll have a lot less control over the window but it should behave the way you want blocking the function until it s been closed

it displays indistinctly files and folder

inherited	properties
the lower a style declaration appears in the cascade and the more specific it is in targeting the element the more it will weigh against other styles

that being said aside from giving other developers the opportunity to at least cursorily review code it can also notify people that it s a good time to run an update from source control and merge any new changes if needed hey someone found a regex parsing bug in foo but forgot to update bar with it oh bob s working on the baz module i should ask him to take a look at this too you get the idea

int	boolean
that means if your constructors are taken arguments you have to consider for primitive types arguments int boolean float ... or string every combinations of limit values for a string xxx null
fonr int 0 -x +x -integer.min +integer.max .
and so on for non-primitive types build an instance of those to be passed to the constructor of the object to test meaning you recursively have to consider the constructor parameters of that parameter primitive types or not finally not every parameters automatically created for those constructor would make sense in a functional way meaning some of those values will fail to build the instance because of an assert that must be detected

190149
prng	random
on a computer your options are pretty limited to pseudo random number generators prngs and given your constraint that they never repeat then a prng is your best option - real random data will occasionally duplicate a number
in your case i d consider using a large prng 32 bit or larger to shuffle your 10 000 numbers and then send the numbers out in the shuffled order
once they re used up you can shuffle again - since the prng is so large you ll be able to go through the 10k numbers many times before duplicating a sequence

x86	64bit	websphere	ibm

websphere mq 7 for windows supports x86 and x64 but not itanium 64bit
it only officially supports visual c++ 2005 for development at the moment but ibm usually issues ptfs for toleration on a regular basis so it shouldn t be too long before c++ 2008 support is there

190526
switching	screens
see the earlier stack overflow question rendering graphics in c# for more information
like lockbits you will need to use the unsafe keyword compiler switching but you get high performance pixel level access
you also get higher performance screens rendering via directx backbuffering when compared with using the normal bitmap class and picturebox control

190745
cpu	processors
applications differ in how they scale depending on a large number of variables including types of problem solving approach to solution and other factors
100 concurrent users consuming 10 cpu does not mean 500 concurrent at 50 it could be 20 or it could be 100
your bottleneck could be processors or memory or network bandwidth

190885
dictionary	map
communiti - community create a function which compares each stem to a list of the words that were reduced to that stem and attempts to determine which is most similar
comparing communiti against community and communities in such a way that community will be recognized as the more similar option personally i think the way i would do it would be a dynamic form of #1 building up a custom dictionary database by recording every word examined along with what it stemmed to and then assuming that the most common word is the one that should be used
if my body of source text uses communities more often than community then map communiti - communities. a dictionary-based approach will be more accurate in general and building it based on the stemmer input will provide results customized to your texts with the primary drawback being the space required which is generally not an issue these days

190962
prepare	execute
you can do prepare statements which is similar but different
here is an example the prepare statements are often used to see an execution plan for a given query
since they are execute with the execute command and the sql can be assigned to a variable you can approximate the some of the same behavior as dynamic sql

191706
punctuation	words
then go backwards some fraction of this number of words or to the beginning and forward the remaining number of words to select the rest of the context
in this way you just split the entire corpus on whitespace find the first occurence of the term perhaps using a fuzzy match to find subterms and account for punctuation and apply the above algorithm
you could even be creative about introducing ellipses if the first non-selected term doesn t end in punctuation etc

i ve used commons config on projects with their properties and xml config
it is very easy to use and supports some pretty powerful features

193479
folder	directory
remember the user running the application may not have write access to that directory
the safest place to put stuff like that is in c documents and settings username application data applicationname folder adjusting the name as necessary
that said however i would probably store that type of stuff in the registry instead of a file on their computer

193952
superclass	subclassing

call is for calling non-virtual static or superclass methods the target of the call is not subject to overriding
callvirt is for calling virtual methods so that if this is a subclassing that overrides the method the subclassing version is called instead

post	get	post	get
they are very simple to use and you can do whatever effect you like when the ajax call is completed you get a function called on success
if you want to stick with the post back one solution is the following and in js something like it s a bit of a hack the idea is to cancel the postback initially do some stuff then set a timer where the postback will be enabled
the big problem with this approach is that the fade effect and the actual delete are independent in case of an error you still get the fade effect

194248
lxml	elementtree
elementtree as in python 2.5 has only a small feature set compared to full-blown xml libraries but it s enough for many applications
if you need a validating parser or complete xpath support lxml is the way to go
for a long time it used to be quite unstable but i haven t had any problems with it since 2.1

the server-side language is probably irrelevant here

edit further investigation has shown that it is possible to get a stack trace for the current executing function so if you are lucky you can do something with that

int	double
for example adding two integers is different than adding two double or even one int and one double
there is even the whole pointer arithmetic domain without casting you can add to a pointer an int but you cannot add two pointers...
in java there is no pointer arithmetic but someone still found string concatenation without the + operator would be ridiculous enough to justify an exception in the operator overloading is evil creed

it s trivial to fake a post request by a user to a page
making it a post request however prevents web accelerators or reloads from re-triggering the action accidentally
as ajax there is one more consideration if you are returning json with callback support be very careful not to put any sensitive data that you don t want other websites to be able to see in there

195220

post requests are just as insecure as gets
the main difference is that post is used to modify the state of the server application while get only requests data from it

postgresql	mysql
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
postgresql does comply better with standards so it can be easier to replace later
in the end the choice has so many variables that no matter which way you go you ll find some important issue that makes it the right choice

195444
hash	md5

storing the password hash in the database is not optimal secure in case the database contents get into unauthorized hands. there is no way to reverse the hash directly but there are online dictinonaries like here for reversing hash pass words
in the db you should store somethig like md5 login_name + domain_or_appname_salt + password

195444
salt	md5
in the db you should store somethig like md5 login_name + domain_or_appname_salt + password
the salt in the middle prevents many forms of dictionary attacks
on the clients side in the browser you would have a login form with username and password

convert it to a long and then check its size
if your long can fit into an int convert it to an int
you can do the same for floats and double although the regular expression is a bit mroe complicated

195837
int	double	int	double
a most decimal real numbers are not exactly representable into a double i would not bother
note too that there is a catch as 25.0 could be both real and an int number
my comparing dvalue double long dvalue i guess you should know if is an int again not taking into account the usual precision problems coming witb binary real numbers used by computers

196328
cruisecontrol	teamcity
however once you passed that hump i feel that cruisecontrol is pretty flexible enough to allow you to do different sort of things to fit different scenarios
besides cruisecontrol documentation its wiki page also has some useful information as well
i do not have a direct experience with teamcity

196580
apache	nginx
from a raw performance perspective nginx is faster but not so much faster that i would include that as a determining factor
apache has the advantage in the area of modules available and the fact that it is pretty much standard
any web host you go with will have it installed and most techs are going to be very familiar with it

196705
postgresql	mysql
you will find more than 500 users there and some of them are development companies building projects for their clients
my impression is that most of them use postgresql that s what i do to and some others use the google app engine
in fact web2py is the only framework that allows you to write code once and the same code will run on gae sqlite mysql postgresql oracle mssql and firebird with the limitations imposed by gae

196705
django	web2py	django	web2py
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and web2py has a configuration file at the app not at the project level like them
webp2y logs all tracebacks server side for the administrator django and pylons do not
web2py programs often run on gae unmodified

196834
for-loop	arrays

i use a for-loop to iterate the string and use charat to get each character to examine it
since the string is implemented with an arrays the charat method is a constant time operation

196933
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but the savings in transferred bytes can be enormous
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google-chrome
it apparently doesn t work this way in safari 3

197188
pop-up	dialog
directly below it there is a help message and next to it a small icon an arrow going down .click on that arrow and then select open rename dialog
a new pop-up appears with the checkboxes you need
2 - alternatively select the variable you want to change and press twice alt+shift+r

197420
pthreads	fork
having said this i would not use this code - i would either be inclined to fork mklink or look at the native library from jruby jpython sorry i cant look it up atm as my network connection is flakey
i seem to recall that jruby has written a library that wraps up various pthreads apis into java thinks like chown that are required for ruby compliance but are not cross platform
this library is being used by the jpython folks who seem very pleased with it

197429
boost	stl
however the stl proposes std for_each but its syntax is a lot less intuitive
here is its prototype it takes two iterators defining a valid range and applies the unary function or functor f to each object in this range. you can rewrite your example using std for_each like this however if you want to stay close to the classical syntax of the for each construct and if you re ok about using boost you can use boost.foreach which will let you write


197437
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5

i m guessing from way you ve phrased the question you don t want to store the codes in a database if you did you could simply verify each code against the database so what you could do is take all the pertinent information about what is in the coupon then hash it together with a secret salt to prevent tampering
thus suppose you wanted a coupon for user 23 worth 200 you might build up a string like 23_200 and calculate an md5 hash with a secret salt of billthelizard to get 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 thus the complete code you give the customer is 200_23_2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 now when you received the code you break it apart and check that md5 200_23 +secret 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 to verify the value edit if an 32 character hash is too long you could always truncate it chopping it down to 8 chars would still give you 4294967296 different hash values

197902
subclass	abstract-class
the subclasses will be required by the compiler to implement any interface methods that the abstract-class left out
following your example code try making a subclass of abstractthing without implementing the m2 method and see what errors the compiler gives you
it will force you to implement this method

198311
put	get	put	get
but even then i would get the plugin working in one language first
i would probably put mybrowser.asp in the plugin directory
here s some code for fckplugin.js to get you started

198325
vb.net	vb6

if you re converting a large application perhaps you should just upgrade to vb.net which will be cheaper
there are some features in vb6 with no exact equivalent in c# the error handling late binding etc

198325
vb.net	vb6
there are some features in vb6 with no exact equivalent in c# the error handling late binding etc
ask yourself why it s worth the manual effort to convert those when you could go to vb.net which does support them
and if you don t believe me and no-one s voted for my answer sob sob

198366
implements	extends

codemirror comes with support for 60+ languages and addons that implements more advanced editing functionality autocompletion code folding configurable key bindings search replace linter integration etc.
a rich programming api and a css theming system are available for customizing codemirror and extends it with new functionality

198411
int	chars	int	chars
and that s for using chars
since your structure is so big that you re going to need to use int for references your triple is actually 12 bytes which is even worse
in this case you ll only ever save space by substituting for words that are 12 ascii chars or more

198470
range	max
but if you don t use random.new then the class method rand only takes a max value not a range as banister energetically points out in the comment and as documented in the docs for random
only the instance method can take a range as illustrated by generate a random number with 7 digits
this is why the equivalent of random.new.rand 20..30 would be 20 + random.rand 11 since random.rand int returns a random integer greater than or equal to zero and less than the argument . 20..30 includes 30 i need to come up with a random number between 0 and 11 excluding 11

198473
post	get	post	get
get or query string posts are really good for information required for either bookmarking a particular item or for assisting in search engine optimization and indexing items
post is good for standard forms used to submit one time data
i wouldn t use get for posting actual forms unless maybe in a search form where you want to allow the user to save the query in a bookmark or something along those lines

198607
xna	slimdx

xna provides several math constants including 3d specialists like pi 2 etc. and some advanced math functions with float precision though not the trigonometric functions
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big

198866
post	get
both get and post send data in plaintext over the wire when used over http
there are other good reasons to post data too - like the ability to submit unlimited amounts of data or hide parameters from casual users
the downside is that users can t bookmark the results of a query sent via post

199286
post	get
iis may have legacy code that aborts the request before it can get to asp.net for processing
scott hanselman s blog post talks a bit about this and may be relevant for you
as general comment url rewriting is typically used to make a url friendly and easy to remember

199668
division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
note this catches integer addition subtraction overflows and i realized that your question involves multiplication
in which case division is likely the best approach
this is commonly a way that calloc implementations make sure that the params don t overflow as they are multiplied to get the final size

199754
mouse	keyboard

press release are interaction events not mouse events
if you activate a button or mc with the keyboard by tabbing to it and pressing space it will fire a press event but not a mousedown

199867
bash	zsh	bash	zsh
for a while i was the maintainer of the freebsd port of the bash tab-completion scripts but abandoned it as soon as i tried zsh for the first time
it can do everything bash can do but more easily and more elegantly
it also has the nice property of having extremely bash-like keystrokes so if you re on a system without zsh you ll be able to make do even if it wouldn t feel as nice

200026
hide	show
when the user mouses over it it calls whatever function it needs to do
it hide itself allowing normal interaction with the swf
it places a mouseover function on the window which will show the original div again

200235
ubuntu	linux

i tried the first alpha version current is 3 of the flex builder under ubuntu and it was just okay but not useable for productive just alpha flashdevelop works only under windows maybe with wine.
and in my opinion it s not a good ide fdt is on eye level with the flex builder but also not free and i don t know if it runs innately on linux

200341
jar	war
heck you can store content directly in a war file which is basically a jar file with a few extra bits
yes you may need to write a custom resolver to use classloader.getresourceasstream but basically as you re given the ability to generate the content however you like fetching it from a jar file seems perfectly reasonable
you ll probably want to make sure it only fetches a very specific set of extensions though

200581
jar	war
in a jar or war file and pull them at runtime
to load a resource from your deployment jar use the following code
this.getclass .getclassloader .getresourceasstream filename

200712
hex	binary
bring up the open file dialog in visual studio. click the little triangle on the open button and select open with. now select binary editor
you should be able to edit the hex values at the beginning of the file to include any byte order pattern you need
this wikipedia article describes what you will need to set the byte order markers to be for the different file formats utf-8 or utf-16 for example

200715
xslt	xquery

xslt is an example of a functional programming language for doing transformations of data or documents represented as xml -- admittedly a very verbose and very limited one
if i remember correctly xquery is also purely functional

200861
hex	binary
ie
to unpack you can encode the result back to hex similarly however note that for your example there s probably no need to take the round-trip through a hex representation at all when encoding
just use the md5 binary digest directly

201298
configobj	configparser
the downside here if the file will be hand-edited by a user errors could be hard to catch and debug
ini format i ve been using configobj for this with quite a bit of success
configobj is essentially a replacement for configparser with support for nested sections and much more

201723
folder	directory
just put a in the key name and you can access the files as if they were in separate directory
i use this to store user files in separate folder based on their user id in s3
for example mybucket users 1234 somefile.jpg

201820
post	get
like google with the q in the query string chances are you are doing a post
so change your to the biggest mistake most developers make with search pages is to do a post back
http was designed to do queries or searches through the query string thus the name and to get a form to post to a query string instead of the body you need to use a get method

201835
ienumerable	ilist
if the underlying code is using yield to generate the ienumerable or is using linq then you ll end up holding open any resources used
you should copy the ienumerable into another ienumerable before returning it
by using ilist you make this a requirement so that nobody can inadvertently return an ienumerable

202336
ceil	floor
we can use log to do the first
so for numbers 0 take the ceil of the log
for numbers 0 take the floor of the log

202362
rss	feed

you can certainly get rss statistics
if you are hosting your own rss feed you can parse the iis or apache logs to find all requests for the feed and then do some processing to aggregate these per machine

202941
django	turbogears

i think django has some of the best documentation of any project i ve worked on
that s the reason we chose it over turbogears two years ago and it s been the best technology choice we ve made

203012
kde	gnome
if there is any example of a nice integrated linux environment please please please show me i really want to use linux
and i know there s qt and other managers like kde etc
i noticed the same thing so it probably isn t gtk or gnome alone you basically just answered your own question - mac os x has one desktop environment centered around cocoa which has a lot of very good programmers and designers spending much time designing discussing and implementing it

203242
inherited	subclassing

in short single table inherited sti is a design pattern that allows a mapping of oop inherited relationships to the database
if you define any subclassing from your activerecord model objects then you should consider sti

203256
maven	pom.xml

a simpler way to go is the maven eclipse plugin as opposed to a maven plugin for eclipse
it s simply a maven plugin that generates the .project and .classpath file based on the contents of the pom.xml you just run mvn eclipse eclipse and you re done

203256
maven	pom.xml
it s simply a maven plugin that generates the .project and .classpath file based on the contents of the pom.xml you just run mvn eclipse eclipse and you re done
it uses a classpath variable in eclipse to locate the local maven repo
i personally prefer this approach most of the time because you have more control over when the maven plugin updates are done

203266
django	turbogears	django	web.py

danj here s a pretty good list of all the known python frameworks i would recommend looking at the wikipedia articles for django turbogears pylons etc
i wrote an article on web.py once but it got deleted - they explain the philosophical and component differences between the frameworks pretty well

203428
postgresql	mysql

in postgresql you can do this select whatever from mytable where something ilike match this
i m not sure if there is an equivalent for mysql but you can always do this which is a bit ugly but should work in both mysql and postgresql

203444
prng	random

normally seeding a new state takes quite while for a serious prng and making new ones each time won t really help much. the only case i can think of where you might want more than one prng is for different systems say in a casino game you have one generator for shuffling cards and a separate one to generate comments done by the computer control characters this way really dedicated users can t guess outcomes based on character behaviors
a nice solution for seeding is to use this random.org they supply random numbers generated from the atmospheric noise for free

203550
g++	gcc

use g++ test.cpp instead since this is c++ code
or if you really want to use gcc add -lstdc++ to the command line like so gcc test.cpp -lstdc++ running md5 against the a.out produced under each scenario shows that it s the same output

203550
g++	gcc
or if you really want to use gcc add -lstdc++ to the command line like so gcc test.cpp -lstdc++ running md5 against the a.out produced under each scenario shows that it s the same output
but yeah g++ probably makes your world a simpler place


203630
switching	screens	switching	screens
to some extent this became handled in screens readers by the reader switching between a table mode and a layout mode based on what it saw inside the table
this was often wrong and so the users had to manually switching the mode when navigating through tables
in any case the large often highly nested tables were and to a large extent are still very difficult to navigate through using a screens reader

204279
vb.net	vb6

i found vb.net really hard to pick up after working in vb since 1991 - the languages are similar enough to feel familiar but different enough to constantly trip me up
to make it even more confusing i do a lot of work with excel vba which is still vb6

204416
implements	extends
if so you could extends it to include an isobjectderived method with semantics that it returns true iff the class only derives from object
since you are writing the class all you would need to do is implements it in the parent and have it return true if the object is of class parent and false otherwise
you could also do this with reflection by checking the superclass of the current class and make sure it is object

204491
cvs	svn

a basic hosting plan at dreamhost gets you tons of web hosting space bandwidth database jabber chat server cvs subversion repository and more for a little more than 5 bucks a month
beanstalk seems nice svn only but i don t have any experience with it

204777
union	distinct
selectmany - for each element of source selector is invoked and a sequence of values is returned
union - when the object returned by this method is enumerated union enumerates first and second in that order and yields each element that has not already been yielded
edit i ve moved distinct to preserving order based on this implementation

204819
filtering	grouping
this means that you can t easily subscribe to people s event streams and see previous events very easily but you are simply rendering a small grouping of messages when you need to render the stream for a particular user
i believe this was twitter s original design flaw- i remember reading that they were hitting the database to pull in and filtering their events
this had everything to do with architecture and nothing to do with rails which unfortunately gave birth to the ruby doesn t scale meme

204965
submit	submission
put it into a cookie and store somewhere on the server
during submit action handling check the cookie hash against the database entry
if there s no such hash or it s different reject the submission

204965
submit	submission
if there s no such hash or it s different reject the submission
after successful submit you can remove the hash entry change it s state to submitted - whatever suits you
that method should protect you in many cases but surely is still not 100 bulletproof

205178
prng	random
as noted by others software systems are only pseudo-random and must maintain state
a compromise is to use a hardware based rng to provide an entropy pool stored state which is made available to seed a prng
this is done quite explicitly in the linux implementation of dev random 3 and dev urandom 4

205201
public	protected
which allowed the protected methods to be accessed
that said there is an argument to make everything public for unit testing


205216
cassini	iis

when you re running a web site using cassini the account used by the web server process is your own account that you use to log on to your windows machine
that account will be different on iis

205745
accessor	properties

i suppose my biggest gripe about my own code is the explosion of accessor
next design work i do i ve set myself the challenge of using the smallest number of properties

206153
queue	fifo
even though you are saying that you want fifo order you want fifo order with respect to a random set of variables which is essentially random order
if you want to use queue you need to be able to determine order before the message goes in the queue not after it goes in


206333
move	drag
you can use these to drag the relationship arrow up and down
be careful not to move the endpoints though because visio will disassociate that connector from the table object


206345
int	boolean
a boolean is about truth and falseness
an int is about whole numbers
those are very distinct concepts truth and falseness is about deciding stuff

206371
translation	localization
separate configuration from localization
that way localizers can translation the text and you can deal with different configurations per locale features layout etc
you don t want localizers to have the ability to mess with your app

206443
versioning	upgrade
suppose you re developing a new versioning of your software and checking that the upgrade from the previous versioning works correctly.
do you have to reinstall the os then the old versioning


206463
put	get
allow for feedback
when you do releases of the software have the person whose job it is to put code into the build push back on developers pointing them to the wiki pages on it
i ve done this in my organization and it took several months for people to really get into the hang of using the wiki but now it s this indispensable resource

206497
maven	pom.xml
important when you try to bring new team members up to speed or use a contious integration server for automated builds
i recommend to use maven and let it do the heavy lifting for you
create a pom.xml file and generate the eclipse project via mvn eclipse eclipse

206643
put	get
and it is not illegal at this point but if you get nailed they will bring the hammer down on you
they have within their authority to level heavy fines against you but it seems like what they usually do is put you in remediation
if you don t comply i don t know what happens because everyone i have heard this happening to complied

206658
put	get
i think this was added circa delphi 6 or 7
the following code will work you could use any positive offset from that position to put it anywhere in that monitor
you can get the width and height from there too to know the dimensions

206904
dreamweaver	aptana

unfortunately the best one i ve used as far as wysiwyg is dreamweaver and i don t like it that much either but it is a standard part of the toolset in many web shops and you just get used to it
i currently use aptana for that sort of prototyping which is not really wysiwyg but has a great preview function and i don t end up having to go back through crappy wysiwyg generated markup and cleaning it up later

206952
int	chars	int	chars
the header file to the complete module included these functions word addcontroltodialogtemplateex mtdialogtemplatetype dlgtmp chars title word id chars winclass dword style short x short y short cx short cy dword exstyle int helpid
int destroydlgtemplateex mtdialogtemplatetype dlgtmp

206964
soappy	suds
does not work on python 2.5+ zsi very painful to use and development is slow
has a module called soappy which is different than soapy above
newer libraries suds very pythonic and easy to create wsdl-consuming soap clients

207062
google-chrome	firefox
a folder called google-chrome can mean any number of things
google-chrome is a general term for the ui of a browser
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base

207350
accessor	properties

add a private accessor for the class to your test project
use the accessor to set up the private properties of the class in some known way instead of using the classes methods to do so

207623
folder	directory
like you suggested 1 it downloaded the latest jars over http 2 copied them to a folder
3 since the swing app is launched using a .bat file after user said yes we would shut down the swing app and look for any files in the update folder
if yes launch another .bat file to copy the new jars to the required directory

207669
versioning	upgrade
the only problem but this is true for most flash uploaders i guess is session handling - if you re using sessions you re going to have to pass along the session id to the flash file and back again
digitarald the author has a new versioning of fancyupload in beta now that works with flash 10 something a lot of the other uploaders don t
according to him it should be very simple to upgrade from fancyupload2 to the new versioning once it s released

207923
filtering	grouping
i think the hottest track is this expression i found it in ldap query for grouping members on a coldfusion community s site
i m more or less sure the filtering can easily be applied to your query
i m sorry but i cannot test it because i have no ad around here

207937
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock

if a map-type structure is more appropriate you can use a concurrenthashmap
with a list a readwritelock is probably the most effective way

208011
sudo	passwd

the systems i run have a sudo -only policy
the root passwd is disabled and people have to use sudo to get root access

208025
sudo	passwd

while it is a good idea to use a sudo only policy like chris suggested depending on the the size of your system an ldap approach may also be helpful
we complement that by a file that contains all the root passwd but the root passwd are really long and unmemorable

208576
range	minimum

devexpress have a good one the rangetrackbarcontrol control extends the functionality provided by the trackbarcontrol enabling end-users to select a range of values
two sliders can be used to set the minimum and maximum values alt text you can get them free from hope this helps

208704
folder	directory

check that the .webpart file deployed to the wpcatalog folder of your web site
depending on what directory was specified when provisioning the web application you should find it in a location similar to this c inetpub wwwroot wss virtualdirectories 80 wpcatalog

208789
submit	submission
if the daemon can t grab the lockfile it just dies so there s no worry about multiple daemons running
another approach to consider would be to submit the files via http post and then process them via a cgi
this way you guarantee that they ve been dealt with properly at the time of submission

209321
hide	show
get a pane as in a cview derived class surrounded by your splitter window show the littler vertical bar at the text editing position in that view
this is the cursor used in any text editing control such as a cedit hide the caret vertical cursor


209716
post	put

post has no guarantees of safety or idempotency
that s one reason for put and delete both put and delete are idempotent 1+n identical requests have the same end result as just 1 request

209896
sorting	grouping
pay attention to which grouping your user uses most
switch to that sorting strategy exclusively after enough data is collected
it s a lot of work but kind of fun.

209932
put	get
most games are fire-and-forget apart from some bugfixes unless it s one of the more successful games which get an expansion pack or a sequel
security is an important issue for online games since there are much more annoying people trying to to put people off than there are for business applications many of which are for more or less internal uses at the customer
you are expected to work much more than when writing business applications

210235
xsl-fo	xslt
when you re talking about formatting xml documents and that s pretty much what you re talking about that s the tool designed to do it
from wiki the general idea behind xsl-fo s use is that the user writes a document not in fo but in an xml language. xhtml docbook and tei are all possibilities but it could be any xml language
then the user obtains an xslt transform either by writing one themselves or by finding one for the document type in question

210462
udp	tcp

have the server listen for broadcast on a specific port on the network must use udp when client starts have it broadcast some ping request on that port
when the server sees a ping it send back a message with the tcp address and port required for the client to connect to it

210486
short	base
the usual example is to take an animal base class with a speak method a dog subclass would emit a bark whereas a pig subclass would emit an oink
the 5 second short answer most people use so other developers can get their head around polymorphism is overloading and overriding


210652
opera	firefox

you cannot do that in all browsers supposedly ie does allow it but mozilla and opera do not
when you compose a message in gmail the attach files feature is implemented one way for ie and any browser that supports this and then implemented another way for firefox and those browsers that do not

210685
post	put	post	get	put	get
restful web services chapter 8 section overloading post reads if you want to do without put and delete altogether it s entirely restful to expose safe operations on resources through get and all other operations through overloaded post
doing this violates my resource-oriented architecture but it conforms to the less restrictive rules of rest. in short replacing put delete in favor of post makes the api harder to read and put delete calls are no longer idempotent


210693
prepare	execute
i understand that this would be useful for debugging but it is not the way prepare statements work
parameters are not combined with a prepare statement on the client-side so pdo should never have access to the query string combined with its parameters
the sql statement is sent to the database server when you do prepare and the parameters are sent separately when you do execute

211049
superclass	subclassing
even a class definition that does not explicitly specify a superclass still has a superclass class cookie end this defines the cookie class with the superclass of object
i ve encountered this error before and it will occur when you have some code trying to reopen a class without specifying the superclass and the programmer s assumption is that the class in this case cookie has already been defined and that he is simply reopening it to add some functionality
but if the reopening and the definition are in reverse order you ll get that error because the class will already have been defined as a subclassing of object but is trying to be redefined or reopened with a different superclass

211327
int	chars

in java language spec arrays you can see in 10.4 arrays must be indexed by int values
short byte or chars values may also be used as index values because they are subjected to unary numeric promotion and become int values. an attempt to access an array component with a long index value results in a compile-time error

211327
int	chars
short byte or chars values may also be used as index values because they are subjected to unary numeric promotion and become int values. an attempt to access an array component with a long index value results in a compile-time error
i could not find the type of the length attribute but it is at least an int
and if it s a long then you can not access elements beyond the max integer length

211503
hash	hmac
however for the hmac you actually want to store the key somewhere
without the key there is no way for you to verify the hash value later
-

212095
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort from the selection sort category
this would likely be the most confusing sort next to quicksort but once they understand how it sets them up for understanding the quicksort algorithm
insertion sort as an example of the insertion sort category would be covered as it is also a simple sort that they can get a lot of use out of

212488
factors	mean

it depends on your os cpu compiler and possibly other factors
in general it means the cpu bus could not complete a command or suffered a conflict but that could mean a whole range of things depending on the environment and code being run

212565
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort this will teach how to merge which is important because there are a ton of speedups you can get by merging two sorted lists together as well as how to divide the problem into smaller sub problems important for dealing with hierarchical structures and also used in quick sort
quicksort though faster is much harder to understand
you need two scanning variables a pivot item etc.

212589
hash	salt

basically that means appending some random text to the password before you hash it
the salt value helps to slow an attacker perform a dictionary attack should your credential store be compromised giving you additional time to detect and react to the compromise

212589
hash	salt	hash	salt
this approach means you don t need to store the salt separately and then recompute the hash using the salt value and the plaintext password value obtained from the user
edit as raw computing power becomes cheaper and faster the value of hashing -- or salting hash -- has declined
jeff atwood has an excellent 2012 update too lengthy to repeat in its entirety here which states this using salt hash will provide the illusion of security more than any actual security

213336
haskell	ocaml
f# - basically ocaml on the clr
very nice very clean scala - not a strictly functional language but much better for it than ruby haskell - everybody s favorite
you ll notice that three of these four languages are statically typed

213934
struts	wicket
alternative view technologies like wicket tapestry etc
containers like spring and libraries like struts all can be learnt slowly
the best practices and review posted all over internet definitely help

214650
versioning	upgrade
be sure to list the upgrade codes of all the products you want to remove
note that if you re careful with your builds you can prevent people from accidentally installing an older versioning of your product over a newer one
that s what the maximum field is for

214689
versioning	upgrade

yes it does mean that the windows createprocess and loadlibrary apis on windows nt before 2000 and all of windows 95 98 and me will not load a dll or exe file made by vs9 because the pe header in the file has the required os versioning field set to 5
the error message upon attempting to load a vs9 generated exe file will be a very unfriendly modal error dialog actually say you need to upgrade your operating system to run this program

215238
hide	show
to get it to degrade nicely you d have to have all the rows show initially and then hide them with your jquery document ready function and also create the row with the link in
also your method of giving the rows to hide a particular class should also work
the jquery would look something like this you d still need to create the row with the link to unhide them though

215323
processors	hyperthreading

each processors or processors core can do exactly 1 thing at a time
with hyperthreading things get a little different but for the most part that still remains true which is why my ht machine at work almost never goes above 50 and even when it s at 100 it s not processing twice as much at once

215323
cpu	hyperthreading
with hyperthreading things get a little different but for the most part that still remains true which is why my ht machine at work almost never goes above 50 and even when it s at 100 it s not processing twice as much at once
you ll probably just have to do some testing on common architectures you plan to deploy on to determine how many threads you want to run on each cpu
just using 1 thread may be too slow if you re waiting for a lot of i o

215473
opera	firefox	webkit	gecko
even if you test with mozilla firefox opera and konqueror from kde 4 on windows you re not even close to covering most of the userbase
that being said if you narrow your focus to browsers with support for modern css you ll find that there s only a few underlying engines trident ie gecko mozilla webkit apple khtml kde and presto opera
taking these individually trident only used by ie in windows you re already testing it

215545
delphi	oxygene
but first a warning you will take at least the total development effort it took to write your current delphi application
in our case this effort was warranted since the old delphi application which in fact it was kylix had an end-of-life because of various reasons. our rewrite consisted of two parts rewrite with limited extra functionality followed by a lot of extra functionality the design of the first part already took the second part into account
back to your choices 1- a total rewrite in c# or vb.net in visual studio 2- a partial reuse of your existing delphi business layer code by using oxygene from remobjecs a visual studio plugin with a syntax that is very similar to the delphi syntax

215567
hash	md5
that being said i heard from a coworker a long time ago that when sgi was porting opengl to new hardware they had a bunch of unit tests that would draw a set of primatives to the screen then compute an md5 sum of the frame buffer
this value could then be compared to known good hash values to quickly determine if the api is per pixel accurate


215575
queue	fifo
implements a circular buffer style fifo queue
could be made more generic by creating a structure containing the queue size queue data and queue indexes in and out which would be passed in with the data to add or remove from the queue
these same routines could then handle several queues

215603
move	drag
a way to track where the cursor is so that when it s close to the midpoint of a line you can prepare to grab and drag the line to split it
the mouse move event will play a role in this
not sure which toolkit you re using or i would be more specific about what the event would be named - it might be onmousemove

215617
cpu	processors

there is no standard way to get the number of supported threads per cpu core within java
your best bet is to get a java cpuid utility that gives you the processors information and then match it against a table you ll have to generate that gives you the threads per core that the processors manages without a real context switch

215746
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari

opera has native svg support firefox has native svg support internet explorer does not include svg support natively
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1

215746
google-chrome	safari
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers


215749
svg	vml

ie has svg support in ie9 but not in ie8 and below
the alternative is vml mozilla claims to support it on its latest version opera claims to support it since v8.0 safari has experimental support probably incomplete chrome seems to have roughly the same level of svg support as safari konqueror uses the same svg engine as safari and chrome - ksvg claims to be in beta

215749
svg	vml
the alternative is vml mozilla claims to support it on its latest version opera claims to support it since v8.0 safari has experimental support probably incomplete chrome seems to have roughly the same level of svg support as safari konqueror uses the same svg engine as safari and chrome - ksvg claims to be in beta
the fact that they have a todo list implies it s not ready for production camino apparently supports svg as well


216153
haskell	scheme
it s not too widely used but definitely seems like a solid language to use especially considering the robustness of drscheme which in fact compiles scheme programs to native binary code
after that - haskell is incredibly interesting
it s a language which does lazy evaluation right and the consequences are incredible including such things as a one-line definition of the fibonnaci sequence

216249
post	get
although i suggest using get for search
no sure you want to post again dialog on a page-refresh and you can modify the search criteria without the form


216381
postgresql	mysql	post	get
as long as you keep it consistent with the conventions you don t have to tell cake anything about how your table is set up
post id int body text created datetime comments id int body text name varchar post_id int it has adapters to support mysql mssql postgresql sqlite oracle and others
you can also wrap webservices as models and even get it to do joins between data in your database and remote data

217119
client-side	server-side
this way you can build helpers on the server-side that sit between your client-side app and any existing controllers
the helper is specific to that functionality and plugin and you do not open up blanket access to your models from the client-side


217361
dictionary	map

can you use dictionary string string instead of namevaluecollection
since dictionary t t implements ienumerable you could use linq as so edit actually you may be able to use dictionary directly as if it doesn t map key value the way you want you can always go back to linq

217672
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties

inherited generally maps to an is-a relationship
since your container is a list but with some other things i would inherit from list and add your additional properties to your subclassing

217688
inherited	properties
i would suggest you call it testsuite and make the list as a properties
has-a is much easier to maintain compared to inherited
in general i d be very careful to inherit something like a list

217708
config	ini
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions centralised location for the sites configuration on each server so easy to keep upto date server doesn t change that oftern updateing the config is simple with an update script
can be generated by the script all my sites have a function that rebuilds the config file useing the config assoc array
updates that effect the config file are as simple as config key new value

217726
ienumerable	ilist
usually you only need a get property here
you can control access to the list by choosing to return a readonly version of the list with .asreadonly or just exposing the list as an ienumerable
in cases where i want tests to be a list i usually implement ilist and call an internal list field for the actual implementations of the ilist

217918
ubuntu	linux
later edit you could also try setting up a linux unix firwall with igd activated
here is a forum post for ubuntu
and there is a miniupnp project too

218045
put	get
get a handle to the cmd.exe process
allocate some memory there virtualallocex put the path to your dll in the memory
writeprocessmemory load your dll into the cmd.exe address space

218131
folder	directory

you can t directly ignore folder on a checkout but you can use sparse checkouts in svn 1.5
for example this will check files and directory from your project trunk into my_checkout but not recurse into those directory

218558
hash	md5

i think what you re looking for is a hash function
i would recommend an approach like this the function hash can be any hash function for example the function md5 from digest md5

218749
punctuation	words
it s easier for my brain to tokenise each words and understand its meaning
although because the punctuation characters are harder to read it s still hard going - but maybe that will change given a bit of time to get used to it i ll update this answer again tomorrow assuming i can make it through an entire day like this


218773
mouse	keyboard

if i look at the official document object model events document mouse events fields are defined as read-only
keyboard events are not defined there i suppose mozilla followed this policy for them

219124
fastcgi	scgi
flup is another way to run with wsgi for any webserver that can speak fastcgi scgi or ajp
from my experience only fastcgi really works and it can be used in apache either via mod_fastcgi or if you can run a separate python daemon with mod_proxy_fcgi
wsgi is a protocol much like cgi which defines a set of rules how webserver and python code can interact it is defined as pep333

219490
sqldatasource	objectdatasource

my understanding is that with sqldatasource connection management is performed for you and you have nothing to fear
objectdatasource doesn t talk to the database directly in the first place so it will be safe -- as long as the underlying object performs its connection and reader management correctly

219541
filtering	grouping
instead of a factory that returns a grouping object consider filter adding some filter objects that require less granular configuration
for example instead of consider where all common filtering derive from something like filterbase or implement ifilter
on the server side call something like filterbase.constructqueryobject to return the more granular objects

219835
accessor	properties
compare to the same for properties vs fields since properties before the same function as events encapsulation via accessor also - events do not mention anything about fields
they only define the accessor add remove
the delegate backer is an implementation detail

219869
ubuntu	linux
well i know it s not a command and it s unlikely to be found on many unices but linux
in my ubuntu hardy bash_completion is already configured very well and that means not only for files and direcotires
for example if i type i get praise propdel propedit propget proplist propset and even i get automaticaly svn propget svn keywords it works also for ant and make automatically reading the default files or the ones specified on the commandline

219993
hlsl	glsl
these languages opengl s gl shader lang and high level shader lang and directx s equivalents are c style syntax and really easy to use
some examples of hlsl can be found here for xna game studio and direct x
i don t have any decent glsl references but i m sure there are a lot around

220003
post	get
however an easy way around this problem is to use the sp webservices to get you list data
i had a macro written by someone at ms a while back that automated this conversion if i canfind a link i ll post it
if you are using kerberos then you task is probably finished

220028
put	get

i always md5sum passwords before i put them into the database and then also md5sum password login attempts to check them against the db
just for safety i do a select query using a where clause with userid username and md5summed password so that i don t get any rows back at all unless both match

220050
hash	md5
md5 will do fine
don t store the password store the hash
then to log users in hash the password they entered and compare it to the hash in the database

220050
hash	salt
then to log users in hash the password they entered and compare it to the hash in the database
if the hash match they re legit
also add a salt to the password before you hash it

220082
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
if somebody gets your database they re probably going to get the key you used to encrypt the passwords as well
the real solution is to hash salt and then store the passwords
jeff atwood has an awesome post on this and here is one discussing rainbow tables massive tables of words with their md5 sums

220089
jboss	glassfish
jboss from redhat should work just fine on linux windows for sure
community a much much bigger community around jboss
glassfish still forming its community

220409
cpu	processors
if you have a single processors single thread machine then you should use the serial collector default for some configurations can be enabled explicitly for with -xx +useserialgc
for multiprocessor machines where your workload is basically cpu bound use the parallel collector
this is enabled by default if you use the -server flag or you can enable it explicitly with -xx +useparallelgc

220901
inherited	properties
but as a consequence you can t bind to type for real
the system.componentmodel code is identical between simple bindings and list bindings give or take a currency manager so simple bindings also inherited this behaviour
equally you can t bind to properties of a class that implements ilist ilistsource since this is interpreted in a special way

221448
post	get
the api is implemented as an asp page that accepts get or post params and returns xml after a user has been authenticated
so we can use the http send adapter to post requests to the fogbugz system either updating bug records or retrieving information
the response from the api call is basic xml that will be returned in the response body that can be read by biztalk as necessary

221811
maven	pom.xml

you can solve your deployment tasks using maven
every time you change anything just type svn update mvn clean compile war exploded tomcat inplace -p deployment you have deployment profile in your pom.xml file containing all the configuraiton needed for deployment environment

222288
put	get
when you take the address of the reference variable you get the address or the original variable in this case of a temporary ansistring created before calling broken not the address of the argument
if you don t want to pass around full classes your options are to either pass by pointer or put in a dummy argument or


222347
post	get
into the code will throw an exception that will not get handled
the second version from the original post does not have this problem and it is generally preferred
that said there is a minor overhead using the exception and if you are 100 sure the data will not change you can use the but i recommend against it

223002
post	get
in fact i m sure it will do anything you need it to do
taken from my other post about how to use autoit with python you can of course use any of the autoitx functions note that that link goes to the autoit function reference the com version of autoit - autoitx has a subset of that list...the documentation is included in the download in this way
i don t know what you re wanting to do so i can t point you towards the appropriate functions but this should get you started

223113
inherited	subclassing
yes any constructors you change in foo that bar or bah depend on will require you to modify bar and bah accordingly
no there is no way in .net to inherited constructors
but you can achieve code reuse by calling a base class s constructor inside the subclassing s constructor or by calling a virtual method you define like initialize

223288
client-side	server-side
if javascript validation didn t work for any reason regular server-side validation scenario page reload with error informations takes place using the same server-side script
this solution isn t as responsive as pure client-side validation needs time to send receive data between client and server but is quite simple and you don t need to translate validation rules to javascript


223414
filtering	grouping	union	distinct
if you have setup your class to override equals you or have an iequalitycomparer you can directly call the distinct extension method to return the unique results from the list
as an added bonus you can also use the union and intersect methods to merge or filtering between two lists
another option would be to grouping by the id and then select the first element

223423
switching	screens
if you are looking for simple full screens transitions i would just consider starting a new utility application and look at toggleview method in the rootviewcontroller.m
try switching out the uiviewanimationtransitionflipfromleft and uiviewanimationtransitionflipfromright to uiviewanimationtransitioncurlup and uiviewanimationtransitioncurldown for a really nice transition effect this only works on the device


223582
expression-blend	silverlight
now there is an eclipse plug-in available for you to use silverlight with eclispe
so you will be able to use expression-blend to design your ui and use java for the backend coding future plan i think
check out this link for more details

223887
profiling	debugging
xdebug is the most popular due to it s extra features beyond that of what you ve even described
xdebug will do profiling tracing into the valgrind format that you can use programs like kcachegrind and wincachegrind to evaluate
your only other real alternative to the debugging facilities xdebug provides is zend debugger which is a part of the zend platform again available as an extension

224067
hash-collision	key
i guess the only way around that would be to pre-exchange digital signature key or to have a trusted communication hub
possible attacks include if i can generate a hash-collision then i have two secret numbers with the same hash
so once i know everyone else s secret numbers i can choose which of my secret numbers to reveal thus selecting one of two possible results

224357
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
i can think of one bad one its the one mysql gives for why their table names are case sensitive
each table is a file on disk your filesystem is case-sensitive and the mysql devs forgot to
this is heaps of fun when you move a mysql schema to a case-insensitive filesystem

224866
vb6	vba
i think this originates from the old vba access jet currency data type being the first fixed point decimal type in the language
decimal only came in version 1.0 style not fully implemented in vb6 vba6 jet 4.0
the rule of thumb for storage of fixed point decimal values is to store at least one more decimal place than you actually require to allow for rounding

225000
public	protected

public members of a class a are accessible for all and everyone
protected members of a class a are not accessible outside of a s code but is accessible from the code of any class derived from a

225360
spaces	delimiter
this groups all white spaces as a delimiter
so if i have the string this should yield the strings hello and world and omit the empty spaces between the and the
as vonc pointed out the backslash should be escaped because java would first try to escape the string to a special character and send that to be parsed

225406
versioning	upgrade
we have problems with jvms crashing on a particular version of red hat for example
and we have also found some older red hat versioning unable to cope with extra memory properly resulting in running out of swap space
our solution was to upgrade redhat

225865
int	chars
that way you avoid all the null s and allow for more coupon types in the future
coupon coupon_id int name varchar coupon_type_id int - foreign key coupontype coupon_type_id int type_description varchar .
or i suppose you could have a coupon type column in your coupon table chars 1

226299
for-loop	loops
if your application uses a database or web service that not loops control is almost always going to be be where the time goes
the list.foreach could be faster due to using that internally and a for-loop without the wrapper would be even faster
i disagree that the list.foreach delegate version is more functional in any significant way

226422
innodb	myisam
optimum server settings are going to be different to a mainly myisam db
make sure the size of the innodb file is big enough to hold all your data or you ll be crucified by constant reallocation when you change the engines of the tables


226519
division	multiplication
i m guessing though that the choice of multiplication vs
division isn t going to have a big performance impact in your application


226546
vb.net	vb6
support for vb6 has ended but vb.net is still very much alive and gaining new features
vb.net compiles to msil bytecode that depends on some of the the .net libraries depending on which .net framework classes you use
some of those libraries are not written in pure .net or are just wrappers around the windows api

226774
int	boolean
when using integers as boolean this isn t true
in some languages on some computers fortran on vms there can be many different int values that resolve to true and many different values resolve to false
on windows the hresult when being interpreted as success or failure is the same way

227505
put	get

i generally create a hash and put component cookie whenever i add a component to the screen
when you need your cookie object back in an event perhaps the event always gets a copy of the component and then you are just a get component away from your cookie

227544
try-catch	exception-handling
because it is easier the code will on average be better written and less buggy
to me that programmer and quality overhead is the primary argument against using try-catch for process flow
the computer overhead of exception-handling is insignificant in comparison and usually tiny in terms of the application s ability to meet real-world performance requirements

227559
versioning	upgrade
finally we use the call-in to tell users how to get upgrade and technical support with their new license
finally we store the key in the application s database a locally-installed msde sql express database so that any attempt to copy the app will a be non-trivial and b bring over a lot of data specific to the organization that first bought the legitimate versioning making them less likely to share
the licensing key is encrypted and split into two different keys that are kept in two different tables

228015
int	chars	int	double
the maximally aligned types are likely to be in c99 long long long double or
if you include you could presumably use intmax_t in place of long long and on power 6 aix machines intmax_t would give you a 128-bit int type
the alignment requirements for that union can be determined by embedding it into a struct with a single chars followed by the union you would then use the larger of the requested alignment in the example 16 and the align value calculated above

228211
inherited	properties	hide	show
if you want a child web to display as a root level site in global navigation first turn off inheritance from the parent site like so you might also want to hide all site pages from global navigation
setting includepagesinnavigation to false hide all pages in the site regardless of whether the publishingpage.includeinglobalnavigation properties is set to true if you are dealing with default sites that don t inherited from publishingweb it s still possible to hide these sites from the global navigation bar. for example if you create a site collection using the collaboration portal template and want to exclude the news site from global navigation add that site to the __globalnavigationexcludes properties of the site adding navigation nodes directly to an spnavigationnodecollection is a good way to display only the nodes you want as well as to group nodes and links to external sites
figure 10 show how to add an internal link external link and a heading to the global navigation bar

228349
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar

i believe the uinavigationcontroller assumes that your controller view frames don t include the area beneath the navigation bar
uibarstyleblacktranslucent is more often used for uitoolbar so apple probably didn t make it easy to use it nicely with uinavigationbar

228349
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
uibarstyleblacktranslucent is more often used for uitoolbar so apple probably didn t make it easy to use it nicely with uinavigationbar
you ll probably need to abandon the uinavigationcontroller or start hacking the frames careful with rotations if you want to reliably render under the bar area
also if your intention is to hide the navigation bar after a few seconds you ll have a much easier time if you make it fade out like the photos app instead of trying to slide it up like mobile safari

228367
cpu	processors
in the early microprocessor days of the 1970 s cpus had only a small number of registers and a very limited instruction set
typically the arithmetic unit could only operate on a single cpu register often referred to as the accumulator
the accumulator on the 8 bit 8080 z80 processors was called a

228367
16-bit	64bit
so ax became eax bx became ebx etc
there was no need to access to top 16-bit of these new extended registers so they didn t create an eaxh pseudo register
amd applied the same trick when they produced the first 64bit processors

228777
post	put
i would suggest you use a tool which supports acl inheritance such as subinacl or setacl or one of the many acl tools
in relation to why your earlier post failed there is a few reasons
there are four locations where you can put your custom actions cas ui immediate deferred and commit rollback

228882
post	get
this blog post has a good rundown of what you need to do to get it working
i have done this myself too so if you re interested i can expand this post with some examples later


229041
put	get
use asp.net ajax updatepanel
put the listbox in the updatepanel and trigger a update if you add or remove listbox
this way viewstate and related fields get updates and eventvalidation will pass. forget client-side and use the classic postback and add or remove the listitems server-side

229451
gif	png
note also that irfanview does an awful job of converting 32bit png image to 256 allowing only one transparent color which looks bad if full color was dithered
i see that the gimp manual states his png8 format like gif uses only one bit for transparency
only two transparency levels are possible transparent or opaque

229736
for-loop	loops
it can be interesting in some cases but it can be a pitfall i saw in a source which is a major way to slow down a program because strlen is a costly function in c
somehow the for-loop is mostly designed to run a number of times know in advance you can still use break to terminate early so the dynamic evaluation of the stop term is more annoying than useful if you really need dynamic evaluation you use or
on some other languages like lua the stop condition is evaluated only once at loops init

229743
for-loop	loops
loops instruction decreases the value of the register ecx and jumps to the operand if ecx is greater than 0 it does nothing otherwise
this is a classic for-loop
mov ecx 0x00000010h loop_start

229917
int	chars	int	double	int	boolean
the java byte code specification only has 4-byte types and 8-byte types
byte chars int short boolean float are all stored in 4 bytes each
double and long are stored in 8 bytes

230139
post	put	post	get

could it be not the size related of the post but how long the line is before a new line
if they use the moodle wysiwyg view the html would just get put into one line with no breaks

230208
daemons	systemd
so far we ve had zero issues as a result of this process except when the build server kicks in while our source control systemd also known as the daemons spawn see so many of my recent remarks performs a large multi-file check-in
as daemons spawn doesn t support transacted check-ins. however this is a very rare occurrence -- perhaps once every 5 or 6 weeks
and a force rebuild immediately afterward takes care of it

230358
public	protected

in addition to mark biek s answer the __destruct function must be declared public
otherwise the function will not be executed on script shutdown warning call to protected mychild1 __destruct from context during shutdown ignored in unknown on line 0 warning call to private mychild2 __destruct from context during shutdown ignored in unknown on line 0 this may not be harmful but rather unclean

230561
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i actually use it on linux
on debian ubuntu sudo aptitude install winpdb then just put this in your code where you want it to break import rpdb2
rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger_interactive_password then start winpdb and attach to your running script

230712
cpu	processors
there are some tools for directing how the processors handles its cache but in general that is the processors s business and should be invisible to you
you can think of the cache as your cpu s window into ram
pretty much any memory access goes through the cache

230958
put	get
i usually have a thirdparty folder which will then have vendor product and version breakdowns so the ajax toolkit is stored in thirdparty microsoft ajaxtoolkit some version number
i like this approach because we can put a label on all the artifacts that go into making a build
another idea might be to the dll s within the project so if they get the latest of the project they will get the dlls

231163
filtering	grouping
it would be similar to using a sparse matrix instead of using a normal matrix
now with sql 2008 you can use partitioning functions and you are able to filtering the data that goes in an index
the disadvantage for earlier versions would be that the index would be made for all the data but this can be optimized by storing the interesting values in a separate file grouping

231171
multiplying	subtract

this will work for you basically it finds the flooy by multiplying by one with zero precision
then it can do ceil round by subtract that from the total calling the built in functions then adding the result back on edit fixed for -ve numbers

231216
stdout	fflush
it would mean that the program would potentially behave incorrectly if the user invoked the script without the -u option
i usually use a custom stdout like this .
now all your print calls which use sys.stdout implicitly will be automatically fflush ed

231602
hash	salt
or is it just hash and possibly salt
if it s hash you could get lucky and just google for a matching pair assuming you have any that are dictionary words because there are pre-hashed dictionaries already online
if you have an example of the ciphertext you could post it someone might recognize the cipher format.

231706
ssl	https

as far as ssl goes you can buy separate certificates for the domain and subdomain or a single wildcard .foo.com cert that covers them both naturally the wildcard cert will be more expensive
if you have an https page that requests items from other domains all will be well as long as everything is https

231706
ssl	https
you can do ssl cross-domain ajax using iframes as long as everything is https and the https scheme is used in the iframe src
summarizing short answer no true cross-domain xhr not allowed workaround with iframes more efficient need 2 ssl certs or wildcard cert somewhat complicated workaround with proxy less efficient can do with 1 or 2 ssl certs 1 with backend request to bar.foo.com via http somewhat complicated

put	get
i would suggest testing this gem with a quick man man invocation at the command line once you get it all together
i guess it s time for me to pull the custom garbage out of my .bashrc and put it where it belongs.
incedentally i found myself typing man trap at one point in this process

subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo
by quick calculations in sample programs showed so you want to use as little division as possible in favor of multiplication or modulo
not shown are subtraction addition and comparison operators cause they blow all of these out of the water
also using final as much as possible allows the jvm to do certain optimizations

if you can consistently reproduce the problem with specific input parameters you should debug like this first debug to the precise free that causes the problem
then figure out when the memory that is about to be free d was malloc ed

you d want to put more checks into your real code of course but i suspect it was the call to getgenericarguments that you were missing


233457
folder	directory
it replaces all the permissions set in order to set only the ones defined in the command so after the command accessing files resulted in a access denied even with my admin user it applied on the c windows directory while i called the command from the wwwroot folder
so after some tests the right command is t applies on specified folder and subfolders e edits the acl instead of replacing it

multiplying	subtract
then you use subtractive blending look up glblendequation to subtract your minimum value

nemerle	boo

a key factor for linq is the ability of the compiler to generate expression trees. i am using a macro in nemerle that converts a given nemerle expression into an expression tree object. i can then pass this to the where select etc extension methods on iqueryables. it s not quite the syntax of c# and vb but it s close enough for me
i got the nemerle macro via a link on this post it should be possible to create a similar macro for boo

236055
free	malloc	free	malloc
each implementation of malloc will operate same different depending on the os
neither unix linux windows needs that a free actually return the memory back to the os
that would be too expensive since your alloc would be in very small chunks recently mozilla firefox borrowed a malloc implementation from bsd os

236111
free	malloc
on linux with glibc the memory is actually always returned to the os above a certain size glibc malloc uses mmap for big allocations controlled by mmap_threshold and in that case free calls munmap which frees automatically the reserved memory
below that threshold it uses brk and free does not return the memory in that case
note that the above explanation is not exact to be precise you need to know the difference between physical memory virtual memory etc.

236152
versioning	upgrade
ms like to say that they don t break their apis between releases but this is not actually true
they may have got better at it but it was always a real issue for us getting hold of a pre-release versioning of their new software to see what we had to do to keep ours working with it
then we had to support several different ecel versions and upgrade of our content between them

236253
lisp	scheme
in functional languages this kind of situation never arises as i wouldn t be rebound
however with python and also as you ve seen with lisp this is no longer true
the difference with your scheme example is to do with the semantics of the do loop

236365
folder	directory
i believe simply prefixing the image relative url with .. should get you to the root of your application not necessarily the site as the application might not be hosted in the root of a site
if your xap file is located as follows and you where trying to link the following image apparently all relative uri s are relative to where the xap file is located clientbin folder typically and silverlight appends the current silverlight client namespace
so if you silverlight control is in the namespace whoppa you would need to put all your images in the clientbin whoppa directory

integer	fractions
some helpful information from msdn truncate returns the number that remains after any fractions digits have been discarded
it rounds to the nearest integer towards zero


236759
folder	directory
i have seen this done in install packages to get a shorter version of the directory
alternativly you can use a shared folder and map it to a drive letter
or you can use the an administrative share

236978
cpu	affinity
the .net threadpool won t allow you to limit things which is why you need to use a custom threadpool. another option if you re running on a multi-cpu machine is to use affinity to limit your program to certain cores
on a four-core machine if you limit your program to core3 for instance then it can go hog-wild and max out that cpu and the rest of the system will still have 3 cores to maintain high availability


237028
for-loop	loops
this happens until the function exits at which point the generator raises stopiteration and loops exits
so the generator object is sort of like an adapter - at one end it exhibits the iterator protocol by exposing __iter__ and next methods to keep the for-loop happy
at the other end however it runs the function just enough to get the next value out of it and puts it back in suspended mode

237216
dictionary	map
there are many different collection types like linked list array map set etc
is the container associative storing key-value pairs like a dictionary
memory footprint and layout

237298
try-catch	exception-handling
if you follow my religion as well and the second statement is true then you are not repeating code unnecessarily
unless you have other requirements my recommendations to improve your code would be 1 put the try-catch in each method not around each method call
2 have the catches within each method catch only the exception-handling you know about

237319
uiview	subviews	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when you re done with your prefs you can animate it out and then remove it as a subviews
you can switch to a uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller based hierarchy and hook your current opengl uiview to a uiviewcontroller s view outlet
then you can use all the regular uinavigationcontroller based navigation stuff

237495
disk	ram
most file systems are configured to use block sizes of 4096 or 8192
in theory if you configure your buffer size so you are reading a few bytes more than the disk block the operations with the file system can be extremely inefficient if you configured your buffer to read 4100 bytes at a time each read would require 2 block reads by the file system
if the blocks are already in cache then you wind up paying the price of ram - l3 l2 cache latency

237495
disk	ram
this is why you see most buffers sized as a power of 2 and generally larger than or equal to the disk block size
this means that one of your stream reads could result in multiple disk block reads - but those reads will always use a full block - no wasted reads
now this is offset quite a bit in a typical streaming scenario because the block that is read from disk is going to still be in memory when you hit the next read we are doing sequential reads here after all - so you wind up paying the ram - l3 l2 cache latency price on the next read but not the disk- ram latency

237818
folder	directory	folder	dir
as a really basic guide using the command line the git gui should be pretty self explanatory mkdir myrepo - make a new directory this could be an existing dir with your code in it git init - makes the directory into a git repository
this basically adds a .git folder to the current directory
this is like using visualsvn creating a new repository then checking it out to a working directory just without the server vim myfile.txt - make a new file if you have existing files you obviously can skip this git add myfile.txt - start tracking the new file similar to svn add ing a file git commit - commits whatever you have run git add on

237861
ant	maven
i tend to roll my own repo without maven maven is fine but it doesn t click with me
i run something similar to the bsd ports system that is one big structured tree that contains little ant build files
these build files either checkout the source of a project pull its dependencies from somewhere else in the tree and build it these are for the projects i want to build- mine or pull binaries from somewhere else which might be an external source or my own binaries repository

run that and you ll see an overflowexception get thrown
if that s what you want for your whole project you can set it in the project properties or compile with the checked+ command line option to csc . edit it s worth noting that the other answers have shown that you could put smaller amounts of code in the checked context - just the declaration and assignment of c or even just the calculation
it s all pretty flexible

238767
post	put	post	get
my preference would be that the username password only be accepted via post so that it doesn t appear in the url at all but you could conceivably encrypt and encode the password so that it could be put in a get request
i can t envision any reason why i would do this instead of a post
edit as others have indicated if you have patient-related data you may need to encrypt all communications with the server

238937
serializable	deserialization

i use it in a class tree which serializable to a xml file
on the deserialization the parser class returns a pointer to the base class which has a enumeration for the type of the subclass because you don t know which type it is until you parse it

239066
prng	random	prng	random
if you use a so-called true random number generator that uses properties of entropy or noise in its generation then it would be very difficult to produce the same values given some input unless you re able to duplicate the entropic state for both calls into the function - which of course would defeat the purpose of using such a generator.
in the case of remote keyless entry systems they very likely use a prng function that is deterministic in order to take advantage of this feature
there are many ics that provide this sort of functionality to produce random numbers for electronic circuits

lisp	scheme

240272
post	put
you can reissue a put update or delete request as many times as you want and it will have the same effect every time however the desired effect will modify a resource so it is not considered safe
a post request should create a new resource with every request meaning the effect will be different every time
therefore post is not considered safe or idempotent

240406
fseek	fread
every time you added a new block you would also add it to this vector the correspondent information and save it
now if you wanted to to read a specific block you could do a search on this vector position yourself on the real file with fseek or whatever to the correspondent offset and read x bytes this offset to the start of the other or to the end of the file and do a cast to something depending on the cblocktype examples read some bytes..
fread cbuffer 1 itotalbytes p_file

241908
octal	binary	octal	hex
even a simple task for a human in binary is long winded simple second grade math is still a lot of ones and zeros
so octal became popular because it allowed you to think in groups of three bits and you could use symbols we are familiar with as numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
but groups of four which is another power of 2 gives the humans a lot more mental computing power than octal hex is based on 4 bits which is also a power of 2

241908
multiplying	subtract
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software
take the worst case multiplying for a four bit system 1111 1111 11100001 so it takes 8 bits to store the result of a 4 bit multiplying you will quickly find that if you had a 4 bit system most of the multiplies you want to do will result a number that cannot be stored in 4 bits
so when i saw you taking 64 bit integers the unsigned long long is often 64 bits and multiplying four times that means you need 64 5 or a 320 bit integer to store your answer you were trying to put that answer in a 64 big result which quite often depending on the compiler and computer will happily do and will truncate the upper bits leaving you with the lower 64 bits of the result which can easily look smaller than any of your operands which is what i had thought you might have done at first

profiling	debugging
it s great for forensics and debugging
profiling quantifies that it tells you how much time your code spent in each area or how many times a body of code was executed
it helps you improve your code s performance

242317
free	malloc
if parts of the data structure are paged to disk they need to be loaded from disk only to be discarded
whereas if you terminate without free ing the data paged out to disk can die in peace
of course free ing at other times is usually beneficial as further malloc s can re-use the space you freed and free might even unmap some memory which can then be used by other processes

242348
innodb	myisam
otoh if you were looking to re-code your application to be transaction aware then deciding this setting will be part of the general performance review needed of the innodb settings
the other major thing to watch out for is that innodb does not support fulltext indices nor insert delayed
but then myisam doesn t support referential integrity

242953
cpu	processors

if your app is running on a 64 bit cpu then probably not much difference at all

you may even want to get the template text from a resource bundle to allow for support of multiple languages with the added ability to cope with the fact that 0 and 1 may appear in a different order in some languages
update i just read your original post properly and noticed the comment about the pdf. this suggest that the template text is going to be significantly larger than a line or two
in such cases you may want to explore something like stringtemplate which seems better suited for this purpose - this comment is based solely on initial investigations as i ve not used it in anger

goto	break
i would caution against if failed .. break
on one point in that you re producing a surprising result should you try to nest loops neither goto cleanup nor if succeeded .. have this surprise so i d encourage using one of these two instead


244233
octal	hex
hex maps 4 bits to one hex nibble 0-f so a byte is stored in two nibbles 00-ff
octal was popular on digital equipment dec and other older machines but one octal digit maps to three bits so it doesn t cross byte boundaries as nicely
overall the choice of radix is a way to make your programming easier - use the one that matches the domain best

regarding future preventive measures i agree with greg hewgill there are several known data repository corruption bugs in subversion 1.3.1
the last known one being patched in 1.4.6 and also patched in all 1.5.x and all future versioning of course
so you could upgrade to ubuntu 8.04 dapper drake if possible which comes with subversion 1.4.6 as well as some ext3 file system patches

246649
vb.net	vb6

imho i would suggest not moving to vb.net at all but instead utilizing your c background and making the move to c#
the reason for this is you already know the syntax and that vb.net is not enough like vb6 to make it as easy a move as you might expect

realloc	malloc
make sure you malloc and free the memory correctly using something like - an alternative is to make data just be a pointer to the elements
you can then realloc data to the correct size as required
of course if you were asking about c++ either of these would be bad practice

247229
lisp	scheme
i got on the functional train and now believe that if you have a lazy language or a good syntax for lambda even that isn t necessary so macros are not all that useful in a purely functional style

247804
int	chars

outpts if think the point is that php does not differentiate between int indexed arrays and string indexed hashtables
the serialization format can be used for hashtables exactly the same way as the format is not intended to be human readable but rather to provide a common format to represent all php variable types with exception of resources i think it s more simple to use the given format because the underlying variable can be reconstructed by reading the string chars by chars

i would not run the application full time as root but you might want to explore making your application setuid root or setuid to some id that can become root using something like sudo for particular applications

this way your program has no special privileges when running normally only elevates it s privileges when needed and is restricted by sudo to only running certain programs
it s been awhile since i ve done much unix development so i m not really sure whether it s possible to set up sudo to not prompt for a passwd or even if there is an api for it but as a fallback you could enable setuid to root only when needed

int	double
integers are stored with the right-most bit being 1 and each bit to the left being double that 2 4 8 ...
it s easy to see that this can store any int up to 2 n where n is the number of bits
the mantissa decimal part of a floating point number is stored in a similar way but moving left to right and each successive bit being half of the value of the previous one

249511
datediff	difference
with one-digit accuracy this won t make much difference but do not try to calculate new dates based on the resulting value as they will not be 100 accurate
i ll try and find a way to format that more nicely... this yields 8.3 the formula takes into account that between 2008-04-13 and 2008-11-05 datediff mm ... returns 7 but really it is not seven months in between but less
in this example it returns 6.7

it does not however require locking for ordinary source files those can be opened for editing by multiple users at the same time and then merged back into the depot
i find perforce s system with changelists that group changes to multiple files and treat them as a unit nice
i m sure you can do something similiar with svn but it s not as easy out of the box

249808
folder	directory
the simple answer is that you can t share files in svn - in the end we had to restructure our directory and use batch files
for source code files that were shared we moved them to an include folder and have all the projects reference that folder
for binary files that need to be copied to more than one location we store them just once in svn and then use batch files to copy them across to the target locations on each developers machine or also on the build machine

250008
post	get

this is my first post one stackoverflow
you can get the cellid the id of the phone pole that the mobile is connected to on a lot of phones thru system.getproperty string arg here i have an example that tries a few keys to see if a cellid can be found

250131
hide	show
the following link show how to manually remove items
customize site actions menu i have added options to the menu using features but have never tried to hide otb option in code
i would be interested in your results

250459
put	get
don t get me wrong i love django and i will stick to it for a lot of projects
i just wont put it everywhere yet .


250719
public	protected
unit tests are generally speaking meant to test the interface of a class meaning its public and protected methods
you can of course hack a solution to this even if just by making the methods public but you may also want to consider if the method you d like to test is really worth testing it may be worth to move it into its own class
add more tests to the public methods that call the private method testing the private method s functionality

250971
put	get

put all your non-presentation code which excludes serializing to json put all the code that goes before serialization in a class library and link to the dll directly from the unit tests
also to get any expression to be evaluated in the debugger you have to be in break mode hit a breakpoint or press the stop button which has a stop-square on it

251023
cvs	svn
they would have to access code via our svn and would be unlikely to get paid without meeting unit testing and code review requirements
if contracting i d make sure to have solid experience of both vss check-in out and cvs merge conflict models
working on your own you have a great opportunity to play and learn with the latest - i d be trying out git

251371
int	double

store as a typical c-time the time_t int value returned by time value in an unsigned int column
convert like drewh said with nsdate - timeintervalsince1970 - datewithtimeintervalsince1970 double value except store as an integer unless you need sub-second granularity which generally for created-on last-modified is overkill

251619
equals	gethashcode
by providing a more unique gethashcode function it excerises the equals function far less often
i also optimised the equals function to compare the more unique values before the less unqiue keys
86 000 11 items with 10 000 unique properties runs in 0.34 seconds using the comparer object below without the comparer object it takes 9 minutes 22 seconds hope this helps edit if it was just one string instead of a keyvaluepair where string name+value it would be approx twice as fast

251773
switching	screens
if your application deals with documents it s better to let each one have its own window
it makes it easier for the user to arrange their workspace and switching between documents using the os s app switching capabilities
a lot of mdi applications prevent this by corraling multiple documents into the same window which limits usability of screens real estate in a multiple monitor scenario

252122
versioning	upgrade
implementation of intellisense requires a full fidelity of engine parser reconstruction in client side using managed code base
support of multiple server versioning means design and implementation of multiple versioning of parsers and related infra in parallel. this multiplies time and cost to develop test and support
at the same time the core module is an important product base that enables not only intellisense feature but also other products including upgrade advisor to analyze scripts

252733
goto	break
in other words the normal switch behavior is wrong 97 of the time. it s not just in a compiler - on the contrary where fall through was used in this analysis it was often for situations that occur more frequently in a compiler than in other software for instance when compiling operators that can have either one or two operands case fall through is so widely recognized as a defect that there s even a special comment convention shown above that tells lint this is really one of those 3 of cases where fall through was desired. i think it was a good idea for c# to require an explicit jump statement at the end of each case block while still allowing multiple case labels to be stacked - as long as there s only a single block of statements
in c# you can still have one case fall through to another - you just have to make the fall thru explicit by jumping to the next case using a goto
it s too bad java didn t take the opportunity to break from the c semantics

252949
put	get
edit examples of looping that might not be necessary are when you try to do lookups in a list or match two lists or similar
if the looping takes a long time see if it make sense to put the lists into binary trees or hash maps
there could be an initial cost of creating them but if the code is redesigned you might get that back by having o 1 lookups later on

253390
cvs	svn

for cvs pycvs may be worth a look
for svn there is pysvn which is pretty good

253463
redmine	trac

if you plan to do multi-project management in the future choose redmine
with trac you can have multi-project setups as well having a separate environment for each project but in the end it s a workaround

253463
redmine	trac	redmine	trac
with trac you can have multi-project setups as well having a separate environment for each project but in the end it s a workaround
redmine has builtin support for multi-project environments
i previously used trac to manage my projects but i switched to redmine

253463
redmine	trac
redmine uses textile markup but trac uses markdown so i had a couple of troubles there
finally i heard that redmine has some some issues on windows
i haven t tried running redmine on that platform so you d better give it a try or google around

253740
hash	md5
actually all other aspects being equal a slower hash function is more secure than a fast one
this is because a slower hash function results in slower generation of rainbow tables and slower brute forcing or dictionary attacks on the password
from thomas ptacek at as referenced in this coding horror article the problem is that md5 is fast

253908
inherited	subclassing
that means that what we are getting here is not overloading it s hiding
the difference between these is crucial to understanding methods in inherited
if your runnable was declared as a subclassing then the run method would hide the run int method in the parent

254005
ubuntu	debian	emacs	textmate

if you are on ubuntu debian plain old emacs with ruby-elisp package isn t bad
it s no textmate but it s not bad

254130
mouse	keyboard

i think adobe needs to drop the focus when the mouse goes out of its client area or provide an option to do so
however i think most flash developers and especially those who make games rely on the fact that keyboard input is caught by the flash application regardless of where the mouse is

254250
typedef	struct
to prevent these problems it s a good idea to typedef your classes and struct in c++ too even though at first glance it appears to be unnecessary
in c++ with the typedef the name hiding become an error that the compiler tells you about rather than a hidden source of potential problems


254703
post	get
if you anticipate that your rails project might be deployed in scenarios where the daemon will not have access to the console during startup-time you could read from a named-pipe instead of the console s standard input
going one step further you could remove all parts of init.rb except for the require statement and add an action that performs this setup to a controller that would take the relevant parameters as a post over the web
make sure to configure rails to prevent potentially sensitive parameters passwords from being entered into log files recording accesses or errors especially if it might be used as an http get with parameters in the url

255015
submit	submission

if you think what you are doing will be a marked improvement to the kohana project you should make your changes and submit a patch to be considered by the project s maintainers
you probably aren t the first person to appreciate a part of their framework and component-izing their framework into smaller bits may be something you could help encourage by submission a patch though that will require much more time on your part to engineer

255630
dictionary	map

as everyone else has said there s no mapping within a dictionary from value to key
i ve just noticed you wanted to map to from value to multiple keys - i m leaving this solution here for the single value version but i ll then add another answer for a multi-entry bidirectional map

255630
dictionary	map
i ve just noticed you wanted to map to from value to multiple keys - i m leaving this solution here for the single value version but i ll then add another answer for a multi-entry bidirectional map
the normal approach to take here is to have two dictionary - one mapping one way and one the other
encapsulate them in a separate class and work out what you want to do when you have duplicate key or value throw an exception overwrite the existing entry or ignore the new entry

255743
inherited	subclassing
to create a new subclassing within a class cluster you must implement its primitive methods
if what you want is to inherited the behavior of an array it s usually a better idea to do that with a has-a relationship rather than an is-a
that is to write a class that has an nsarray instance variable and simply forwards the relevant messages to it

255786
vim	textmate
fuzzyfinder and fuzzyfinder - textmate - allows you to quickly find files based on portins of a file name
ctags bufexplorer dbext for executing sql commands and getting the results in a vim buffer
ack and the ack plugin for a better grepping experience from within vim

255978
int	chars
in my book i ve included lots of color cartoon-like chars that are like a java-fabric softener
kids like to see immediate results and enjoy playing with shorter programs for example a class fish has a method dive int howdeep
let me try to call this method several times with different arguments.

256099
client-side	server-side
but the server-side part is pretty simple
the client-side part is trickier i think
i found this article helpful he s writing things in php but the client side work is pretty much the same

256241
versioning	upgrade
not the latest versions but that s easy enough to upgrade
yes you might not have the very latest versioning of the jdk but really unless you have a need to develop for the latest and greatest jdk it s not going to be an issue


256359
post	put	post	get
put is often described as the edit method as by replacing the entire resource with a slightly altered version you have edited what clients will get when they next do
using rest in html forms the html5 spec defines get and post for the form element
the method content attribute is an enumerated attribute with the following keywords and states the keyword get mapping to the state get indicating the http get method

256359
post	get
the method content attribute is an enumerated attribute with the following keywords and states the keyword get mapping to the state get indicating the http get method
the keyword post mapping to the state post indicating the http post method
technically the http specification does not limit you to only those methods

256521
skip-lists	tree

from the wikipedia article you quoted θ n operations which force us to visit every node in ascending order such as printing the entire list provide the opportunity to perform a behind-the-scenes derandomization of the level structure of the skip-lists in an optimal way bringing the skip-lists to o log n search time
... a skip-lists upon which we have not recently performed any such θ n operations does not provide the same absolute worst-case performance guarantees as more traditional balanced tree data structures because it is always possible though with very low probability that the coin-flips used to build the skip-lists will produce a badly balanced structure edit so it s a trade-off skip lists use less memory at the risk that they might degenerate into an unbalanced tree

256670
ubuntu	linux
this allowed my to run the stuff on linux but display it on my windows desktop
1 i used to run ubuntu in 64-bit mode but i had no end of trouble
mixing 64-bit and 32-bit is something mac os x does much better. 7.04 worked fine running 32-bit applications on the 64-bit kernel

256843
stateless	stateful
stateful database connections can t be maintained easily as they could fail at any moment the application needs to remember what it was in the middle of doing it and redo it
stateless ones can just be reconnected and have the atomic command re-issued without in most cases breaking state


256861
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the resulting idiom applies equally to collections and arrays when you see the colon read it as in. thus loops above reads as for each element e in elements. note that there is no performance penalty for using the for-each loops even for arrays
in fact it may offer a slight performance advantage over an ordinary for-loop in some circumstances as it computes the limit of the arrays index only once
while you can do this by hand item 45 programmers don t always do so

257043
des	aes
it s been widely in use for a long time but since it was originally specified with only a 56 bit key it s questionable whether it s secure enough for any important uses at this point
triple des is generally better but there are some known theoretical attacks
if you have a choice of cipher you might want to look at aes instead

257199
int	chars
just use the left-bitshift operator shifting to the left by 8 using at least a 16-bit int
then binary or the 2nd value to the int
alternatively putting both values in a union containing 2 chars careful of big endian or small would have the same bit level result

257359
x86	64bit
on an x86 platform usually double is 64bit and long double is either 64 or 80 bits which gives you 19 significant figures if i remember right
your mileage may vary especially if you re not on x86


257570
put	get

should be your best bet to debug things like this is to put the query into a variable and use that that print statement would make it very obvious what the problem is
if you re going to be using list variables a lot like this it can get very confusing consider using the list just once and putting the variables into a dictionary

257608
int	double
the 10 byte long double provides a 64-bit mantissa
this is very convenient for when you want to store 64 bit int in floating point without loss of precision


257790
tapestry	wicket
but no one seems to like struts anymore
the ex-jakarta menu on the apache jakarta page shows a number of web application frameworks that they ve incubated including tapestry turbine and velocity
there s also wicket a very decent comparison of wicket and tapestry is available here

257953
width	height
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height
of course if there aren t any hard width values then the design is a liquid layout so the concern about designing for a particular width is somewhat altered
usually good liquid layouts despite being displayed correctly at any dimension are nonetheless designed to be viewed at reasonable window widths

257989
filesystems	fat
allocate a large file then create a filesystems structure in it
there are several options for the filesystems available for both berkeley ufs and linux ext2 ext3 there are user-mode libraries available
it might also be possible that you find a fat implementation somewhere

258049
accessor	properties
only provide accessor mutator functions if the accessor mutator methods are a sensible and useful part of the class s interface api
don t think of these methods as accessor or mutators
instead think of them as methods that access or mutate a certain abstract properties of the object that happens to be represented by a single member today but may be computed in a more complex manner tomorrow

258093
awt	swing	swt	swing
i don t think that awt is capable of restyling native component peers in a reliable fashion
i know for certain that swt can t and it s a far more sophisticated toolkit than awt
this is part of why it was essentially deprecated in favor of swing back in java 1.2

258148
vim	emacs
if anything you re gonna be more comfortable using emacs on colemak than on qwerty at least i was
in vim it s a lot trickier since hjkl will be completely messed-up
then again i ve always felt that hlkl was broken and should have instead been jkj

258297
inherited	properties
interfaces cannot have constructors neither properties fields function bodies etc
interfaces cannot be inherited they are implemented again technically it might be true that implementing an interface is actually inheriting it in specific languages but that s not my point. interfaces are more like contracts as they do not define any behaviour whatsoever like classes
now if this is a homework then you shouldn t really argue about these sort of stuff with the teacher

258300
width	margin
apply a left margin or padding to #container_bottom container_bottom margin-left 1px

post	get

assuming i understand your question correctly you should check out this blog post of mine titled saving and accessing version compilation information with flex applications which goes on to explain how you can use the conditional compilation feature in the mxmlc compiler to save variable values into the compiled binary and then print them to the log or display in the user interface within the app itself
here are the relevant snippets from that post as far as the actual version number goes i just use three things the compilation date see the example scripts in the post for info on how to automate this the hostname of the computer where it was compiled also demonstrated in the post the svn revision of the working copy see my answer to this question for info on how to get the svn revision number

258675
codeigniter	cakephp
it is more a library than a monolithic framework like cakephp or ror you don t like zend_db you could use zf + doctrine
you don t like zend_controller you could try codeigniter + doctrine + zf you can use zend_openid without using zf s mvc solution
you can also start to use zend in your current application without rewriting everything

258697
implements	extends

the code to do this for a usb mass storage device would be something like it might give you an idea how to implements it

put	get
side issue i ve capitalised these correctly for the people i m referencing - de and van den don t get captial letters for some families but do for others
conversely many asian cultures put the family name first because the family is considered more important than the individual
last point - some people place great store in being junior or senior or iii - and your code shouldn t treat those as the family name

260148
lxml	libxml2	lxml	elementtree

if you have libxml2 and libxslt installed then also install lxml
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree

260148
lxml	libxml2	lxml	elementtree
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well


260277
skip-lists	tree
the rebalance operation can affect large portions of the tree which would require a mutex lock on many of the tree nodes
inserting a node into a skip-lists is far more localized only nodes directly linked to the affected node need to be locked
update from jon harrops comments i read fraser and harris s latest paper concurrent programming without locks

260735
keydown	keyup
if you want to what someone is typing in a text box it s usually best to wait until they ve released before trying to decide what they re doing
but if it s something like a game where you want to respond the instant it s pressed than you would use keydown
keydown is the moment the key is pushed down. keyup is after the key has been released

260826
subclass	abstract-class	public	protected
for abstract-class this constructor scope public or protected is not of much difference since the instantiation is not allowed even if public
since it is meant to be invoked by the subclass it can invoke either public or protected constructor seamlessly
its completely on choice what to use

260932
free	realloc
the sizeof keyword is used here to find out the size of the words struct then that size is multiplied by the number of elements you want to allocate
once you are done be sure to use free to free up the heap memory you used in order to prevent memory leaks free array
if you want to change the size of the allocated array you can try to use realloc as others have mentioned but keep in mind that if you do many realloc s you may end up fragmenting the memory

260972
strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	memmove
standard c provides strcpy strcat strncat strncpy memmove memcpy etc
it makes sense to use strncpy over strcpy for safety if you don t know the source string will fit inside the destination buffer
however strncpy has a major performance issue in that it always writes the amount of bytes specified for the size

261159
public	protected
define all your constructors protected making them public is pointless anyway your subclass constructor s can call one constructor of the abstract class
it may even have to call it if there is no no-arg constructor in the abstract class in any case don t forget that if you don t define a constructor then the compiler will automatically generate one for you this one is public has no argument and does nothing


261227
int	boolean
i could write a method that accepts three boolean void setstate boolean bdidhomework boolean batedinner boolean bsleptwell
or i could use a single number to represent all three states and pass a single value void setstate int nstatebits
if you choose the second pattern you ll be very happy when decide to add another state - you won t have to break existing impls of your interface

261277
boost	stl

boost has a utility called next and its inverse prior for just that purpose
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out

bash	zsh

it s probably best to stick with bash simply because it s the most widely used as a shell and any tutorials or help you may receive from someone will most likely use bash
however i have started using zsh for all of my scripts and i have found it to be far superior to bash in terms of scripting

262878
post	get
applicationcontext has more functionality and you definitely want to use the postprocessors such as requiredannotationbeanpostprocessor autowiredannotationbeanpostprocessor and commonannotationbeanpostprocessor which will help you simplify your spring configuration files and you can use annotations such as required postconstruct resource etc in your beans
even if you don t use all the stuff applicationcontext offers it s better to use it anyway and then later if you decide to use some resource stuff such as messages or post processors or the other schema to add transactional advices and such you will already have an applicationcontext and won t need to change any code
if you re writing a standalone app load the applicationcontext in your main method using a classpathxmlapplicationcontext and get the main bean and invoke its run or whatever method to start your app

262916
scheme	racket

the standard name for timing the execution of expressions in most scheme implementations is time
here is an example from within racket

263011
post	get	post	get
an http post which is different from an http get is a separate logical call to the webserver but it still defines a uri that should process the post
a good webserver apache being one will again make the uri available to whatever module or appserver is running within it then will additionally make available the variables which were sent in the post headers
at the point where your application takes control from apache during a post you should have access to both the get and post variables and be able to do whatever control logic you wish including replying with a soap protocol instead of html

263063
post	get
in either case how the server-side processes both the search part and the http body is entirely up to the server - discarding both would be conforming to these two specs but fairly useless
in order to determine whether you can post a search part to a specific service you need to study this service s protocol specification
if the service is practically defined by means of a html form then you cannot use a mix - you can t even use post if the form specifies get and vice versa

263063
post	get
if the service is practically defined by means of a html form then you cannot use a mix - you can t even use post if the form specifies get and vice versa
if you post to a web service you need to look at the web service s wsdl - which will typically mandate post
with all data in a soap message

263226
kerberos	ntlm
in ntlm you are not allowed to authenticate to remote services

options you may try switch to kerberos

263791
folder	directory
some options for when you want to update your exported copy run svn export --force home ..... myproject this will stop it complaining about overwriting the existing files
this method will mean that if you delete a file from your repository it ll still remain in your www folder
change your svn command to export into a new directory each time svn export home .... myproject_20081105 and then create a symlink to that folder ln -s myproject_20081105 myproject just delete and recreate the symlink each time you release

264354

i have to do this for the subscription lists for the perl review

you can often go to a postal service website to get a canonical form of an address

264473
innodb	myisam
sqlite runs in-process with the client application no network capability very low query overhead because of this potentially rather fast for easy queries because there is less ipc system calls and data copying to do
very limited concurrency i think it s either one writer or multiple readers per database file mysql far more features choice of engines innodb provides good features for many workloads much more control of storage backup restore etc network-capable - which allows its use in large scale applications better concurrency - the innodb engine has mvcc which means that readers do not block writers nor do writers block readers
even the old myisam engine has table-level locking rather than for the whole database as sqlite

264475
filtering	grouping
your best bet is to have the application store a master list of the grouping you want your application to see or a list of grouping you want your application to ignore either an include list or an exclude list
then when you pull back a specific user s roles just compare it to the configured exclude or include list and filtering out the unwanted results
if you want an easier way there is an open source ad role provider over at codeproject that already has support for both exclude and include lists

264518
cpu	processors
the exact details vary from processors to processors
if you are running as a process on an os the sleep call generally just tells the scheduler to suspend your process and then the kernel decides whether to schedule another process or to sleep the cpu
also the above code will not be adequete for real time systems which want deadline guarantees etc

264539
next	except
certain nonalphanumeric characters might have special weights assigned to them
for example the hyphen - might have a very small weight assigned to it so that coop and co-op appear next to each other in a sorted list
string sort is similar to word sort except that there are no special cases

264777

just going from userspace to kernelspace during a pre-emption system call and back without doing any substantial kernel work would take 1000 cpu cycles.

i use the command pattern a lot

265284
int	double
if you are using double precision floats there are a total of 64 bits some of which are devoted to the mantissa some to the exponent and 1 to the sign bit
2 1000 needs a 1001 bit int to be represented without losing precision
in order to work with numbers like that you will need to use a library that has big number support such as gnu mp

265372
client-side	server-side
asp.net validation controls also provide two ways of validation server-side or client-side
the nice thing about these validation controls is that it will preform client-side validation when it detects the browser is able unless client-side validation has been disabled
thus reducing roundtrips

265564
post	get

if i understand the problem correctly you could solve this in post processing by simply using datetime.touniversaltime on the service side
for your example this should get you a datetime with the value 2008-11-03 00 00 00 and kind datetimekind.utc

266257
hex	binary
time it was programmers coded in the 1 and 0 s of binary
hex was considered an advance over this
that was before assembly which uses the code s names and separates the parts of an instruction into its parts

266699
int	chars

given that you are on a 32 bit machine 10000000000 is too big a number to be represented by an int
also converting an int to a chars will only give you from 0..255 or -128..127 depending on the compiler

266871
folder	directory
will cause the current directory to change if a different folder was selected
when running a windows service its containing folder is c windows system32 as that is the system folder and it is the system the operation system that is actually running your windows service
note that specifying a relative path in most of the system.io objects will fall back to using the environment.currentdirectory property

266910
put	get

you can address this in a number of ways architecturally in order to funnel all changes through a central service so that they are not able to make inconsistencies but regardless of how much effort you are willing to put into that and creating a bottleneck or single point of failure may violate some other requirements you have you will not be able to rely on the database engine itself to enforce it with a guarantee like you can with a fk constraint
i often had to deal with this in cross-departmental database situations where things could get out of sync because disparate systems were not fully integrated yet or security concerns required them to have separate administrators

267096
implements	extends

if your abstract class is the only class that will ever implements the interface then you can always just check for instances of the abstract class you don t need the interface
but if you want to be future-compatible with new classes not yet written which will not extends the abstract class but could use the interface then keep using the interface now

267099
g++	gcc

to add to what others have said g++ is the gnu c++ compiler
gcc is the gnu compiler collection not the gnu c compiler as many people assume

that said if the control is rendered on the client because the visible property is true when the page is rendered you can then hide it using javascript like this that assumes that the control s id attribute really is txteditbox on the client and that it is already visible
there is not necessarily a best way although one better approach is to use css class definitions when you want to hide something dynamically apply that class to the element
when you want to show it again remove it

267408
public	protected
you could also consider using send which will also give you access to private and protected methods like james baker suggested alternatively you could modify the metaclass of your test object to make the private protected methods public just for that object
this will let you call these methods without affecting other objects of that class. you could reopen the class within your test directory and make them public for all the instances within your test code but that might affect your test of the public interface


267497
int	chars

std getline allows you to read a line of text and you can use a string stream to parse the individual line once you get the line of text into the string you can actually use any parsing function you want even sscanf buf.c_str d d d i1 i2 i3 by using atoi on the substring with the int or through some other method
you can also ignore unwanted chars in the input stream if you know they re there

267542
post	get

i think you should be able to follow the method used in this post
it looks really ugly but i would think you could do it twice and get the result you want

267694
tunnel	vpn
i m almost positive it ll only authenticate handshake once
tunnel over ssh
the poor man s vpn

267694
tunnel	vpn
the poor man s vpn
you ll be able to tunnel ftp or anything you like over the ssh connection
it ll be as fast as you re going to get and is very secure to boot

267839
short	base
masks particularly multi-bit ones often have an associated shift value which is the amount the bits need shifting left so that the least significant masked bit is shifted to the least significant bit in the type
for example using a 16 bit short data type suppose you wanted to be able to mask bits 3 4 and 5 lsb is number 0
you mask and shift would look something like #define mask 0x0038 #define shift 3 masks are often assigned in hexadecimal because it is easier to work with bits in the data type in that base as opposed to decimal

267839
octal	decimal	octal	decimal
you mask and shift would look something like #define mask 0x0038 #define shift 3 masks are often assigned in hexadecimal because it is easier to work with bits in the data type in that base as opposed to decimal
historically octal has also been used for bit masks
if i have a variable var that contains data that the mask is relevant to then i can isolate the bits like this i can isolate all the other bits like this i can clear the bits like this i can clear all the other bits like this i can set all the bits like this i can set all the other bits like this i can extract the decimal value of the bits like this i can assign a new value to the bits like this

267976
folder	directory
to answer you second question whether you should deploy these libraries into tomcat s shared directory - i would say no and here s why if you deploy a library jar into the shared location tomcat server lib then that version of the library becomes the default for all web-applications running under that instance of tomcat
as you can see from this overview of the tomcat architecture the class-loader works down the chain with an individual web-app s lib folder being the last place it will look before it throws a class-not-found exception
this is not true in tomcat 6 and tomcat 7 any classes in the web apps lib and classes folder will be resolved before those in common and thus this will not break other apps which deploy all of their jars in the war 2

268287
inherited	subclassing

classes should either be designed for inherited or prohibit it
there is a cost to designing for inherited it can pin down your implementation you have to declare which methods are going to call which other methods in case a user overrides one but not the other it reveals your implementation rather than just the effects it means you have to think of more possibilities when designing things like equals are hard to design in an inherited tree it requires more documentation an immutable type which is subclassing may become mutable ick item 17 of effective java goes into more details on this - regardless of the fact that it s written in the context of java the advice applies to .net as well

268335
ssd	sata
so it will as you see be more than twice as bad as the simple read case
to improve the speed the first thing i d try is a faster hard drive or an ssd
sata is pretty much the easiest fastest option

269015
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
actually only ie gives this information which isn t important for the server in most cases
neither firefox nor opera at least provide this info
update also tried with safari still no path.

269015
google-chrome	safari
update also tried with safari still no path.
somebody reported that google-chrome might provide the info although being a beta that might change.
perhaps you might need them in some intranet cases

269289
int	double
i o operators this is where you figure out how to properly create your class from user input and how to format it for output as well
conversions casts figure out what types classes your big int class should be convertible to and how to properly handle the conversion
a quick list would include double and float and may include int with proper bounds checking and complex assuming it can handle the range

270104
skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	tree
a binary tree allows for more rapid searching and insertion by being inherently sorted and navigable
an alternative that i ve used successfully in the past is a skip-lists
this provides something akin to a linked list but with extra references to allow search performance comparable to a binary tree

270210
put	get

you can either put them in the src folder alongside your classes or you can create a new source folder for the purpose usually called resources although you ll locate them identically from code
then you get at them using getresource com x y foo.png

270398
folder	directory
it s important to note that if you have build automatically turned on in eclipse as most people do any resources in this directory that get changed outside of eclipse you edit an image using an image editing tool that the ide may not always detect this change
usually doing a refresh on the project folder will ensure that the file gets updated in the build in these situations


270409
put	get

you can put the userid and password into any biztalk binding that supports authentication including msmq
for security the password is not exported you just get a mask

270532
submit	submission

the other thing i have done in the past is wrap the form area in a panel and set the defaultbutton attribute to the submit button you have
this effectively maps the enter key to the submission as long as you have a form element in focus in the panel area

270545
x86	64bit

you can use the corflags cli tool for instance c program files microsoft sdks windows v7.0 bin corflags.exe to determine the status of an assembly based on its output and opening an assembly as a binary asset you should be able to determine where you need to seek to determine if the 32bit flag is set to 1 x86 or 0 any cpu or x64 depending on pe option | pe | 32bit ----------|-------|--------- x86 | pe32 | 1 any cpu | pe32 | 0 x64 | pe32+ | 0 the blog post x64 development with .net has some information about corflags
even better you can use module.getpekind to determine whether an assembly is portableexecutablekinds value pe32plus 64bit required32bit 32-bit and wow or ilonly any cpu along with other attributes

270687
profiling	debugging
one java app i was working on a while ago had dismal performance
so we cracked out the profiling to see where the bottlenecks were
turned out that it was mostly due to string concatenation operations incurred by assembling debugging level logging statements that occurred all the time inside nested inner loops etc hah and to think they got added in the first place to figure out why the performance was so bad

270783
int	chars
after that the 4 chars code can be treated as an int key
then just build a dictionary that stores word sets indexed by that int key
50 000 words should easily fit into memory so nothing fancy is required

270986
versioning	upgrade
whatever makes the most sense to you will probably sustain you the longest through upgrade an deprecations
cakephp is in a bit of a volatile state right now still unearthing bugs while pushing to release versioning 1.2 which is not backward compatible
i wouldn t suggest building a critical application with it if you need something rock solid right now

271143
int	chars
the c89 standard states that uint_max should be at least 2 16-1 ushrt_max 2 16-1 and ulong_max 2 32-1
that makes a bit-count of at least 16 for short and int and 32 for long
for chars it states explicitly that it should have at least 8 bits char_bit . c++ inherits those rules for the limits.h file so in c++ we have the same fundamental requirements for those values

271143
int	chars	int	chars
for chars it states explicitly that it should have at least 8 bits char_bit . c++ inherits those rules for the limits.h file so in c++ we have the same fundamental requirements for those values
you should however not derive from that that int is at least 2 byte
theoretically chars int and long could all be 1 byte in which case char_bit must be at least 32

271187
range	minimum

for the most part the number of bytes and range of values is determined by the cpu s architecture not by c++
however c++ sets minimum requirements which litb explained properly and martin york only made a few mistakes with

271252
put	get
try to get to the object you want by some other attribute
here s how you put defaults in your urls in the above example both url patterns point to the same view -- blog.views.page -- but the first pattern doesn t capture anything from the url
if the first pattern matches the page function will use its default argument for num 1

271590
cpython	ironpython
speaking for python ironpython c# is probably the easiest optimization path
cpython with c++ is doable but i find c a lot easier to handle but not all that easy being c
two tools that ease this are cython pyrex for c and shedskin for c++

271644
boost	stl

move to boost smart pointers
in the meantime you may want to extract a working auto_ptr implementation from an old another stl so you have working code

272021
printf	strcpy
also declare separate parts to hold the date and the time for the first time you ll have to fill in both systime oldsystime as well as datepart and timepart
but subsequent printf s can be made quite faster as given below printf timepart 02d 02d 02d systime.whour systime.wminute systime.wsecond
if oldsystime.wyear systime.wyear oldsystime.wmonth systime.wmonth oldsystime.wday systime.wday we can reuse the date part strcpy buff datepart

272261
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	greenplum
see this posting for a bit of fan-out on this topic
i m not sure off the top of my head if mysql does this but postgresql certainly does
iirc some of the variants greenplum i think also directly support bitmap indexes and there was some talk of incorporating it in the main db engine

272898
post	get

without testing it or even trying to compile it i would do something like also here s a link to a blog post that achieves the same accross web applications
and finally a word of advice you ll get better search results if you use programmatically instead of code wise

273779
vpn	lan

as for 2 - this happens with some proprietary vpn software cisco
my solution was to perform my work duties in a virtual pc which doesn t need its normal lan abilities and do my other network internet tasks in the physical machine

273818
folder	directory
so i wound up putting those resources in the package directory - in the end i had resources in several different places and it was more of a mess than putting everything in package directory would have been
that said here s the code i used to put my html templates in a separate folder
it should be added to init in your application class

273855
punctuation	words
for your particular case i think comparing the search to real words sounds like the way to go with a words list like that
the alternative styles punctuation require a bit more work but i doubt users will use that often enough to be an issue


273980
lift	wicket
wicket only handles logic pertaining to display and input validation and i only need to inject the ejb into the model classes
perhaps you could create something similar in your app i ve got no idea what lift has to offer...
this has worked out nicely for me but i don t have particularly complex business logic and can isolate any changes which need to be persisted into small units of logic and single pages

274773
dns	spf

in my experience most anti-spam systems will score html s hamminess slightly below plaintext but there are much more important things to consider that affect deliverability make sure you have a valid reverse dns configuration for your mail server or you will be undeliverable to many domains
investigate adding an spf record to your dns zone file

274830
vbscript	vba

you mean like this createoutline function which actually copy all headings from a source word document into a new word document i believe the astrheadings function is the key in this program and should allow you to retrieve what you are asking for update by kol on march 6 2018 although astrheadings is an array isarray returns true and typename returns string i get a type mismatch error when i try to access its elements in vbscript v5.8.16384 on windows 10 pro 1709 16299.248
this must be a vbscript-specific problem because i can access the elements if i run the same code in word s vba editor

274830
vbscript	vba
this must be a vbscript-specific problem because i can access the elements if i run the same code in word s vba editor
i ended up iterating the lines of the toc because it works even from vbscript for each paragraph in doc.tablesofcontents 1 .range.paragraphs wscript.echo paragraph.range.text next


275465
ssl	https
some certificate authorities will allow you to do this without extra cost
everything else would only happen after the ssl connection is established and therefor after the error is encountered by the user
with https the ssl connection is negotiated before any of the http headers are sent to the server including the host -header that tells the server for which virtual host the request is actually intended

275993
post	get
the whole wakeupmainthread hook seems to be setup properly
it s this hook which post the wm_null message that triggers the checksynchronize
it just doesn t get that far in the console app

276065
prepare	execute

since version 5.1 php is shipped with the pdo driver which gives a class for prepare statements
see pdo driver at php.net note that this way with prepare statements will automatically escape all that needs to be and is one of the safest ways to execute mysql queries as long as you use binbparam or bindvalue

276137
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
there are a myriad of other factors that go into this and as was suggested in another response at some point you get a bad implementation of tcp
that being said if you want to achieve low latency and can tolerate loss using udp with an overall packet size set to the path mtu be sure to set the payload size to account for headers is likely the optimal solution esp
if you can ensure that udp can get from one end to the other

276151
ssl	https
if supporting older browsers is important you may have to take that into consideration
------ previous answer ------------ ssl hosts must be tied to a unique ip address port combination thus you cannot use virtual hosting or at least it can only have one ssl host per ip address
this is due to the fact that https begins encryption before the host parameter is sent in http and thus it cannot determine which cipher to use from the hostname - all it has is the ip address

276151
ssl	https
this is due to the fact that https begins encryption before the host parameter is sent in http and thus it cannot determine which cipher to use from the hostname - all it has is the ip address
this would be silly easy to fix if http had a tls command so it could start ssl after asking for the hostname but no one asked me
for the definitive answer see

276255
inherited	properties

okay given the extra information - i believe the problem is that getproperty is going up the inherited change
if you change your call to getproperty to then prop will be null if the properties isn t overridden

276262
redmine	trac

i installed redmine a week ago
it s quite similar to trac but written in ruby on rails and with a better theme and with some nice ajax features right clicking issues brings up an menu where you can change a bunch of things for that specific issue. it integrates perfectly with subversion and you can configure it to react to keywords issues in a svn-commit and connect those commits to a specific issue id

276285
redmine	mantis	redmine	bugzilla	redmine	trac

we use redmine beanstalk at my company and we re happy with them so far
we evaluated trac bugzilla mantis lighthouse and redmine fogbugz wasn t an option due to the incredibly high price and decided that we like redmine the best

276496
int	chars
the operator makes decisions on how to display data based on the data type passed it and uint8_t may be getting interpretted as a chars
make sure you cast the array values to int when printing or investigate in a debugger
the sample program gives the following output cygwin g++ reading aa reading bb reading cc reading dd reading ee reading 11 as int array aa bb cc dd ee 11 as unint8_t array ª i y î

276519
goto	break
increment ... which is somewhat ignoring continue and break for now equivalent to so your for loop example is again ignoring continue and break equivalent to which acts as if it were again ignoring continue and break two extra details of the for loop which were not in the simplified conversion to a while loop above if the condition is omitted it is always true resulting in an infinite loop unless a break goto or something else break the loop
a continue acts as if it were a goto to a label just before the increment unlike a continue in the while loop which would skip the increment
also an important detail about the comma operator it is a sequence point like and || which is why i can split it in separate statements and keep its meaning intact

276539
folder	directory
you can give server.mappath the directory relative to the location of your web service where you want to save the file otherwise you probably need to pass a full file path c files file.txt
as far as the permissions issue i am usually able to resolve this by adding write access to the folder i m writing the file to for iis_wpg and aspnet users these usernames may be different on your server


276806
free	malloc
but there s no guarantee
the important fact if you don t free memory that you no longer need further mallocs are guaranteed to consume even more memory
but if you free first malloc might re-use the freed memory instead

276806
free	malloc
on the other hand you can now malloc 9000 more blocks without increasing the amount of memory your program is tying up
even when free could technically return memory to the os it may not do so
free needs to achieve a balance between operating quickly and saving memory

276972
haskell	scheme
it might be even clearer to define repeated this way you don t have to use a let-loop this way and the lambdas make it obvious that you expect your arguments in two stages. note recur is not built in to scheme as it is in clojure i just like the name the cool functional feature you want here is currying not composition
here s the haskell with implicit currying i hope this isn t a homework problem


277057
hash	salt	hash	salt
for example in traditional unix passwords the salt was stored as the first two characters of the password
the remaining characters represented the hash value
the checker function knows this and pulls the hash apart to get the salt back out

277082
inherited	properties
of course by that rule there is no such thing as object oriented programming on a conventional machine architecture since there is no run time class object with attributes and methods at the machine-code level
or at least there isn t except for specialized architectures like the old system 38 or as 400 . what object oriented means was settled long ago as being three things abstract data types with inherited and polymorphism
the wikipedia article linked confuses the properties of oo with the benefits to some extent

277177
disk	ram
unfortunately some more experienced programmers learn the wrong lesson and assume that everything always needs to be cached in ram or it will be too slow
modern operating systems have very sophisticated disk caches so the second time you access the same part of a file might be significantly faster
finally interactive programs should do all file operations in another thread so your application doesn t slow to a crawl or stop working when the disk is busy or when a remote volume is temporarily unavailable

277218
put	get
the method attribute of form elements in html4 xhtml 1.0 will only accept get or post
in addition standard configs of most webservers will deny delete and put requests
assuming you have configured your webserver to allow methods like put delete such as webdav does you could then create your own http request delete resource.html http 1.1 host domain.com and handle it appropriately

277233
g++	gcc
the example you gave actually compiles c code where it is not an error to fail to declare function prototypes
if you meant to compile this as c++ code you would need the following command line g++ -o test test.cpp -framework opengl in that case you most certainly would get an error for not including gl.h and your code would fail to compile
when executing gcc from the command line g++ is the c++ compiler while gcc is the general c compiler

277445
innodb	myisam
there are numerous other differences however the common one s i am aware of are myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not innodb supports referential integrity whilst myisam does not innodb handles indexes a bit differently storing the primary key as part of every index making indexes take up more room on the disk but also making a covering index more likely myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking different memory buffer index settings are used in the mysql configuration files innodb is typically said to have better crash recovery as mentioned in another answer the data is store on disk differently
i believe innodb is configurable in this area and can have one file per table etc
if required i m sure a google search or the mysql site will bring up numerous other differences in more detail

277449
post	get

i came across a post by graham skan a while back
it might get you started

277452
innodb	myisam
myisam uses a data file and an index file for each table stored in a directory named after the database
innodb seems to lump everything together in a file called ibdata1


277489
operands	scalar
in scalar context or if the left operands is not enclosed in parentheses it returns a string consisting of the left operands repeated the number of times specified by the right operands
in list context if the left operands is enclosed in parentheses or is a list formed by qw string it repeats the list
if the right operands is zero or negative it returns an empty string or an empty list depending on the context

277511
innodb	myisam
myisam locks the whole table for reading while inserts updates are executing
innodb can do row-level locking thus allowing multiple concurrent writes and read on the table


277839
required	placeholder
i then go to the content pages and add new placeholder for the plaintext equivalents and add text as required
to make my life easier i then overloaded my sendmail method to get the response for the required page passing and and creating alternateview s as appropriate
in summary so in short the views seperate the actual views of the content html and text

277887
versioning	upgrade
if so then the resource tells me what page to go to launch and i throw the url into shell execute so the users preferred browser is displayed
most of the time the download is a setup program created by innosetup which updates the users system and database to the latest versioning
when a new paid upgrade is needed i then send the user to a purchase upgrade form

277887
versioning	upgrade
when a new paid upgrade is needed i then send the user to a purchase upgrade form
my web resources are asp pages so i can redirect to a different resource based on the customers versioning number
for the main application our application has a server piece and a client piece i have a loader which will check the server to see if the versioning of the client file on the server is different than the versioning on the client...if so it prompts the user if the user wants to update revert

278194
dictionary	map
there is often a convenience class whose members are the map from identifiers to localized messages
the dictionary are typically stored in separate files and in a format targeted to human translators
more here

278572
inherited	subclassing
c++ and ruby permit multiple inherited for your implementation and your interface
that said one should use multiple inherited with caution keep your abstract-class virtual and or stateless
that said as you note there are too many real-life class hierarchies where the subclassing inherit from the superclass out of convenience rather than bearing a true is-a relationship

278739
jboss	glassfish	jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic
from a technical perspective i would choose glassfish because it has support for more recent innovations
i do not think jboss is bad in anyway it simply isn t as up-to-date
most of my experience is on weblogic but i have used jboss and glassfish

279287
folder	directory

if you structure your project this way src __init__.py main.py dirfoo __init__.py foo.py dirbar __init__.py bar.py then from foo.py you should be able to do import dirfoo.foo or from dirfoo.foo import fooobject per tom s comment this does require that the src folder is accessible either via site_packages or your search path
also as he mentions __init__.py is implicitly imported when you first import a module in that package directory

279761
for-loop	loops

i d move everything after the line else parent down outside the for-loop
after loops of forks do another for-loop with waitpid then stop the clock and do the rest i ve assumed that if the child process fails to exit normally with a status of 0 then it didn t complete its work and therefore the test has failed to produce valid timing data

280054
put	get
there are many different guidelines on how to do this and i would recommend reading some tutorials on c++ and object oriented design to get you started
some basic guidelines will be put things together which are used together create classes for domain objects eg files collections etc header files allow you to declare a class or function and then use it in several different source files
for example if you declare a class in a header file you can then use this class in several source files so header files enable you to separate the declaration from the implementation

280057
mousemove	mouseleave

mousemove is the correct event in vb6
you ll have to do some work to manually detect when the mouseleave the client area cleanly

280085
equals	compareto
inventing a working efficient and effective hashing algorithm is not
assuming i do then implement a standard cookbook recipe effective java including all related requirements if a.equals b then a.hashcode b.hashcode if you have two instances of an object that need to be compared for equality then you probably need to provide an implementation for equals
if you have multiple instances of an object that need to be sorted then you probably need to provide an implementation for compareto

280235
versioning	upgrade
when trying to upgrade boost -- so i didn t but rather went on using v1.30.0 until i was able to upgrade visual c++ as well
even the old versioning of boost are very stable and useful they just have less features


280289
hide	show

there is a standard windows setting under display properties to normally hide those accelerators unless the alt key is held down
that would explain why opening the menu with alt+f10 show them for you

280587
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect for example stderr to the file foo do this first before you execute the code above it will open the file and duplicate its file-descriptor to 2 closing the original file descriptor afterwards
now if you have your stdout closed in your parent then if the child calls open it will get 1 since that s if stdin is already opened the next free file-descriptor
only solution i see is to just use dup2 and duplicate something into that in the parent like the above code

280881
phpunit	simpletest	phpunit	simpletest
simpletest is maintained by a small but involved group of people
phpunit seems to have a bigger userbase which may count as an argument for switching
i m quite happy with simpletest though

280900
vbscript	vba

vbscript works quite well with the jet engine
however i do not see why you say it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access. sub transfercsv docmd.transfertext acexportdelim putnameofqueryhere c putpathand filenamehere.csv true end sub is the usual way in vba

280900
vbscript	vba
however i do not see why you say it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access. sub transfercsv docmd.transfertext acexportdelim putnameofqueryhere c putpathand filenamehere.csv true end sub is the usual way in vba
edit it is possible to run a vbscript file .vbs from the command line
here is some sample vbscript to output a tab delimited file

281024
ubuntu	centos

fedora and ubuntu use totally different package managers so you won t be able to easily do it in any sort of generic way
in centos which is redhat enterprise edition with the serial numbers filed off and so therefore pretty close to fedora we did this using kickstart files

281142
getter	setter
the setter foo attr
the getter in java it is common practice to prefix get set. i ll have to say the best practice is to go with what s standard in your language
in java people expect to see get set prefixes so omitting them might confuse people even though they re not strictly necessary

281346
vsto	add-in
one of the team system versions of visual studio 2005
the vsto development story is somewhat simpler in visual studio 2008
in this release all of the vsto projects add-in and the document-level projects are now available in visual studio 2008 professional as well as the team system versions

281387
put	get

put on your best trogdor and burninate until they learn to put in the where clause
the best advice is to get the muckety-mucks that are mucking around in the database to use transactions when testing

281391
width	margin
ul.popular-pages li float left
since you re not setting any width in your li s i suggest skipping the float and set display inline on your li s instead if you want them on a row
adjust with padding margin to get appropriate spacing between them and line-height to get correct behaviour for any eventual 2nd line

281421
swt	swing

right now i m either using swt or qt jambi
swing didn t evolve in the last say 10 years bugs aren t fixed the development has stopped in favor of javafx so you won t ever see any new features too

281479
swt	swing	swt	swing
the components themselves are a lot simpler than swing s in terms of extensibility and similar which means that the api can be proportionally simpler
i can actually remember how to create and populate a table in swt
whereas i don t think i have ever handled that in swing without google s assistance

281479
swt	swing
whereas i don t think i have ever handled that in swing without google s assistance
swt s biggest problem right now is the stable version depends on carbon on mac os x
this means that swt apps can only run 32bit on java 5 or 32bit on soylatte

281479
swt	swing
if it s a flashy custom-styled application with tons of custom controls and complex compositing swing is the only game in town
however if a simpler api is more important to you or if your users demand the ultimate in platform laf fidelity swt is the best choice


281685
cassini	iis
the constantly changing port is also rather disconcerting to me
also for each web project in your solution it fires up another instance of a cassini server and each one takes anywhere from 20 to 50 mb of memory
i use iis all the time it s pretty easy to setup and you guys are already doing that.

281812
inline-functions	inlining

there are two kinds of memory usage that inline-functions will affect code size mdash
in general inlining code will increase how much memory is used to load your program

281812
inline	inlining
if you call a function out-of-line the stack for that function is used until it returns when it s released again
if you inline the function then that stack space will remain used for the whole life of the uber-function
inlining won t affect heap usage as the same allocations and deallocations would occur for the inlined code as would occur for the non-inlined version

281953
pop-up	dialog
to fix this create a class for the dialog parameters and a parameters property of that type on the custom dialog
that makes code like this easy to write because the parameter names pop-up in intellisense and you don t need to declare any variables to hold their values


282008
implements	extends

i ran into this when trying to implements a custom control and discovered that it s a remarkably hard problem
there s no built-in functionality within the windows.forms model to support controls whose display area extends outside the client area of their container

282051
versioning	upgrade
when you need to upgrade take one down upgrade it bring it up take the other one down upgrade it bring it up
it takes a bit of effort to be able to do this - having both versioning running at the same time - as database changes etc can be tricky
but the same effort also pays off in being able to roll changes back perhaps host just a few users on an experimental server etc

282162
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest and phpunit which i prefer
read the tutorials on how to write and run tests on the homepage of phpunit
it is quite easy and well described

282410
put	get
in order to get your example to work i had to create a custom type called stretch with a property called stretchamount
once i did that and put that inside the property element tags it worked
otherwise it wasn t called

282698
ssl	https

you re not going to be able to do what you re talking about simply because the postback which is what the login control uses is going to be whatever the page s security is ssl or non-ssl
your best bet in this scenario is to use an iframe which contains an https ssl page that just contains thelogin control

282922
put	get
yes it s extremely easy to get a site off the ground and hobble the pieces together to make something that works but to come up with a well designed and robust system requires deeper design and thought
it s very easy to start making bad oo decisions like breaking the law of demeter because things are just so quick to put together
rails is that easy

283151
coalesce	isnull

the preferable way is to use ansi compatible function coalesce select coalesce column_name default_value from table_name
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull

283164
free	malloc
see the notes for doug lea s malloc implementation for an overview of the various techniques that are used for simpler systems a strategy of first fit or best fit might be used with the free blocks stored on a linked list which would give a o n time with n being the number of free blocks
but a more sophisticated storage system such as an avl tree might be used to be able to locate free blocks in o log n time
a realtime system might use an heap allocator like tlsf two-level segregate fit which has a o 1 allocation cost

283405
jboss	glassfish
jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand
but i agree that the documentation and the market share is better for jboss
the various commercial j2ee app servers are more suited for large production environments and they are overkill during development for a j2ee app that should be app server independent

283686
post	put	post	get	put	get
a simple ajax call in jquery is as follows it also helps if you understand the basics of http - for example the request methods put post get delete head and so on
the error you pasted means that the header content-length is missing with your request and most servers if not all expect it to be send when you issue put or post because those are assumed to be data changing create update
maybe ie adds the header for you but firefox apparently doesn t

283985
width	margin

by default div elements are displayed as block elements so they have 100 width making centering them meaningless
as suggested by arief you must specify a width and you can then use auto when specifying margin in order to center a div

284126
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
maybe it makes the code a little longer but it s not a bad code
for the other for-loop you need to check inside the brackets to have an idea for what this loops is used
the problem with this example lies in the fact that you re iterating over two different arrays in the same time which we don t do that often

284537
width	text-align
text-align center only drawback is that you have to create 4 images but that shouldn t take too long
you ll also need to add a class to the final cell in each row if you want to add that drop shadow on the right and just change it s background-image and width property accordingly


284711
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller is a distinct object that is very different from a uitabbarcontroller
in general your application should have a tab controller one of who s tab s loads a uinavigationcontroller which in turn loads it s views - not that both maintain management over the different views
it is also improper to refer to the display of a uiviewcontroller as such an object doesn t have a visual representation

284851
junit	testng	ant	maven
which are useful because maven will not execute the post-integration-test if any of the integration tests fail
not a problem with ant so i just use junit out of preference with it
in either case segmenting out the tests as both testng and junit do is helpful with integration tests too

285543
loops	if-statement

explicit loops always work better than implicit ones
you should wrap the whole thing in an if-statement just in case you re dealing with a zero-length array

285627
cvs	svn
when you tag it with svn cp you re just making a copy of that particular revision with a longer name
and unlike a cvs tag you or other developers could continue doing ongoing development on that tag
it isn t a static entity like a cvs tag is well to be fair you can move a tag on individual cvs files which effectively changes it

285792
pull	push
ideally the other developer would clone from your public repo on github
then when he was done with his changes you d either pull from a repo that he makes available to you or you d integrate his changes with patches that he emails to you
either way you d pull the changes into the private repo on your computer fix any mistakes that result from the merge and then push his changes to your public repo the one on github

285809
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
if the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialversionuid than that of the corresponding sender s class then deserialization will result in an invalidclassexception
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

285809
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization
therefore to guarantee a consistent serialversionuid value across different java compiler implementations a serializable class must declare an explicit serialversionuid value
it is also strongly advised that explicit serialversionuid declarations use the private modifier where possible since such declarations apply only to the immediately declaring class serialversionuid fields are not useful as inherited members

286221
put	get
but the basically you need to get a character buffer somewhere in memory to store the string you want to execute
obviously you can do this the same way you are getting the other functions called you put the text on the stack as well
after you have that written you need to write a pointer to it on to the stack in the location that the shell_code function expects to find its arguments

286300
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
similarly for point 2
you can calculate the sin from the cos using sin 2 + cos 2 1
that is sin sqrt 1-cos cos

286303
swt	swing

it depends with eclipse 3.4 swt 3.4 is quite supported with macos
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java

286396
ssl	https

there are a whole number of things that could be complicating things as far as inconsistencies with the ssl certs etc
try both unsecured http and secured https -- did you try connecting from another computer or from another network

286617
inline	inlining
however inlining opens the door to more optimizations if you have v a + b + c your wrapper class forces the generation of stack variables whereas for inline calls the majority of the data can be kept in the fpu stack
also inline code allows simplifying instructions considering constant values and more
so while the measure before you invest rule holds true i would expect some room for improvements here

286667
for-loop	arrays
your first problem is that you don t have a fixed sized arrays so you d have to pass the size of the arrays or what i d prefer you make the arrays null-terminated then i would write a private helper function that parse the string then you can do what qrdl has suggested
in a simple for-loop edit you should probably use long instead of int and atol instead of atoi because your prl_id is of the type long
second if there could be wrong formated numbers after the you should use strtol which can catch errors

286883
maven	pom.xml
what you might want is to set up a central repository similar to what happens with maven
if you use maven you can create a local repository of libraries on a server accessible by the team
the dependencies on these libraries are entered in the pom.xml file and this is in the subversion repository

286883
maven	pom.xml
the dependencies on these libraries are entered in the pom.xml file and this is in the subversion repository
now as team members check out the code from subversion they all have access to the maven repository
i am looking for a reference to this right now

287231
for-loop	loops
here is an example edit the last example #3 assumes that you don t want to process additional urls as they are found in loops
if you do want to process additional urls as they are found just use urls.count in the for-loop instead of the local count variable as mentioned by configurator in the comments for this answer


287241
int	chars
i question the need to convert a phone number to a numeric value though since it may also contain other necessary chars like pause
also a phone number represents a string of digits more than it represents one long number anyway so the conceptual data format is more string than int in any case


287317
profiling	instrumentation
the profiler approach is overkill
maybe the use of profiling is worth the trouble if you absolutely have no clue where the bottleneck is
i would rather spend a little time analyzing the problem up front and putting a few strategic print statements than figure out how to instrumentation your app for profiling then pour over gargantuan reports where every executable line of code is timed

287493
profiling	instrumentation

it is worth considering investing in a good commercial profiling particularly if you ever expect to have to do this a second time
the one i use jprofiler works in the java world and can attach to an already-running application so no special instrumentation is required at least with the more recent jvms

287500
subclass	abstract-class
as jon suggested you could create an anonymous class that implements it inline but there s a class called keyadapter that is an abstract-class implementing keylistener with empty methods for each interface method
if you subclass keyadapter then you only need to override those methods you care about not every method
thus if you only cared about keypressed you could do this this could save you a bit of work

287676
hash	salt
then the attacker needs to know 1 the way you combine the salt and the password not much security there 2 the salt which is likely in the db already and 3 they have to compute that value for each combination of password and salt
that s a lot more than just computing hash of common passwords and looking for a match


287738
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	hash
first a lot depends on the hash algorithm that is chosen
a key derivation algorithm like pbkdf2 based on a hash-based message authentication code makes it computationally infeasible to find an input in this case a password that will produce a given output what an attacker has found in the database
a pre-computed dictionary attack uses pre-computed index or dictionary from hash outputs to passwords

287738
hash	salt
pre-computation attacks are thwarted by using cryptographic salt
this is some data that is hash with the password
it doesn t need to be a secret it just needs to be unpredictable for a given password

287738
hash	salt
in practice 8 to 16 bytes of data from a cryptographic quality random number generator makes a good salt
with pre-computation off the table an attacker has compute the hash on each attempt
how long it takes to find a password now depends entirely on how long it takes to hash a candidate

287859
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
height 1em
it won t stretch the full width between the label and the right side but you can have the label hide the bottom-border using background-color or something and have the div expand all the way to the right aswell without the margin
if you want correct semantics you can even use an input instead of a div set it s display to block and fix the borders and background

287883
hash	salt	hash	salt	hash	md5
make sure you use a proper salt although the libraries you re using should be making sure of this for you
when you hash the passwords use do not use plain md5
use pbkdf2 which basically means using a random salt to prevent rainbow table attacks and iterating re-hashing enough times to slow the hashing down - not so much that your application takes too long but enough that an attacker brute-forcing a large number of different password will notice from the document iterate at least 1000 times preferably more - time your implementation to see how many iterations are feasible for you

287883
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt	hash	hmac
a good way to apply the salt when hashing is to use hmac with your favorite hash algorithm using the password as the hmac key and the salt as the text to hash see this section of the document
example implementation in python using sha-256 as the secure hash edit as mentioned by eli collins this is not a pbkdf2 implementation
you should prefer implementations which stick to the standard such as passlib

288507
versioning	upgrade

on our development server we have lots of versioning installed eg 2000 2005 express 2005 standard 2008 express we haven t had any major problems
you will need to install them as named instances when you go through the installation procedure eg myserver sql2000 myserver sql2005express myserver sql2005 etc i wouldn t advise running this many versioning or instances on a production box but 2 instances until you upgrade your other applications to 2005 should be no problem

288577
versioning	upgrade
you d need to upgrade to the newest interpreter or at least choose the newer one if both are installed before your app would work
it s the same with .net -- you need to choose the right versioning the versioning that your code expects to reference before it will work


288615
hash	md5	hash	md5
even though there is a known collision attack against md5 intentional malicious collisions are currently impossible against hashed urls
the type of collision you d need to intentionally collide with a hash of another url is called a pre-image attack
there are no known pre-image attacks against md5

288615
hash	md5	hash	md5
there are no known pre-image attacks against md5
as of 2017 there s no research that comes even close to feasibility so even a determined well-funded attacker can t compute a url that would hash to a hash of any existing url in your database
the only known collision attack against md5 is not useful for attacking url-like keys

288753
range	max	range	min

if you want numbers to be uniformly distributed over the range you should break your range up into a number of equal sections that represent the number of points you need
then get a random number with a min max for each section

288928
shadowing	named
the problem is that because the method is in a different method table slot it doesn t actually have any direct relationship to the method it is shadowing
so what we re actually saying is does the base type have any method which meets the criteria for shadowing which varies depending on whether the method is hidebysig or hide-by-name
for the former we need to check whether the base class has any method which matches the signature exactly whereas for the latter we need to check whether it has any method with the same named so continuing the code from above i think this is most of the way there but i still don t think it s exactly right

289061
octal	hex	octal	decimal	int	double

if you are working on octal you can simply if you are working on hex you can simply but for decimal you should probably do it the way jesse beder suggests most systems have a fast int divide
if you re working on a system that doesn t you could use the double dabble algorithm to fast convert to bcd

289163
cassini	iis

as i stated here your developers need to be aware that cassini runs as the local user which is typically an admin account for developers
the development will be able to access any file or resource that their account can which is quite different from what they will see on an iis 6 server

289524
inline	inlining
it can therefore only do so with functions that it has the body of
this means that if a function in the cpp file calls another function which is not implemented in the same cpp file or in a header file that is included then it doesn t have the actual body of the function and can therefore not inline it
but if you use ltcg it s the linker that does the inlining and it has all the functions in all the of the cpp files of the entire project minus referenced lib files that were not built with ltcg

289569
versioning	upgrade
with the long term support lts versioning you get three years support on the desktop and five years on the server
there is no extra fee for the lts versioning we make our very best work available to everyone on the same free terms
upgrade to new versions of ubuntu are and always will be free of charge

289891
public	protected
protected and private are not an essential part of good encapsulation
you can do good design with everything being public that s the way python works for example
if your software development involves lawyers then you care about adding protect and private to the things you re not committed to

290004
int	chars
this means that you can call it with different argument types
for instance you may have a function for printing a variable on screen and you can define it for different argument types void print int i
void print chars i

290048
int	double
notice however that the return type in any case is a significant part of the type of a function
major compilers currently reject the following code int f
double f

290253
int	boolean	tinyint	boolean

a tinyint is an 8-bit int value a bit field can store between 1 bit bit 1 and 64 bits bit 64
for a boolean values bit 1 is pretty common

290255
tinyint	boolean
tinyint 1 allows any value that can be stored in a single byte -128..127 or 0..255 depending on whether or not it s unsigned the 1 shows that you intend to only use a single digit but it does not prevent you from storing a larger value
for versions older than 5.0.3 bit is interpreted as tinyint 1 so there s no difference there
bit has a this is a boolean semantic and some apps will consider tinyint 1 the same way due to the way mysql used to treat it so apps may format the column as a check box if they check the type and decide upon a format based on that

290547
django	turbogears	django	web.py
there are many fine options but it can be daunting to a newcomer
if you are looking for something that comes prepackaged with web db templating integration i d suggest looking at django turbogears or pylons
if you want to have more control over the individual components look at cherrypy colubrid or web.py

290553
inherited	properties

was its support for mixin inherited - the methods from any other classes could be reused in your class
as long as your class provided the properties that these methods used it worked just fine and there was no diamond problem or other multiple-inheritance gotchas to worry about

290643
haskell	scheme
inspired by lex augusteijn s sorting morphisms 3 ph.d
haskell programmer ate so many bananas that his eyes bugged out now he needs new lenses
post-doc haskell programmer from uustalu vene and pardo s recursion scheme from comonads 4 tenured professor teaching haskell to freshmen

290894
rss	feed
there s no reason to have multiple formats for a site available and any modern feed client can now parse atom feed
atom has quite a few technical advantages over rss and is being widely supported and utilized by major companies such as google and microsoft
as for branding i don t really care what acronym is used

291470
next	except
after the script is loaded imported the python interpreter won t access it anymore except when printing source line in a exception stack trace
any pyc file will be regenerated the next time as the source file is newer than the pyc


292360
git-merge	git-rebase

git-pull - fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch synopsis git pull description runs git-fetch with the given parameters and calls git-merge to merge the retrieved head s into the current branch
with --rebase calls git-rebase instead of git-merge. note that you can use

292360
git-merge	git-rebase
with --rebase calls git-rebase instead of git-merge. note that you can use
current directory as the repository to pull from the local repository this is useful when merging local branches into the current branch. also note that options meant for git-pull itself and underlying git-merge must be given before the options meant for git-fetch. you would pull if you want the histories merged you d fetch if you just want the codez as some person has been tagging some articles around here


292421
treemap	linkedhashmap
in this case there two potential standard implementations you mights want linkedhashmap can retain the order that the entries were added
treemap a sortedmap navigablemap will sort the results order of which can be determined by a comparator
alternatively you might want a form of map that fire events or also provides a tablemodel

293005
post	get

you need a developer certificate from apple to install your application on an actual iphone and to post your application to the apple store but you don t need a uuid unless the person mistook developer certificate for uuid and used the wrong term
to get the certificate you have to join apple s developer program

293047
put	get
solution almost always you will get errors like undefined reference to .
put all the template definitions in a header so that when the compiler is using them it can already produce the code needed
if base is a pointer to a virtual base class of derived

293323
put	get
trying to get updates more regularly will prove to be overkill and probably be perceived as micro management
weekly progress reports once a week take half an hour to put together a simple report that covers the following achievements assumptions dependancies issues resolutions it shouldn t take much effort to do this and it will give you a very good insight into how the project is tracking
it s also very effective in providing management or clients and overview of what s happening and what needs to be addressed

293343
post	put	post	put	post	get
the issue is that rest uses get post put and delete
but the django test client only offers get and post
i ve monkeypatched methods for put like post and delete like get

293461
post	get

the perlmonks post might help as well as the google search for perl gui builder
once you see what s available you might be able to ask a more specific question to get a better answer

293919
children	parent
if a node can get to its parent but not vice versa you have to have all the leaf nodes in order to print out the full tree
compare this to the situation where you have each node know about its children - then you only need the root node


293971
required	placeholder

change it to this the binder required the int argument
so you have to give it a placeholder which stands for the integer argument that the generated function object needs

294571
folder	directory
whichever route you take you might try to be consistent take the same approach with views and widgets as you do with commands etc
if only commands it might simplify things to just have a commands folder so you don t have to decide on a good top-level folder for each new command
if you re going to have a large number of commands where large is somewhat ill-defined having an additional level of directory might be nice

294744
cassini	iis
here s a link to how this is accomplished debugging asp.net is a bit different though and i m not sure if this will work for you
if you are debugging locally using the light weight web server cassini you can apply this trick to cassini itself
if you are debuggin directly on a web server though inside of iis i don t know how to get this trick to work but hopefully it will lead you in the right direction

294983
vsts	tfs
if you re logging into the machine with an account which is on a different domain note local users are also on a different domain you will not get single-sign-on
as far as i m aware there isn t a way around the authentication model which vsts uses
you could write your own vsts-style extensions using the existing vs api which say uses a config file for the authentication credentials as the tfs api does support authentication through a manually-created user we have an external application at work which authenticates against our tfs server and is used by employees of our many offices on different domains

295032
move	drag

dreamweaver allows you to move the elements around to any part of the page without being constrained
when you drag elements around the page it automatically creates css code for absolute positioning and custom coordinates

295036
lisp	scheme
i m not sure how useful the bare source code will be as it was meant to go with the book but it s a fine book that covers the basics of implementing lisp in a lower-level language including garbage collection etc
that s not the focus of the book which is programming languages in general but it is covered. lisp in small pieces goes into more depth but that s both good and bad for your case
there s a lot of material on compiling and such that won t be relevant to you and its simpler interpreters are in scheme not c++

295229
int	double

this should do the trick #ifdef __gnuc__ #define deprecated func func __attribute__ deprecated #elif defined _msc_ver #define deprecated func __declspec deprecated func #else #pragma message warning you need to implement deprecated for this compiler #define deprecated func func #endif ... don t use me any more deprecated void oldfunc int a float b
use me instead void newfunc int a double b

295518
fontfamily	font-size
gives you a nice base size in all browsers that is it makes 1em render in a normal and readable size
you may want to try other values between 75 and 80 depending on what fontfamily you want to use
also bear in mind that relative font sizes are inherited accumulatively - for example this works in your favour as you would only need to give your button class a font-size of .7em to achieve what you want the buttons would then always have a font size that is 70 of its parent object

295534
hash	salt

if you re really worried pick a 256- or 512-bit hash 32 or 64 characters
if you re really really paranoid add a salt

295534
hash	salt	hash	md5
if you re really really paranoid add a salt
if you re more paranoid than that concatenate two hash for a longer one such as md5 and sha-256


295590
multiplying	add	multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
then you could add as much iteration as you need
this should be faster because it reduces the number of division operations done in naive square rooting down to a simple divide by 2 actually a multiplying operation and replace it with a few fixed number of multiplication operations instead


295657
sorting	filtering
of course if those additional clauses go anywhere near user text input you have to sanitize them to prevent sql injection attacks. the database can filtering faster than any other tier in general because using a where clause on the database will often allow the database to avoid even reading the unnecessary records off the disk which is several orders of magnitude slower than anything you can do with the cpu
sorting is often faster on the db as well because the db can often do the joins in such a way that records are already sorted in the order you want them
so performance wise if you can do it on the db all the better

296057
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
cli is super powerful much more than the command prompt on windows i know about powershell... from a gui perspective i typically have the terminal cli running anyway from a debian ubuntu perspective start stop processes sudo etc init.d apache stop or sudo etc init.d apache start text editors gedit gui - gnome kate gui - kde vim cli or nano cli processes running ps -aux terminate process add a package sudo apt-get install php5-cli upgrade patch a system there is a whole lot of information here and a large variety of options to choose from
i would recommend going with a linux distro that has a friendly community ubuntu centos debranded free rhel or rhel you pay them to help you
there is definitely going to be a lot of value for you to play around with a distribution over a weekend on a virtual machine or spare machine at home work

296396
put	get
repeat a few times and you ll quickly get down to the function or statement s that leak
then see if that code still leaks when put in a separate script
finally to see why it s leaking employ the devel modules checking for memory cycles with devel cycle

296727
submit	submission
if you are submission parameters through post the best method will probably be to create a form with hidden inputs for each parameter
submit the form every twenty seconds


296775
next	except
carry on with normal coding
simply delete monkeypatch later when next version of ruby is released
the bugfixing process looks similar except with monkeypatching it s a 15 minute solution and a 5-second extraction whereas without it pain and suffering ensues

297123
dictionary	map
abstract data types are not specific to any one programming language and the map adt can also be known as a hash or a dictionary or an associative array others at
notice we re making a distinction between the dictionary class and the dictionary adt. the dictionary class has been marked as obsolete so it s best not to use it
