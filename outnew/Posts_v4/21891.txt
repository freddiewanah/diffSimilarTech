ienumerable	ilist
with an ilist ienumerable appraoch to tweak your example you could of course write some custom extension methods on allowing something more like i m not sure it is worth it though
to do that you would have to use a non-generic api such as ilist not -

7502571
punctuation	words
but in text lots of words are not followed by spaces punctuation
the regex needs to allow for any non-word characters that may occur between words

7504239
innodb	myisam
my personal recommendation is use innodb for almost all business activities as it supports transactions.
the only use i ve found for myisam is full text searches dunno why that s not available in innodb but i freely admit that s a personal preference

7504827
hash-collision	key
there is not really a problem here you have a hash-collision
that is both of your key have been placed in the same hash bucket

7506439
ssl	https
if your ssl certificate has problems you may see empty response received error when you load your fbml canvas app.
confirm an ssl certificate is required for all canvas and page tab apps not in sandbox mode and not fbml . see here though i am currently getting mixed content warnings in ie and firefox when using facebook in https mode and then loading content over http in the app

7506439
ssl	https
confirm an ssl certificate is required for all canvas and page tab apps not in sandbox mode and not fbml . see here though i am currently getting mixed content warnings in ie and firefox when using facebook in https mode and then loading content over http in the app
so users of your app might get kinda bad feeling if you do not serve your content over https

7508554
catransition	subviews
i then setup the catransition on the container view and everything worked as i wanted
it s probably not the cleanest way but i ended up using an nsview container subclass with custom addsubview and replacesubview withview methods that modify the new subviews s frame to match the container view s frame which is then structured into the nssplitview subviews i wanted to animate

7511203
sudo	passwd
more about sudo on if you want to remote controll this you can use the -s command line switch or use
if you are on the sudoers list you can start your progamm with sudo sudo python append_to_host.py sudo runs your python interpreter with root privileges. the first time you do it you will be asked for your passwd later calls will not ask you if your last sudo call is not to long ago

7514586
rvm	bundler
are you in an rvm gemset
if you re using bundler and have locked rails to 2.3.5 that s what it ll be regardless whether you run gem update or not

7515334
floating-point	fractions
since the decimal fractions 2.675 is exactly halfway between 2.67 and 2.68 you might expect the result here to be a binary approximation to 2.68. it s not because when the decimal string 2.675 is converted to a binary floating-point number it s again replaced with a binary approximation whose exact value is 2.67499999999999982236431605997495353221893310546875 since this approximation is slightly closer to 2.67 than to 2.68 it s rounded down
what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic

7517307
interpolation	splines
you could also try splines interpolation if your facial tracking algorithm measures accelerations in face motion
since face movement is not low-pass filtered prior to video capture most of the classic dsp interpolation methods may not apply

7518212
awt	swing
it s a mac java awt bug that will hopefully be fixed at some point
i ve been looking for an answer to this very same problem which appears only on mac. you either have to live with the ugly jfilechooser swing lightweight not native look option or have an if os is mac and handle things differently by putting the file extension at the end yourself

7518315
google-chrome	firefox
the important difference is that google-chrome doesn t force you to specify compatibility boundaries that s not a problem given how simple their api is
firefox add-ons that want to be accepted on addons.mozilla.org however have to specify a maxversion and use a version number that is already released

7519463
rvm	bundler
if you are not using rvm i found this command to uninstall all gems gem list | cut -d -f1 | xargs gem uninstall -aix gem install bundler bundle install
rvm gemset empty rvm use ree my-gemset gem install bundler bundle install this solved the issue for me

7520822
firefox	safari
the transitions used by jquery mobile rely on css 3 transition effects that firefox is not able to replicate correctly
i would suggest using desktop safari as your desktop testing browser as it will do a better job of replicating how mobile safari will act

7521775
udp	tcp
datagramsockets which are still connectionless are used for udp
the answer is if it s udp then it s fine because it s connectionless if it s tcp then the serversocket should see the connection request and create a new socket for two-way communication with that client to answer the why or why not - udp is connectionless and therefore a new socket isn t used for communication

7521775
udp	tcp
the answer is if it s udp then it s fine because it s connectionless if it s tcp then the serversocket should see the connection request and create a new socket for two-way communication with that client to answer the why or why not - udp is connectionless and therefore a new socket isn t used for communication
udp just receives a datagrampacket and either drops it if the app determines that it s invalid malformed etc. or it replies with a datagrampacket

7521811
equals	icomparable
it seems sort does asserts equality on items that it knows to be the same assuming by object.referenceequals and if the comparator does not return 0 for those ones that it knows should be equals it invalidates the entire sort
just to make a quick observation as i have just tried to do such a randomized sort using the following code to get some basic unit tests to run in a random order i randomly got the following argumentexception icomparer or the icomparable methods it relies upon did not return zero when array.sort called x

7522819
bluestacks	android-emulator
edit bluestacks has since opened up for beta
for me it runs similarly to the android-emulator so does not provide a whole lot of benefit for the purposes of recording your applications

7522866
bash	zsh
in bash you could do something like this
in general that depends on your shell but if you use bash zsh ksh or sh as provided by dash the following should work for a real installation script you d probably want to be sure that type doesn t return successfully in the case when there is an alias foobar

7524455
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
you can use pushviewcontroller animated to show the viewcontroller modally which will be on the navigation stack and have the uinavigationbar for you to add your button if your first viewcontroller is not a uinavigationcontroller using pushviewcontroller animated won t solve it so you can present a uinavigationcontroller modally with your viewcontroller as the rootviewcontroller hope any of this helps
okay explained solution presentmodalviewcontroller animated presents a viewcontroller modally which does not have a uinavigationbar so you can do some things add a uinavigationbar in your viewcontroller s nib and add the add button there and everything you need to setup

7525300
equals	compareto
as to equals the javadoc says compares this bigdecimal with the specified object for equality. unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equals only if they are equals in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equals to 2.00 when compared by this method
bottom line use compareto instead of equals

7526698
config	ini
the .net config file generated from visual studio called myservice.exe.config should be saved in the same location as the exe
and it s an xml not an ini file

7528950
postgresql	mysql
no drupal is not about advanced sql and you should not see much improvement switching from mysql to postgresql and as already mentioned you would lose some compatibility everyone uses mysql for drupal more or less
the postgresql optimizer is much better much better datatype support faster for anything advanced like triggers etc

7529321
super	implements
setuid 2 for example mentions the setuid system call is permitted if the specified id is equal to the real user id or the effective user id of the process or if the effective user id is that of the super user. on linux there s also under linux setuid is implements like the posix version with the _posix_saved_ids feature
this allows a set-user-id other than root program to drop all of its user privileges do some un-privileged work and then reengage the original effective user id in a secure manner. i don t even know if python directly implements this but it s not exactly what you want anyway

7532062
freebsd	linux
freebsd has an experimental implementation of dtrace
it should be noted that systemtap is not an implementation of dtrace for linux but a wholly different entity in itself

7532433
oncreate	onstart
i am very confident that oncreate is not called when startservice is invoked on a running service
onstartcommand and hence onstart for older services will be called for every startservice call

7534969
boost	stl
boost is huge - has been added to the std namespace in the new standard. and that s where it died
unless you are specifically referring to a few oddball things like std iota or lexicographical_compare_3way it is not appropriate to speak of the stl and it hasn t been appropriate to speak of the stl for twelve years

7540001
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if you have not called setcontentview before you call findviewbyid then the particular view object has neither been created nor added to the view hierarchy
move the line setcontentview r.layout.main

7541440
ubuntu	debian
this particular setup was suggested to me by two debian-using r core members and this was before the dawn of ubuntu
this is not an r-wide recommendation which is why you will not find it in the manuals but rather a specific recommendation by r power users to be implemented on debian and debian-alike systems

7542176
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is the only major browser not to ...
your problem is that firefox is inserting a element that is not present in the html

7542233
octal	decimal
has pointed out that while gnu fortran may be more permissive to comply with the standard you d have to declare an octal constant in a data statement or since fortran 2003 as int o 600
open expects you to give it a value for the mode in octal not decimal this is why you basically always see an extra leading zero when dealing with modes in c code since in c you write an octal literal with a leading zero

7542233
octal	decimal
open expects you to give it a value for the mode in octal not decimal this is why you basically always see an extra leading zero when dealing with modes in c code since in c you write an octal literal with a leading zero
600 in decimal is 1130 in octal

7543194
punctuation	words
so effectively what this does is capitalize each words in the string and each blank string and lonely bit of punctuation too but again that s not important -- capitalization doesn t change characters that have no concept of case
.join space glues the words back together reinserting the space that was used to separate them before

7543321
ubuntu	linux
you will see something like this -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1342 2010-09-16 10 13 your_script the x s mean that it is executable. to set the executable flag if it is not set run chmod u+x your_script i m pretty sure for older versions of ubuntu you need to have the script in etc rc.d rc3.d or etc rc3.d
what linux does is run through rc0.d to rc5.d and execute every script in there

7544425
mef	prism
so mef is not the same thing as prism
prism is a ui composition framework which can be used with wpf silverlight wp7 surface and probably with c# based metro style apps for win8

7544448
jboss	glassfish
here s what i know on this glassfish v3 support ejb3.1 out of the box you can use them per your pleassing jboss application server version 6 also support ejb 3.1 out of the box
as always jboss offers some custom non-spec config options some of which intervene just a little bit over the ejb3.1 specs but in all it s ok. yes tomcat by itself is not a full java ee application server as it doesn t have amongst others an ejb container

7546124
subtraction	multiplication
also subtraction is the same check this i m not 100 sure
for multiplication for example you need to check it yourself

7547188
onfocus	onblur
what you should be doing instead of setting is to add the onfocus class to the existing value so that it is not lost
then during the blur event you would remove the onfocus class and add in the onblur class again not just totally replacing the classname value

7547738
portrait	landscape
so for example if you have a xib with a view for landscape and a view for portrait and both views contain the same interface objects in different positions such as a uilabel in landscape and a uilabel in portrait
it is not possible to link the uilabel in your portrait view and the uilabel object in the landscape view to a single uilabel object in the view controller at the same time

7551060
uiview	uiwindow
make sure your opengl uiview is attached to a uiviewcontroller and not inserted directly into the uiwindow
to do that create a custom view controller then add it to your app s window via the appdelegate self.window is just the app s uiwindow you may have to change that if you store the window somewhere else

7552284
punctuation	words
so in order to keep consistency and not depend on character positioning you might want to escape all those characters that have a special meaning in regular expressions the following list is not complete so be aware of other characters like etc. if you want to get rid of all punctuation and symbols try this regex keep in mind that in java strings you d have to escape back slashes
a third way could be something like this if you can exactly define what should be left in your string this means replace everything that is not a words character a-z in any case 0-9 or _ or whitespace

7552324
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql you could do this items.order owns_cache desc nulls last for mysql and sqlite items.order coalesce owns_cache 0 desc i think mysql sorts nulls at the bottom of a desc ordering though so you might not need anything special there
this coalesce approach will also work in postgresql so this would be a portable solution that should give you consistent results everywhere

7552533
unixodbc	iodbc
licensing unixodbc is gpl and lgpl. iodbc is lgpl bsd in practice there is not a lot of difference but i think you ll find unixodbc is more widely used
just so you know i use and have contributed to unixodbc and i don t use iodbc

7552533
unixodbc	iodbc
application support a lot of odbc applications support unixodbc openoffice and odbc drivers from oracle ibm and sap
i m not sure about iodbc

7552533
unixodbc	iodbc
thread safety unixodbc is thread safe and includes flags to protect handles at different levels
this did not used to be the case with iodbc but that might have changed now

7553224
ssl	https
it provides the only and except options to control which actions and controllers ssl is to be required for but doesn t provide a way to force http to be used instead of https
the code for force ssl is pretty easy to read

7558597
innodb	myisam
if so then you ll need to use the innodb engine
if it doesn t you can go ahead with myisam engine

7559152
jar	manifest.mf
this will happen when you doubleclick a jar file in windows explorer but the jar is by itself actually not an executable jar
a real executable jar should have at least a class with a main method and have it referenced in manifest.mf

7559234
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
for example in html element names are case-insensitive but in xml they are case-sensitive
all css syntax is case-insensitive within the ascii range a-z and a-z are equivalent except for parts that are not under the control of css from the docs website

7559484
jsf	seam
ensure that all versions are compatible with each other jsf seam richfaces etc
ensure that you understand that jboss ships with its own set of jsf api impl libraries and that you should not include any in your webapp s web-inf lib mark it as provided in maven

7561542
opera	firefox
given the spectacular failure rate of this approach though it certainly doesn t work in opera 11 and i can only imagine that it achieves nothing in ie... i d strongly suggest an animated gif for the sheer simplicity and cross-browser compliance
well this took far longer than i care to admit and is only reliable in from my own limited testing chromium 12+ and firefox 5+ on ubuntu 11.04 it does not work in opera 11

7561542
opera	firefox
well this took far longer than i care to admit and is only reliable in from my own limited testing chromium 12+ and firefox 5+ on ubuntu 11.04 it does not work in opera 11
that being the case i ll show only the excerpts to cover firefox and chromium though the linked js fiddle has vendor prefixes to at least try with opera even if it fails

7562460
appfuse	spring
2- appfuse great starter application plus tutorials uses spring
3- lulu - interestingly does not have community presence or atleast not with same name.uses spring 4- java passion - but not free but very well worth it

7564443
union	distinct
columns formed using set operators union union all crossjoin except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns that are being modified cannot be affected by group by having or distinct clauses

7567935
client-side	server-side
if not you can do a client-side post in javascript
if the callback page is regular asp.net you could do a server-side response.redirect or server.execute

7568493
implements	extends
because atomic variables are expected to be mutated they are poor choices for hash table keys. hashcode is not implements and so is the case with equals
this is in part due to a far larger rationale that is discussed in the mailing list archives on whether atomicinteger should extends number or not

7571520
openssl	m2crypto
in m2crypto s install file note about fedora core -based distributions ---------------------------------------------------- fedora core and redhat centos etc. have made changes to openssl configuration compared to many other linux distributions
if you can not build m2crypto normally try the fedora_setup.sh script included with m2crypto sources. my solution was to get the sources from pypi or from the source

7571942
union	distinct
i got it working by using an approach similar to remou s above but you probably wanted union all otherwise two identical rows will not be inserted as union has an implicit distinct and i seemed to need an outer select that was aliased otherwise it didn t work
additionally when you union as mentioned above you need a from table in access so i followed the oracle convention and created a single row table called dual

7574460
oncreate	findviewbyid
move the initialising code to inside the oncreate method
you cannot use findviewbyid before oncreate and this is what you are doing if you try to initialise with a value like that

7574498
inline	inlining
now it might be the case that the variadic template function s arguments are on the stack in the same location as va_args would want them but that would require the template function to not be inline
i strongly suspect the reason always inlining variadic function is unimplemented is because of the implementation of va_args assume standard stack layout

7577978
thin	webrick
using rack handler thin is similar but in this case as thin actually is a web server it is started and will serve rackapp but listens on thin s default port of 8080 not the rack default of 9292
after stopping thin with ctrl-c the default rackup server mongrel or webrick will start listening on port 9292 again with no app specified so you ll get the nomethoderror

7578680
google-chrome	firefox
the websocket server demonstration currently works with firefox 7 beta and google-chrome dev it s at 16 now
not firefox 6 which uses and older version of the websocket draft protocol

7578740
mp3	wav
with them you can handle mp3 and ogg files
i thought java by default should be able to handle wav file as they are not compressed in any way but i m not sure since i ve never used java to play wav files only mp3 files

7582874
decoder	encoder
update 2 in case anyone mentions chardet due to gbk using the many unused slots in gb2312 and chardet not working on actually-used slots and not attempting to verify its answer by doing a trial decoder charget guesses gb2312
your error message is xmlsyntaxerror switching encoding encoder error line 1 column 36

7584180
apache	nginx
if you plan to server push services apache is not a good choice
take a look at cherokee and nginx both work much better with php-fpm than mod_php with apache2 since you do not need cgi support only fastcgi is supported with cherokee and nginx only php

7584341
client-side	server-side
since this is a client-side concern and not a server-side concern you ll want to do this with javascript
keep in mind that by the time the page is sent to the client all of the server-side code has completed and disposed

7585580
gtk	drawingarea
although it does not exactely what you say paint by pixel i like to use python gtk and cairo
in this case you create a gtk window add a drawingarea create a cairo context and do paint operations

7587294
wadl	wsdl
wsdl 2.0 or wadl offers rest service description but ms and wcf supports neither of them and these standards were not broader accepted and supported yet
web api is technology to create rest services and rest services don t use wsdl so there is no way for your service to generate one

7587662
google-chrome	firefox
i posted an answer to a similar question thanks jacob a while back about firefox not google-chrome
the answer works in google-chrome as well

7588660
aggregate-functions	sum
when a group by expression is provided the select list may contain the aggregate-functions count_big or sum
however sum may not be specified for a nullable column

7590162
datamapper	activerecord
ef 4.1 code first combine unit of work with datamapper pattern
so i would not recommend use activerecord pattern

7591199
mvp	presenter
the way i see it and how the google dev pages on mvp outline there are two flavours of mvp have a view that doesn t know about its presenter and wrap it with a presenter
the view provides a sufficient api for the presenter to get set all the data it cares about

7595257
matlab	simulink
just look at the number of comments in unit-testing framework for matlab
unit testing simulink is not straightforward unfortunately

7596565
implements	extends
your object you wish to deep copy will need to implements serializable
if the class isn t final or can t be modified extends the class and implements serializable

7596891
mp3	wav
from adobe s programming as3 chapter working with sound -- basics of working with sound although there are various sound file formats used to encode digital audio actionscript 3.0 flash player and air support sound files that are stored in the mp3 format
they cannot directly load or play sound files in other formats like wav or aiff

7597116
webclient	httpwebrequest
restricted headers protected by the system include but are not limited to the following date host in addition some other headers are also restricted when using a webclient object
these restricted headers include but are not limited to the following accept connection content-length expect when the value is set to 100-continue if-modified-since range transfer-encoding the httpwebrequest class has properties for setting some of the above headers

7597209
.htaccess	httpd.conf
check if the directory where your .htaccess lives in has enabled the neccessary allowoverride enabled must be authconfig and options at least in the httpd.conf
make sure it is not within the part of your .htaccess usually you should have a logging-message in your error-log

7597209
.htaccess	httpd.conf
make sure it is not within the part of your .htaccess usually you should have a logging-message in your error-log
i assume that you will find something like this this solution does not always help depending on the apache-version you are using in some cases you have to move this section to your httpd.conf to make it work

7598368
oncreate	findviewbyid
you could then try to move the code into onresume which is called after oncreate
as the spinner is not a child of the activity itself findviewbyid can not find it

7602876
vim	notepad++
notepad++ is great but if you want a truly powerful editor that can do things like this with ease i d say use vim
not sure about regex but there is a way for you to do this in notepad++ although it isn t very flexible

7603892
n-gram	words
you can also google for arpa language model for more info last not least check google s n-gram tool online soon to move to they built n-gram based on the books they digitized -- also available in french and other languages
the generalization of words frequencies are language models uni-grams single words frequency bi-grams frequency of words pairs tri-grams frequency of world tripples ... in general n-gram you should look for an existing toolkit for language models - not a good idea to re-invent the wheel here

7604826
ostream	ostringstream
all those people telling you to use std ostream for the type instead of std ostringstream are absolutely correct
you shouldn t be using std ostringstream that way

7605542
emacs	gedit
i ve seen discussion of embedding of emacs in other applications in the past and the consensus is that even that s not feasible let alone what you re suggesting
you d be better off identifying what gedit does that makes you want to use it instead of emacs and extending emacs to make it do that too

7605542
emacs	gedit
you d be better off identifying what gedit does that makes you want to use it instead of emacs and extending emacs to make it do that too
there can t be that much --- gedit doesn t do much. the extra features can just sit there and wait for you and you ll find it easier to locate and use them if you re comfortable in emacs-mode already

7606239
setcontentview	findviewbyid
in your code if you call setcontentview r.id.my_layout android will use the appropriate layout
then you can do a findviewbyid call where it should return null for the view of the layout not being used

7606313
gtk	cairo
you are right in saying that gtk performs a lot better on linux and other operating systems as compared to windows
that suggests that in fact the problem isn t actually with the entire cairo library

7606313
gtk	cairo
to optimise gtk you may try changing the backend of cairo difficult unreccomended and requires another ton of glue code or stop using libwimp this will make gtk look less native
but overall i think gtk is not that slow

7608310
jruby	mri
the problem is that you have probably installed version 0.4.6 which is not specific to the jruby platform but also installs incorrectly on mri
so the error neo4j not found is because you are using jruby and installed the neo4j.rb gem in mri

7608310
jruby	mri
so the error neo4j not found is because you are using jruby and installed the neo4j.rb gem in mri
neo4j.rb version 1.0.0 can only be installed on jruby

7609024
postgresql	mysql
you can play around with what you hash a bit as well if you wanted to mix the time in md5 random varchar || now varchar -- postgresql sha rand || now -- mysql
for mysql you could throw this right in your self.up postgresql doesn t have sha1 support by default but it does have md5 and that s probably good enough for this if you have the pgcrypto package installed then you could use sha1 for both

7609943
mvp	presenter
activity is excellently suitable for controller presenter view model i ve tried all of them i like mvp the most it has excellent instrumentation for managing the views view dialog and so on while it s not a view itself
sorry for the late i ve use mvp on android this way

7611632
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if i misread your post and you aren t trying to release the uiviewcontroller the i would need to see some code to figure out why things aren releasing on viewwilldisappear
i have noticed that when instantiating a uitabbarcontroller it loads all it s dependencies and is really stubborn when trying to release an entire uiviewcontroller

7611739
equals	gethashcode
the elements in one bucket may but need not be equals but elements in different buckets must be unequal
conceptually you can think of the default gethashcode implementation on reference types as using a field in every instance containing a random value for the hashcode which gets initialized on object creation

7612081
spaces	delimiter
it cannot be followed by a blank spaces
it may be usefull to note that a cobol picture strings are delimiter only by the separator spaces separator comma separator semicolon or separator period

7612202
equals	gethashcode
if a reference type does not override equals gethashcode a dictionary using the default comparator won t care about any of the key objects fields or properties and thus won t notice or care if they change
it s simplest to think of the default gethashcode method as returning a number related to an object id and the default equals method as comparing object id s

7613586
exponent	modulo
one side of an rsa key will consist of the modulo and an exponent
the modulo will be a large number not representable with the normal integer types and the exponent is typically a large number for one side and a relatively small one for the other

7613846
lxml	libxml2
look for lxml examples link to google web cache because actual page aren t available on the
if your stylesheet written in the xslt 1.0 you can use libxslt through lxml libxml2 libxslt python bindings

7615180
ssl	https
the ssl version is required for your users who have secure browsing enabled in their security settings
without an https version your app is not accessible to users who opt for secure browsing

7615205
postgresql	mysql
i ve written several apps that mix and match relational and non-relational databases mysql mongo postgresql and riak
it s actually not particularly hard in rails to do this and i even wrote a library that creates relations across different types of databases so your ripple models can belongs_to user where the user table is in mysql

7615875
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the somewhat cross-browser way to do animation keyframes is opera and internet explorer do not currently support the keyframes rule
your animations are not working in firefox because you are using - webkit -keyframes which only applies to webkit browsers google-chrome and safari

7615907
debian	linux
in debian for example default shell is dash not bash
if you use bash-only feature and don t specify that this script should be interpreted by bash it may fail even on linux

7617399
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload is called when the view is fully loaded into memory but not yet displayed on screen
try putting the above code in viewdidappear which is called when the view has appeared on screen

7618381
single-quotes	double-quotes
i tend to use double-quotes just out of habit from other languages but i don t have a strong preference i m willing to change if i hear of a compelling reason why single-quotes are better but to date i ve not even heard a good reason let alone a compelling reason
even the google javascript style guide says that single-quotes are preferred without giving a good reason for consistency single-quotes are preferred to double-quotes . this is helpful when creating strings that include html it then goes on to give a very short example of a string that doesn t even include html. a lot of people seem to believe xhtml is only valid with double-quotes but that is not true the xhtml spec allows either

7620381
ssl	https
source so it seems referrer is not within the domain but within ssl
if a website is accessed from a http secure https connection and a link points to anywhere except another secure location then the referrer field is not sent

7622035
clang	llvm
that s not necessary in most of the cases since llvm clang knows objc naming conventions
so if you follow the standard naming conventions of cocoa llvm automagically assumes the corresponding family return memory policy to follow

7622111
debian	centos
if anyone worrying about the disk io bottlenecks please have a check with the following command. iostat if this tool is not installed then apt-get install sysstat on debian based servers
yum install sysstat on redhat centos based servers

7622216
trie	tree
i m not sure if you would benefit from using a suffix tree here as the base of the characters being entered into the trie is only 10 compared to the base-128 for ansi strings but it s possible
i believe a good solution decent memory usage can be used to immediately determine if an entry has already been seen thus preserving order and with a linear complexity is a trie

7623945
boost	stl
the environment i m using can t use c++11 aka c++0x or boost although both of those are awesome so i figured i d post how i figured out to do this without either for the sake of posterity
as unclebens alluded to the functional header in the stl has some useful features if you aren t using c++11 or boost this problem is a bit more general than just not wanting to call a second template function

7624673
valgrind	gprof
if you re using linux your distribution probably has a valgrind package and a package that includes kcachegrind which may be called kdesdk or something else
it s worth the time invested to learn how to use them they are not as easy to get started with as gprof

7626141
uitableview	uipickerview
whenever user is scrolling up down above method is triggered automatically which is similar to uitableview
remember uipickerview is using uipickertableview which is private so we can not detect the scrolling the way you want to have

7626308
config	ini
my server is on lamp config with php 5.3 and fast cgi
you can not set php ini directives with the .htaccess method with fcgi cgi

7628291
inline	inlining
the code-size won t increase either if the compiler decides to omit the function code and inline all calls to it
i m referring to the inlining of bar_alias1 bar itself won t necessarily be inlined if it s large. however this doesn t apply if the functions are virtual

7629701
implements	extends
java.lang.object is not an interface so no interface will implicitly implements it
however any class that you create which implements any interface will extends object because all classes must extends it

7630695
layoutparams	viewgroup
layout_width and layout_height are part of the base viewgroup layoutparams
the takeaway from this is that layoutparams are not parsed by the view s constructor they re parsed by another step that your code above isn t doing

7630695
layoutparams	viewgroup
the takeaway from this is that layoutparams are not parsed by the view s constructor they re parsed by another step that your code above isn t doing
the layoutinflater involves the parent viewgroup s generatelayoutparams method. since layoutparams are dependent on the intended parent of the view it s not recommended to put layoutparams in styles

7633950
opera	google-chrome
opera doesn t even support the latest protocol yet and microsoft is far behind a partial implementation said to become available in version 10 msie
google-chrome supports it in a development version

7636566
serializable	deserialization
the purpose of this annotation is just to suppress the warning it will not interfere in any other way with the serializable
from serializable javadoc the serialization runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization

7636566
serializable	deserialization
from serializable javadoc the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable
and also if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification

7636566
serializable	deserialization
and also if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

7637548
postgresql	mysql
mysql is fine for read-only or read-mostly scenarios it is no accident that mysql is frequently used for web but more advanced multi-version concurrency control capabilities of oracle ms sql server postgresql or even firebird interbase can often handle read-write workloads not just with better performance but with better correctness as well they are better at avoiding various concurrency artifacts that may endanger data consistency
even traditional locking databases such as db2 or sybase are likely to handle read-write workloads better than mysql

7638248
jar	manifest.mf
it s not the cleanest way to go but it s possible to edit them inside the jar file
you can remove the signature by deleting meta-inf eclipsef.sf and removing everything from meta-inf manifest.mf that goes after it s main section filenames and digests...alternatively remove just sections of the config files

7638549
client-side	server-side
instead send your dynamic content in json format to client using ajax or socket.io and render it using client-side templates such as jquery templates
don t consider server-side dom dom doesn t scale for complex layouts you will sink in a sea of selectors and dom calls

7638935
implements	extends
there are a few different base classes you can extends implements
what is nice about class rules is that if you do not implements them as anonymous classes then you can reuse the code

7640565
udp	tcp
not udp
so if you need a very precise accounting and the application in question uses udp ip or any other protocol besides tcp these counters will be wrong

7643816
robocopy	xcopy
the robocopy task is included in msbuild community tasks
i use the web deploy feature to package all content files up and then i can use web deploy to sync with a site or use xcopy or rather robocopy if web deploy is not an option

7645487
pthreads	fork
the daemon function is not defined in pthreads so its implementation if any could behave differently on different platforms
on linux with glibc daemon only does one fork optionally chdir s but only to you can t specify a path does not touch umask and does not close the descriptors it optionally reopens them to dev null though

7645832
bmp	png
silverlight does not support the windows bitmap bmp format
only jpg and png

7645869
punctuation	words
standardtokenizerfactory - it tokenizes on whitespace as well as strips characters documentation - splits words at punctuation characters removing punctuations. however a dot that s not followed by whitespace is considered part of a token
splits words at hyphens unless there s a number in the token

7645903
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
3 if you need to use onclicklistener check if you do use dialoginterface.onclicklistener or view.onclicklistener they can be easily exchanged if not validated or if using both of them
1 check if you are using onitemclicklistener or onclicklistener which is not supported for listview documentation android developers listview 2 check if you added listener to your listview properly

7648127
dbcontext	objectcontext
managing lifetime you re correct that a single static instance of dbcontext is usually not recommended the more you use an objectcontext generally the bigger it gets. this is because it holds a reference to all the entities it has ever known about essentially whatever you have queried added or attached. so you should reconsider sharing the same objectcontext indefinitely
these comments apply directly to the dbcontext because it wraps wraps objectcontext to expose simplified and more intuitive apis. see documentation cost of construction the overhead of creating the context is relatively low the reality is this cost is actually pretty low because mostly it simply involves copying by reference metadata from a global cache into the new objectcontext

7649581
svg	vml
ie7 8 does not support either canvas or svg
it does however support vml which is a vector language similar to svg and there are a number of javascript-based hacks for ie that use its vml functionality to emulate both canvas and svg in this older browser

7650274
profiling	debugging
jboss 7 has passed the web profiling tck which is a seperate tck
the web profiling specification outlined in jsr 316 states that the following components are required in a web profiling compliant container wp.2.1 required components the following technologies are required components of the web profiling servlet 3.0 javaserver pages jsp 2.2 expression language el 2.2 debugging support for other languages jsr-45 1.0 standard tag library for javaserver pages jstl 1.2 javaserver faces jsf 2.0 common annotations for thejava platform jsr-250 1.1 enterprise javabeans ejb 3.1 lite java transaction api jta 1.1 java persistence api jpa 2.0 bean validation 1.0 managed beans 1.0 interceptors 1.1 contexts and dependency injection for the java ee platform 1.0 dependency injection for java 1.0 wp.2.2 optional components there are no optional components in the web profile. web profiling products may support some of the technologies present in the full java ee platform and not already listed in section wp.2.1 required components consistently with their compatibility requirements

by passing the web profiling tck and by also including the components required in the full profiling allowed by wp2.2 you can continue to build applications requiring the full profiling on jboss 7

7651795
realloc	malloc
realloc can be used for increasing memory but it is a tricky function at times it can return a different pointer than the original and if it fails to allocate new memory the original memory is left unchanged
it may be worth mentioning that malloc will not increase the size of existing memory

7656386
dns	spf
here you should have this spf entry in your dns for all your domains and nothing more in your spf string
make sure that you have such a dns entry for mail.maydomain.com as well as mydomain.com because the spf entry for mydomain.com is not valid for subdomain.mydomain.com

7656386
dns	spf
make sure that you have such a dns entry for mail.maydomain.com as well as mydomain.com because the spf entry for mydomain.com is not valid for subdomain.mydomain.com
if you have many subdomains you may consider to have an spf entry for

7658558
wxpython	pyqt
pythoncard is another rad ide i used in the past but also unmaintained right now although they are not ides some tools are very helpful for gui design like - wxglade wxpython included as a pluging in stani python editor only python2.x - qtdesigner qt-pyqt or pyside included in pyqt
spyder ide build on pyqt has a dedicated link to it

7659031
prepare	execute
to avoid sql injection mysql_real_escape_string is at minimun what you need to use. a better alternative is using prepare statements and paramerized queries look into pdo extension which is shipped with php since v 5.1 iirc which will be the safest option to avoid this kind of exploit
sending unescaped html to the db does nothing since malicious scripts aren t of course execute

7659555
move	drag
well action_down is happening just once after that action move should be happening and in the and action up.
but there is one problem for example if you have a touchable area of 48dip x 48dip and if you touch that area and move you finger away while dragging i mean you press and you drag you finger away from the touchable area than action up will not happen

7662161
google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in google-chrome but not in firefox try just selecting document instead and see if it behaves
firefox can pick up the keypresses in the above sample so i suspect the problem lies elsewhere in your code

7662830
serializable	deserialization
and same with the words from serializable specification a serializable class must do the following .
have access to the no-arg constructor of its first nonserializable superclass that would explain why you have problems only in deserialization because naturally constructor is not called during serializable

7665478
implements	extends
however in your example for a to implements its own abstract methods is a contradiction the point of making them abstract is so it doesn t provide implementations it just specifies what the method signatures should look like
you could have two abstract classes x and y where y extends x

7666354
client-side	server-side
if you make sure the form is not vulnerable to email injections you have client-side validation captcha and server-side validation of some form it does not have to be super complex it will stop spam. keep in my that today s great solution is not so great tomorrow why the hell do i need that server-side bull when my client-side validation works just fine
if a spammer goes around the client-side security the server-side security will still be there

7666688
super	implements
super references the superclass of that message that is implements by the method the reference super is in
glad that you did not ask for super

7666688
super	self
glad that you did not ask for super
self in ruby as in smalltalk references all the time the current object and that may be an instance of a class or even a class itself

7666716
super	implements
for a concrete sub class it is not mandatory to implements the abstract methods that are already implements by one of their super class
yes you can implements abstract methods in a class which is declared as abstract

7668718
uiview	caanimation	uiview	calayer	caanimation	calayer
you either need to use explicit animations using the appropriate subclass of caanimation or you need to use uiview animations
calayer s that are associated with a uiview as in they re accessed via view.layer do not participate in implicit animations regardless of how you configure your catransaction

7672027
inline	inlining
i think compilers use some kind of heuristic to decide on whether or not to inline a function
if the function is called from one place only inlining it may shave off a few instructions and cycles improving the size and speed

7673263
matlab	simulink
ineligible programs with matlab compiler
simulink including the sim command is not supported by matlab compiler

7682922
mongodb	bson
mongodb stores data in a binary format called bson which supports these numeric data types int32 - 4 bytes 32-bit signed int int64 - 8 bytes 64-bit signed int double - 8 bytes 64-bit ieee 754 floating point there s no exact value fixed-point equivalent to mysql s decimal type in mongodb but you can store 64-bit floating point numbers in mongo as a double
it s worth mentioning that the mongodb shell - being a javascript shell - doesn t recognise the distinction between int and floating-point values it treats all numbers the same because javascript represents all numbers as 64-bit floating point regardless of their underlying bson type

7684868
sse	avx
thus sse instructions are not guaranteed to be atomic even if the underlying architecture does use a single memory access this is one reason why the memory fencing was introduced
combine that with this statement from the intel optimization manual section 13.3 april 2011 avx and fma instructions do not introduce any new guaranteed atomic memory operations

7687680
client-side	server-side
you say that you downloaded these files - you can t unilaterally enable compression client-side
otoh you can control it server-side - and since you ve flagged the question as php and it doesn t make any sense for your administrator to recommend compression where you don t have control over the server then i assume this is what you are talking about

7691014
ssl	https
if you link to iresources at an external site using and then the external site does its own http redirect to non-ssl pages that will break the ssl lock on your page
but when you viewing the source or the information in the media tab you will not see any becuase your page is properly using only https links

7692327
lisp	smalltalk
some systems notably smalltalk do promote editing code within the image and have editing and export facilities to support this but common lisp as standardized does not nor do i know of any modern cl implementation which does.
as dirk mentions you can save an image in many lisp implementations

7693048
equals	gethashcode
two reasons there already exists a means of comparing objects which may or may not be the same type equals
since iequatable t does not include gethashcode its behavior essentially has to match that of equals

7693048
equals	gethashcode
since iequatable t does not include gethashcode its behavior essentially has to match that of equals
the only reason for implementing iequatable t in addition to equals is performance

7693233
ffmpeg	handbrake
handbrake bundles ffmpeg with its installation so i would get it from there
be mindful of the licensing on ffmpeg handbrake as they are distributed in france and i m not sure you can distribute it with your application but you may be able to use it server side

7696958
rtp	rtsp
if so- if you are not doing rtp over rtsp then you would also need to forward the ports for the media which is not the same as the rtsp port 554 or 8554
these ports are exchanged during the rtsp setup

7697557
skip-lists	tree
i do not know of a .net implementation but a data structure that might work for you is an indexible skip-lists
it has similar o lg n performance like a balanced binary tree but is conceptually more like a linked list

7698265
haskell	ocaml
haskell has a more powerful constraint language abut again i m not sure logic programming in the type system is a good way to go
the other part of the ocaml type system can do type-level computation is in its module and functor language

7698265
haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
so yes the type system of ocaml and most functional language that would hold of sml haskell and scala as well has some computational strength but no i wouldn t expect to do particularly useful pre-computation with them
and it s certainly not standard practice among ocaml programmers

7699482
uiview	subviews
either a xib interface builder view or a class that inherits from uiview are equivalent to a user control
they are ways to aggregate sub views think views and subviews - not controls

7700192
bash	zsh
try the following note that you ll never get behavior that exactly matches zsh one with bash only
in the above case i see the following differencies right part of the prompt is not cleared when you run a command accept-line event in terms of zsh

7703824
rar	zip
make sure you are really opening a zip file not for example a rar file named with a .zip extension
proper zip files have a header which was not found in this case

7704340
udp	tcp
if you have a udp connection and your app doesn t read those buffers it gets full and the kernel starts to drop the received packets
if you have a tcp connection it will acknowledge the packets as long as there is free space in the buffers but after that it will signal that it cannot read more

7706276
clang	llvm
except perhaps for a few high-level as in aware of high-level language features or details that aren t encoded in llvm ir optimizations clang s backend does little more than generate straightforward ir and run some set of llvm optimization passes on it
all of these or at least most should be available trough the opt command and also as api calls when using the c++ libraries that all llvm tools are built on

7706539
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome forum i will not post the w3schools link due to general unreliability but they also state it s only supported in opera for whatever it s worth
according to sitepoint google-chrome is not supported here only opera and ie 8 buggy .

7708109
innodb	myisam
this happens most often when you have one table that is myisam and one table that is innodb
since myisam doesn t support fk constraints all hell breaks loose when django creates a fk between the tables

7708922
udp	tcp
remember udp does not provide reliable communication it is intended for situations in which data loss is acceptable streaming media for instance
chances are good that this is a buffer overflow my guess don t rely on it but the point is that if this data loss is not acceptable use tcp instead

7709174
dictionary	map
note that this will not check whether the keys are consecutive integers nor whether they start at 0 so you might waste a lot of space when you convert the dictionary to a list
you could recursively walk through all dictionaries and check if all keys can be converted to integers using this map int your_dict.keys this will generate a valueerror if one of the keys cannot be converted to int

7712466
division	multiplication
for numbers less than 10 the division is not necessary and that s probably why it doesn t work
to check make a function which divides two variables dividing by a constant is usually optimized into multiplication by the compiler

7712522
google-chrome	firefox
disable all web security on google-chrome startup which you obviously don t want to do in real life
wouldn t work in firefox either

7718403
octal	decimal	octal	hex
the call to has wrong mode this is usually octal and not decimal or hex
7777 is 017141 in octal and thus tries to set non-existent bits

7718808
super	implements
you cannot use a bare super call that contains no type class
nor can you implements a replacement for it that will work

7720361
jms	jta
to see how to setup jta for jpa and jms check out this blog post
not sure if i understand correctly but if you re trying to simply do declarative transaction managment using spring and the transactional annotation for just jms then simply use the tx annotation-driven transaction-manager mytransactionmanager and then - for the mytranactionmanager register a bean of type jmstransactionmanager now you can use the annotation as normal and the jms interactions will be wrapped in a transaction if your goal is to work with multiple resources jms and jdbc then you need to use jta

7721084
serializable	deserialization
there is no limitation of web services that prevent this however the default serializable in .net doesn t know how to serializable circular references
you d need to write you re own serialization deserialization code and plug it into wcf

7722254
setinterval	settimeout
you can play with the number after you ve switched to setinterval you might be surprised how low you can take it without affecting the visual performance
try using setinterval instead of settimeout launching 101 timers at once isn t that friendly to the browser but a single interval timer that stops itself isn t a big deal

7722530
wav	caf
in response to a deleted comment which was moved to the question i can t speak for cocos2d specifically so i will write about the file formats in general wav does not use data compression
caf may

7722743
serializable	deserialization
if you are using xmlserializer with default non- ixmlserializable serializable then indeed this cannot be achieved without adding an extra class that is the alertone with an attribute and a value
if you implement ixmlserializable it should be possible but that is not a nice interface to implement robustly the deserialization in particular is hard

7723193
rtp	rtsp
if rtp session is closed that does not mean that rtsp connection should also be teardown whereas rtp channels must be closed on rtsp channel teardown
-- send any rtsp request periodically options set_parameter or get_parameter before timeout value received in setup response

7723868
gif	png
however gif was not a supported image file in previous versions of ax maybe there is an error with transparency
my first suggestion is to convert the gif to png update the image in the check layout and try again

7725267
queue	fifo
accessing elements in the middle of the queue diverges from that expected behavior and if you modified that object would could seriously break the expected behavior pattern
in the case of a priority queue the elements are sorted so the first element off the queue is the element with the highest priority or if all the elements have the same priority it leads back to your first question which is no it will not be guaranteed to be in fifo order since many implementations use a heap-sort and the results of the sort will be ambiguous for objects of equal priority since a heap is a linear-representation of a binary tree for two equal child objects there becomes an ambiguous choice between the two children of the root to choose as the new root node when removing the root node from the queue during a pop .

7725267
queue	fifo

in other words objects of the same priority will be grouped together but the order they are popped from the queue may not be in fifo order

7726465
kerberos	ntlm
unless your webservice runs on the exchange box you ll need to configure kerberos
ntlm does not allow credential delegation

7728068
awt	swing
you re trying to do awt graphics in a swing program -- don t do this
instead there s no place for update in a swing graphics program and you should not be overriding the paint method but rather the jpanel s paintcomponent method

7730477
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
for redhat fedora and debian ubuntu this is a hard problem
unfortunately depends within the description file is all you get for the following reasons r itself is reasonably cross-platform but that means we need this to work across platforms and oss encoding depends beyond r packages requires encoding the depends in a portable manner across operating systems---good luck encoding even something simple such as a png graphics library in a way that can be resolved unambiguously across systems windows does not have a package manager afaik os x does not have a package manager that mixes what apple ships and what other open source projects provide even among linux distributions you do not get consistency just take rstudio as an example which comes in two packages which all provide their dependencies

7732080
matlab	simulink
you can compile matlab scripts into standalone executables but i m not familiar with a matlab tool to convert matlab code to visual c++ code
you can convert matlab code to c or c++ using simulink coder formerly real-time workshop which is available from mathworks as a separate product

7732302
setinterval	settimeout
i would not be using setinterval for this
instead use settimeout with a function that after swapping to the next image to be shown will start another settimeout

7732771
mp4	webm
if you re only using an mp4 file and flash isn t working this could explain what you re seeing
you could either try adding another format webm or ogg on the latest firefox or check to see if flash is working

7734840
setinterval	settimeout
if you can you should use settimeout instead of setinterval
setinterval will call the function after period whether the function from the previous interval is complete or not

7738774
dictionary	map
it goes through all the keys in the dictionary and if they map to things that are not dictionary in your case the filename we print out the name
otherwise we call the function on the dictionary that is mapped to

7738789
g++	gcc
build and link with g++ and link libstdc++ statically by using -static-libstdc++ link stage option
after building the shared librrary using gcc the shared library builds fine but when i issue ldd it give me the dependency on libstdc++.so.5 gcc doesn t automatically link libstdc++ g++ does

7738789
g++	gcc
after building the shared librrary using gcc the shared library builds fine but when i issue ldd it give me the dependency on libstdc++.so.5 gcc doesn t automatically link libstdc++ g++ does
so either you are linking with g++ or you pass -lstdc++ linker option

7738789
g++	gcc
so either you are linking with g++ or you pass -lstdc++ linker option
you have a few options build and link with gcc not g++ to make sure libstdc++ doesn t get linked in automatically

7744168
spaces	delimiter
in fact i just now ran it and it also read the line that you indicated would not work and it reads just two words since the operator in that case will use white spaces as a delimiter for the string
a possible reason for the failure is if the line preceding the +lda #5 line has more than three words delimiter by spaces

7744350
client-side	server-side
if used as a client-side technology -- yes dart should work just fine
however as detailed here dart is intended for server-side as well as client-side use developers have not been able to create homogeneous systems that encompass both client and server except for a few cases such as node.js and google web toolkit gwt

7744655
codeigniter	kohana
sadly codeigniter does not support hmvc unmodified however there is a drop-in extension for codeigniter which allows you to use a hmvc architecture
thanks wesley alternatively you can use a fork of codeigniter which is specifically designed for hmvc called kohana framework

7747856
subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication
there must be a clear difference between the implementation of addition subtraction and multiplication division
and indeed there is so lets look at addition and multiplication jsparse.cpp but as we can tell there isn t a huge difference here

google-chrome	firefox
the latest version of google-chrome 14.0.835 displays the fiddle in the exact same way as the latest version of firefox 3.6.23 and the latest version of ie 9.0.3
so you can see that google-chrome shouldn t have done it right in the first place

7751392
aggregate-functions	sum
sum is an aggregate-functions that sums up all rows in a column not all columns in a row as you probably want
as an aggregate-functions it always returns a value at least null

7752076
portrait	landscape
your minzoomscale is set to 1.0 thats fine for portrait mode but not for landscape
because in landscape your height is smaller than in portrait you need to have a value smaller than 1.0

7753238
set	bag
on the parent you have a method on the child you have a method using these methods to add remove set both sides are consistent after the action is performed
it then wouldn t matter whether you set inverse true on the bag or not

7753881
union	distinct
that s what union does
take all the distinct items of newitems and add to it the distinct items from source that do not already exist

7754779
onclick	onchange
this is the solution does not have an onclick event by default in other browsers than firefox
so what you have to do is adding an onchange event to the tag

7756460
listview	gridview
i m not sure that a listview makes sense from your description
like most of the asp.net controls in its class -- the repeater and gridview are other similar examples -- the listview is meant to create several rows of identical information based on an html template you provide

7758589
memcached	apc
on a shared hosting space you may not have memcached available
check apc in that case

7759753
scikit-learn	nltk
edit much later try scikit-learn it is very easy to use
your corpora are not very big so nltk should do the job

7760127
glut	sdl
also another bad thing about glut is that it doesn t really track pressed keys but characters entered so pressing num1 and num1+shift generates 2 different things and for every keyboard layout these will be different
if you want to do proper keyboard handling use either sdl or better sfml google for it - simple and fast multimedia library

7760499
queue	fifo
resig if i do the anonymous function will get enqued immediately but will not get called until everything else on the event queue has already been handled
that is as long as whatever browser its running really runs everything on a fifo basis as i would expect it to

7761949
glut	glfw
so you need a replacement for all the stuff glut does for you
you might be able to get away with glfw but that might not be sufficient for your game

7761949
glfw	allegro	glfw	sdl
you might be able to get away with glfw but that might not be sufficient for your game
as such sdl sfml and allegro 5 are all possibilities

7762553
stateless	stateful
it s important to understand that backbone is not a stateless web server so a redirect might sound like what you want but it most likely isn t
if you have any experience in building stateful desktop applications draw from that experience and how you would move from one screen to another

7765214
firefox	safari
unfortunately theoretically seems to be the name of the game here because it seems that this feature isn t supported by firefox yet
it apparently is supported by safari see this page which details it but my quick attempts to get it working within your fiddle haven t succeeded yet even in safari

7770477
quicksort	timsort
choosing a good pivot isn t hard but guaranteeing an o n log n quicksort comes at the cost of generally slower sorting on average
for more detail on timsort see this answer and the linked blog post

7771499
division	modulo
before returning the result or before doing division or right bit-shifting you can normalize back to the standard integer range using something like
if not then you don t need to worry about overflows at each stage of the calculation because you will always get the correct answer modulo 2 32 or 2 64

7771661
cvs	svn
that process worked great but we missed some projects initially from cvs and the team also made some commits to cvs after the fact
so our subsequent svn dump had a combo of new projects not seen in svn before existing projects already migrated to svn but with newer commits

7773784
n-gram	words
that way there s no need to maintain a separate mapping from ids to n-gram
for example say you have a document containing the text hello which contains the trigrams hel ell and llo assuming you re not including words boundaries

7774697
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring does but you ve declared an immutable string variable and assigned to it a string literal
since an objective-c string literal is always immutable an instance of nsstring but not nsmutablestring there s no way those messages can be sent to the object you re using

7776000
innodb	myisam
innodb implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while myisam implements table-level lock
innodb has transactions while myisam does not

7776000
innodb	myisam
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not

7776000
innodb	myisam
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

7776000
innodb	myisam
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not

7776021
innodb	myisam
innodb implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while myisam implements table-level lock
innodb has transactions while myisam does not

innodb	myisam
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not

7776021
innodb	myisam
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

7776021
innodb	myisam
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not

7776995
rvm	bundler
i fix that by installing xcode 4.2.x adding into .bash_profile reloading environment source .bash_profile executing rvm install 1.9.3 executing rvm ruby-1.9.3-rc1 executing gem update --system and finally executing gem install bundler the problem is with xcode 4.2.x version
if you run rvm get head you will see this message do not use xcode version 4.2.x

7778424
opera	firefox
and opera doesn t support onerror. from the horses mouth webkit source that checks origin when passing exceptions to onerror
and the firefox source that checks

7778663
addition	modulo
if that s really what you are looking for then you should be doing something like the following to encrypt with a 7 to decrpyt you subtract 7 which in mod 10 arithmetic is an addition by 3 so that would be this of course presupposes you ve properly validated your input which isn t the case in your example above
based on your comment you are trying to do a variation on the caesar cipher in which case you should be using the modulo not the integer division operator

7778663
division	modulo
based on your comment you are trying to do a variation on the caesar cipher in which case you should be using the modulo not the integer division operator
using integer division loses information which will prevent you from decrypting

7779139
nginx	lighttpd
if you are using nginx you can also take advantage of its xsendfile functionaliy
note lighttpd and apache have an alternative xsendfile implementation with some differences and are not supported yet

7781499
udp	tcp
many attempts to use udp for speed wind up re-implementing many of the things that tcp provides for you already -- but most re-implementations are not done nearly as well as the real thing
please don t be so quick to dismiss tcp

7785711
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome i was able to use the following but i couldn t make anything work for firefox see bug 549114 the workaround you can do for firefox if necessary is to wrap your non-breaking content in a table but that is a really really terrible solution if you can avoid it
update according to the bug report mentioned above firefox 20+ supports page-break-inside avoid as a mechanism for avoiding column breaks inside an element but the below code snippet demonstrates it still not working with lists as others mention you can do overflow hidden or display inline-block but this removes the bullets shown in the original question

7786100
queue	fifo
assuming the three messages to be sent by the server are already queue up after you hit enter for the first time your packet is sent never blocked as sendto doesn t block for udp received by the server and i assume see above echoed back and added to the fifo receive buffer in which you alread have three messages queue up
you then have a recv in your program which receives the first queue up message printing it out

7786216
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu 11.10 you can just run update-alternatives --config ruby and selected desired version i also recommend you to update rubygems before you start installing any gems
what i do on my squeeze boxes to get ruby 1.9 as default cd usr bin ln -sf ruby1.9.1 ruby ln -sf gem1.9.1 gem ln -sf erb1.9.1 erb ln -sf irb1.9.1 irb ln -sf rake1.9.1 rake ln -sf rdoc1.9.1 rdoc ln -sf testrb1.9.1 testrb i run a lot of rails production servers this way and all other debian ruby packages are not broken because they relay on usr bin ruby1.8 binary

7786966
cstring	bstr
pass a cstring as a bstr
now bstr is not a part of the basic idl but an ole automation extension widely used in com

7786990
google-chrome	firefox
i successfully tested this add-on with google-chrome 14
unfortunately i could not get it working with firefox 7

7788209
spaces	delimiter
in the most basic sense because you have not quite specified what to do with punctuation you can split each line into a list of words using line.split which splits on every spaces
if you have other delimiter you can substitute that in instead of the spaces

7790722
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp
the thing is in contrast with say udp and sctp tcp does not have the concept of message boundaries because it s stream-oriented
it means tcp transports opaque streams of bytes and you have very little control of chunking that stream with regard to the receiving side

7792151
postgresql	mysql
there are ways to automate retrieving this list in postgresql mysql and most other databases
iterate through this list and for each column_name dynamically build the sql text such as select column_name from your_table where column_name is not null limit 1 see the mysql limit and postgresql limit

7792182
pthreads	fork
you can also use the bigger part of what s in pthreads as long as it is implemented in some form under windows
the one major pthreads thing that does not work with mingw is fork simply because there is no such thing under windows cygwin goes through a lot of pain to implement it

7793516
google-chrome	firefox
have a look at these related so questions error attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope specifically the last answer talks about using document.write and jquery animation error attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope i could not reproduce the crash of the program on google-chrome
i get the error attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope when i run this in firefox

7799042
oncreate	onstart
first why onrestoreinstancestate isn t firing according to the documentation onrestoreinstancestate gets called after onstart which according to the activity lifecycle diagram only gets called after oncreate or onrestart
if your main activity isn t destroyed when the user goes to choose a contact then onstart will never fire and onrestoreinstancestate will never fire

7799269
aggregate-functions	sum
i changed the aggregate-functions from sum to count
notice the aggregate-functions does not get included in the group by clause --- the group by lists only the fields or field expressions which determine the groups not any aggregate functions

7800721
icmp	tcp
ping command is not using tcp protocol but icmp protocol
so you can t use tcp port 80

7802047
dbcontext	objectcontext
i wouldn t recommend creating a dbcontext that exposes edmx generated models from 4.0
you also loose the benefits of inheriting objectcontext dbcontext inheriting properties row versioning ect and controlling the poco object non code generated so you don t have to worry about partials + metadatatype attribute as in 4.0 your question related to validating schema created with ef4.0 so that data annotations are not completely wiped when updating your model you need to use metadatatype attribute

7802166
serializable	deserialization
it might not be a bad idea to just use the separate model for available times but if you decide to go the hash route you can do so using the serializable keyword
you have to tell activerecord to serializable the variable and then it will do the serialization and deserialization automatically whenever you access the hash

7802969
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql example ms-sql example better databases ie
not mysql will also support transactions with begin tran commit tran rollback tran

7804208
bash	subshell
i think it s some undocumented bug feature. echo|return typed in commandline gives an error that s correct - return should be in a function. is accepted in the bash dash but return doesn t terminate a function call
if return terminates a subshell it would work outside a function

7805281
boost	stl
it mimicks the stl containers but provides functionalities geared toward polymorphism access elements as automatic memory handling specific copy behavior using new_clone methods syntactic sugar given is a if your types are unrelated the other possibility is to use boost variant
basically a variant is similar to of course since it s boost it provides specific guarantees to make sure that you can only access the member of the union that is currently active and lifts the restriction on classes with constructors destructors not being usable in traditional unions

7805563
primes	palindrome
after the loop is over palindrome will be pointing to palindrome 2 . meanwhile since 8 will be removed from palindrome since it is not a primes
now palindrome 7 9 10 and palindrom palindrome 2 10

7805609
boost	allocator
mmap boost iostreams memory mapped files perhaps combine that with eastl which boasts a faster std map and thrives with custom allocator - in fact they have no default allocator eastl look at tuning your hash_map std unorderded_map
if hash_maps are slower you should look into a loadfactor b hash function tuning docs last but not least evaluate the use of boost serialization for binary serialization of your map whatever implementation you picked

7806049
spaces	delimiter
i ran into a couple of problems when i tried converting kevin fairchild s suggestion to work with strings containing spaces and special xml characters which were encoded
the final version of my code which doesn t answer the original question but may be useful to someone looks like this rather than using a space as a delimiter and replacing all the spaces with commas it just pre-pends a comma and space to each value then uses stuff to remove the first two characters

7806655
super	self
super person self .__call__ someinfo if you need to use the base class you can do it directly but beware that this will break multiple inheritance so you shouldn t do it unless you re sure that s what you want parent.__call__ self someinfo
the super function takes the derived class as its first parameter not the base class

7811126
.htaccess	httpd.conf
php_admin_value is not valid in .htaccess files
it can only be used in httpd.conf

7812049
inline	inlining
using the inline keyword to avoid a prologue is not completely reliable since it does not force the compiler to inline the function .
under certain low-optimization levels inlining will not occur and you ll end up with a prologue again and the stack-pointer will not be pointing to the correct location if you decide to take it s address in those cases

7814519
postgresql	mysql
since i usually work with either sqlite or postgresql i ve only developed for those
but extending it to say mysql shouldn t be too troublesome

7814738
hex	binary
if this is correct you can use the convert function with a style of 2 to have sql server treat the string as hex and not require a 0x as the first characters
my understanding of your question is that you have a column uuid which is binary

7814822
spaces	linefeed
on your whitespace removal request pls note that trim only removes character 32 ie a standard spaces
clean will remove non printing whitespace such as carriage returns character 13 and linefeed character 10 clean doesn t deal with non-breaking spaces character 160 a common issue with dealing with data from the web for this you need a substitute function you can do this either with formulae over the entire cell or more painlessly and targeting the leading whitespace with vba with formula you can use combine these three formulae to clean an entire cell like so

7817746
allocator	stl
most implementations of the c++ stl i m familiar with have been significantly dependent on an os particularly for memory allocator
i m not going to rule out using the c++ stl in an operating system kernel but you d have to do a lot of work to port an implementation of the stl to your environment e.g implement a memory allocator make exception handling work write an iostreams compatibility shim to output to the screen tty whatever and to get a compiler to target your implementation correctly

7819803
google-chrome	firefox
it s funny set #one td and #two to height 100 and it works in firefox not google-chrome
set an arbitrary number like 1px to #one td and it works in google-chrome not firefox

7821798
arp	icmp
if you want to detect mac addresses you should use arp protcols where it s applicable in local networks not internet
icmp protocol starts after ipv4 header 1 and mac addresses is related to physical link layer

7822002
mp3	wav
although there are various sound file formats used to encode digital audio actionscript 3.0 flash player and air support sound files that are stored in the mp3 format
they cannot directly load or play sound files in other formats like wav or aiff

7822158
touchesbegan	touchesended
when i added touchesbegan moved cancelled handlers with similar implementations as the touchesended the event seems to bubble up to the root view controller
so i guess on ios5 views discard touchesended events when they have not seen the relevant touchesbegan

7825419
.htaccess	httpd.conf
order allow deny allow from all check your documentroot folder for an .htaccess it can override the above
aside from that you can also get this error when your virtualhost does not contain the proper servername or serveralias and the request ends up falling into the default httpd.conf setup

7827488
uiview	calayer
uiview s animation capabilities have grown as the ios sdk has matured but there are still a few things that are best done by interacting with the underlying calayer
on ios every uiview is backed by a core animation calayer so you are dealing with calayers when using a uiview even though you may not realize it

7830749
super	self
the logic is the same as in super dealloc
note that you should also call self viewdidunload in your dealloc if you don t already release your memory there because it is not called implicitly although sometimes it is

7831173
awt	swing
although i would definitely advise testing it first before writing the code. you might be able to avoid this if you can get the window using java awt native interface to get the window id
note that swing is built on top of awt so this will work for swing. however i m not sure how to do this

7834303
rdf	owl
what you can t do in rdf is say hang on that s not consistent no one thing can be both a car and a bacterium because rdf has no way of expressing that
using owl you could also say the classes car and bacteria are disjoint by definition they have no members in common

7834356
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
anyway you shouldn t need to add it as it s provided in uiviewcontroller class
uiviewcontroller has navigationcontroller property that is handled by the framework and it points to the parent uinavigationcontroller if the view controller in question has one

7835481
primes	modulus
the length of each primes factor must be no more than half the length of the modulus
the private exponent must not be longer than the modulus

7835481
exponent	modulo
the private exponent must not be longer than the modulo
the private exponent reduced modulo p-1 resp

7837317
vim	sublimetext	vim	textmate	emacs	sublimetext	emacs	textmate
then of course there s surely got to be an emacs or vim plugin
this question might already have your answer eclipse plug-in create a new file extension for a language not supported by eclipse if you aren t opposed to using a different editor there is a liquid mode for textmate which i think may also work on sublimetext if you aren t using a mac

7837504
webclient	webrequest
the approach you need to take is to use webclient in conjunction with your own code based on a dispatchertimer that will call the webclient cancelasync method
the webrequest does not provide a means for managing request timeouts either

7838478
ienumerable	iqueryable
no the database is not hit when a linq-to-entities query is cast as ienumerable so performance is not compromised
you can if you d like upcast to either iqueryable or objectquery

7841250
pthreads	fork
fork wait and waitpid are defined by the pthreads standard and windows is not posix-compliant
in order to have pthreads compliance under windows you should compile under cygwin

7843346
prepare	execute
for an example of using prepare statements see the msdn page or the prepare method
the problem seems to be that you re trying to execute a query that doesn t return a result set using the executereader method of the sqlcommand class which will attempt to execute your query and create and return a datareader for an eventual result set

7843503
mongodb	bson
if not most likely mongodb could not properly store the data in your object in bson
if i understand what s happening correctly you re seeing intact objects in the mongodb databases curly braces and all. these records are actually not much more than standard associative arrays stored in bson

7843503
mongodb	bson
if i understand what s happening correctly you re seeing intact objects in the mongodb databases curly braces and all. these records are actually not much more than standard associative arrays stored in bson
when you insert a php object into a mongodb database the mongodb actually converts your php object into a sort of associative array which it then stores as bson

7843729
kerberos	ntlm
delegated authentication of the second hop between the server hosting the service and the database server is usually not possible unless all authentication is using kerberos and delegation is specifically configured
this scenario can only work at all if all the computers involved workstation where the winforms app is running server hosting the service and the database server are all supporting kerberos authentication and not falling back to ntlm

7843729
kerberos	ntlm
this scenario can only work at all if all the computers involved workstation where the winforms app is running server hosting the service and the database server are all supporting kerberos authentication and not falling back to ntlm
if you are sure that all authentication is using kerberos then you have to ensure that delegation is correctly configured

7844166
subtraction	addition
not an expert but the whole statement on subtraction seems wrong
you can implement subtraction in two basic ways directly as subtraction or as addition of two s complement

7845385
setinterval	settimeout
instead of the while true you should use setinterval so that your code doesn t hog all the processing time that will call your function every 3000ms
you may want to take the settimeout s out of call_pulse_hide and call_pulse_show and just control the timing from the setinterval

7846321
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu for example you ll want to install libc6-i386-dev and gcc-multilib but i think that is installed as a dependency anyway
when on a 64bit install of most linux distributions the 32 bit development libraries aren t installed.

7848776
recvfrom	datagram
if you try to recvfrom later that is what you ll get
the receive buffer is obviously necessarily large enough to hold at least one max-size datagram 65535 bytes but since usually datagram will not be maximum size but rather something below 1280 bytes or 1500 if you will it can usually hold quite a few of them on most platforms the buffer defaults to something around 128-256k and is configurable

7850355
clgeocoder	mkreversegeocoder
on the other hand be carreful with mkreversegeocoder it has been deprecated in ios 5 they recommand to use clgeocoder instead
i have got the same issue mkreversegeocoder doesn t always return the full address beacause sometimes the coordinates is not accurate enough and the service can t generate an approximative address. in order to get best results i have implemented an other reverse geocoding against yahoo

7850832
move	drag
as i said for some reason my fb does not always compile all the assets correctly so sometimes i have to move them in manually
that is you can simply drag and drop them from the source directory to the bin-release directory although if you are using svn you should be careful with this as it might copy also the svn metadata

7854773
keystore	jks
a rather large problem that i frequently encounter is that when generating the csr to get our certificate the keystore sun formatted jks keystore does not output the .key or provide any facility for obtaining the .key
so i always had ended up with a .pem .crt with no way of using it with apache2 which cannot read a jks keystore like tomcat can but instead requires a unpackaged .key + .pem .crt pair

7854773
keystore	jks
so i always had ended up with a .pem .crt with no way of using it with apache2 which cannot read a jks keystore like tomcat can but instead requires a unpackaged .key + .pem .crt pair
to start get a copy of your existing keystore and skip to the 5th command below or create your own like this then optionally create a 2-year csr and then import the csr response in the next 3 step process to get this working and if you already have your jks keystore file that you use for a tomcat application server follow the following steps first get the der binary formatted certificate into a file called exported-der.crt then view verify it now you will want to convert it to pem format which is more widely used in applications such as apache and by openssl to do the pkcs12 conversion then download and use exportpriv to get the unencrypted private key from your keystore by now you probably realize the private key is being exported as pkcs#8 pem format

7855524
serializable	deserialization
also passing a struct binary serializable in this way is not portable at all and can bring you to several problems if you want to use the same mechanism with other systems or if you change the structure or things like the packing of the object
a custom serialization deserialization would be preferred and more portable but the choice is of course your

7856166
floating-point	fractions
the second one only involves integers not fractions and integers can be represented exactly in the binary floating-point format up to 52 bits
from the floating-point guide because internally computers use a format binary floating-point that cannot accurately represent a number like 0.1 0.2 or 0.3 at all

7856561
postgresql	mysql
postgresql does that most every rdbms does
furthermore this query wouldn t run in postgresql because no identifiers with backticks that s mysql slang

7856922
draggable	droppable
cloning the draggable element doesn t seem to clone the events as well even with clone true passed in as the parameter
i have noticed this with other jquery controls also such as droppable

7858052
ssl	https
the site should have bindings to port 80 with http 443 with https for standards ssl en 444 with https for this to work
the following url rewrite rule should do what you want it redirects to whenever https is not on or when the port number is not 444

7860005
super	self
in the code def foo2 self super b self .foo self is an instance of b
when a method derived from a is called by an instance of b it will start looking in the namespace from b and only if the method is not found is not overridden by b the implementation from a is used but always with self referring to b

7860122
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
-webkit for webkit browsers like safari and google-chrome -o for opera and sometimes -ms for microsoft although in this case border-image is just not supported in ie9 and below
as in the article you mentioned you still have to use the -moz prefix for firefox

7861887
dbcontext	objectcontext
however dbcontext does have a constructor overload that takes an objectcontext - you can use this to pass in an objectcontext and subscribe to the savingchanges event on it
from what i can see on msdn dbcontext wraps an instance of objectcontext as a facade not exposing this specific event

7864884
ssl	https
no ssl ssl mixed ssl no ssl
the globe icon in chrome s address bar refers to whether or not the current site uses https a common web security protocol

7865050
oncreate	onstart
long story short you need to restore your state in oncreate not in onrestoreinstancestate
here is a sample of the log when phone is locked 10-23 10 50 20.847 i test 913 a onsaveinstancestate 10-23 10 50 20.847 i test 913 a onpause 10-23 10 50 20.847 i test 913 a onstop 10-23 10 50 20.847 i test 913 a ondestroy | isfinishing false 10-23 10 50 20.859 i test 913 a oncreate 10-23 10 50 20.859 i test 913 a onstart 10-23 10 50 20.859 i test 913 a onrestoreinstancestate 10-23 10 50 20.863 i test 913 a onresume 10-23 10 50 21.210 i test 913 a onsaveinstancestate 10-23 10 50 21.210 i test 913 a onpause as you can see after invoking onsaveinstancestate your activity is killed then created again and because you miss to recover your state in oncreate your arraylist is empty

7865886
haskell	sml
if you mean solve including some form of type-checking that the you re not missing an implementation of some function for some case then f# doesn t give you any elegant way and i m not sure if the haskell solution is elegant
you may be able to encode it using the sml solution mentioned by kvb or maybe using one of the oo based solutions

7868031
inline	inlining
you should inline a function if the compiler doesn t and profiling with a realistic data set shows you re spending a significant amount of time in the function the algorithm using said function is an efficient one and if inlining it shows a speed improvement in a benchmarking with said data set
the compiler is perfectly capable of making a decision as to whether to inline a function or not depending on the chosen optimization profile

7868176
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
also the expression onload in document.createelement object evaluates to true in google-chrome and opera
naturally firefox is an exception because such event support check doesn t work there generally

7869422
ilist	icollection
edit corrected icollection instead of ilist error
update if your collection only implements icollection and thus is not indexable then you should consider using a viewmodel exposing an ilist instead of the model you currently use to make the above valid

7870611
consistency	acid
what the other answers seem to be missing is that the generally-applicable alternative to acid isn t nothing it s something called eventual consistency sometimes nicknamed base
when people say they need acid semantics often what they really mean at least from a domain business requirements point of view is simply data integrity

7870739
google-chrome	firefox
uncaught referenceerror boxnum is not defined you should look into using a javascript console like firebug for firefox or the google-chrome developer tools comes stock ctrl+shift+j to open them
firefox also has a javascript error window that comes stock as well

7870894
g++	gcc
if it s gcc and it certainly looks like it is based on the absolutely identical error message you may need to make sure that you re calling g++ rather than gcc and or that your extension for the source file not header is a recognised one like .cpp a
i m not entirely certain the rules that gcc follows but i ve always found it safer to use source files like blahblah.cpp and explicitly use g++

7870894
g++	gcc
i m not entirely certain the rules that gcc follows but i ve always found it safer to use source files like blahblah.cpp and explicitly use g++
a reasoning since you mention in your particular case that you re using the correct header file extensions i think one possibility is that the header extension has no effect whatsoever on what gcc tries to compile the source file as

7870895
cvs	svn
many say that svn was build to be a better cvs and in almost all aspects svn is better and is widely used
only thing that i have come across in my limited use of cvs is that cvs treats branches and tags as different and also treats them as what they are and not as just folders that svn does

7871033
prepare	execute
does not work for prepare statements or simple sql or plpgsql functions
you have to use execute in a plpgsql function for that purpose

7871053
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you shouldn t put either of these in viewdidload or loadview
put them in viewdidappear which is after your scrollview is actually drawn on screen

7871646
cvs	svn
at least once i ve had to manually reconstruct a saved cvs file that had become corrupted
i m not sure how i could have done that with svn or git

7872879
postgresql	mysql
this is not possible with postgresql
it does not offer an in-process in-memory engine like hsqldb or mysql

7873758
inline	inlining
it is however common for debug builds to disable inlining which is perfectly valid since compilers are not required to inline anything
if the getter is defined as an inline function either implicitly by defining it inside the class or explicitly with the inline keyword the compiler will usually inline it and there will be no overhead in calling it

7876634
queue	fifo
i m afraid i m not in a position to provide a nice python answer now but i ll give you the outline of the data structure you ll need to use keep your 1000 items in an fifo queue
keep pointers to the largest and smallest items in the queue

7880308
boost	stl
in short you can write bad code just anywhere but boost cannot be blamed
stl can only be blamed for insane raw performance 4

7886236
codeigniter	cakephp
i never used framework instead i coded my own but i took a look at codeigniter
if you want to use framework i wouldn t suggest to use cakephp

7887433
onresume	onpause
then use onresume onpause
as ondestroy is not guaranted to be called you shall use onpause to deregister

7887458
postgresql	mysql
it is well worth the trouble getting familiar with postgis and postgresql they are both remarkably good projects and by far my preferred relational db but just looking up points does not require them
if it is just points mysql is fine

7890013
serializable	deserialization
bitset doesn t do serializable so you don t need to know
use serializable deserialization

7892503
wav	ogg
playing wav should be supported out of the box by the jre with the help of the classes in javax.sound.sampled it jsut requires some code to wire it up not too sure about android
playing ogg is not supported out of the box

7892566
stateless	stateful
if you re communicating using a web service it should preferrably be stateless that is you should always send any context information the service implementation needs in the request
while technologies that let you implement stateful web services exist they d likely make things more complicated not less

7892772
svg	vml
ie8 and earlier does not provide either svg or canvas on which all the charting libraries are based
it does provide vml which is similar to svg

7892942
google-chrome	firefox
i ve had exactly the same problem though not in google-chrome although i didn t actually test with google-chrome
on certain browsers and i cannot remember which ones offhand - but it was either in ie or firefox any content that is added into the dom by javascript is not printed

7893153
opencv	emgucv
i have not used emgucv but i have used opencv for a while now
from sharpercv s website the emgucv cv.net wrapper is our current recommendation if you want to use opencv

7895640
oncreate	setcontentview
to be more clear your oncreate method should look like
your layout variable is not the same as the layout you used in setcontentview

7896584
innodb	myisam
innodb does not support hash keys only btree
myisam is infamous for being unreliable

7897720
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
since the textview s onclicklistener is set the onitemclicklistener will not be called
when you set the onitemclicklistener the event onitemclicked will only be called if the child of the listview does not have the onclicklistener set

7897720
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
when you set the onitemclicklistener the event onitemclicked will only be called if the child of the listview does not have the onclicklistener set
setting clickable to true will provide the child view in this case your textview with an empty onclicklistener

7899971
intersect	contains
this approach speeds up the search by eliminating checks of those sets which do not intersect d at all
you can extend the idea to eliminate even more checks by using an index from two-word sets to lists of sets contains both words

7900470
setinterval	settimeout
1 year latter your method called by setinterval will execute at 00 00 + some milliseconds because you may not be the only one asking for the processors to do things at this exact moment and the os timers have granularity anyway
but your settimeout method will occur latter maybe around 00 01 because each day it would have been called a little after the requested time and requested to be called the next day at the same time.

7900698
dictionary	map
firstly you need to store the available combinations and then we make a dictionary of the combinations mapped to the right key character that produces them some variables to keep track a printing function and the logic the logic basically checks to make sure our keymap contains the keycode in question
if we re not tracking anything or if it s different to the one we re currently tracking use that particular map and the first index

7901066
gmail	hotmail
these articles describe the two ways to do it css and table sending html mail with images not displaying in gmail i think it can be helpful for your problem
see these articles related to hotmail and outlook it might be helpful also after reading the code of the snippet you re using it seems correct to see the image in attachment due to this line email.attach img see the first comment of the snippet it shows how to use it using css not a table

7905390
comparator	comparable
so the call looks like this this works for anything that implements comparator so numbers strings and anything that inherit from comparator hope this helps took me ages to work this one out
here s how i do it with linq and i comparable might not be the best but works for me and it s test framework independent

7906026
kerberos	ldap
for that you might be better off just staying completely within ldap and don t venture into the kerberos
kerberos gives you advantage of single sign on but since your android app doesn t have any credentials already in place it doesn t really help you

7909470
ssl	https
now for each application that you create within your site for example your www.mywebsite.com newapplication you can explicitly configure if it requires ssl or not by checking the require ssl option under the ssl settings visible in iis management console when the application is selected
start by configuring iis to accept both http 80 and https 443 traffic

7910191
trie	tree
if instead of single and unique ip u need to ban ip ranges probably you need a patricia trie also called radix tree they were invented for word dictionaries and for ip dictionaries. however these tree can be slower if not well written balanced. hashtable are always better for simple lookups
they are too fast to be real now about synchronization if you are filling the black list only once at application startup you can use a plain read only hashtable or radix tree that don t have problems about multithreading and locking

7911261
prepare	execute
if you re coming from a sql client programming language java php c# etc these would usually represent parameters in a prepare statement though i m not sure if digit only placeholders are valid
update this can also appear in dynamic sql execute using an open-for-using statement

7912325
serializable	deserialization
this means that at serializable time this assembly had no strong name
now if you recompile this assembly sign it using a strong name and redeploy it inplace without chaning the serialized data the assembly identity will not be considered the same and the deserialization code will not be able to use it for deserialization hence the error

7912325
serializable	deserialization
now if you recompile this assembly sign it using a strong name and redeploy it inplace without chaning the serializable data the assembly identity will not be considered the same and the deserialization code will not be able to use it for deserialization hence the error
assemblies used for serialization and deserialization must have the same full name at least with the formatter and the binder you use

7913360
textmate	sublimetext
i ve not used textmate so i m not sure how they accomplish it however you could either write a plugin for sublimetext 2 to accomplish this
it s pretty easy to write a plugin in sublimetext 2 and the site has some good documentation

7915049
operands	scalar
that is not the correct answer except where noted the order of evaluation of operands of individual operators and subexpressions of individual expressions and the order in which side effects take place is unspecified
between the previous and next sequence point a scalar object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression

7919609
innodb	myisam
innodb has constraints on foreign keys which ensure you are not breaking the database model when doing a migration
see myisam does not have native support for constraints although it seems you can implement this if you choose to do do because myisam is not checking your fk relationships you do not get the error

7920413
pthreads	fork
this will work fine as long as you don t want to use any third-party libraries that use pthreads the second option is much easier and somewhat portable but only works well if you have access to all the source code of your entire application and can modify it to use your wrappers properly
the other threads in the current process aren t killed by a fork -- they re still there and running in the parent

7920894
client-side	server-side
but i am not sure if it will shrink data which goes from server-side rather than client-side
2- another suggestion is getting from shortened value from server-side backing bean

7922208
implements	extends
popupwrapper only adds focusmanager to the component if it implements ifocusmanagercontainer
my component was extends skinnablecomponent thus did not receive any focus

7923490
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is not the corresponding safer version of strcpy
if the target array is too big strncpy will pad it with null characters

7923617
textmate	sublimetext
that being said 2.0 has been promised for years now without delivery which has caused a lot of disgruntlement in the textmate community
i would also check out sublimetext editor on osx if i were in youre shoes and making this choice not as many people using it but heard very good things

7925282
apache	nginx
this webserver is extremely lean and as a result it s faster than apache and iis the down side is that the configuration is a bit more complex
when it doesn t matter which language and which platform my advice is to look at the nginx pronounced engine-x webserver

7925860
super	self
so before you call super s initializer it s not safe to overwrite instance variables but it s ok to use normal stack variables or even global variables
you can do something like this when your methods are entered even init s then self is always set

7926220
expression-blend	silverlight
essentially expression-blend gives you automated xaml generation of the fancier graphics that visual studio doesn t
you ll also find that it will guide you towards mvvm pattern wpf silverlight

7926620
implements	extends
make your panel implements iheadercontributor and use iheaderresponse.renderondomreadyjavscript
if you really can t give the tag a wicket id i ll assume you don t have a basepage that every or almost every other page extends in which to abstract this it ll be not possible to know at page render time when that tag is rendered what class to append to it it will be simply copied as is from your html to the output

7927730
lisp	scheme
it s not lisp in that it s not based around cons-cells but it shows clear influences from languages like scheme with a straight-forward and attractive syntax
like scheme at least in it s earlier incarnations it tends towards minimal but does a good job of balancing that with usability

7929158
icmp	udp
this will give you perfect write-level flow control but probably isn t necessary since again udp will just drop your packets sometimes and on networks without the ability to properly process icmp source quench messages which dumb firewalls configured to block icmp will just block dropped packets are your only source of flow control information
i m not saying that you shouldn t fix this bug in twisted for real but this fact of life in the udp world is the likely reason that nobody has bothered to do so yet

7929287
dbcontext	objectcontext
this data are not accessible through dbcontext api
you must convert dbcontext back to objectcontext and access the metadataworkspace

7933695
kerberos	ntlm
mod_auth_kerb this is an apache module that implements kerberos
mod_auth_sspi this is an apache module for windows that supports the original ntlm not ntlmv2

7933813
xsl-fo	xslt
if you relax the above requirement somewhat you ll probably agree that xsl-fo is the best choice
you definitely do not need to write custom fo s for every file write an xslt just once and use it on-the-fly to convert your xml to xsl-fo and then use a rendering engine to process xsl-fo to pdf

7933961
hex	binary
a hex editor will not be able to do the same easily at least
the de facto tool for doing this and all other forms of binary manipulation is interactive disassembler better known as ida comes with a cool free trial

7934956
rspec	capybara
here s an idea the final step here you would use like this i would actually use rspec personally i find the syntax less clumsy
i wouldn t use capybara to test a remote api because capybara is made for testing applications is used for testing applications with a html ui as aslak points out in the comments

7935724
division	multiplication
first of all multiplication is faster than division
so if you have to write it is better to write . your compiler is usually smart enough to replace division with multiplication on constants if the results is the same but it will not do that with variables of course

7935724
division	multiplication
so if you have to write it is better to write . your compiler is usually smart enough to replace division with multiplication on constants if the results is the same but it will not do that with variables of course
sometimes you can optimize a bit by replacing divisions with multiplication but there may be problems with precision

7937638
ubuntu	linux
nb the advices above are not specific to ubuntu 11.10 they could apply to other linux distributions and other ubuntu versions
you don t need an ide to code in c or c++ on ubuntu

7942684
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this is because mfmailcomposeviewcontroller isn t a subclass of uiviewcontroller but of uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller throws an exception when you re attempting to push a uinavigationcontroller or subclass of uinavigationcontroller onto an existing stack

7942790
cfstring	nsstring
you re being told that setstringvalue was sent to an nsstring cfstring object
this means that the pointer in label is not an nstextfield but is instead an nsstring

7945116
equals	compareto
redefine equals instead of compareto if you want perform search operations
by default indexof compares using equals operation and in your case equals not redefined that means you have comparison by references

7945187
prepare	execute
following is an snippet of my glassfish domain configuration file domain.xml where a connection pool galleriapool is used by a jndi datasource jdbc galleriads that is eventually used by the jdbc realm galleriarealm update #2 - getting the sql statements execute by the jdbc realm against derby it looks like the structure of the sql query does not match the database model that you ve prepare
you could take a look at the sql statements execute by the jdbc realm against the derby instance via the derby.language.logstatementtext system property

7948320
move	drag
the best method i have found is to select the items that you want to move select the cut item from the edit menu or context menu select the folder that you want to move them to and select the paste item from the edit menu
i have found that drag and drop is not always reliable and i have the same issue in visual studio

7948533
bash	zsh
1 actually getopts in ksh93 supports long-named options but this shell isn t used as often as bash
in zsh use zparseopts to get this functionality

7948631
single-quotes	double-quotes
you could wrap your string in single-quotes instead escaping the existing single-quotes in the text with a backslash or you cou could instead escape the with a backslash so that it s not interpreted
when you use double-quotes any in the text will be replaced with their current value

7948986
sudo	passwd
sudo chmod 0755 data db sudo chown -r 498 496 data db # using the user-id group-id you can also use the user-name and group-name as follows they can be found in etc passwd and etc group sudo chown -r mongod mongod data db that should make it work
in the comments below some people used this sudo chown -r id -u data db sudo chmod -r go+w data db or the disadvantage is that user is an account which has a login shell. daemons should ideally not have a shell for security reasons that s why you see bin false in the grep of the passwd file above

7949306
super	implements
subclassing should call super for properties defined by the superclass
for example do not try to return yes for properties implements by calayer doing will have undefined results. you need to set the view s content mode to uiviewcontentmoderedraw uiviewcontentmoderedraw redraw on bounds change calls -setneedsdisplay check out apple s documentation on providing content with calayer s

7949571
udp	tcp
tcp 25 would usually reveal a smtp server whereas udp 25 would not
quite simply if you need connection reliability ensuring that every byte of data transmitted is received you should be using tcp regardless

7949597
ienumerable	ilist
in your case if you have an ilist and you want to force chunk partitioning you can just make it look like a simple ienumerable instead of writing this list.asparallel ... write that the dummy projection will hide the fact that the source is actually an ilist so plinq will use chunk partitioning
from what i understand plinq will choose range or chunk partitioning depending on whether the source sequence is an ilist or not

7950281
g++	gcc
another thing to try is to pass the full path and filename for the library as an input file to g++ with no options - gcc will figure out that it s a library file and a lib directory search will not be done for it
so assuming that you have mingw installed in c dev mingw the command line should look like g++ -o test -lc dev mingw testboost.cpp c dev mingw lib libboost_regex.a if that works then you have a problem with the wrong library being found and you need to fix your build script build configuration or you ll continue to have problems down the road

7950495
opera	safari
i m not sure about opera or ie but there is a compatibility list which may or may not be accurate you can try to patch your own version in with something like this but check if function.prototype.bind is there first
older versions of safari don t support bind

7950612
updatepanel	scriptmanager
try to define a trigger for your linkbutton otherwise hasfiles is always false if you cannot remove the updatepanel from the masterpage you could expose a property on the masterpage that gives access the updatepanel like this from the contentpage you can access the updatepanel and update the triggers programmatically
you could also use the scriptmanagerproxy class if you need a scriptmanager on your content page but i m not sure whether you need this at all

7953467
profiling	debugging
i used eqatec quite some time ago for only a short period of time so can t objectively compare the feature set but for me the built-in profiling does the job and is exactly what i was long waiting for
you can check if you have the profiling installed by checking if you have start windows phone performance analysis not start performance analysis in your debugging menu

7953792
shadowing	named
this shadowing with later mentions of the same member is well-defined in the standard
struct literals with default values that are not zero using c99 variadic macros using uses the default values except for the explicit override of named

7955050
junit	testng
you don t actually need to write an after method here as junit creates a new instance on each method run so your method just adds code that will be done anyway
note this isn t the case with testng

7957543
crossover	mutation
the important thing about crossover to work effectively is that a few properties should be fulfilled the crossover should conserve those parts that are similar in both for those parts that are not similar the crossover should not introduce an element that is not already part of one of the parents the crossover of two solutions should if possible produce a feasible solution you want to avoid so called unwanted mutation in your crossovers
in that light you also want to avoid having to repair a large part of your chromosomes after crossover since that is also introducing unwanted mutation

7961663
lxml	libxml2
you should then be able to use lxml.etree this way i notice though that the lxml static build process does not produce a working universal build
you ll probably see messages like this during the lxml install ld warning ignoring file private tmp easy_install-83mjsv lxml-2.3.1 build tmp libxml2 lib libxslt.a file was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked i386 assuming the default architecture on your machine is 64-bits if you try to run in 32-bit mode and there is the error message you originally reported

7961663
lxml	libxml2
you ll probably see messages like this during the lxml install ld warning ignoring file private tmp easy_install-83mjsv lxml-2.3.1 build tmp libxml2 lib libxslt.a file was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked i386 assuming the default architecture on your machine is 64-bits if you try to run in 32-bit mode and there is the error message you originally reported
so the root cause of that appears to be that the static libraries libxml2 etc that lxml builds are not universal

7961663
lxml	libxml2
so the root cause of that appears to be that the static libraries libxml2 etc that lxml builds are not universal
as long as you have no need to use lxml in a 32-bit process unlikely for most uses this should not be a problem

7962381
fgets	fread
i d rather pass the to read from as the parameter so you d use the same code to read from stdin or from other arbitrary files finally i d note that if you re just going to copy an entire file fgets probably is not the most efficient way to do the job
fread may be more suitable

7965875
hmac	md5
then you can calculate the hmac code of the message for example with on the other end you can then check this signature by first splitting with getting message and hmac then you can check authenticity with if codes match then check if the timestamp in the is still within the limits
you shouldn t use plain md5 that

7965902
persistent	transient
but framework like seam 2 for java ee 5 or cdi extension like seam3 persistent in java ee 6 gives you possibilities to manage those special use cases
so when a cdi bean is serialized passivation of a sfsb the entitymanager is considered as transient and is not

7968119
org.json	gson
you re talking about using map objects but if you are going to do that you may as well us the org.json objects like jsonobject which are basically built on maps hashtables anyway
since the month data are not valid java identifiers you ll probably have to use custom serialization with gson

7968362
cdr	cons
what we want is a list consisting of cdr x with car x appended to the end
the one trick here is that car x isn t a list so we want to convert it to a list before appending it define first-to-last x append cdr x list car x if you wanted to stick to the fundamentals cons is the really fundamental way to put things together into lists but it would be a bit more work

7968362
cdr	cons
the one trick here is that car x isn t a list so we want to convert it to a list before appending it define first-to-last x append cdr x list car x if you wanted to stick to the fundamentals cons is the really fundamental way to put things together into lists but it would be a bit more work
you d basically end up defining something essentially identical to append in terms of cons

7969807
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
firefox msie starting with version 9 opera konq and google-chrome support
msie8 and safari not support

7970036
boost	allocator
if you have c++11 boost you can use is_pod to check that this assumption is correct and produce an error if it s not although boost is unable to determine if a type is pod without c++11 or some other compiler extensions
malloc returns null if allocator fails

7971101
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
as wikipedia says mp3 is a patented digital audio encoding format using a form of lossy data compression this stackoverflow question suggests that you should use wav or ogg support on android and offers an alternative way of playing mp3s
the soundpool api docs do imply mp3 support so i m not sure what is going wrong here

7971101
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
the soundpool api docs do imply mp3 support so i m not sure what is going wrong here
i suggest you try testing with some other mp3 files and also test converting your existing mp3 to wav ogg formats to test that too

7971172
inline	inlining
by default it doesn t optimize when running in a debugger but optimizes and thus inline the method when not running in a debugger
i m not sure if a debug build has an effect on inlining

7971280
google-chrome	firefox
a simple way to do this although perhaps not quite as dynamic as you would like is to use firebug s console or similar in google-chrome ie9 etc.
after loading a page containing a jquery reference in firefox go to firebug s console tab and paste this

7974735
apache	nginx
apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests
the drawback is that nginx doesn t handle the php requests and for that the apache is installed too - nginx will send all the php calls to the apache so it will handle them and return the response back to nginx and back to the client

7974735
apache	nginx
the drawback is that nginx doesn t handle the php requests and for that the apache is installed too - nginx will send all the php calls to the apache so it will handle them and return the response back to nginx and back to the client
if in that setup which is quite common you will put css js files under javascript you will lose the advantage of the nginx which instead of handling the static js css files on its own it will send them to the apache as it ll address them as php pages

7979502
igraph	networkx
if not there are other solutions here and here which may consume less memory benchmark and see i think igraph is fully c backed so it will but you may miss the pythonic feel of nx
the fact that networkx is mostly written in python does not mean that it is not scalable nor claims perfection

7980651
implements	extends
an enum is a special type of class so you can declare constructors fields and methods as well as implements interfaces
however they can not extends other classes

7982503
google-chrome	firefox
it was indeed security related which works if the external css is in the same directory for firefox but does not work for google-chrome
if css file is in another directory or online it will not work in firefox as well

7983696
floating-point	fractions
the general problem one encounters in javascript is how to do math as if they re not floating-point
thus in an expression like yours if the numerator is not evenly divisible by 100 you ll get a value with a fractions part

7985979
set	bag
my guess is that you are setting the css property in the markup which would mean that the value is getting set each time the page is rendered so viewstate would not come into play anyway
you are free to use the viewstate bag during the lifecyle of your page even if viewstate is disabled disabling viewstate does not render the page.viewstate property inoperable

7986794
actionscript	mxml
you might consider creating a skin in pure actionscript based off the viewnavigatorskin source code such that you can place it with your offset.
but if you aren t noticing a huge performance hit from the mxml skin i wouldn t worry about it

7987601
implements	extends
i did not have to write a serde after all wrote a custom inputformat extends org.apache.hadoop.mapred.textinputformat which returns a custom recordreader implements
the recordreader implements logic to read and parse my files and returns tab delimited rows

7988462
google-chrome	firefox
everything runs quickly in google-chrome
everything runs pretty fast thought not as fast as google-chrome in firefox

7989750
persistent	transient
according to the javadocs merge string entityname object object - copy the state of the given object onto the persistent object with the same identifier
save object object - persist the given transient instance first assigning a generated identifier i think merge requires an already-persisted entity which is why merge flush isn t giving you one

multiplying	subtract
i m just not certain that multiplying by seven counts as one of those cases
for a start multiplying x by 7 or shifting x three bits left then subtract x is an operation that can be done entirely inside the cpu

7991662
boost	allocator
initial idea looking at the source it seems you can use your own allocator which is then used by the internal stream internal_streambuf_t of boost format
for example you could use something like the libstdc++ array_allocator unfortunately boost format also uses a couple of std vector which do not use the custom allocator which may be a problem in your case

7991662
boost	allocator
for example you could use something like the libstdc++ array_allocator unfortunately boost format also uses a couple of std vector which do not use the custom allocator which may be a problem in your case
so even if you can find the location of the result string when using a custom allocator it is only available after during a call to str . this should explain why it is not possible the formatted result is never stored inside an output buffer in the class

7992414
persistent	transient
persistent is to make a transient entity a new one not in the database yet with no generated id persistent
hibernate and jpa automatically make persistent all the modifications made to persistent entities while they are attached to the session

7993815
implements	extends
i guess you d rather like employee to be a personal and thus it should look like this so to summarize is-a means a class object extends another class or implements an interface a is-a b if a extends b or a implements b has-a means that a class object has a variable of that type like contact contact in your employee class which means employee has-a contact
well since employee doesn t extends personal it has a personal and a contact

7998603
spaces	linefeed
to output an enter followed by y you may try this don t insert spaces in
if that not works would be because the linefeed characters that are inserted both after the first enter and after the y

7999821
gif	png
about the questions images should not be used much and no transparent images should be used you can use transparent gif they are somewhat supported
transparent png however not

8001913
uiview	calayer
uiview s animation methods as i used above can only animate certain properties
to animate properties of the calayer you must use core animation classes and methods not uiview s

8004800
inline	inlining
the c# compiler doesn t inline and the jit only does it a little bit so you need to inline by-hand
method calls includes things like the + and operators you might use on vectors - inlining these will improve performance

8006703
subtract	addition
now to only detect the period it is not necessary to subtract the mean
if you just leave the samples as-is the suqared mean will be added at each addition

8006832
accelerometer	gyroscope
on some devices they are implemented in h w on some devices they use the accelerometer + the magnetometer on some other devices they use the gyro
on nexus s and xoom the gyroscope is currently not used

8006930
imperative	declarative
declarative when you can though imperative has some value at some points in a project lifecycle
imperative is an easier way to think for testers and business analysts who aren t as familiar with information theory and design

8008619
ubuntu	linux
explanation the default shell on ubuntu is dash not bash
this is a rather limited but therefore fast shell that is unfortunately not available on all linux platforms

8009302
scheme	racket
i believe that the best tutorial on macros is still kent dybvig s writing hygenic macros in scheme with syntax-case
it s not specifically about racket but basically everything will carry over and reading the guide that chris mentioned above will cover any remaining differences

8010647
google-chrome	firefox
i have the same thing - and i read from the google-chrome help site that elements on the site are not encrypted - like videos
i looked via firefox - right click- view page info- media tab and saw that every time i use a youtube video in my video player i have plain http addresses like and i think these non https links are causing the security message site-wide

8010766
backtracking	greedy
will not give up its match for backtracking
will match - it will still be zero or one greedy

8013359
onchange	onsubmit
it s likely that they worked around that bug by disallowing alert or confirm commands in the onchange call to allow the form to submit as expected
it turns out that it is only presence of an alert - or a confirm - during the input s onchange event that causes the form s onsubmit event to not fire

8016187
boxlayout	miglayout
for example boxlayout doesn t stretch components horizontally but instead adheres to the preferred width
you can either continue to use the panels with panels solution and constantly be fighting layout manager or you could use a 3rd party layout manager known as miglayout

8020322
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so my answer is it is because the sel s signature does not cannot change for nsmutablestring s that it is declared non-const
here are some nsstring creation alternatives which suggest a little more safety without copy cfstringcreatewithbytesnocopy cfstringcreatewithcstringnocopy cfstringcreatewithcharactersnocopy chances are good that the nsstring apis in question also use these

8020909
lisp	scheme
the fact that or looks like a function call is a feature of scheme lisp syntax but looks deceive
it s because this version of or evaluates all of its arguments since it s a function while the standard scheme or which is not a function but special syntax doesn t

8021206
innodb	myisam
if you like deleting stuff a lot innodb might not be for you
innodb is much much stricter than myisam

8022776
persistent	transient
like matt said in his comment to your question since those fields are marked as transient they are not persistent to the database and thus there s no way for you to query them
if you want to find or list by a transient property you ll need to write a closure to iterate over a list of objects with the transient property already set

8023606
equals	gethashcode
2 you don t override gethashcode to be consistent with equals or it s just not shown in your code excerpt 3 i recommend implementing
you already implemented equals rational so you don t need to add any additional methods

8023783
textview	imageview
so in stead of returning an imageview in build something like a relativelayout add both the imageview and the textview to it and return the layout
i m not sure if it s the best approach but i would try to return a layout which is an indirect subclass of view that encapsulates both the imageview containing the image and a textview with the overlaying text

8024428
rspec	capybara
turns out it s not a selenium-only feature and of course require capybara rspec and set in your spec_helper that should be all it takes to get capybara-webkit and rspec up and running
here s how to do this resources railscasts episode 257 request specs and capybara capybara-webkit on github installation make sure your gemfile includes capybara-webkit rspec-rails and database_cleaner you need database_cleaner because database transactions aren t compatible with rspec drivers besides rack test you must still use the js true flag in your tests

8024536
subtraction	modulo
the solution for unsigned integers is relatively straightforward as described in jack toole s answer and works by moving the implied conditional outside the subtraction so that we are always subtracting the smaller number from the larger one and are not comparing a potentially-wrapped value to zero this just leaves the question of signed integers
consider the following variation we can easily prove that this works by using modulo arithmetic

8024863
udp	tcp
tcp is faster for when using a few connections the important difference is that modern nics perform significant amounts of acceleration on tcp and not really that much for udp
this means there is more overhead to process each udp packet and as such they cannot compete unless you need to send to multiple recipients simultaneously

8026144
glut	glfw
opinionated note i prefer glfw over glut
it provides a nicer model and is still in active development unlike glut which has not been updated in a significantly long time

8028717
postgresql	mysql
the following query is tested on postgresql 9.0
mysql does not support window functions most other big rdbms do

8028787
uiview	calayer
you can add a separate uiview with 1 point height and gray background color to self.view and position it right below toscrollview
edit unless you have a good reason want to use some services of uiview which are not offered by calayer you should use calayer as mattdipasquale suggests

8029785
vb.net	vb6
vb.net and regular vb are vastly different
vb6 was the last release of vb6 that is not managed

8030503
google-chrome	firefox
i did not test this on google-chrome or ie but it does work flawlessly on firefox
incase there was anymore confusion over this for firefox the above referenced example of settimeout works perfectly

8031378
division	subtract
integer division can be carried out in linear time through repeated subtraction for 7 2 you can subtract 2 from 7 a total of 3 times so that s the quotient and the remainder modulo is 1
if you were to supply a dividend of 0 to an algorithm like that unless there were a mechanism in place to prevent it the algorithm would not halt you can subtract 0 from 42 an infinite number of times without ever getting anywhere

8032962
apache	nginx
based off your question and the comment you made above i d recommend going with apache
i cannot claim to be an expert with nginx or apache but do know that nginx is very well known for its super fast serving of static content

8037503
ssl	https
while i haven t got ssl i can attest that excel normally shouldn t ask you for authentication when using pass through authentication
my guess is that you will need to add the destination website with the https to your trusted zone in ie

8039597
openssl	m2crypto
my specific problem was that openssl and the m2crypto instances of key pairs were not in the same underlying format
thus creating keys with openssl and then trying to use m2crypto to use the keys was wrong

8041096
uiview	subviews
i personally wouldn t trust the ios structure to not have subviews already embedded in a uiview
you should double check that the subviews is of the correct type

8046509
union	distinct
1st alternative insert into x a b c x y select a b c max cast null as integer as x max cast null as integer as y from pqr where p_a is null group by a b c union select max a as a max b as b max c as c x y from pqr where p_a is not null group by x y
you could replace the group by a b c clause with a distinct in front of a in the select-list of the first part of the union

8047479
gitolite	gitosis
that means gitolite i won t even mention gitosis which is obsolete can establish restrictions on accessing a all repo writing only certain branches but you cannot limit read access to certain branch but it cannot prevent a user to access parts of a repo
however since gitolite v3 or g3 april 17th 2012 you can with vref rules prevent writing pushing to certain directories in addition of certain branches

8050352
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
also you ll need to do this on keypress not keydown note this works in firefox but this will not work in google-chrome and afaik there is no workaround
i ve not tested ie opera or safari

8050352
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
i ve not tested ie opera or safari
edit keydown does actually work and works in google-chrome and firefox

8051112
rtp	rtsp
one of the options though is when rtp streams are tunnelled through rtsp connection in which case all communication might be taking place through single tcp connection
rtsp stream does not carry video audio itself it provides a method to control independent rtp video and audio streams they are in turn independent one from another

8052462
client-side	server-side
it would have to match the same conventions for separating client-side code from server-side code
any server-side code would need to be executed on the server not in the browser

8053692
ireport	subreports
there is a known discomfort or a bug if you want to call it that way with jasper report not being able to set or use relative paths to your project resources subreports images etc especially if you are compiling the reports with the ireport designer tool
i am working with jasper report and ireport 4.1.1 and every time i compile the jrxml to a .jasper file my paths are absolute

8053786
dictionary	map
why not create a mutable map with all the integers in the dictionary as keys 1000000 ints in memory is roughly 3.8m from my measurements and pass through the document list only once where for each document you extract the integers and increment the respective count values in the map for which the integer is key
something like this the result is a map with its keys being a number in the dict and the value the number of times it appears in the document list this is oversimplified since i dont verify if the number exists in the dictionary although you only need to init the map with the values and then increment the value in the final map if it has that key

8055176
innodb	myisam
it doesn t work with innodb
if you are using myisam then you can create a compound primary key on a text field + auto increment field

8056313
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the final url after following all redirects is available in the responseurl attribute of a xmlhttprequest instance. this feature is new and only supported in firefox 32 stable in september 2014 ref and google-chrome 37.0.2031.0 stable in august 2014 ref and probably also opera 24
responseurl is not yet supported in ie 11 or safari 7 and older browsers

8058079
google-chrome	firefox
to create the google-chrome folder right click inside the .default folder select new folder type in without the quotes google-chrome 4 open the google-chrome folder and create a .text file named usercontent.css
the contents of this file tells firefox not to display +1 buttons on web pages. to create a text file named usercontent.css right click inside the google-chrome folder select new text document type in without the quotes usercontent.css windows will bring up rename warning dialogue box that says if you change a file name extension the file may become unusable

8059135
lisp	scheme
even if you re not ok with scheme you could surely fork the module to edit it to use your favorite lisp engine without too much trouble
it s not quite what you described but as moritz explained what you described is impossible because there s no way to know what parts of the code should be treated as perl code and which parts should be treated as lisp code

8059360
realloc	malloc
some variety of realloc trick might then work but i don t think realloc in particular because that s intended to be used on objects that are allocated with malloc and the details of what c function is used to allocate objects in not exposed in objective c so you shouldn t assume it s malloc
if you override alloc then you might be able to make sure malloc is used

8059421
division	subtraction
it does not matter whether you do that by arithmetic manipulation division and modulo by 10 or by converting the numbers into strings but fundamentally your question is precisely about the individual digits of the numbers
for the subtraction x minus

8059908
exponent	modulo
not the exponent
you can t encrypt your modulo because then you would have to crack the second envelope and would still get to your modulo which only shifts the problem to knowing the outer modulo

8061455
png	ico
another note in the above tutorial is the png compression is embedded in the ico file for the 256x256 images only
png compressed windows vista icons cannot be read and edited with an windows xp-only compatible icon editor nor can you open them with a png image editor

8061783
prepare	execute
prepare pdo statements are sql injection safe by design
however that s not true for execute and query - you should generally only use those two for hardcoded queries

8062363
listview	gridview
the market app is not using a listview it is using a gridview see the hello gridviewtutorial for more info
a gridview can use the same adapter as a listview but it will position items in a grid with multiple columns

8064166
udp	tcp	rtp	rtsp
when streaming to an android device using rtsp rtp the rtp portion must flow over udp
android does not support rtsp rtp interleaved rtp over tcp most android devices support rtsp rtp streaming

8066032
noexcept	throw
in c++11 is marked noexcept
any exceptions falling out of t could be caught by the implementation so that clear itself may not throw anything

8068245
move	drag
with more code you can actually prevent the typing of non-numeric keys and you can move the focus before the 3rd value is typed
there are ways to get data into fields that does not trigger onkeyup copy paste drag drop so you will have to validate at other times too

8068248
division	multiplication
the source code peephole.c contains the following comment that explains why constant division isn t folded the -qnew flag enables true division defined in pep 238
the somewhat unexpected reason for your results is that python seems to fold constant expressions involving floating-point multiplication and exponentiation but not division

8068271
punctuation	words
if the element is already in the document you can get its text content and split it based on if it s not already an element make it one note this doesn t take punctuation characters into account - you might want to remove some of them from the string with a simple regex before splitting
also if there is only a single words in the text last will be undefined

8068442
spaces	delimiter
you should use the getline function not the simple cin for cin only gets the string before white spaces
extracts characters from is and stores them into str until a delimiter character is found

8070711
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
the uploaded file is not magically present in the expanded war so reading it with fileinputstream won t work at all
you d have to read it from event.getfile .getinputstream and then write it to an arbitrary outputstream such as fileoutputstream

8074415
zlib	libpng
this resource is useful because it discussed in detail what always seems to be the problem for me--numpy and scipy are ok but matplotlib fails and it fails because of libpng libjpeg et al. some empirically likely causes of a failed install of numpy scipy matplotlib all unfortunately based on personal experience libpng freetype zlib all matplotlib dependencies
one possible source of problems but not the only source is caused by matplotlib versions above 1.0 which do not compile by default against libpng version 1.5 yet that that s the version a developer is likely to have on their mac because it s the version included with the x11 shipped with the 10.7 versions of xcode version 4.0 - 4.2

8076744
clang	llvm
which means - you can t immediately use a code generated by a stock c compiler llvm-gcc clang whatever unless you specify a limited target for it and implement sanitising llvm passes
another issue is that the bitcode format from different llvm versions is not guaranteed to be compatible

8080435
hex	binary
a hex character does not normally represent a specific decimal character
it represents 4 bits in a base 2 binary number system

8082487
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
a nullpointerexception is a runtime exception unchecked generally it s not declared not thrown and not documented
it could be generated by some component within your api that is not initialized or by null parameters in that second case it can make sense to translate it in a illegalargumentexception and i would document it

8084989
jar	manifest.mf
adding classes to the jar file s classpath
not to bother with -classpath parameter you could put references to the jar files into the manifest.mf of your application jar if it s you application of course

8086245
allocator	stl
that s the stl way. since your objects seem to imply that dynamic allocator goes on somewhere i would guess that a copy constructor assignment operator or destructor for one of your classes is not implemented properly
remember that stl containers make copies of the objects you put into them

8087981
prepare	execute
when using transactions when you want to issue select-style prepare statements and execute them but not retrieve the data until later when you don t need the closecursor statement if you have already fetched the rows as with stmt- fetch before your next statement is to be execute
at this point the rows are in a fetched state and frees up the driver to execute new statements

8088403
jar	war
but neither the war nor ejb depend on each other as they don t share anything directly only indirectly through the 3rd library jar
the lib jar is stand alone since it doesn t have any dependency on either the war or ejbs

8088403
jar	war
the lib jar is stand alone since it doesn t have any dependency on either the war or ejbs
note your ejb session bean interface classes will go in to the library jar since both tiers rely upon them

8088403
jar	war
the war has its own structure with the web-inf and all the ejb jar has its meta-inf and ejb-jar.xml
but of note is the that lib.jar is not in the web-inf lib directory it s in the ear bundle and thus shared by both the ejbs and the war using class loader chicanery that the container is responsible for

8093775
rar	zip
7-zip cannot create rar archives at all let alone in parts
all it can do is extract them also see the front page for that library supported formats packing unpacking 7z zip gzip bzip2 tar xz unpacking only arj cab chm cpio deb dmg hfs iso lzh lzma msi nsis rar rpm udf wim xar z xz and more

8097954
persistent	transient
this is not good in a long-running conversation with an extended session persistent context
persist is used on transient objects

8097954
persistent	transient
it makes a transient instances persistent
however it doesn t guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to the persistent instances immediately the assignment might happen at flush time.it also guarantees that it will not execute an insert statement if it is called outside of transaction boundaries

8098644
implements	extends
or a superclass might implements a new method that our subclassing doesn t meaning a user of our class could unintentionally bypass intended behavior by directly calling the superclass method so we have to track the superclass api to determine when and if the subclassing should change
nothing in that answer discourages extends arraylist

8099167
apache	nginx
nginx doesn t manage your backend processes like apache does so it can t affect their environments
to set a new php variable from nginx you need to add a new fastcgi_param entry along with the rest of them

8100906
pascal	delphi
you do not describe your pascal implementation of vincenty s earth ellipsoid model so the following is speculation the model makes use of numerous geometrical trig functions-- atan2 cos sin etc
depending whether you use internal delphi functions or your own versions there is the possibility of lack of precision in calculations

8102160
icollection	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
if there are to be no further queries and all the data will need to be read return an ilist icollection etc
it depends on whether you wish to have any future queries performed on the entity and whether these should be in memory or not if there are to be future queries and the db should do the work return iqueryable

8103829
cvs	svn
just a word of warning steer clear of cvs
svn subversion is good enough will be excellent for your project as it s not too difficult to get your head around it

8103931
apache	nginx
now back to the question my guess based on reading tests published here would be that the proper multi-thread apache architecture should scale better than nginx on multi-core cpus
paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .

8103931
apache	nginx
paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .
16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests performance is to be fast processing more requests per second on a single-core cpu scalability is the ability to process more requests per seconds as the number of cpu cores grows the ideal is to scale linearly doubling the requests per second as you double the number of cpu cores

8104843
punctuation	words
see words characters in the most recent perlrecharclass w matches a single alphanumeric character an alphabetic character or a decimal digit or a connecting punctuation character such as an underscore _
it does not match a whole words

8106898
profiling	debugging
i get a hard time from profiling fans because the method is so manual but they never talk about the speedup results. maybe that will change.
not sure about vs10 but in older ones you debugging the dll by specifying the exe for running it

8107069
punctuation	words
many writing systems use spaces or punctuation to explicitly separate words and line break opportunities can be identified by these characters
scripts such as thai lao and khmer however do not use spaces or punctuation to separate words

8107069
spaces	delimiter	punctuation	words
scripts such as thai lao and khmer however do not use spaces or punctuation to separate words
although the zero width space u+200b can be used as an explicit words delimiter in these scripts this practice is not common

8110145
allocator	stl
i think part of the question comes from an assumption that allocator are useful
allocator at least pre-c++11 were something of a late addition to the stl people wanted containers independent of the memory model which was somewhat excessive because the language doesn t include memory models

8110406
hex	binary
15 decimal f hex
i think you are making some confusions 104 decimal is 1101000 which is not formed by two groups splitting 104 into 10 and 4. the exception is for hex numbers that can be formed by two groups 4 binary numbers 2 4 16

8110603
prepare	execute
you can have cached prepare statements and after each execute clear parameters. for best performance you need use thread pool also not need create a new thread for each new request
i think you can create some pool of prepare statements and retrieving those by some key you can define keys for queries

8113456
persistent	transient
it has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned
transient instances will be destroyed by the garbage collector if the application does not hold a reference anymore

8113456
persistent	transient
hibernate will detect any changes made to an object in persistent state and synchronize the state with the database when the unit of work completes
developers do not execute manual update statements or delete statements when an object should be made transient

8113831
postgresql	mysql
mysql doesn t have recursive queries databases like postgresql sql server and oracle do have these types of queries
very powerful and easy to use but in mysql you re on your own

8115532
implements	extends
you can accomplish what you want by implements part of the functionality of automapper using reflection
it will be of very limited utility and the more you extends it the more like automapper it will be so i m not sure that there s any long term value to it

8116898
freebsd	debian
both freebsd and linux uses elf format for executable files but they have a different abi
freebsd can execute linux executable files using linux compatibility layer aka linuxulator but linux debian in your case does not support freebsd abi for elf

8117406
implements	extends
this is a common problem that i have accomplished a lot on in the launcher or main what android is calling an activity you do as little as possible which amounts to saving the the refs they give you and maybe setting a few other things as long as you are there and do not drop in to a long-running activity a service is exactly what you need but instead of trying to pump it into a hold on to it state what you do is implements checks for nulls and handle as needed -- trying to fix a machine to make it run the way you want here actually involves rescinding you hold on the main thread and letting it go as fast as consistent with the applicaton s general constraints
to do this you can simply write a service - reading everything available - then extends that service and implements runnable then you run the constructor on that code from the activity constructor and do new thead yourclass .start

8123449
client-side	server-side
i m not sure other frameworks are necessarily more friendly regarding design elements as the client-side styling is really independent of the server-side framework
you can easily plug in any front-end boilerplate framework to provide nicer styling whichever server-side framework you are using

8126447
postgresql	mysql
sqlite does not have a server-client architecture like mysql postgresql
you will probably want to move to mysql or postgresql if you want multiple computers to use the same database at once otherwise it will be the same as sharing a microsoft access database

8128295
subtraction	addition
null does not point to a valid object which is why you cannot use it in subtraction
i found this in the c++ standard 5.7 expr.add 7 if two pointers ... both are null and the two pointers are subtracted the result compares equal to the value 0 converted to the type std ptrdiff_t as others have said c99 requires addition subtraction between 2 pointers be of the same array object

8133582
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
and the documentation for the sortedset interface states note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equal

8133890
daemons	systemd
i think this is a better option than using curl as the daemons is also a custom socket interface curl will be most suitable for http request s but i think here the daemons is not an http one
its better that u can use the php socket library to connect with the daemons running in your systemd and then u can pass data to the daemons and can process the result sent back by the daemons

8139370
draggable	droppable
we were discussing similar issue in topic revert invalid with grid doesn t return to start position with jquery ui draggable and gregl offered workaround for this i think this is exactly your situation
you need to define drop handler in droppable

8141107
serializable	deserialization
java serializable simply punts on preserving object identity between different deserialization sessions
this problem is called eq in distributed computing and some systems do try to solve it but java deserialization does not

8141601
serializable	deserialization
a serializable class must have access to the no-arg constructor of its first nonserializable superclass
during deserialization the accessible default constructor is called for the first class in the inheritance hierarchy that does not implement serializable

8142508
memcached	apc
i would prefer the memcached method because memcached allows you to create a memcached cluster its easy to seperate your application server from caching servers for scaling thats a huge plus you seperate bytecache from user cache correct configurated very secure as its iptables is very reliable
one way could be use memcached instead of apc for your users bind your vhosts domains to own ips start memcached instances for your vhost vhost1 port 12345 vhost2 port 12346 add iptable rules that drop every packet on the specific memcached port which does not match your vhost ip for that port your problem seems to be that php runs as fastcgi so that every vhost will get the same php process to share their cache

8143223
udp	tcp
tcp is a bit slower than udp but more failsafe
since your game is turn based it will probably send minimal amounts of data between the client and server and it is not really latency dependant i would say you might aswell go for tcp

stringbuilder	stringwriter
it provides a stream-like syntax though does not derive from stream which works with an underlying stringbuilder
you can use a stringwriter to write values to a string

8144309
trie	tree
as you follow the tree toward leaves add letters to current string as in traversing within a trie and as you go back up away from leaves drop letters from end of current string
the data structure isn t precisely a ternary tree since the third branch is implicit the next entry after current entry

8145691
ssl	https
a proxy receiving a connect request and accepting it doesn t do any ssl tls initialisation or processing if it did it would be a potential mitm attacker
it merely relays all the traffic between the target https host and the initial client back and forth

8147575
uicontrol	uibutton
i m not completely sure if this snippet works for this particular case an uicontrol inside a uiscrollview but my understanding of uiresponder chain suggests me that it should if this works can t test it right now but it did work for me in a similar situation then you should add more code to handle the drag drop related events maybe disable clip subviews option in the uiscrollview add the button to the new superview if the location intersects with the cgrect of the destination return the button to the original location if it doesn t etc
when you begin touching the uibutton the order doesn t get to the uiscrollview because the event could follow as a touch event handled by the uibutton or as a pan event handled by the uiscrollview

8150161
jxtable	jtable
which is the reason it never made it into jxtable or maybe i had other priorities then -
its a long-standing bug on jtable reported in 2007 astonished that it isn t fixed not even in jdk7 firing a update on all rows is a reasonable quick fix if it doesn t degrade performance too much due to triggering frequent complete resorts

8151947
ssl	https
if ssl for all pages is not an option to you then you could use this approach switching between http and https pages with secure session-cookie
the idea behind is that you leave the session cookie unsecure and therefore available to http and https pages but have a second secure cookie to handle the authentication

8152641
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
note that user-select doesn t work in any browsers that i m aware of though the vendor prefixed versions will work in firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie 10+ if you use only these vendor-prefixes your css should validate if you set vendor extensions to warning
for ie and opera you can use the unselectable attribute on elements

8152743
base	fractions
and it stores them as binary floating point numbers -- that is relative to base 2 instead of base 10
a number with a finite representation as a decimal fractions doesn t necessarily have a finite representation as a binary number so it must be rounded to be stored in a finite computer

8153619
profiling	debugging
if you remove the profiling the crash will not happen
with this information it s not possible to say what causes the crash but you can try the following remove all -xx vm parameters -verbose gc and the debugging vm parameters

8153976
factories	presenter
and this indeed is injected with a session factories
however this isn t a controller in the presenter sense you re assuming it s a utility class to manage the currentcustomer in the user s session - it demonstrates the use of session scoped objects

8153976
mvp	presenter	factories	presenter
open session in view osiv is implemented as an http module and as such it does not require the session factories being injected on each and every page or page presenter if you apply mvp - it s just there in the http context
in your situation i assume services are injected onto your presenter

8154338
opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
it includes work-arounds for both internet explorer firefox safari and opera and the example above
the following example will show a colored background on #box in google-chrome and safari but not firefox and opera

8154834
implements	extends
the reason that you cannot capture the httpapplication.error etc has to do with how the resthandler has been implements by the good folks at microsoft
specifically the resthandler explicitly catches handles the exception and writes out the exception details to the response to make matters worse there is no clean extension point that i could find where you can change extends the behavior

8155127
client-side	server-side
found this post that deals with this problem add client-side onchange handler to asp.net checkbox control
the attribute oncheckedchanged requires a server-side event handler not a javascript function

8155674
ssl	https
ssl cannot solve the problem of sql injection or in your case insecure direct object reference relating to the user id
judging by this ssl suggestion you probably have never heard of tamperdata which allows you to read intercept and modify all https traffic generated by your browser including components like flash and javascript burp is more advanced but does the same thing

8156328
udp	tcp
however in parallel to tcp there s another transmission protocol that doesn t do any checking at all and has no reliability udp
udp is just a thin wrapper around raw ip packets which adds a little bit of meta data like a port number

8157408
udp	tcp
the first possible issue i can think of is that because udp doesn t have the overhead inherent in the transmission control that tcp does udp has higher data bandwidth and lower latency
so it is possible for a udp datagram that was sent after a tcp message to be available on the remote computer s input buffers before the tcp message is received in full

8158827
factors	mean
taken as a whole this approach can be a little tedious but it also is not hard and it can perform quite a bit better than dom parsing in some cases if that s something that is a factors for you app
a dom parser makes things much easier for things like this but it does mean a choosing a library that supports dom on ios figuring out how it works its idiosyncrasies etc and b having the whole xml document in memory before you parse it out and populate your table model

8159040
uiview	caanimation	uiview	calayer
if it is a swipe calculate how far long you want the view to rotate and wrap it in a uiview animation
if you find this not working you may need to go down to the calayer which is only slightly more complex and to animate it you will need to create a caanimation this might give you more information as for your adding removing colors by keeping track of how far the circle has rotated you should be able to calculate which color swatches you want to see

8159405
ssl	https
1 no you do not need to alter any code on your website at all in order to use an installed ssl certificate
it is as simple as prefixing your desired destination link with the https protocol specification instead of the typical http protocol

8159818
implements	extends
linq to entities does not know how to translate a method you wrote to sql since you implements it
i never used linq to entities but there must be a way to extends the expression tree builder to enable linq to entities to translate your method to sql linq to nhibernate has a way to do so

8161102
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
your application server jboss weblogic glassfish etc doesn t provide it because depend of the rdbms that you are using in this case mysql and the version of it
in the case of jboss 7 the jdbc driver can be installed into the container in one of two ways either as a deployment or as a core module

8161506
tortoisegit	svn
btw if you are learning git tortoisegit is not the place to start
imo it is meant for people comfortable with svn and tortoisesvn and to help them make a transition to git

8164953
portrait	landscape
so your layoutsubviews only getting called once with bounds.size returning dimensions indicating portrait and it doesn t get the second call
just do one thing set your xib orientation to landscape in xib design

8167312
portrait	landscape
if you want anything shown as customised then add overlay view on it transform that view to look as landscape view. note -overlay is also add as portrait thats why transformation needed
apple doesn t support landscape for camera view

8169811
dictionary	map
if you take a closer look at your input you have an dictionary key1 which contents is not single sendung but an array of such objects
thus you can t map contents of the key1 directly to sendung ivars rather than create new class eg sendungresult

8170479
implements	extends
eclipse does not offer such a component so you will have to implements one yourself
but i wouldn t extends text for this

8171090
calloc	malloc
the c99 spec at least in its final public draft states in j.1 unspecified behavior the following are unspecified ... the order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to the calloc malloc and realloc functions 7.20.3
so it would seem that malloc doesn t have to be deterministic

8171795
moq	moles
i would primarily use moq for most of my needs and try to write my code to be testable using a conventional framework
if however you get stuck in a situation where you cannot easily isolate your code for various unit tests i d use moles for those situations

8172460
octal	hex
permission modes need to be specified in octal not hexadecimal
0x660 hex 03140 octal

8173799
google-chrome	safari
this is best demonstrated with a diagram like in the following taken from google-chrome and chromium provide an interval that averages just over 41 milliseconds enough of a difference for the second clock to be visibly slower in well under a minute
safari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not great

8174473
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
here is the sample code may layout xml not complete one.... now to handle click events all i had to do was to add onclicklistener in my adapter that s it
problem is i could not get my onitemclicklistener working for this listview

8174496
awt	swing
android does not support swing awt or any of that - it has its own gui layer
at least out of the box it does not although i can theoretically envision an awt implementation over the android library

8175181
touchesmoved	touchesended
a possible approach is identifying in touchesmoved which subview is currently under the touch which the touch location is in and change its status accordingly
touchesbegan and touchesended would not play a major role in this

8175289
implements	extends
so you have a couple of options create a base model that implements the functionality you want and extends that with your various models this way you only do it once add the functionality to each model not dry overwrite the core files not ideal - it s only a few lines of code
you can t extends the active record class without modifying the core which really sucks

8177105
apache	nginx
polling tends to strain apache servers but there are some specialized servers to deal with it like ape
i m not sure but i think you can do the same with nodejs and nginx handles the stress pretty well

8181746
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
indexeddb has been over-engineered in my opinion and is not widely supported yet for all of mozilla s insistence that its better than sliced bread and websql s future is looking a bit uncertain as mozilla is refusing to implement it and it is no longer being worked on due to an impasse between w3c and the browser vendors who have actually implemented it google-chrome safari opera
there is currently a bit of a browser explosion happening thanks to smartphone adoption so its hard to determine how much of the market supports html5 localstorage features but using statcounter i ve been able to calculate that between google-chrome 4+ firefox 3.+ safari 4+ opera 10.5+ and ie 8+ including iphone and android devices you ll have captured around 80-85 of the market with this figure going upwards a rate of 1-2 per month

8182996
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a lot more advanced when it comes to sql features
things that mysql still doesn t have and postgresql has deferrable constraints check constraints full outer join mysql silently uses an inner join with some syntax variations the sqlfiddle was created using mysql 5.5.32 lateral joins regular expressions don t work with utf-8 fixed with mysql 8.0 regular expressions don t support replace or substring introduced with mysql 8.0 table functions common table expressions introduced with mysql 8.0 recursive queries introduced with mysql 8.0 writeable ctes window functions introduced with mysql 8.0 function based index partial index full text search on transactional tables mysql 5.6 supports this gis features on transactional tables except or intersect operator you cannot use a temporary table twice in the same select statement you cannot use the table being changed update delete insert in a sub-select you cannot create a view that uses a derived table possible since mysql 8.0 statement level read consistency

8185717
udp	tcp
from a paper it seems that tls can t handle udp whereas sip doesn t require anyone to use tcp alone
tls is working on tcp level so tls requires to use sip over tcp

8186762
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
first of all you should be aware that cors is supported by the following browsers internet explorer 8+ firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ and google-chrome
please note that ie7 and older versions of firefox and safari doesn t support it at all

8188580
firefox	safari
this usually happens with firefox
in chrome and safari i have not yet noticed getcurrentposition timing out

8188612
lxml	beautifulsoup
this answer refers to an older version of the question where beautifulsoup has not been mentioned you can use lxml and iterate over all elements asking them for the value of their class attribute
lxml is a library for parsing xml documents

8190941
rtp	rtcp
as a consequence that means that the udp client application needs to be prepared for a lot of awful things including packets not received at all packets delayed packets out of order packet bursts for real time communication applications rtp has been developed in order to cope with those issues see rtp
in addition to that - and to gain more control about the communication line rtcp has been developed also rfc 3605

8190986
persistent	transient
it has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned
transient instances will be destroyed by the garbage collector if the application does not hold a reference anymore

8190986
persistent	transient
hibernate will detect any changes made to an object in persistent state and synchronize the state with the database when the unit of work completes
developers do not execute manual update statements or delete statements when an object should be made transient

8193350
n-gram	words
there is a routine that will give you n-gram it is sliding
with the brown fox brown fox jumps fox jumps over jumps over the over the lazy the lazy dog there is a caveat if you have only p words and want n-gram with n p sliding will return one p-gram not an n-gram obviously rather than none

8195851
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
master prepareforsegue detail viewdidload master viewwilldisappear detail viewwillappear the new view is displayed with or without animation master viewdiddisappear after animation is finished detail viewdidappear however when switching between views using a uitabviewcontroller the order is different secondtab viewdidload secondtab viewwillappear firsttab viewwilldisappear the new view is displayed
firsttab viewdiddisappear secondtab viewdidappear so it seems that you cannot always count on these events occuring in the same order - it can vary depending on the nature of the view controllers you are transitioning between

8196334
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
note that the arguments about hard debugging are bogus because you can of course provide a message to nullpointerexception saying what was null and why it shouldn t be null
just like with illegalargumentexception

8197557
gson	jackson
as i ve said in the past in another related so question i ve gotten huge performance gains when working with large sets of json by simply switching to jackson from gson
gson is really simple to use and if performance isn t an issue it s quite nice

8197557
gson	jackson
gson is really simple to use and if performance isn t an issue it s quite nice
jackson is much much faster though and is not really that much more effort to use

8197914
implements	extends
another reason not to have your gui class implements listener interfaces
the best solution is not to do this but instead to use an anonymous inner class that extends mouseadapter or a private inner class that does the same

8198276
bazaar	git
these systems cvs subversion perforce bazaar and so on think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time git doesn t think of or store its data this way
instead git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem

8200728
apache	nginx
with nginx you do not need to remap exactly the way you did it in apache
to test a file is not a static file or directory before applying a rule in nginx the real simple way is not a multi-if like you did but a try_file directive check if file exists in pitfall page

8200911
centos	linux
centos 6 epel6 has 0.10.x which isn t supported upstream since oct 2016
some linux distributions such as arch linux have node.js in their package repositories

8201033
google-chrome	firefox
the display inline-block is not needed in firefox but without it in opera and google-chrome the so don t follows a linebreak and even overlaps the container
i came with up with this poorly the clearing of the text-decoration only works in firefox and opera with this code

8201047
base	fractions
i just made that up but you get the idea - essentially the number is represented as a sum of fractions of 2 - since binary is base 2 - so something like .5 or .25 can likely be represented exactly but most other numbers will be represented as an approximation
you typically don t notice this because float print routines will convert back to base 10 for display which essentially introduces another inexactness that ends up cancelling out the first one so what you see as the assigned value or the printed out value are not exactly the value of the representation as stored in memory

8201051
rpm	yum
with the rpm command you need to know the exact location of the .rpm package but with yum you just need to know the name of it and as long as it s available through your repositories list it will be installed along with its dependencies
to expand on the udo s answer there is the program rpm which manipulates specifically the packages it is asked to manipulate and there is yum which is a more intelligent management system that can find dependencies and download .rpm files even if they re not in the system

8201611
listview	gridview
also you can use controls those don t rendering with default layout like repeater or listview
the problem is that gridview control doesn t add element but just put the header row into section of generated table whereas the data table plugin requires a section in a table

8202513
cdr	cons
for instance when you do this define lst 4 5 under the hood this is what gets assigned to lst cons 4 cons 5 so when you evaluate cdr lst you get the second element of the first cons which happens to be cons 5 which in turn gets printed as 5
for extracting only the second element in the list not the second element of the first cons which is what cdr does you could as has been pointed in the comments use car cdr lst or just cadr lst for short even simpler use second lst another possibility - if the list only has two elements and it s ok to replace it with an improper list use define cell cons 4 5 or define cell 4

8203233
config	ini
run your phpinfo and check if extension is loaded if not check config file php.ini path and loaded config file to see where it is looking for php.ini and which file is loaded
if it is correct set display_startup_errors in your ini to on and look into apache error log to see if there are problems with loading some extension

8203989
udp	tcp
the problem with this is that a udp packet has a limited size and could get fragmented if too large and while large packets may work on your lan they could get fragmented over the internet
as udp doesn t provide ordering guarantees like tcp the fragments could come in the wrong order without the qdatastream header

8205192
memcpy	memmove
a memmove function written entirely in portable c would on many platforms probably take at least twice as long to execute as would a memcpy also written entirely in portable c. implementations are allowed to expand functions in-line when doing so would not alter their semantics
on an 80x86 compiler if the esi and edi registers don t happen to hold anything important a memcpy src dest 1234 could generate code mov esi src mov edi dest mov ecx 1234 4

8211288
client-side	server-side
if the traffic varies a lot say sometimes a few queries per hour other times hundreds per minute client-side makes sure that a central server is not over-loaded by this effort server-side infrastructure will not be needed and so will not cost the provider money
server-side advantages servers can be setup up with infinitely more power then desktop machines and so can crunch the big numbers

8211475
junit	cactus
but this is for junit 3 not junit 4 so it seems to be pretty out of date
the other alternatives you have come from how perform junit tests with struts - ibatis which suggest httpunit again pretty old or cactus which has been retired

8212611
requestfactory	gwt
otherwise it mostly saves you from writing jsni on declare methods in an interface and possibly annotate them with propertyname the answer wouldn t be complete if it didn t mention jsonprequestbuilder there s also requestfactory with jsonrpcservice but it s about json-rpc not quite restful and is still experimentatl
there are two approaches autobeans js overlay types use js overlay types to make your js objects available to java gwt code and jsonutils to parse json to your overlay types

8213381
innodb	myisam
this only works in innodb
what s a covering index a covering index refers to the case when all fields selected in a query are covered by an index in that case innodb not myisam will never read the data in the table but only use the data in the index significantly speeding up the select

8213381
innodb	myisam
what s a covering index a covering index refers to the case when all fields selected in a query are covered by an index in that case innodb not myisam will never read the data in the table but only use the data in the index significantly speeding up the select
note that in innodb the primary key is included in all secondary indexes so in a way all secondary indexes are compound indexes

8213500
innodb	myisam
this is a question i hear a lot and there is a lot of confusion around the issues due to the differences in mysql over the years. indexes and multiple index support changed over the years towards being supported the innodb myisam differences there are some key differences below but i do not believe multiple indexes are one of them myisam is older but proven
data in myisam tables is split between three different files for - table format data and indexes

8214398
mdpi	hdpi
for instance with your 15dp icon you should have a 12x12px image in a res drawable-ldpi folder ldpi is 75 of mdpi a 15x15px image in a res drawable-mdpi folder mdpi is the base a 23x23px image in a res drawable-hdpi folder hdpi is 150 of mdpi a 30x30px image in a res drawable-xhdpi folder xhdpi is 200 of mdpi the application will grab the proper asset to match the resolution of the device you are running on
if you do not create an asset for each level the application will take the closest match and scale it up or down you are probably using an hdpi device to test and your 15px image was getting scaled up to 23px causing pixelation

8215007
division	exponent
2 is integer division so it will round down
so if you give it a number like 3 as an exponent it will not work correctly because 3 2 is 1

8216211
factors	matrix
but according to the zoo faq document warning pdf a zoo object may be 1 a numeric vector 2 a numeric matrix or 3 a factors but may not contain both a numeric vector and factors
when asked to read in a bunch of columns that contain both numeric character values converting everything to factors is the only way that read.zoo can produce an object fitting one of those three criteria

8217806
udp	tcp
dtls provides tls for datagram based protocols like udp
from a paper it seems that tls can t handle udp whereas sip doesn t require anyone to use tcp alone

8220966
bmp	png
but there s not one png nor one bmp
i can come tomorrow with a valid png sub format that would be perfectly fine but that no single png decoder out there would decode it would have to be validated and accepted but once it would be accepted it would break all the existing png decoders out there

8225322
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy has no idea of buffer sizes so it ll merrily run over the end of your target array and either corrupt your program s data or immediately crash
strncpy is a nice alternative with a maximum length parameter but it s not always available

8226024
config	ini
however if you your config is not meant to be edited by hand go with any format you like because ini is not the easiest one to parse
it depends on how the config file will be used

8227087
onkeyup	onkeydown
then in your onkeyup you can call event.istracking and event.islongpress to determine whether to handle things as a long press or short press
during onkeydown you do not know whether it is a long press or not because that is called as soon as the key is pressed and you do not know how long the user intends to hold the key down for

8227166
lisp	smalltalk
well lisp has some in the language and some in the libraries while smalltalk has it all in the libraries except that the compiler cheats and hard codes some of them so there isn t really much difference in the end. in lisp a program is an s-expression and editing programs is editing s-expressions
in smalltalk a program is a collection of objects and editing programs is editing objects

8230153
factors	mean
this way you aren t adding an additional factors of n to your runtime and you can eliminate your swap function altogether
edit 2 what i mean by drawing it out on paper is write each of the values out on paper in order horizontally

8231535
boost	stl
boost is just a big non-standard library collection
c++ s stl is getting better and better yet it s not nearly as huge as boost and is not intended to

8232064
webkit	gecko
sub-pixel rendering just isn t supported on webkit like it is on gecko firefox
i wouldn t say this is a bug really but it is just how webkit is rounding sub-pixel metrics

8236244
glut	sdl
java doesn t have a lack of these types of libraries but c++ has a glut of them
on the negative side c++ is one of the least beginner-friendly languages out there and even though there are multiple cross-platform libraries for it sdl it is not a cross-platform friendly language

8236830
single-quotes	double-quotes
first you re putting various arguments in single-quotes which prevents any interpretation being done on them for example doesn t do anything special inside single-quotes
you re probably thinking of double-quotes but those aren t what you want either

8237452
webclient	httpwebrequest
the webclient class runs on the user interface thread so the user interface is not responsive while data is being downloaded from the internet
on the other hand the httpwebrequest class does not block the user interface thread and your application is responsive

8243610
arp	udp
with the ping command you just know that you did not receive any answer within the expected time - there is no connection in the arp protocol afair
from the udp standard packet loss is painless there is no acknowledge nor error message retrieved to the socket layer

8247465
division	exponent	division	multiplication	multiplication	exponent
that being said you can look at a positive exponent as indicated repeated multiplication 10 3 is 10 10 10 or 1 000 and you can look at a negative exponent as indicating repeated division e.g 10 -3 is 1 10 10 10 or 0.001
my inclination partly because i like the symmetry of this approach and partly to avoid the cuts since a cut is often a signal that you ve not defined the solution properly would be something like this the other approach as others have noted is to define a positive exponent as indicating repeated multiplication and a negative exponent as indicating the reciprocal of the positive exponent so 10 3 is 10 10 10 or 1 000 and 10 -3 is 1 10 3 or 1 1 000 or 0.001

8250833
namenode	hdfs
here are several things to consider too small files are not recommended - filesystem metadata kept in namenode memory - hardware limits to number of files
default block size on hdfs is 64mb but 128mb is most common case in production servers

8250907
fgetc	fread
it behaves as if calling fgetc repeatedly but it has direct access to the buffer that fgetc reads from so it can directly copy a larger quantity of data
fread is not calling fgetc to read each byte

8251800
n-gram	words
more importantly there would now only be a single string-based index that could be used for all words regardless of their position in the n-gram
the n-grams would reference the words by their primary key identifiers instead of by their text create table ngram id int primary key w1id int foreign key references words id w2id int foreign key references words id w3id int foreign key references words id w4id int foreign key references words id n int not null all of the foreign key indices would be integer-based instead of string-based

8252843
dictionary	map
you can then map each of those values to a key like so this generates a iterable of tuples so no information is lost if you know that all your non-mapping values are hashable -- and if you know they are unique or if you don t care about collisions -- then just pass the resulting tuples to dictionary
here s a recursive solution that can handle arbitrarily nested dictionaries it s not as efficient in the long run as a reverse dictionary but if you aren t doing such reverse searches frequently it probably doesn t matter

8254138
mvp	presenter
the mvp pattern was described by fowler in 2004 and he retired it in 2006 by splitting the pattern into supervising conroller sc and passive view pv
in sc the view is bound to the model and in pv not in pv the view is only changed by the presenter directly

8256768
mp4	h.264
i had this problem with some mp4 videos as well
i was converting uploaded videos to mp4 h.264 + aac and they wouldn t buffer

8257870
factors	matrix
since you re using a data.frame you need to ensure the product columns are character and not factors the code above will give odd results if the product columns are factors
note that you don t really have a matrix

8258071
swt	swing
you will also need to be careful to package your application- swt makes things slightly more difficult than a pure java app iirc
swing has a native look and feel but it is not 100 accurate

8258074
stateless	stateful
if you re being stateless and don t keep values in wider scopes such as session or context you re fine with not troubling yourself about which instance of your servlet will be called when
however if you are being stateful get put objects to the session scope for example then you need to synchronize that servlet instance s access to said scope synchronized session or serialize the way requests are being treated by the servlet threads

8259270
ssl	https
go to without the checkout onepage bit and if something shows then you know it s not a problem with ssl
if the admin section not cpanel is working then you have the option of disabling the secure https address temporarily

8261934
octal	hex
just like octal and binary notation is not
especially considering that the explicit int cast doesn t parse hex either and instead just reads everything up to the first non-digit

8262063
octal	decimal	octal	hex
in javascript only decimal and hex are defined as part of the standard while the octal is implementation dependent which would explain why octal parsing is not consistent between the examples you gave
you can get rid of octal literals in strict mode but in all browsers i tested parseint still tried to parse an octal instead of decimal

8262063
octal	decimal
you can get rid of octal literals in strict mode but in all browsers i tested parseint still tried to parse an octal instead of decimal
which is kind of strange because the spec does not say anything about trying to interpret implied octal for parseint and explicitly prohibits the octal extension when in strict mode

8262722
rspec	capybara
rspec nowadays doesn t have this problem anymore so its safe to do page.should_not have_text test jonas
the capybara mailing list worked better than stack overflow even though it took the moderators over 24 hours to approve my post because of turkey day

8265749
prepare	execute
in sql server using a prepare statement is definitely injection-proof because the input parameters don t form the query
it means that the execute query is not a dynamic query. example of an sql injection vulnerable statement

8267862
persistent	transient
the first one tells this property is persistent and the second one tells this property is not persistent
if you re talking about the java transient keyword and not about the transient annotation then yes a transient field may be queried and annotated with basic

8267906
uicontrol	uibutton
setselected and sethighlighted work fine on uicontrol but not uibutton which are not uicontrol
i d recommend using uibutton s documentation linked method to change the background image to something that mimics highlighting

8268449
nginx	lighttpd
in the case of wordpress which i consider extremely bloated nginx is indeed a lot faster at serving static content uses less memory and is a bit faster at serving php pages but it certainly doesn t cut your php execution time in half
nginx vs lighttpd nginx has recently gained a lot of popularity

8271478
inline	inlining
whether or not something is inline is completely compiler dependent - as the compiler has the final decision on whether to inline something
premature optimization aside if it really matters or if you re just curious you can use compiler-specific pragmas to force inlining no inlining on a function and then profile appropriately to see if you can make better decisions than the compiler

8273057
innodb	myisam
keep the columns you want to be full-text searching in myisam and the rest in innodb
this will be risky as the data in myisam will not be transaction safe

8273875
innodb	myisam
in mysql 5.6 we may have full-text on innodb however it still does not support most of the features that a real full-text search engine would have
the myisam full-text index probably isn t as good as you think

8275434
nsmutablestring	nsstring
for example you can also use it if you want to convert an nsmutablestring to nsstring or otherwise ensure that you re dealing with an nsstring instance
for example that s one way to ensure that the _mystring ivar is pointing to an nsstring instance and not an nsmutablestring instance

8275944
datamapper	activerecord
for better abstraction you can try datamapper
i think the key problem is activerecord api is not aware of ordering semantic

8276566
translation	localization
when i changed the simulator s language from english to spanish it did not translation the more label
then i clicked on infoplist.strings in the project and in the file inspector on the right-hand side of the xcode window i added french as a localization

8282062
innodb	myisam
one thing to check is if your configuration is optimized for innodb
default mysql settings are usually depending on exact version but still not optimized for innodb but more suited for myisam engine

8282062
innodb	myisam
default mysql settings are usually depending on exact version but still not optimized for innodb but more suited for myisam engine
percona s site has a nice introduction to innodb performance optimization basics number 5 on that list setting is exactly what andreas proposed

8283236
margin	text-align
the only disadvantage is that if you have content below the box you ll need to add some extra margin so it doesn t overlap with the button
if you wrap them all in a block element such as a you can specify text-align right

8284209
actionscript	mxml
per your actionscript class you could allow default initialization of the parameter then implement a creation complete event handler in your mxml
as tags mxml does not support class constructors

8286723
cpython	pypy
neither of these implementations are equivalent to cpython s split method most obviously they do not handle the special case cpython does where the sep is not supplied
however if you are merely interested in the basic algorithm used rather than the details pypy s implementations could be a guide at a quick glance it looks to be doing basically the same thing as both cpython and jython

8290392
accelerometer	gyroscope
the iphone has an accelerometer and a gyroscope
here is a very good video explaining both i may be wrong but i believe you are using the accelerometer not the gyro

8292939
serializable	deserialization
if you just want to communicate with another system in a strongly-typed way and you can expect the xml schemas to not be changing very frequently you might be ok with xml serializable
just encapsulate the deserialization into a separate component and write different versions of them yes you ll need to be able to determine the schema version that is currently used

8295254
postgresql	mysql
and my own tests confirm that running an alter table on a table with 1.2 million rows the same as in my test with postgresql to increase the size of a column took 1.5 minutes
in mysql however you can not use the workaround to use a check constraint to limit the number of characters in a column

8296999
nsstring	nsobject
the nslog method will still provide a correct result since is used for any nsobject subclass not just nsstring
probably the value in the price field is nsnumber and not an nsstring

8297302
dbcontext	objectcontext
a shared dbcontext is not a good idea
since dbcontext objectcontext is not thread safe

8297302
dbcontext	objectcontext
since dbcontext objectcontext is not thread safe
because there is only a single instance of the membership provider and there are concurrent requests in asp.net applications shared dbcontext instance will not work properly

8298772
haskell	scheme
yet in haskell it is normally not possible to have such values in lists
the whole thing is a clever scheme to make sure that values you produce in an st action can t escape from there

8298811
comparator	comparable
comparator is not by default part of java.lang.object
in order to override the comparator method your class has to implement the comparable interface

8298917
spaces	delimiter
it s not really possible to tell whether that means the file uses spaces since stackoverflow doesn t really handle tabs very well
you don t need to specify the delimiter at all though just let it use the default whitespace

8301457
postgresql	mysql
also check how you deal with strings that are too long for your varchar columns afaik sqlite ignores your size limits but postgresql will complain loudly if you try to exceed the column size and mysql will truncate your data with a mere warning unless you ve put your server in strict mode
postgresql doesn t use is or is not for general comparisons you want or should work in mysql and sqlite as well except when you want to compare against a null then you have to use is null or is not null everywhere

8301457
postgresql	mysql
postgresql doesn t use is or is not for general comparisons you want or should work in mysql and sqlite as well except when you want to compare against a null then you have to use is null or is not null everywhere
is is used for special comparisons such as is null and is distinct from see the comparison operators section of the postgresql manual for further details

8302834
opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this positive in the following browsers microsoft internet explorer 9.0.8112.16421 for windows 7 google-chrome 16.0.912.41 beta for debian gnu linux google-chrome 15.0.874.121 m for windows chromium 14.0.835.202 developer build 103287 linux built on debian unstable running on debian 6.0.3 mozilla firefox 8.0.1 for windows on wine iceweasel debian firefox 8.0 mozilla firefox 7.0.1 for windows on wine mozilla firefox 6.0.2 for windows on wine mozilla firefox 5.0 for windows on wine mozilla firefox 4.0.1 for windows on wine mozilla firefox 3.6.24 for windows on wine mozilla firefox 3.5.19 for windows on wine mozilla firefox 3.0.19 for windows on wine iceape debian seamonkey 2.0.14 apple safari 5.0.2 7533.18.5 for windows on wine apple safari 4.0.5 531.22.7 for windows on wine opera 11.52.1100 for linux konqueror 4.6.5 for gnu linux on kde 4.6.5 google android 2.3.4 browser dolphin browser hd 7.1.0 for android mozilla firefox 8.0 for android opera mobile 11.50 for android apple mobile safari 5.0.2 6533.18.5 on ios 4.2.1 8c148 on iphone 3g mb496fd it does not work in mozilla firefox 2.0 for windows on wine floats are not supported
mozilla firefox 1.5.0.12 for windows on wine floats are not supported

8303538
freebsd	linux
it certainly looks very similar to freebsd s crypt see modular crypt in the manpage
i don t really recall if it s the same way in linux or other but this seems to indicate it s not unique

8304784
listview	gridview
one way to accomplish this is to bring up a small form with all the subitems of the listview item in textboxes or a gridview so they can be edited
listview doesn t have that capability

8306084
textmate	aptana
syntax highlighting is a little sketchy though in that it uses an engine similar to textmate but it shouldn t bug out horribly on multilingual files
i can t say much about netbeans for sure as i ve never used it for anything but java desktop apps but the eclipse-based aptana is my go-to ide for web development

8307063
implements	extends
hibernate not only implements jpa spec but extends it to adds more features
so hibernate creates their own annotations which just extends the jpa annotation with the hibernate features and put these annotation inside the package org.hibernate.annotations if there are no hibernate specified features added for that jpa annotation eg onetomany and manytoone hibernate will not make that annotation in their org.hibernate.annotations package and you have to use these annotation from javax.persistence according to the jpa specification

8307893
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval certainly has its place just not with timing critical functions
just use a settimeout for this

8307949
implements	extends
then for your suite you need to implements before after logic as well
unfortunately the class annotated with runwith suite.class isn t actually instantiated so you can t use the constructor of that class but you can extends suite

8311518
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the problem is that presentmodalviewcontroller does not work in viewdidload yet as the view is loaded but might not even be on screen yet
if you put your code in viewwillappear animated this should work

8311532
ssl	https
abstract you can avoid ssl warnings for domains that support ssl by not being specific about the transport protocol
instead of including http or https use security considerations please note that there are some security considerations to this approach

8312048
serializable	deserialization
the solution here is approach that allows real custom object creation during deserialization using any set of arguments either serializable or non-serialized the main problem is that the approach sub-optimal it requires 2 phases of deserialization per object that requires custom deserialization but it works and allows deserializing objects the way you need it so here goes first we reassemble the customcreationconverter class the following way next we create the factory class that will create our foo here is sample code in this case foo contains an argument that we needed to pass to a foo constructor during deserialization
here are my thoughts regarding problem solution the problem json.net s custom deserialization api is not transparent affects my class hierarchy

8312048
serializable	deserialization
these correct arguments can either be inside serializable text or they can be already created and initialized some time before
unfortunately json.net during deserialization passes default values to arguments that he doesn t understand and in my case it always causes argumentnullexception

8314341
uiview	subviews
i m not sure what you mean by a calayer bezier path but you have a couple of options here create a subclass of uiview where you draw your circle using uibezierpath methods in the drawrect
this view can then be added to another view as a subviews and animated using standard methods

8314415
gson	jackson
unfortunately the latest release of gson 2.0 still doesn t have built-in support for an easy configuration to provide polymorphic deserialization
so if gson must be used instead of an api that has such built-in support like jackson -- using which i ve posted complete examples for polymorphic deserialization at then custom deserialization processing is necessary

8314807
delphi	oxygene
it s not exactly delphi but it s fairly close
remobjects just released oxygene for java a jvm-targetted version of their oxygene dialect of object pascal

8314958
draggable	droppable
note that it doesn t use the accept option to specify which draggable the droppable will accept
instead you ll have to check whether or not a draggable should be rejected manually in the drop event

8315937
ubuntu	debian
i got the same doesn t load backend error on my c++ program when i execute i found a solution at least on my ubuntu 11.04
just do sudo -i ln -s usr lib libsoci_mysql-gcc-3_0-3.0.0.so usr lib libsoci_mysql.so it seem that the soci library search for the file usr lib libsoci_mysql.so that is not in the system buy if you make a link to the library usr lib libsoci_mysql-gcc-3_0-3.0.0.so that it s in the system it works i think debian ubuntu makes a file name change from the original name but it have side effects because the soci library search inside for the original name

8318833
division	modulo
if you take division truncating towards zero to be a given that leaves you with a negative remainder
in java at least it s not a modulo - it s a remainder operator

8318849
division	modulo
in c99 and c++11 the rules been tightened up so the division must truncate toward zero and if there is a remainder it must be negative
most of them are not defined to return a modulo

8319158
textview	imageview
textview comes with 4 compound drawables one for each of left top right and bottom
in your case you do not need the linearlayout and imageview at all

8319200
geany	gedit
if it is the first case then most if not all python ide i have ever used do have that functionality built in gedit eclipse geany spe just to mention a few
if it is the second case some ide like gedit do have a plugin for that but in general what you should probably use is another window manager namely a tiling window manager

8323605
udp	tcp
maybe as well in ipv4 i m not sure abuot that. in udp if the address changes and the sender doesn t know about it the message obviously cannot be sent
in tcp a connection is identified by the tuple source address source port dest address dest port

8327962
strcpy	strdup
you also do not allocate so strcpy will also fail
you might want to change that to use strdup instead another couple of nitpicks when scanning for a string you do not need the on the string buffer so redo like this scanf s buffer

8328268
udp	tcp
udp connections do not guarantee delivery of packets if you need guaranteed delivery of packets use tcp instead
there are various reasons for packet loss when using udp to list a few network congestion packet corruption faulty hardware

8330070
backgrounding	multitasking
to ensure that it pops back try this in the applicationwillenterforeground like so or a very quick and dirty way is to actually quit the application when it enters the backgrounding note this probably isn t the best way
this is caused by multitasking the app isn t properly quitting

8330578
innodb	myisam
with appropriate triggers on the innodb table there s no reason that the myisam copies would get stale incorrect or you could simply rebuild them on a scheduled basis so that you ve got a staleness window that matches the rebuild interval
innodb does have full-text indexing now but since it s basically brand new most mysql installs will not support it yet

8330578
innodb	myisam
innodb does have full-text indexing now but since it s basically brand new most mysql installs will not support it yet
the standard workaround is to have a mirror myisam table that contains copies of the searchable data with a fulltext index

8331178
setinterval	settimeout
you could also use setinterval but i prefer doing it this way because it will be called 1000ms from the last run not every 1000ms regardless of how long it takes to run if the process is synchronous
just call settimeout from within your function

8332692
postgresql	mysql
benchmarks that attempt to model actual usage conditions with many concurrent queries put postgresql on par with or ahead of mysql in performance especially as you scale up in cpus cores
no postgresql is not slower

8334041
setinterval	settimeout
the gist is that you run a function in your setinterval slightly faster than your tempo for example every 100ms
long example short you can track whether or not it s time to play a beat by checking the value of new date .getmilliseconds and seeing if the equivalent of one beat in milliseconds has passed instead of relying on the not-so-accurate settimeout or setinterval functions

8335325
division	addition	division	multiplication
however here it has a larger influence than for the trial division so at least skipping the evens should be done apart from reducing the work it also reduces storage size so improves cache locality
so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

8335325
division	addition	division	multiplication
so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small
summarising trial division does futile work by dividing primes the sieve does futile work by repeatedly crossing off composites

8335579
firefox	safari
here is how paragraphs are styled in the 320 and up project last line is for firefox so justified text in browsers which was a big no-no is slowly becoming a reality
it works in safari tested with safari 5.1 on os x lion and safari mobile on ipad not with chrome yet

8341237
persistent	transient
the semantics are pretty crystal clear in my opinion you have not changed any persistent fields ergo there is nothing to save
the .save has no way of guessing that in this case some transient property should make you run through the save and then beforeupdate

8341908
implements	extends
i don t know if this is politically correct but since i m not bound to asp.net authoring got to use sso with kerberos style i ve choose to implements in this way
edit how i do this i have an homecontroller which simply stores userid in session then forwards to the real starting point of the webapp a controller which extends my basecontroller this pattern is secured by having the authorize attribute on the base controller each derived controller will have it applyed for each action thus the onauthorization method of the base controller or the one in your derived controller if you need to override for special cases will be fired no way to access without passing at least once from the homecontroller index mock of the base controller of course you need an homecontroller not inherithing from the base the entry point of your webapp the startcontroller inherits from basecontroller thus each action needs onauthorize invocation before since the startcontroller doesn t override it the basecontroller one is called

8341982
implements	extends
implements proper trailing space trimming of the line if string.trim isn t acceptable
extends bufferedreader by implementing bufferedreaderfactory and add line-trimming functionality to the reader

8344518
setinterval	settimeout
try using setinterval instead
i m no js engine guru but i would like to think the constant reuse of settimeout has to have some effect on performance that would not be present using setinterval which you only need to set once

8346405
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is not redeclared overridden in nsmutablestring so we cannot assume that this will return an nsmutablestring
in fact even in the nsstring class the return type is defined as id .

8348973
config	ini
if it s not 0 then php exited and because of the ini config settings set none of the php error messages were outputted
what i did was to enable the display_errors ini setting and set error_reporting to e_all

8349796
uiview	subviews
then set the generic uiview s hidden property to hide or show both labels
you cannot make subviews in a uilabel in ib

8350190
setinterval	settimeout
you probably want to call settimeout again at the end of your plotxy function or use setinterval otherwise your animation will only have one step
or you can do something like the following which shows both another way to solve the parameter passing problem and a way to keep calling the function with settimeout of course you can add some conditional processing within plotxyproxy to decide whether to set each timeout you could have plotxy return a boolean as to whether the animation has finished and call settimeout or not based on that boolean

8355156
dbcontext	objectcontext
the second problem cannot be solved with dbcontext api
dbcontext api is simplification of objectcontext api and this simplification removed methods needed for complex scenarios

8357604
imperative	declarative
these are imperative side-effects but even in a pure declarative language haskell there is state in the imperative io monad note not all monads are imperative
implicit in space allocation and timing is state relative to the imperative real world

8358945
jax-ws	jax-rs
1 install cxf osgi bundles both core and dosgi - we are using the following cxf-bundle-minimal-2.2.12.jar cxf-dosgi-ri-discovery-local-1.1.jar cxf-dosgi-ri-dsw-cxf-1.1.jar links 2 install jax-rs rest and jax-ws soap apis -the api definition are in org.apache.servicemix.specs.jsr311-api-1.0-1.3.0.jar and org.apache.servicemix.specs.jaxws-api-2.1-1.1.1.jar these are the versions we have -these may or may not be bundled with cxf
in our case only the jax-ws jar was included

8359809
udp	tcp
udp sockets that are not bound to the address will remain open as they are stateless
tcp listening sockets not bound to the address will remain open as well

8360956
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is not specific to google-chrome as i could reproduce it in google-chrome 15.0.874.121 for macintosh as well as safari 5.1.2
it also occurred in older versions of firefox for mac such as version 3.6.8 but the behavior is correct in the current version. this currently outstanding webkit bug is likely to be the cause of the issue

8365840
imperative	declarative
definition referential transparency rt of the sub-expressions is the only required attribute of a declarative programming expression because it is the only attribute which is not shared with imperative programming
other cited attributes of declarative programming derive from this rt

8366074
google-chrome	firefox
edit i ve only tested the following solution in google-chrome
it isn t currently working in ie or firefox

8366758
implements	extends
it does not extends to the code blocks of methods this includes generator expressions since they are implements using a function scope
this means that the following will fail the above means a function body is a code block and a method is a function then names defined out of the function body present in a class definition do not extends to the function body

8368998
sudo	passwd
therefore multiple sudo calls are also not a problem
the passwd is not read from the standard input but from the current terminal

8368998
sudo	passwd
but sudo provides an optione -s which read the passwd from standard input and not from the terminal
edit a better solution to the whole problem would be to avoid intercepting the passwd at all

8369747
ubuntu	debian
the profile module is part of standard python and is different from cprofile as it is implemented purely in python but ubuntu doesn t install it by default likely because of its debian lineage
profile isn t default included in debian either because profile.py has a different license from the rest of python

8371383
jar	war
however if a persistence unit of the same name is defined by an ejb-jar war or application jar file within the ear the persistence unit of that name defined at ear level will not be visible to the components defined by that ejb-jar war or application jar file unless the persistence unit reference uses the persistence unit name # syntax to specify a path name to disambiguate the reference
however in section 8 note java persistence 1.0 supported use of a jar file in the root of the ear as the root of a persistence unit

8372621
uilabel	uitextview
for anyone else having this same issue i ended-up solving it by using a uitextview instead of a uilabel
this was the best solution for two reasons it doesn t require any custom behaviour to determine whether the text contains spaces and change the line break mode of the uilabel to from word character wrap

8372817
xdebug	xhprof
something that doesn t work as well with xdebug last time i checked
xdebug has an impact on performance and xhprof i wouldn t say there is none manages a lot better

8372817
xdebug	xhprof
xdebug has an impact on performance and xhprof i wouldn t say there is none manages a lot better
we frequently use xhprof to collect samples with real traffic and then analyze the code from there

8373384
postgresql	mysql
postgresql doesn t currently allow ambiguous group by statements where the results are dependent on the order the table is scanned the plan used etc
that s how the standard says it should work afaik but some databases like mysql versions prior to 5.7 permit looser queries that just pick the first value encountered for elements appearing in the select list but not in group by

8373384
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql you should use distinct on for this kind of query
you want to write something like syntax corrected based on follow-up comment this is a bit like mysql 5.7 s any_value ... pseudo-function for group by but in reverse - it says that the values in the distinct on clause must be unique and any value is acceptable for the columns not specified

8376533
dbcontext	objectcontext
using objectcontext for one half of the application and dbcontext for second half of the application must result in code duplication
dbcontext api has some limitations and it will probably not support selective compiled queries in near future

8377440
punctuation	words
the following regex just strips of an url not just http any punctuation user names or any non alphanumeric characters
it also separates the words with a single space

8378447
rsa	dsa
the manual page to evp_sha512 says ... evp_sha512 ... return evp_md structures for the ... sha512 ... digest algorithms respectively. the associated signature algorithm is rsa in each case
highlight by me. so it looks like you are trying to do an rsa signature with a dsa key which will not work or spit out nonsense

8380669
scheme	racket
technically it can potentially break other scheme implementations also so this isn t a racket quirk or anything.
you should use the racket simply scheme module

8380669
scheme	racket
you should use the racket simply scheme module
the file you have linked to is not compatible with racket

8387027
jar	war
the selenium tests are not at the moment in a separate project but they are packaged as a separate jar and this is made available to the automated acceptance test stage via the jenkins copy artifact plugin - the ant python scripts package the war file and deploy to a container then ant unpacks and runs the selenium tests via junit
there s only a handfull of smoke tests at the moment and they have no dependancy on the main war although i can possibly see that changing

8388091
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
as i know it has never shown the percentage i use firefox opera and google-chrome
so i think it s not only a firefox problem

8388322
google-chrome	safari
as others have mentioned this currently a bug in google-chrome
the code below is the proper way to do what you re asking here s a working fiddle to demonstrate view in something other than google-chrome additional information i think you ll also find that the above method does not work in safari as well

8388386
google-chrome	firefox
w3schools seems to think it should be closed and i could not find the official spec on this tag but it sure doesn t work in google-chrome
firefox will not accept it with or or

8388674
innodb	myisam
i no longer use mysql for new projects at all. if you must stick with mysql i recommend using innodb on all tables unless you have a particular reason not to
imho this is one of the terrible things about mysql that it makes you choose between speed and full-text indices myisam and referential integrity and transactions innodb

8388708
gson	jackson
if you have not already invested too much time into jackson may i recommend you looking at gson here is a tutorial that should have you started
google gson api maps your json string into a domain object

8390704
accelerometer	gyroscope
this sensor is just the opposite to accelerometer and magnetic sensors which give readings with a lot of jitter
the readings from the gyroscope the angular speed does not drift at all

8392569
ubuntu	linux
first the distrib is ubuntu not ubunto. secondly i recommand you to use a live cd or a usb stick if you want to try the system and if it works well and or you like it install the system using that same medium
there are plenty of howto on the internet so i won t explain here but the principle is to reduce windows partition or allocating a full hard drive for linux and manage the partition scheme throw the installer

google-chrome	firefox
it s supposed to display the text of your css file. if you get no google-chrome package registered for google-chrome aaa skin aaa.css message in the error console your skin declaration in chrome.manifest didn t get processed or the provider name aaa in my example above doesn t match the provider name specified after skin if you get an in-content error page saying file not found
firefox can t find the file at google-chrome aaa skin bbb.css as in your case it means the path part of the skin declaration is incorrect

8393007
lisp	scheme
i m assuming you re using common lisp since it s obviously not scheme but maybe it s some other lisp variety in which case that link won t help.
quoting a list or a symbol in lisp with is exactly equivalent to using the special form quote ...

8394366
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
uitapgesturerecognizer is a discrete gesture recognizer and therefore never transitions to the began or changed states
from the uigesturerecognizer class reference discrete gestures transition from possible to either recognized uigesturerecognizerstaterecognized or failed uigesturerecognizerstatefailed depending on whether they successfully interpret the gesture or not

8395194
google-chrome	firefox
note for a google-chrome userscript you apparently don t need the timer delay
but for firefox and ie 8 the other 2 browsers i double-checked a dynamically added iframe is not manipulable until after it has settled for some reason

8398244
firefox	safari
that works in firefox 3.0 although not in earlier versions of firefox because they don t support display inline-block
word-wrap break-word is supported in firefox from version 3.5 onwards opera from 10.5 safari from 2 chrome from 1 and ie from at least 6

8399795
addition	modulo	addition	multiplication
all operations are meant in that field you should do every single addition multiplication or inversion modulo p
when doing addition of points there are a few special cases which you must handle specially there is a special point at infinity which does not have coordinates x and y

8400014
uiview	subviews
then it would be trivial to animate those subviews using uiview s animation methods clearly you d then need to add code to manage the touches and remove the subviews when needed but that shouldn t be too onerous
rather than using drawrect in your main view i would create a new subviews for each object

8404437
queue	fifo
the define command will not affect the messages in a queue
the only effects you might notice are for example if you change the queue from fifo to priority or vice versa

8404437
queue	fifo
the only effects you might notice are for example if you change the queue from fifo to priority or vice versa
this only changes the indexing and ordering for new messages in the queue and does not affect existing messages

8406114
inline	inlining
the task is not currently executing since tasks get queued by the scheduler the task s scheduler created at construction is the same scheduler as the current one the task isn t canceled the task isn t faulted the third point there is fuzzy - it can execute inline on a different scheduler but this requires the other scheduler to be able to execute it immediately so it s dependent on the scheduler being one that supports this
the inlining mentioned in that article is different than a task starting

8406328
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is google-chrome browser content browser.xul after all
i ve found the answer but it is a bit of a hack and requires removing the following lines of code from the addon-kit javascript source since the above code is specifically designed to prevent using the addon kit in anything other than bonafide firefox this avenue is not worth pursuing further

8406947
jlist	jlabel
edit you could have a map to map the small images to the large ones if the large ones aren t so big as to make you run out of memory and then use the a listselectionlistener added to the jlist to get the small icon and then the map to get the large one
the large one can then be displayed in a jlabel

8407867
translation	localization
implementing a general scheme for handling expressions of the type n items is not simple cldr gives you sets of rules but you would need to code them and in translation you would need to request for all the relevant inclined forms of a noun like item. if such expressions occur in some specific context s only it might be feasible to reformulate things so that you don t say n tickets left but number of tickets left n. this would be much easier to implement just string localization and number localization
in addition to the plural form issue that paweł dyda described there are a few other potential problems the writing of the number may need localization partly because the format of large numbers varies 1 234 vs

8408909
ssl	https
but if you know you won t have any need for it just strip it down to a regular http connection they did actually publish the http urls at one point but i d imagine that the resulting mixed-content warnings etc that came about as a result of people adding ssl connections and not thinking it through just created a bunch of support questions so it was simpler to default to showing https and let people hack it if they really wanted
people asked for it so they could use the libraries on things like e-commerce sites which eventually require an ssl connection

8412793
move	drag
what works best for me is to not move the uiimageview that is in the scrollview but rather create a duplicate view in the controlling view controller and move that with the touches then add that to the main view and then subsequently remove the original
this approach also looks better if the user changes their mind halfway through and decides to not drag it out after all

8413998
nsis	uninstaller
instruction you tell nsis to run the uninstaller from the same place and not from the temp directory
you tell nsis to wait for the uninstaller process to complete and then return

8415624
postgresql	mysql
i do not know enough to provide the code but essentially it could look like this a recursive approach lastly you can switch to postgresql which supports recursive queries
unfortunately it cannot be done in mysql given such a table structure as mysql does not support recursive queries

8418890
boost	stl
for example for your complex struct from above somethink like this should do the trick not tested but as i said the stl complex type is already build in in boost serialization
why don t you use stl vector instead of your own array class

8419803
multiplying	multiplication
so that multiplying can be achieved with 3 shifts and adds
if you don t need the result to be bit-exact then you could consider multiplying by 1 24 of course if your platform doesn t have a hardware multiplier then you will need to optimise that multiplication

8423379
factors	mean
you need to add a fudge factors that is if the two numbers are similar to within a certain tolerance then you should consider them to be equal
you can do this by subtracting one number from another and seeing if the absolute result is below your threshold in my example 0.01 of course this combined with rounding errors that can creep in with successive mathematical operations mean that floating point numbers are often not the best choice anyway and should be avoided where possible

8423452
union	distinct
you could use select sex as uniq from type4 union select fason from type4 union select color from type4 union select size from type4 now for your question if the four columns have no overlapping values you could use select distinct sex as uniq sex as fromcolumn from type4 union all select distinct fason fason from type4 union all select distinct color color from type4 union all select distinct size size from type4
your original query does not need the subquery nor the distinct

8428404
listview	gridview
listview are not grids and in my opinion should not be used when the final expected result is closer to a grid
to me this is a gridview with usual header texts

8429002
strcpy	strncpy
your arrays are not so strcpy doesn t know when to stop
to fix this either add a 4th null character or use strncpy

8431060
super	extends
however that s not advisable so i d prefer to either add the code before or after the call to super if possible or override an internally called method
unfortunately you can t extends methods in the way you want

8434264
trie	tree
don t be fooled though when k is medium each node occupies a couple cache lines but the trie isn t very high so the number of cache misses is pretty small
theoretically speaking a van emde boas tree is your best bet with o log log m -time operations where m is the size of the range

8434374
heroku	engineyard
i m not saying that can t be done on other platforms i m just saying heroku is working great for me in that way
i do have one app that processes voip data over udp so i ll need to figure out if i prefer amazon or engineyard for that heroku won t let you open a udp port as far as i know

8434697
postgresql	mysql
there is no direct way of retrieving hierarchical data in mysql like for example postgresql s recursive query
there is a good article summarizing different ways of implementing nested data set in mysql most users at one time or another have dealt with hierarchical data in a sql database and no doubt learned that the management of hierarchical data is not what a relational database is intended for. the tables of a relational database are not hierarchical like xml but are simply a flat list

8435546
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
from tree map api note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

8438657
mp3	ogg
you could even add a play method to the then use it like this the only caveat is firefox doesn t support mp3
you ll have to convert your files to ogg

8439337
boost	allocator
also i would do proper type erasure take a look at boost any and make object a complete type that contains dataobject elements and then perform the operations on that type rather than the hierarchy
that will enable you to provide functions that also return by value and hide the dynamic memory allocator internally which also means that resource management can be controlled inside object and is not the responsibility of user code

8442718
jar	war
if the reason you are trying to convert a jar to a war is only because you want to be able to see the source code of the classes in the jar then trying to convert it to a war is not the right thing to do
a java jar java archive file is just like a zip file an archive that can contain other files

8442718
jar	war
a war web archive is the same as a jar file but with a certain prescribed directory structure that makes it suitable for deployment on a java ee application server
converting a jar file to a war file will not automatically make it possible to see the source code of the classes in eclipse

8442831
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
update july 2015 this method is confirmed working in the following browsers google-chrome - v.43.0.2357.132 mozilla firefox - v.39.0 safari - v.8.0.7 placeholder is visible in dropdown but is not selectable microsoft internet explorer - v.11 placeholder is visible in dropdown but is not selectable project spartan - v.15.10130 placeholder is visible in dropdown but is not selectable update october 2015 removed the in favour of html5 attribute hidden which has wide support
the hidden element has similar traits as display none in safari ie project spartan needs checking where the option is visible in dropdown but is not selectable

8444425
ienumerable	icollection
also as mentioned in answer by inu ienumerable is not supported - at least lazy loading proxies demand icollection and i m almost sure that it is global requirement as mentioned in linked answer
code first normally skips all ienumerable properties from mapping

8445866
gson	jackson
you tagged your question with gson but i would recommend you the jackson library instead because i saw your last two questions and seems like gson is not flexible enough for you
in jackson your example would look like this with this solution you can have immutable objects which will built by the constructor

8446647
clang	llvm
however when compiled with llvm clang i get bar nfoo n
but as i m not sure if this might be a bug in clang i filled a bug report here

8447306
viewmodel	caliburn
viewmodel 3 and probably not the best way you could store a reference to your view in your viewmodel
caliburn micro as an example gives you a way to access your view getview from within your viewmodel then you could get a reference to your grid and call beginedit

8448208
dictionary	map
i wouldn t use dictionary or hashtable unless you have to
often the map interface and hashmap or linkedhashmap class are better choices as they are not sunchronized

8448861
sqoop	hadoop
sqoop is now an incubator project in apache
there is no reason sqoop should only run with cdh and not hadoop

8448861
sqoop	hadoop
there is no reason sqoop should only run with cdh and not hadoop
the sqoop documentation says sqoop is compatible with hadoop 0.21 and cloudera s distribution of hadoop version 3

8449950
google-chrome	firefox
only google-chrome currently supports sending binary object types
firefox does not yet support sending binary types

8452592
cpython	pypy
pypy is now faster than cpython in most cases
disclaimer i m not an expert on pypy - in particular i don t understand the details of the rpython translation i m only citing stuff that i ve read before

8452593
nsstring	nsobject
if your array is populated with different elements use this instead what you are doing in your example is effectively the same as just because you cast object as doesn t mean string will actually be pointing to an nsstring object
calling nslog in this way will call the method according to the nsobject protocol which the class being referenced inside the array may or may not conform to

8456234
stateless	stateful
it is stateless because the implementing class does not preserve any state between method calls
rowcallbackhandler implementations of this interface perform the actual work of processing each row ... in contrast to a resultsetextractor a rowcallbackhandler object is typically stateful it keeps the result state within the object to be available for later inspection

8457528
namenode	hdfs
3 when the no.of files are so huge a single namenode will not be able to keep all the metadata
in fact that is one of the limitations of hdfs

8457646
equals	gethashcode
not in this case but with a class that contains both an int and a string we would compare the ints first because is faster and we will hence perhaps find an answer of false before we even look at the strings now at this point we ve a good basis for overriding the equals method defined in object since as will return a paramid reference if other is a paramid and null for anything else including if null was what we were passed in the first place and since we already handle comparison with null we re all set
try to compile at this point and you will get a warning that you have overriden equals but not gethashcode the same is true if you d done it the other way around

8457646
equals	gethashcode
try to compile at this point and you will get a warning that you have overriden equals but not gethashcode the same is true if you d done it the other way around
gethashcode is used by the dictionary and other hash-based collections like hashtable and hashset to decide where to place the key internally

8457799
libstdc++	libc++
libc++ is not binary compatible with gcc s libstdc++ except for some low level stuff such as operator new
for example the std string in gcc s libstdc++ is refcounted whereas in libc++ it uses the short string optimization

8457891
pdfbox	itext
i would not use pdfbox it is good for reading and modifying an existing pdf file but createing a file from scratch using pdfbox can be a lot of work
i think your criteria can be met with both itext and apahce fop but here you have some additional criteria licensing fop is based on apache license and therefore friendly also for commercial use flexbility a low level api like itext is more flexible than high level fop visual tools there is one designer for fop here

8458169
requestfactory	gwt
because i have worked mostly with gwt here is a list of advantages and dis-advantages i can think of regarding gwt advantages robust toolkit development tools testing refactoring eclipse live-debugging cross browser compatibility out of the box with some caveats availability of third party libraries dto serialization mvp frameworks etc only code which is used is downloaded to the client with js frameworks you download the whole framework even if you only use one specific function gwt-rpc and requestfactory for communication with a java backend no need to serialize or de-serialize yourself
disadvantages bigger learning curve might not be suited for small ui enhancements compilation can take some time if code base is big and different browser and languages must be supported generated javascript can become big in complex applications solution code splitting as a side-note with each new gwt version the disadvantages become less of an issue as each new gwt version improves in compilation time and code size

8458272
rtp	rtsp
a1 yes rtsp rtp streaming is suported under 2.1 i recall it s been there since 1.6
to see some rtsp streams not live though but they could be go to a2 if streams is rtsp then browser will open it in the external video player

8458528
antialiasing	transparent
your text seems to have antialiasing soft edges
those edges aren t 100 transparent but they re also not 100 opaque - they are a mixture of foreground and background

8460584
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
i m pretty sure that the following functions are respecting the letter but not the spirit of the standard of course you ll code calloc and realloc accordingly
btw every code using malloc should test against its failure but some -incorrectly- don t

8464745
calloc	malloc
calloc is basically malloc + initialization
edit regardless this is not really a good example of the usage of malloc

8467212
implements	extends
from docs.oracle.com it is possible however to define a class that does not implements all of the interface methods provided that the class is declared to be abstract. the declaration you have only names two interfaces comparable and serializable
since hand is an abstract class it doesn t have to actually implements those interfaces but any non-abstract class that extends hand must do so

8467741
boost	allocator
boost make_shared does some magic to allocate the reference count and the object in contiguous memory which saves on calls to the allocator and improves locality of reference
making it so that shared_ptr doesn t actually delete what it points to pros faster though it still involves a heap allocator for the reference count directly addresses the issue at hand the thing you re pointing to can t be deleted

8467797
nsexception	nserror
slightly related not nsexception but nserror if you create an nserror object with initwithdomain code userinfo you should send autorelease to it before you return it to the caller
almost all nsexception objects and other types of exception objects are created autoreleased which assigns them to the nearest in scope autorelease pool

8468144
uiview	subviews
2 in the .xib file drag out a new uiview to the canvas not on the tableview
3 drag the tableview to be a subviews of the view as shown 4 connect the file s owner s view property to be the uiview you just added

8468171
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not support it
firefox does support it but converts the image to a bitmap and converts transparent pixels to black

8468647
implements	extends
update i was able to successfully implements an extension method on the object class in c# using the following code and using it as however when i attempted to port this to visual basic i discovered that you can extends a lot of things but not the object data type
this so question has more specifics vb.net impossible to use extension method on system.object instance so you can extends object in c# or if the objects in your arrary are of a specific base type or implements a specific interface you could extends that in order to implements this functionality

8470268
ioexception	fileoutputstream	ioexception	fileinputstream
i d also suggest catching ioexception instead of exception . you re using filewriter and filereader which doesn t allow you to specify the input output encoding - not the issue here but personally i like to take more control over the encodings i use
i d suggest using fileinputstream and fileoutputstream wrapped in inputstreamreader and outputstreamwriter

8470652
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure why safari google-chrome is able to be smarter and see that uni is the id of an element
perhaps someone else can enlighten me but for firefox you should explicitly state this using in your inline javascript you should put uni in quotes

8473723
required	placeholder
but in c++11 there is a generic replacement that works std bind stringcasecmp std placeholder _1 target however bind does not return a c++03-style function object which not1 is expecting it required the type of result of bind to define the argument_type member which does not exist
therefore the final expression std not1 std bind stringcasecmp std placeholder _1 target will not work

8474136
boost	allocator
hopefully the two pieces of code together show that whole stackalloc can give a boost it can also hurt performance a lot too
generally you shouldn t even consider stackalloc unless you are going to need to use pinned memory for interacting with unmanaged code anyway and it should be considered an alternative to fixed rather than an alternative to general heap allocator

8474566
oncreate	onstart
a using oncreate ondestroy will allocate when activity gets on the stack and unallocate when activity is popped from the stack
b using onstart onstop will allocate when activity gets visible and unallocate when activity is not visible

8474609
serializable	deserialization
but custom complex types such as nested beans entities or ejbs should each also be serializable
if something is not really implementable as serializable such as inputstream then you should either redesign the model or make it transient and keep in mind that it will be null after deserialization

8475526
postgresql	mysql
when you have sql query that is hard to write using orm - you can use postgresql views
not sure about mysql

8478627
swt	swing
there s actually a super easy way in swing not in swt
i misread the question when i first posted this answer but since i found my way here whilst searching for a swing solution i ll leave it up for others

8480076
perforce	svn
i was using p4v with perforce when i had to use it
drastically helped me with merges considering p4 is not quite like using svn or git

8481723
ssl	https
if ssl is enabled then running your form with https instead of http as the comment above says will work to force users to use the ssl version add something like the following to your .htaccess file
you will need to enable ss l if it is not already enabled if you are going to run this in production you will also need to purchase and install an ssl cert instead of a self-signed cert

8482709
boost	allocator
of course you should size your strings appropriately and boost array probably isn t the best - ideally you want some length information too but you get the idea.
as i said in my comment your problem stems from attempting to use objects that internally require heap allocator in a structure which should be self contained requires no further dynamically allocated memory

8482755
lisp	scheme
there is a great many different dialects of lisp of which common lisp is perhaps the most used today
scheme with which you are familiar does not claim to be a lisp although it shares many characteristics

8485038
aggregate-functions	sum
unfortunately odata doesn t support aggregate-functions - it supports only the limited set of querying functions described here
aggregate operators all aggregate operations are unsupported against a dataservicequery including the following aggregate average count longcount max min sum aggregate operations must either be performed on the client or be encapsulated by a service operation

8487678
super	extends
and if you don t specify a constructor at all java will add a default parameterless constructor so in effect your code looks like this so in other words your code is failing to compile because the call to super in the default constructor cannot be resolved
if you want to extends a class outside its package it must have a constructor that is public or protected because in java every constructor must call a constructor from its superclass

8490722
lisp	prolog
in lisp 1 2 3 is a valid list but not a valid program since an integer is not a function
if we look at the other great homoiconic programming language prolog then we see the same phenomenon we can build a data structure foo x 1 bar but without a definition of foo we can t execute it

8491379
ssl	https
you probably got the error for only the users that had forced ssl but not the rest
now that facebook require ssl for applications your redirect_uri need to be https i.e otherwhise you will get bad request

8492630
parsley	cairngorm
i work at the place where i cannot choose the tools to use and parsley is one of the tools i wouldn t choose if i was given a choice
if you think about being able to debug and test your project encapsulation modular design etc - avoid using micro architecture frameworks at all costs parsley similarly to swiz mate less so cairngorm and probably others of which i don t have an in-depth knowledge relies on metadata

8493700
boost	allocator
and since the storage size required for this is fixed and known at compile-time it s sizeof t boost optional doesn t need any dynamic allocator
if you want an object with automatic storage that has optional semantics may or may not exist you can use boost optional

8493785
prepare	execute
in sql server 2005 sql server 2000 and sql server 7.0 the prepare statements cannot be used to create temporary objects and cannot reference system stored procedures that create temporary objects such as temporary tables
these procedures must be execute directly

8497116
opengl-es	glsurfaceview	implements	extends
in your activity where myrenderer is an instance of myrenderer implements glsurfaceview.renderer then it should automatically start the rendering without you having to touch start edit actually start is called when the view is laid out when you setcontentview or add it to whatever layout you set as content view not when setrenderer is called it sounds back-to-front but implements renderer is for if you just want to render something in the standard android opengl-es way whilst extends glsurfaceview is if you actually want to get under the hood and edit the way android renders
in fact i would recommend not extends glsurfaceview at all but doing as much as possible in your glsurfaceview.renderer

8497218
daemons	systemd
maybe send a signal maybe write to a file that the daemons watches maybe just a network socket whatever
not knowing a good way to do this i can offer an ugly hack solution write a tiny daemons that runs as root and accepts commands to shut the systemd down and have your php script communicate with the daemons through a reasonably-secured channel for your definition of reasonable

8497852
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode is contractually required to return the same result for any two structs that compare as equals
gethashcode is explicitly not a source of disambiguation between two identical things

8498220
hex	binary
reading data out is slightly slower - you have to call hex on all binary data read out of a query to get it in a useful format if your client api doesn t deal well with binary data php in paricular will usually determine that binary strings and will break them if manipulated without first calling bin2hex base64_encode or similar - but this overhead is about as minimal as character collation and more importantly is only being called on the actual cells select ed not all cells involved in the internal computations of a query result
so of course all these small speed increases are very minimal and other areas result in small decreases - but when you add them all up binary still comes out on top and when you consider use cases and the general reads writes principle it really shines

8499097
g++	gcc
if you re using c then you shouldn t be using c++-specific headers in main.c and you should use gcc rather than g++
if you re using c++ all your source files should have .cpp suffixes and you should used g++

8505859
cpython	pypy
django is a very complex project and would require strict python compliance to run - i doubt it would be possible without some months of work to make django work directly in cpython or pyrex - although one could use a profiler to turn specific bottlenecks into native code with much less effort by replacing individual django modules in the core with ones optimized with cpython moreover optimization with pyrex cpython is not that free - one can have around a 30 speedup by running simple numeric intensive code in cpython without any changes in the code - but for greater speed increase the code has to be manually tweaked so that some variables are made statically typed
on the other hand you might try running django with pypy - there are some hints here pypy is an extremly conformant python interpretor and django core is known to work with it

8508472
tabcontrol	tabitem
if they re not bound to anything then the tabcontrol will revert to its initial state when selected
wpf discards the entire visualtree of a tabitem which isn t selected so no controls actually exist on tabs that are not visible

8510230
bash	zsh
in the interests of future readers who might have a similar issue this is incorrect in bash do done doesn t create a lexical scope unless are used
however it appears to be correct for some versions or settings for zsh per the follow-up comments from the original poster

8512805
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you ve already loaded that viewcontroller or added it to a tab bar controller or whatever then viewdidload will not be called again - this is only called once when your view controller has finished loading its views from a nib or manually
to update a view when it is presented by another controller viewwillappear is the standard method to use though this won t be called if you are swapping views the way you do in your question

8515496
vb.net	vb6
variables or lines could not begin with an _ example of vb6 use of _ i am pretty sure that in vb.net the _ continues to function as a line continuation character however the variable name restriction has obviously been lifted
fyi if you are looking at vb code prior to the .net era ie vb6 of which there is a ton out there the _ character did have special meaning in that it was a line continuation character

8517154
margin	text-align
the following only applies when .block does not have a fixed width if you need to horizontally center .block you margin 0 auto will not work because .block is an inline element which is needed to make it wrap around the fixed-width elements
you need to add text-align center to its parent element which might be your body element if .block is your outermost element and then add text-align left to .block

8518578
spaces	delimiter
if you really mean white-space and not spaces then you have to go this way the difference from the other answers in the splitting character
if this not defined then white-space characters are assumed to be the delimiter

8519526
persistent	transient
if the variable is declared as transient then it will not be persistent
it is the main purpose of the transient keyword

8520987
uicontrol	uibutton
this method works for anything that inherits from uicontrol including but not limited to uibutton
look at the documentation of uicontrol

8521778
consistency	acid
consistency - state should remain valid isolation - operations outside the transaction cannot see half-changes intermediate inconsistent states durability - changes should persist you d have to change hbase code to get isolation but if you can relax that requirement you can implement a transaction coordinator that would roughly do something like save what needs to be done in the transaction in a special table transaction log perform first change perform second change verify that the steps where done and mark the transaction as completed when recovering go to the transaction log and complete rollback changes note that because you don t have isolation sometimes rolling back is not an option so you d need to implement compensation logic also take a look at the saga pattern
hbase does not support transaction. while you have something around atomicity on single table you ve got noting like transaction if you need to update more than one. transactions means 4 things that go by the acronym acid

8528409
g++	gcc
make 2 copies of the same source one to be compiled by g++ the other gcc
block off the c++ parts with #ifdef __cplusplus #if 0 ... #endif #endif so that gcc doesn t try to compile the c++ code

8528939
bash	subshell
the reason for the difference is that when you put it in a separate script x and call that script using x ... then you re launching a separate instance of bash to run the script that is it s equivalent to bash x ... and that separate instance doesn t inherit the set -f setting whereas when you put it in a shell function it runs within the same instance
one solution is to drop the whole set -f approach and just quote your arguments when you call the function another solution is to define the function to run in a subshell but still within the same instance of bash and then cancel the set -f within that function by using set +f the reason for using the subshell for using ... instead of is that otherwise the set +f would leak out of the function call

8532778
uicontrol	uibutton
either register separate methods for each event type the recommended solution or make your own subclass of uicontrol and make it behave differently
as discussed here the uievent that you get from uibutton doesn t give you any information about which uicontrolevent caused it

8534876
serializable	deserialization
you will not be able to serializable anonymous types and store them in a cache like this and unfortunately would need to create and store this
this would be because there is nothing to compare the anonymous type against to do the serialization and deserialization

8535746
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
from treeset javadoc note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

8539606
serializable	deserialization
some sort of identifier must be stored with the serializable data otherwise it will be impossible for you to determine what type an object really is
sure i ve seen deserialization methods where the keys of the serializable data has been used to search for the best matching object types but this is not something i d recommend since it isn t 100 accurate for all cases

8542047
sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
the standardized internet protocols fall into a few categories block oriented stream oriented reliable sctp tcp unreliable udp --- if you really want to send blocks of data you can use sctp but be aware that many firewalls drop sctp packets because they aren t usual
i don t know if you can reliably route sctp packets across the open internet

8543639
nsmutablestring	nsstring
also the temporary variable tmp2 is useless and you should not create a new newstring as you concatenate the string but rather use a nsmutablestring
nsstring works with unichar characters that are 2 bytes long 16 bits

8543931
fseek	fread
it does not mean current position is at end of file it means last read attempted to read past end of file it s a flag that s set by fread and others and cleared by fseek and others
fread has a return value

8545785
implements	extends
now you can extends your result class from mysqli_result and implements some useful interfaces like seekableiterator so you can use foreach on your resultset
phil s answer is ok but it is possible to just extends mysqli_result by checking mysqli field_count . checkout the documentation for mysqli field_count this function can be useful when using the mysqli_store_result function to determine if the query should have produced a non-empty result set or not without knowing the nature of the query

8545993
postgresql	mysql
in other rdbms like postgresql oracle or sql server you could solve this elegantly with a window function as defined in the sql standard
but mysql does not provide this feature

8548040
rdf	owl
you ve been bitten by a common misconception among novice rdf xml users that the attribute names are directly related to the actual data when in fact they are not
the attribute names within the rdf namespaces are just xml syntax and don t actually relate to uris in the data on the other hand things in other namespaces owl in your examples typically do relate directly to uris in the data

8548265
udp	mtu	icmp	udp
besides that ping doesn t use udp but icmp so the results mean nothing
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500

8548861
strtol	atoi
you need to first read whatever the user enters i recommend using std getline and then try to parse that with strtol sscanf or std istringstream
don t use atoi because it doesn t report failures

8550428
erlang	scheme
of course erlang also has registered processes which can be referred to by name
and erlang also uses a simple cookie scheme for remote system access and access to executing underlying file io commands on remote nodes aren t locked down

8550428
erlang	scheme
and erlang also uses a simple cookie scheme for remote system access and access to executing underlying file io commands on remote nodes aren t locked down
erlang minus a few features could easily be an incredible sandboxed-execution environment but i have no idea how much work it would take to remove those features. ruby also has a taint environment similar to perl s taint environment as described by yshavit

8552773
division	exponent
also is parsed as so you ll need either parenthesis or do a second division ... 2 a
the symbol is actually the bitwise xor operator not a power or exponent operator so b 2 is actually b xor 2

8555003
google-chrome	firefox
i ve just experienced a similar issue not seeing the uploadify button in firefox though i do in google-chrome - both in the site i m developing and
using firefox i ve browsed to

8556361
postgresql	mysql
here is how i was able to get it to work with postgresql def self.answered scoped.select questions.title .group questions.title .joins answers .having max answers.created_at is not null .order max answers.created_at desc end or if you want to select the entire activerecord rows for the questions you can select group by every column in questions
anton s answer would be the preferred solution if we were talking about mysql but as you pointed out it causes errors in postgresql since postgresql is a bit more restrictive in its select grouping functions

8557233
google-chrome	firefox
see this is seems to be google-chrome bug
it would not work if added dynamically later on google-chrome would work with firefox

8558322
equals	gethashcode
whether the two objects are equals or not are entirely depends on its equals method s implementation
sometime with the equals method it is also good to override the gethashcode implementation

8558322
equals	gethashcode
sometime with the equals method it is also good to override the gethashcode implementation
if it is not override the default virtual implementation of object class would be considered along with the the equals method s evaluation

8558539
rtp	rtcp
the rtcp sr contains the mapping from rtp to ntp timestamp which allows the client to synchronize the timestamps
the fact that the timestamp jumps negative shouldn t matter since both rtp and ntp timestamps are unsigned

8563445
namenode	hdfs
the mapping between the file and the block-ids is persisted in the namenode
according to the hadoop the definitive guide unlike a filesystem for a single disk a file in hdfs that is smaller than a single block does not occupy a full block s worth of underlying storage

8564247
ienumerable	icollection
that said there is one other possibility that comes to mind for your code above as you re using the ienumerable constructor to the list you may not giving the object any hints as to the size of the collection you re passing to the list constructor
if the object you are passing is is not a collection does not implement the icollection interface then behind-the-scenes the list implementation is going to need to grow several or many times each time leaving behind a too-small array that needs to be garbage collected

8565947
persistent	transient
you could store the value in some kind of persistent server-side storage such as a database or even just a file
this would allow you to manage your data server-side and separate its persistence from the php application since applications are more transient and not reliable for long-term data persistence

8567848
django	web2py
but i m going to add my own accounts and i m doing it with webapp2 instead of django and instead of web2py
i tried web2py but webapp2 and its auth model seem much better and not like with web2py a lot of unnecessary code that is not for app engine

8568985
flask	django	flask	web2py
flask from armin ronacher the man behind werkzeug and jinja2
i ve not used web2py however since it is also a full-stack framework like django is i think it will be as bad as django is

8569245
bash	zsh
the main incompatible change between sh and zsh is that an unquoted parameter substitution undergoes field splitting and filename generation globbing in sh and ksh and bash but not in zsh
in zsh always expands to a single word unless var is an array variable here ls -l whereas in sh would expand to the two words ls l-

8570803
vsto	add-in
one possible solution for you would be you expose webservice to store data to database wherever it is and your vsto add-in communicate with web service
vsto can only be used with microsoft office apps you cannot host it on web

8572536
innodb	myisam
as for the database -- a few important constraints table engine innodb myisam ... size indices usage most mysql tips on stackoverflow will tell you about 5-8 so called important settings
first off not all of them matter - allocating a lot of resources to innodb and not using innodb doesn t make a lot of sense because those resources are wasted

8574568
multiplication	modulo
this method compares possibly overflowing result of normal multiplication with the result of multiplication which cannot overflow
all calculations are modulo 2 32 - 1

8576559
noexcept	throw
now you can safely replace throw with noexcept true or just noexcept
there will be no checks whether such a method actually throw an exception - it s a guarantee you give to the compiler not vice versa

8576747
move	drag
your scrollview doesn t move on a scroll drag
the cgrect frame stays constant. your scrollview contents move up and down on scroll drag

8579186
udp	tcp
finally if you want to use udp you should probably try to use udp instead of wierd tcp
if you disable ack processing in tcp you re not talking tcp any more

8581200
pascal	delphi
i ve not messed with it but it reportedly is just as fast - it s the design of the pascal language that allows this
delphi object pascal

8581408
pascal	delphi
pascal analyzer is not much help here
the refactoring features of delphi might be helpful try a rename refactoring and see how many places it can suggest that it would automatically rename for you

8583641
factors	matrix
however i imagine that in your actual data your data frame doesn t have as a factors but instead as a numeric
you can construct a set of indices into derived being your derived matrix by making an index matrix out of and

8588971
quicksort	mergesort
however quicksort is not stable so some engines firefox s for sure use a different algorithm
a simple stable sort is mergesort

8590661
g++	gcc
however the solution is not iso c++ compliant as will complain g++ -pedantic in order to give some rest to g++ use __extension__ old_whole_macro_content_here so that the new definition reads in order to improve my solution even a bit more let s use the __typeof__ keyword as seen in min and max in c now the compiler will determine the appropriate type
this too is a gcc extension

8591875
firefox	safari
firefox and ie do not use range requests and that s why it works
chrome and safari use range requests

8593868
tabcontrol	tabitem
an alternative solution would be to extend the tabcontrol to stop it from destorying it s children when switching tabs
my guess is that you re using a tabcontrol which disposes it s tabitem when they re not visible

8594443
uiview	subviews
ok so i figured out the issue after reading the answer to the following question animating a uiview frame subviews uiscrollview doesn #39
t always animate i basically was doing some work after i scheduled the animation which was causing - layoutsubviews to be called on each of my subviews which automatically caused those views to be arranged at the end point of the animation

8595187
ienumerable	icollection
icollection collectionbase and ienumerable aren t directly instantiable types
collectionbase icollection is a base class interface that is inherited implemented by any class that considers itself a collection and holds multiple items

8596905
g++	gcc
you have to either use g++ to link or specify c++ runtime yourself usually it is -lstdc++
it seems like you are using gcc as a linker wrapper and not g++

8597994
g++	gcc
try renaming your file to file.cpp and use g++ instead of gcc g++ file.cpp
you have c++ code but are trying to compile it as if it were c gcc file.c c++ is not c and you shouldn t treat it as if it were

8599287
prng	random
other than that use the results that the prng gives you as-is or find a better generator
either you re a statistician cryptographer where you wouldn t be using a normal random function or it really doesn t matter

8600398
sum	coalesce
putting coalesce sum price 0 does not work in mssql if no rows are found
select coalesce select sum price as totalprice from inventory where dateadded between startdate and enddate 0 if the table has rows in the response it returns the sum price

8603066
jar	war
everything is generated by an ant file that 1 build the static files war this also creates the web.xml 2 copies the war into the application resources 3 compiles an executable jar to get the embedded jetty to find and serve your static files add the war with a webappcontext to the jetty handlers hth
i m not that familiar with maven but this is how we approach deployment using embedded jetty we create a single-file jar with the embedding jetty app and the necessary lib jars packed

8603066
jar	war
i m not that familiar with maven but this is how we approach deployment using embedded jetty we create a single-file jar with the embedding jetty app and the necessary lib jars packed
we deploy the static content in a war file which you can package into the jar as well

8605096
serializable	deserialization
see here at oracle for compatible changes to your serializable class
yes after the change in class foo a deserialization of a older foo would set x to a but because you removed a field this does not work

8605105
serializable	deserialization
if you want flexiblity of changing the class internals without breaking the serializable you should use externalizable interface
no if you change order of fields or type of fields the deserialization will not work correctly

8606807
g++	gcc
my g++ 4.6.1 gives this output i specified when i ran configure
tip the configured prefix should either not exist when you do the build or the path should not involve any symlinks - because gcc will build the real path into the binary resolving all symlinks not the value given on the command line

8607936
postgresql	mysql
all is not lost - you really don t have to use postgresql if you don t want to
if your database is small enough which it will have to be since the heroku postgres db is also 5mb and you would prefer to remain on mysql then you could use the cleardb mysql addon - - their entry level db is free and is the same size as the heroku shared postgres db that you get by default but be careful that the number of connections is limited so don t be going crazy with your web dyno counts

8610855
webclient	webrequest
after some fiddling around it looks like the webclient class is not the best approach to this particular problem
to achieve following goal i had to jump one level below to webrequest

8611342
persistent	transient
from the jls section above variables may be marked transient to indicate that they are not part of the persistent state of an object
for example let s say i have a class that represents a sale i ve declared the taxespaid variable here as transient because i can figure it out from cost and taxrate

8613057
mp4	h.264
i ve been trying all solutions listed here and tried other workaround for days but the problem lied in the way i created my mp4
ie9 does not decode other format than h.264

8613103
mp4	h.264
i ve been trying all solutions listed here and tried other workaround for days but the problem lied in the way i created my mp4
ie9 does not decode other format than h.264

8613415
equals	gethashcode
in order to be able to compare 2 instances for equality you should override the equals method and it is also good practice to implement . when you override equals you should also override gethashcode this is used when you put your instances in a dictionary to calculate the bucket
you should not use gethashcode yourselves in order to compare 2 instances of your object for equality

8613681
portrait	landscape
earlier devices were all portrait and the getrotation method does not exist so you ll have to use reflection or similar techniques if you want to support devices that haven t got froyo
the problem here is that some devices are portrait mode by default and some are landscape by default

8615205
innodb	myisam
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario
you can use the merge table type for myisam not available for innodb

8615805
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it is tiny in size colresizable 1.0 is only 2kb and it is fully compatible with all major browsers ie7+ firefox google-chrome and opera
features colresizable was developed since no other similar plugin with the below listed features was found compatible with mouse and touch devices pc tablets and mobile phones compatibility with both percentage and pixel-based table layouts column resizing not altering total table width optional no external resources needed such as images or stylesheets optional layout persistence after page refresh or postback customization of column anchors small footprint cross-browser compatibility ie7+ google-chrome safari firefox events comparison with other plugins colresizable is the most polished plugin to resize table columns out there

8616620
implements	extends
i also always use an abstract class named actionhelper where i extends actionsupport and implements all the necessary interfaces for interceptors
1. please make sure your getters look like this and are not overridden in the class that extends the abstract class i never tried defining the execute method in the abstract class if this is a problem you can maybe just override it in the subclass and return super.execute

8619120
tabcontrol	tabitem
the tabcontrol template i usually use looks something like this
the default behavior of wpf is to unload items which are not visible which includes unloading tabitem which are not visible

8623303
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
para 3 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the speciﬁed size
otherwise ifptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undeﬁned

8624606
innodb	myisam
the official mysql 5.1 documentation acknowledges that innodb does not give accurate statistics with show table status
whereas myisam tables specifically keep an internal cache of meta-data such as number of rows etc the innodb engine stores both table data and indexes in var lib mysql ibdata innodb has no expedient index file allowing a quick query of row numbers

8624899
ilist	iqueryable
you d need to turn it into an ilist to access it by index or query the sessions by some other method using the iqueryable interface for example skip and take
because iqueryable lists cannot be accessed by index using

8628630
google-chrome	firefox
2 the current code uses e4x to make a multiline string to send to gm_addstyle but google-chrome doesn t support e4x
alas the multiline string hack that google-chrome does support for now does not work in firefox

8629015
client-side	server-side
indeed none do unless your file is xml which rather defeats the purpose. client-side processing using javascript is possible but not accessible
server-side processing is a waste of time unless it s user input in which case you should replace the entities before inserting the data into your database

8630570
division	multiplication
for float or double you could try multiplication by the reciprocal which moves the division into compile-time instead of run-time so long as you don t lose too much precision but that s trickier for integral types without resorting to fixed point representation
well shift-and-subtract the general form of replacing with and optionally - commonly seen for power-of-2 divisors is what the division operation does for an int so i m not sure how you d be expected to eliminate it

8630570
division	modulo
well shift-and-subtract the general form of replacing with and optionally - commonly seen for power-of-2 divisors is what the division operation does for an int so i m not sure how you d be expected to eliminate it
if they say to replace it with modulo i d find them hard to take seriously

8631752
client-side	server-side
this library implements client-side flow where only client js app in browser is authenticated against facebook
unfortunately fb does not have a library that implements server-side flow as this would be server-technology dependent and there are just too much server technologies around to support them all

8632159
serializable	deserialization
it is an error to declare a class serializable if this is not the case
to answer sleiman jneidi question asked in comment in oracle documentation mentioned above its clearly mentioned during deserialization the fields of non-serializable classes will be initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class

8633029
client-side	server-side
there is no php-equivalent because php doesn t have access to the client-side dom
it is purely a server-side technology and the output of your php script is the input to the browser

8634648
hash-collision	key
chaining is used to resolve hash-collision situations when different key have the same hash
so it s not about storing multiple values with the same key it s about multiple values whose key have the same hashes

8637063
junit	testng
but yes as far as i know junit doesn t support this
fyi with testng you can specify test at the class level and this will turn all the public methods of this class into tests

8638061
mockito	scalamock
i was going to answer this with a suggestion that you should try scalamock instead of mockito because i wrongly assumed that the problem you were having was caused by mockito not really understanding scala whereas scalamock has been created in scala from the ground up
however that s not your problem and it turns out that scalamock fails when trying to mock httpexecutor because it doesn t know how to handle a type defined in a package object exceptionlistener

8638454
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller will display the title of the uiviewcontroller it s currently displaying that is why you are not able to set it directly
you may try to change the title on your uitabbarcontroller but i m not sure the navigation controller will update it s title after it first appeared on screen

8641155
scala	typesafe
for java it favours ebean in place of hibernate but you ll be able to use hibernate for scala comes with anorm but you l be able to use other libraries more modular easier to pick other components more type safety - views and even routes are checked at compile time better performance typesafe support it s part of typesafe stack less magic not so much bytecode generation and similar stuff more standard play projects are just standard sbt projects different controller api more verbose imho you can compare a simple play 1.x crud controller with a similar play 2.0 one scala is a first class citizen but java is equally supported has native api for each of them hot recompiling is slower it s still on beta let s hope they solve it scala ide support is not as mature as java s but it s evolving nicely async support delegated to akka better prepared for different kinds of datasources like nosql dbs for more info have a look at play 2.0 page spanish translation available here and the rc1 documentation anyway i think the main difference is that play 1.x tried to build it s own stack while escaping away from j2ee now they are part of a new and alternative stack based on scala akka sbt and with the support of a company like typesafe.
here s my list of course with some duplications breaks backward compatibility it s a rewrite from scratch core programmed in scala vs java got to learn scala to collaborate scala for templates but work is being done on groovy templates as a module to ease migration so you have to specify the type of each parameter sbt console instead of python scripts sbt for solving dependencies instead of built-in solution play dependencies command modules availability it will obviously take some time to migrate them all.

8641231
stateless	stateful
this means using a stateless session which does not attempt the fancier web-optimized hibernate stateful session management
the reason netbeans or any other tool that runs your code crashes is simple on large datasets hibernate s stateful sessions take a lot of memory up

8642471
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
nope you ll need to use monodevelop
sharpdevelop is windows-only and not supported on ubuntu

8646359
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
firefox and opera do not have native mp3 support
but google-chrome safari and internet explorer support mp3 natively. i assume you are using newer versions

8647204
icollection	iqueryable
in any event you shouldn t use the count extension method to test whether a sequence is empty because it will enumerate the entire sequence if the sequence does not implement icollection
or as pavel gatilov pointed out if the object implements iqueryable count may unexpectedly execute a database query

8651304
postgresql	mysql
alternatively you could take care of the full_name in ruby and have a separate generated column for the like or check both columns with like also you should be aware that mysql s like is case insensitive but postgresql s is not so you might want to downcase everything to avoid confusion since || is a logical-or in mysql joining the three strings in ruby def full_name and checking product_code and title with separate downcased likes is probably the cleanest portable solution
switching your development environment to postgresql would also be a good idea matching versions with your deployment environment would also be a good idea

8651978
awt	swing
you should never override the paint method of japplet that is an old awt technique and is not used with swing
applets in swing are just like applications in swing

8657003
base	fractions
the ubiquitous ieee754 floating point format expresses floating point numbers in scientific notation base 2 with a finite mantissa
since a fractions like 1 5 and hence 1 10 does not have a presentation with finitely many digits in binary scientific notation you cannot represent the value 0.1 exactly

8658512
listview	gridview
listview with a template and no gridview is an option - just not the option i would use in this case
if it is read only then go with gridview listview

8658788
profiling	debugging
if and only if profiling tells you that parameter validation is a significant bottleneck in your application should you become concerned with minimizing impact points and trimming them out where not absolutely necessary
alternatively you could leave them in for debugging builds and remove them for release builds minimizing the performance impact while still fulfilling their basic purpose as sanity checks

8659660
persistent	transient
it looks like hibernate will not persistent a field with the transient keyword regardless of what other annotations you have
the separate transient annotation will allow you to direct hibernate to ignore a non-transient field for persistence but i don t think it s possible to do the opposite of having hibernate persistent a transient field

8667567
super	extends
the super class is always instantiated implicitly so you cannot do it mdash
plant the super class inside an extends class

8668963
ioexception	filewriter
throws ioexception - if the named file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file does not exist but cannot be created or cannot be opened for any other reason
from the api documentation we can conclude that filewriter does not create a dir if it does not exist filewriter public filewriter string filename throws ioexception constructs a filewriter object given a file name

8669533
serializable	deserialization
this way the field will be skipped on deserialization
by the way the datamodel is also not serializable

8670934
udp	tcp
udp by contrast is not error checked you can t guarantee delivery but you can expect faster more lightweight lower latency performance from it
networks such as skype and online gaming are built on udp not tcp

8670934
udp	tcp
networks such as skype and online gaming are built on udp not tcp
if you really need acknowledgement of receipt you could always build your own micro-protocol over udp using your own cyclic redundancy check for error checking and request response acknowledgement protocol

8672014
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
embed the main view controller not the new one in a uinavigationcontroller
this should add a simulated uinavigationbar to the main view if not set one up under simulated metrics

8675263
multiplying	multiplication
i believe the issue either lies in either multiplying matrices that don t need to be multiplied together or in multiplying matrices in the wrong order
matrix multiplication isn t commutative if you haven t already solved this i would recommend sending all 3 matrices over separately and later dumping the values back to make sure there are no issues sending the matrices over

8677996
viewmodel	caliburn
here is an introduction with caliburn.micro you start view would look like this the attached property tells caliburn to locate the view for the viewmodel which is bound and set the content property of the contentcontrol to it
wpf doesn t support automatic resolution of the view for a given viewmodel

8679396
implements	extends
if you don t need any ui there is no need to extends activity and you can implements other basic component like service
you have not implemented the setcontentview method after extends your class to activity

8679407
dxcore	coderush
there is also a free lite version of coderush called coderush xpress but i just checked and it does not include code metrics. if you re really opposed to installing the whole of coderush devexpress also provides its visual studio plugin technology on which it s built dxcore for free
so you could create your own plugin without installing coderush

8683764
single-quotes	double-quotes
variables are not expanded in single-quotes in php
try putting it in double-quotes

8683805
jar	war
just put the jar anywhere you want in the webapp tree in the war file but not under web-inf which is not accessible from the outside
for the web application the jar of the applet is just a static file that must be served over http by the app just like a css image html or js file

8684024
postgresql	mysql
solution for non-sequential ids if your rdbms supports the cte and window functions like postgresql oracle sql server .
but not sqlite ms access or mysql there is an elegant way there is also the not-so-elegant way that does the job without those niceties

8687746
setinterval	settimeout
or change setinterval to settimeout which will fire itself unless exception is thrown like for example cannot send data to disconnected client
i think the problem is that you fire setinterval every time get_notification event is fired

8688480
requestfactory	gwt
a few notes requestfactory is not a part of appengine see here but an add-on introduced by the latest android eclipse plugin
originally requestfactory was created for gwt

8688480
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
since there are no multiple requestfactory endpoints you can not easily divide them into public no auth required and private secure auth required
with rest and gwt-rpc you can simply have two servlets private and public and set security constraints in web.xml or have your own servlet filter

8690313
udp	tcp
the argument to reactor.listenudp should be a datagramprotocol instance as shown in the udp example
you can t use your qotdfactory with udp so it doesn t need the tcp vs udp selection logic

8690313
udp	tcp
you can t use your qotdfactory with udp so it doesn t need the tcp vs udp selection logic
instead just make a datagramprotocol subclass with your desired protocol logic and let it share a reference to the factory used by your tcp server

8690811
explode	substr
if array_of_stuff is actually set to explode cars books computers foods as you described then the array will have leading spaces before the values other than cars
the in_array function doesn t match substr of the target elements so books will not match against books in the array

8692110
touchesmoved	touchesended
as soon as touchesmoved method is called you have to use setframe or drawrect not sure but which ever works mostly setframe also take the height from cgpoint
refer to my answer in iphone app implementation of drag and drop images in uiview you just need to use touchesbegin and touchesended methods

8692752
ienumerable	icollection
if the signature return type of get is not an icollection then the first will not work if it is not ienumerable then the second will not work
following your clarification to question and in comments i would personally declare the returning type of _item.get 001 to icollection

8692966
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist
count extension method works for all objects that support ienumerable and since ienumerable itself does not have any means of reporting item count it may have to iterate over ienumerable instance using it s ienumerator which can be a real performance hit if called many times
however if you look into count implementation you ll see that it is optimized for icollection types both generic and non-generic at least in fw4.0 meaning ilist and are also optimized and if your object implements icollection which reports item count in count property count method returns item count without iterating through collection

8694074
org.json	gson
normally i use the plain org.json implemantation which is part of android since api level 1 and therefore does not increase application size
for me very interesting was the information found on json parsers performance in the comments as of android 3.0 honeycomb gson s streaming parser is included as android.util.jsonreader

8696662
innodb	myisam
if you need writes not to block reads switch to innodb though there are cases when writes will block reads too
i believe you are using myisam as a storage engine

8697605
setinterval	settimeout
edited in your case you may either use setinterval and clearinterval instead or use a boolean flag to indicate whether to reload or not
to clear a timeout first you need to assign the value returned by the settimeout function to a variable then use cleartimeout to clear the timer

8700040
swt	swing
basically there are the two big and one minor player awt swing swt beyond that there is qt-jambi - which is quite new and not very common
swt provides native libs for win mac and behaves quite well

8704227
union	distinct
minor update because both queries cannot return the same records the default behaviour union distinct is not required and i hope that union all is just a little bit more performant
you can combine two selects with union i don t know how this behaves from the performance point of view but as far as i know this is just like two simple queries with the small overhead from union

8704312
hex	binary
to parse hex data which is naturally text not bytes into its binary equivalent which is a byte array you could use something like the code i posted in this stack overflow answer
it s complete overkill to convert a java library to il just for hex manipulation

8704878
heroku	engineyard
a lot more work than heroku
engineyard are more like heroku in that they aren t just providing you with servers they are providing you with a service and set up stuff for you

8704878
heroku	engineyard
engineyard are more like heroku in that they aren t just providing you with servers they are providing you with a service and set up stuff for you
it s a more traditional service than heroku - you have a bunch of virtual servers allocated to you rather heroku s dyno setup

8707868
ssl	https
i m not sure why their checklist doesn t mention the ssl option but at least in the recent past trying to get encrypted libraries and images from them resulted in an error that directed you to premier maps if you want ssl
the major differences that i ve come across are traffic volume caps are lifted you can make more requests per day you can request map data over secure socket layers https the rest is covered in spoonnz s answer

8710501
g++	gcc
by the looks of it it doesn t look like the g++ tool include the linker so the environment no longer supports the library call
if you use gcc as tool you will include the complete compiler collection so it will compile cpp files with g++

8710893
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the below lines can go to your httpd.conf or you can put the second line alone inside the .htaccess
note the rewritemap definition cannot be used inside .htaccess

8712407
apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
most of the time configuring django on apache comes down to this line wsgiscriptalias path to project bin django.wsgi and django.wsgi is something like this i was also going to recommend nginx + fastcgi as i prefer nginx to lighttpd it s better mantained or at least that s been my perception the last few years
but it isn t covered by django docs and the documentation in the nginx site is not as good

8713069
ssl	https
at a minimum sending passwords and any other sensitive data should be done over ssl tls to prevent someone something not on an endpoint of the tunnel from seeing the data
ideally you will want to run everything over https to prevent session hijacking attacks you can read all about that in the wikipedia summary

8714581
implements	extends
you can implements it by keeping a list of keys for ordering
you can extends the default dict and use __missing__ method to call a loading function if the key is missing and the output the loading happen only when the key doesn t exist yet. one evolution would be to store only the n last element in the dict and purge the oldest entries

8715060
serializable	deserialization
if the constructor of class a is called that s because class a itself does not implement serializable
during deserialization the parameterless constructor of the first non-serializable class in the inheritance hierarchy is called possibly that of java.lang.object

8715966
phpunit	simpletest
phpunit works fine with every continuous integration server since it outputs all standard log files for code coverage and test reports
simpletest does not

8717285
realloc	malloc
moreover you must update this number every time you use realloc or free
sizeof cannot be used to find the amount of memory that you allocated dynamically using malloc

8717354
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s javascript console said i had to drop the www part of the ajax url for it to match correctly with the origin url and it worked fine then
in my case same code worked fine on firefox but not on google-chrome

8717732
.htaccess	httpd.conf
loadmodule rewrite_module modules mod_rewrite.so try ensuring that the directory entry in httpd.conf for your server doesn t contain allowoverride none as this will prevent the .htaccess from being used in the individual directory
it should look something like this note the allowoverride all also in httpd.conf make sure that .htaccess is actually the name apache expects for access files

8719278
coldfusion	railo
glassfish is not a coldfusion server
it is possible to deploy j2ee versions of adobe coldfusion railo or openbd using glassfish

8719419
implements	extends
if you need to view your model as a map then implements an asmap method or something similar which renders that view
i have a few model classes that extends they define getters and setters which wrap the map s get and put methods this is a classic example of when not to use inheritance you re finding that some other piece of code jackson is treating your class like an instance of its superclass which isn t what you want it to do

8719627
implements	extends
example a is the parent class with the getstring method. b extends a and implements the getstring method. c extends b doesn t have to implements the getstring method. hope that helps
short answer isn t possible. long answer you could try get around this by doing the following instead implements in the parent class this causes the child class to need to implements the getstring method

8720148
stateless	stateful
so just be aware that if it doesn t work for the mdb case it may not be your fault the workaround would be to simply have your mdb delegate to a sessionbean of any kind as stateless stateful and singleton all have requestscoped tests
making the ejb itself scoped while stateless singleton and messagedriven can have scoped references injected via inject they cannot be requestscoped or any other scope

8720148
stateless	stateful
making the ejb itself scoped while stateless singleton and messagedriven can have scoped references injected via inject they cannot be requestscoped or any other scope
only the stateful model is flexible enough to support scopes

8720500
stateless	stateful
while stateless singleton and messagedriven can have scoped references injected via inject they cannot be requestscoped or any other scope
only the stateful model is flexible enough to support scopes

8727155
mp4	webm
for example you can play mp4 videos using the video tag in internet explorer 9 google-chrome 6 and apple safari 5 but not firefox 4.0 or opera 10.6
for those two you would have to convert them to ogg or webm videos

8728278
jqplot	highcharts
you ll have to cache the jqplot files in your browser since they do not allow hotlinking
re-reading the docs you are correct that highcharts redraws the whole plot

8729161
uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller
but before just let me tell you that hiding uitabbar unlike hiding uinavigationbar is not animated
so to me hiding tabbar is not a user-friendly approach unless you create your own subclass of uitabbarcontroller that animates hiding the uitabbar

8729412
super	implements
the initializer pattern is necessary because the super class whose initializer you are calling can return any kind of object not necessarily the instance of that class
that s how for example nsstring works it s actually a cluster of classes implements different kinds of strings optimized for different usage patterns

8731313
namedtuple	dictionary
quoting the docs namedtuple instances do not have per-instance dictionary so they are lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples
instead of moving to full dictionary you can try using a namedtuple instead

8731943
tstringgrid	tlistview
i have just spent a lot of time working with tlistview in view style mode vsreport and i find it is even more limited than tstringgrid for example it provides no in-place edit support
instead for a new person i recommend you stay with the tstringgrid until there is something you need to do which you have not specified

8732340
implements	extends
alternatively it would be easy to implements this function in xpath 2.0 as an xsl function in your stylesheet
unfortunately xqsharp does not natively support the exslt functions which are a set of functions designed to extends xslt 1.0

8733244
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i suspect that viewdidload is getting called on the detailview before it is a part of the uinavigationcontroller and therefore it might not have a navigationitem at that time
put this in viewwillappear animated self.navigationitem.title target

8734211
glut	glfw
i think you just need glut for it to work
i also prefer glfw before glut mainly because glut isn t maintained actively

8734568
octal	hex
not long ago if at all it would have been decimal and octal instead of decimal and hex or maybe octal only no decimal
all the forms are human readable though the 0x symbol or an h at the end or some folk use 16# or to all indicate hex very human readable i know this is a hex number and know how to read base 16 hex

8736369
postgresql	mysql
quoting is different mysql uses backticks for quoting identifiers whereas postgresql uses double quotes
like is case insensitive in mysql but not in postgresql

8736369
postgresql	mysql
like is case insensitive in mysql but not in postgresql
this leads many mysql users to use like as a case insensitive string equality operator

8737685
inline	inlining
so i d say that size will inline in virtually all cases where you don t seriously obscure the class type somehow.
whether or not arraylist.size will ever be inlined depends on a number of factors but yes at least in theory if you reference size enough times and if all the other inlining criteria are met then it will be inlined

8743037
consistency	acid
since you are considering using sessions in the first place i take it as consistency of the data is not the number one priority
if the data is important you should use the mysql database since it follows the acid principles and will keep your data even after a client disassociates itself with the current session

8743401
udp	tcp
so just produce any packet tcp http or udp which will contain it
usually it is done by udp on some port which is not blocked

8744872
puma	thin
or puma
i believe thin s --threaded flag handles each request in a new thread but spinning up a native os thread is not cheap

8747742
jar	war
if you are determined to get the path leading to your resource you can retrieve its url and then parse it like this there is however a caveat your resource may be read directly from the jar archive not from a flat file in your filesystem and thus not really accessible via a file object
the above snipped worked in jboss which includes tomcat but jboss explodes a war archive before deploying it - not sure if a pure tomcat will do this as well

8751067
http	spdy
spdy is basically a variation of http s that accelerates web page load time
websockets is not http even though it has an http compatible initial handshake

8751792
dns	spf
in practice you have to add something like the following txt and if possible the newer spf dns records see spf record syntax for more information
also note that from address is not checked at all by spf you can use whatever domain you want

8754632
udp	tcp
in your case i would personnally choose tcp because you will probably end up reimplementing tcp in some form inside of your udp packets otherwise ask for block syn answer i have block syn ack ok send it to me ack ...data push ack .
ok done rst also generically speaking udp is the way to go when you want to broadcast and you dont really care if the data gets there or not meaning there is either high redundancy or low importance integrity.

8755102
udp	tcp
also you should probably use udp instead of tcp in a video chat application since it is more important that data arrives timeously than that all data arrives but that is a whole different topic
if you can use zeromq with udp and you ll have to research that i see no reason why you couldn t use it for video chat

8756358
spaces	delimiter
grep -1 file.txt will return all lines in whcih any colum is -1 assuming the file is spaces delimiter
that s not as clear as it could be so again in monospace grep -1 file.txt the spaces before and after the -1 are important

8757180
daemons	systemd
a single systemd bus always available and used by systemd daemons and services and any number of session buses 1 one for each x11 session running to which your own programs connect
compiz connects to the session bus since it is a user program not a systemd daemon and lacking the privileges and can be running in multiple sessions if all instances connected to the same systemd bus only the first one could claim the bus name

8757210
cpython	pypy
cpython comes from pyrex question 2 not sure if i get it correctly but maybe the answer is psyco a just in time compiler jit for python code the predecessor of the pypy jit
question 1 nuitka direct python code to c++ shedskin compiles implicitly statically typed python to c++ stand-alone programs or extension modules cpython from a superset of python to c extensions

8757252
daemons	systemd
i believe clock_monotonic may still slow down and speed up under the direction of the ntp daemons
most of the time the ntp server does not make discrete adjustments to the systemd clock it only slows it down or speeds it up using adjtime in an effort to keep the drift rate under control

8757356
onchange	onfocus
you cannot use onchange as that is triggered after the user chooses an option from the dropdown
i would use onfocus instead although onmouseup and onmousedown are suitable alternatives see my updates to your jsfiddle

8759328
calloc	malloc
achieving this for now there will be two families of memory management routines the standard malloc calloc etc functions specialized versions of malloc calloc etc with dynamic libraries on linux is trivial and does not require the complicated scheme you have concocted nor the ld_preload or dlopen suggested by ugoren
when you want to provide specialized versions of malloc and friends simply link these routines into your main executable

8759650
equals	gethashcode
as a rule of thumb if you override equals you need to override gethashcode as well but this is not necessary in your case as the default is what you are looking for
if your classes are only equals if they are same instance then you don t need to do anything to use them in a dictionary

8759650
equals	gethashcode
classes reference types are considered equals if and only if the refer to the same object
from the documentation of gethashcode for derived classes of object the gethashcode method can delegate to the object.gethashcode implementation if and only if that derived class defines value equality to be reference equality and the type is not a value type

8760668
archetypes	dexterity
as the initial developer of dexterity i m quite biased but dexterity is cleaner and more modern dexterity is more consistent with the rest of modern zope and plone dexterity has less boilerplate and dexterity types generally use less code dexterity lets you evolve from through-the-web schemata to filesystem development without throwing away your work and starting from scratch dexterity arguably has more better documentation than archetypes see plone.org products dexterity as well as my book professional plone 4 development dexterity is stable and seems to be the preferred choice for many new projects these points are basically the reason dexterity was started so they re not accidental
archetypes will certainly not go away any time soon and will probably exist as part of plone core and possibly eventually and add-on for a long long time

8761557
vbscript	jscript
while i m unaware of any performance differences it will generally be easier to find code samples people who have done it and other forms of support using vbscript
not many people use jscript for classic asp most prefer vbscript

8762691
equals	compareto
from the docs public boolean equals object x compares this bigdecimal with the specified object for equality
unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equal only if they are equal in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by this method . your scales are different

8762878
prepare	execute
use pdostatement getcolumnmeta as you are doing but use prepare instead of query
so it will parse your query but not execute it or attempt to fetch rows of results

8763419
octal	decimal
and from the ecmascript 3 standard when radix is 0 or undefined and the string s number begins with a 0 digit not followed by an x or x then the implementation may at its discretion interpret the number either as being octal or as being decimal
implementations are encouraged to interpret numbers in this case as being decimal

8763754
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome the rounded corners will not hide overflow if the div is absolutely position but if you put in a non-absolutely positioned div and apply the rounded corner css to that and set overflow hidden it should work ok something similar here how to make css3 rounded corners hide overflow in google-chrome opera
ok to redeem myself i think that this can be fixed in google-chrome by nesting the image inside another div

8764292
namenode	hdfs
you should do this stop all hadoop services delete dfs name and dfs data directories hdfs namenode -format answer with a capital y start hadoop services also check the diskspace in your system and make sure the logs are not warning you about it
warning the following will destroy all data on hdfs

8765091
serializable	deserialization
i ve copied it to github in case anyone has improvements to make at any point additionally the jquery.deserialize plugin will now correctly deserialize checkbox values serializable with checkboxesasbools and ignore checkboxes that are not mentioned in the serializable data
one reason for using non-standard checkbox serialization that isn t addressed in the question or in of the current answers is to only deserialize change fields that were explicitly specified in the serializable data - when you are using jquery serialization and deserialization to from a cookie to save and load prefererences

8765874
equals	gethashcode
that is breaking the rules of equals and as a result dictionary will not work for you
the rule of equals gethashcode is from if two objects compare as equal the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

8767315
decimal	ieee
in ieee float single precision normalize that we have to shift the decimal place 16 places to the left so the exponent is biased so we add 127 to 16 and get 143 0x8f
it is a positive number so the sign bit is a 0 we start to build the ieee floating point number the leading 1 before the decimal is implied and not used in single precision we get rid of it and keep the fraction sign bit exponent mantissa 0 10001111 1110001000001000... 0100011111110001000001000... 0100 0111 1111 0001 0000 0100 0... 0x47f10400 and if you write a program to see what a computer things 123400 is you get the same thing 0x47f10400 123400.000000 so we know the exponent and mantissa for the first operand now the second operand normalize shift decimal 12 bits left the exponent is biased add 127 and get 139 0x8b 0b10001011 put it all together 0 10001011 010100111000000 010001011010100111000000 0100 0101 1010 1001 1100 0000... 0x45a9c00 and a computer program compiler gives the same 0x45a9c000 5432.000000 now to answer your question

using the component parts of the floating point numbers i have restored the implied 1 here because we need it 0 10001111 111100010000010000000000 - 0 10001011 101010011100000000000000 we have to line up our decimal places just like in grade school before we can subtract so in this context you have to shift the smaller exponent number right tossing mantissa bits off the end until the exponents match 0 10001111 111100010000010000000000 - 0 10001011 101010011100000000000000 0 10001111 111100010000010000000000 - 0 10001100 010101001110000000000000 0 10001111 111100010000010000000000 - 0 10001101 001010100111000000000000 0 10001111 111100010000010000000000 - 0 10001110 000101010011100000000000 0 10001111 111100010000010000000000 - 0 10001111 000010101001110000000000 now we can subtract the mantissas

8767881
division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
you aren t checking for divide by zero before you do the division
it is not clear why you always do a division even when the operation is an addition or subtraction or multiplication

8767881
division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
it is not clear why you always do a division even when the operation is an addition or subtraction or multiplication
you should do the division only when necessary i ve left variable c in place as it makes it easier to debug the values

8769256
persistent	transient
and you re not even guaranteed to have an id assigned after persistent has been called
what persistent does is to make a transient entity attached to the entity manager

8770922
rational-numbers	fractions
well actually the first isn t exact either if we print the result out with more precision we get 0.62500000000000011102 and printing the intermediate results to full precision to get the most accurate result possible you have to employ a more complicated algorithm for example parse the string as a rational-numbers and convert from that
a quick partial solution is to parse the fractions part to yield numerator 10 k powers of 10 with nonnegative exponent can be represented exactly as double s for a while for exponents 22 assuming 64-bit ieee754 double s and the numerator can be represented exactly too if the fractions part is not too long

8770922
division	addition
then you have only one point where an inexact result occurs due to necessary rounding the final division and the result is supposed to be the closest representable number to the exact mathematical result
a further point of inexactness is the addition of the fractional part to the integral part. the above will produce good results for input with not too big integral part and short enough fractional parts but it will be very wrong for long fractional parts

8771703
slug	permalinks
of particular interest are _menu_item_object - the type of menu item page custom or category _menu_item_object_id - the id of the actual post or category if it s a category that the menu item references _menu_item_menu_item_parent - the heirarchical parent structure of the menu which can be different than the post parent relationships _menu_item_url - the slug of the menu item if it is a custom link menu item sample sql statements to perform the above described operation looks for a menu item with the name of top and gets the term id loads the data for the menu based on the term_id of 3 note that this sql statement will work for pages and custom menus i don t have any categories so didn t include that
the data loaded will allow you to build the permalinks using the siteurl from the wp_options table and appending the post_name to the end technically it s not getting the parent structure but wp finds the page post properly without it update a commenter asked about assembling the child menu items with the parent menu items

8772646
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here are the features multiple file select progress-bar in firefox google-chrome safari drag-and-drop file select in firefox google-chrome uploads are cancellable no external dependencies doesn t use flash fully working with https keyboard support in firefox google-chrome safari tested in ie7 8
firefox 3 3.6 4

8772814
vbscript	jscript
also code that is quite succinct if vbscript yeah i know you didn t expect me to say that becomes more cumbersome since jscript doesn t understand the concept of a default property as vbscript does
typically server-side code means working with adodb and i found that was a bit nasty looking in jscript

8773004
antialiasing	transparent
you might also be able to use sifr scripted 1 inline flash replacement to substitute in a small flash movie clip that allows you to antialiasing the font however you please but flash is hardly ubiquitous and it s not a very efficient nor elegant solution
so if you absolutely need this functionality i would suggest making transparent pngs with photoshop and using background-image and text-indent -9999px to replace the text with the image

8773027
implements	extends
now i can define an array of columns which form the foreign key in the relationship with the following syntax please note that my solution only applies to a 1-to-1 relationship because in my case there s no need to implements it for 1-to-many although i suspect this would require a similar modification
after a lookup in the source code i found out that kohana orm doesn t support the feature i described and i had to extends the orm module which is because of kohana s nature a piece of cake to implements multi-column fk s

8774988
setinterval	settimeout
not setinterval
you want to use settimeout

8776392
prepare	execute
and since you expect the exception to be thrown by the prepare method you should disable the pdo attr_emulate_prepares feature
otherwise the mysql server doesn t see the statement until it s execute

8780880
haskell	sml
olin later addressed this all he said was good point but i want consistency between the two functions. state-value first srfi-1 sml state-value last haskell note in particular his use of state-value which suggests a view where consistent types are a possibly more important point than operator order
the haskell definition is not uniform

8781583
strcpy	strncpy
also it s advisable not to use strcat strcpy as they can easily exceed the buffer
better use strncpy at others which get the buffer size and won t write more

8782495
udp	tcp
udp on the other hand offers no such guarantee
it cannot happen that you receive data in a different order on the application side over a tcp socket

8783507
udp	tcp
networked games are almost always done with udp sockets
udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

8784360
ienumerable	ilist
first it is not a minor change if you swap all your ilists out and replace with ienumerable
the major difference is that you can get deferred execution with your ienumerable while you always have eager execution when using ilist

8787594
jar	manifest.mf
in addition the meta-inf manifest.mf file and the certificate files and are added to the jar file with a now timestamp
so even if you decide not to compile the classes and use the ones already compiled the ones with the original jar s timestamp your resulting jar will be binary different. manifest.mf entries ordering note that the key-value pairs in the manifest.mf file are represented as a java.util.hashmap which does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.

8787594
jar	manifest.mf
so even if you decide not to compile the classes and use the ones already compiled the ones with the original jar s timestamp your resulting jar will be binary different. manifest.mf entries ordering note that the key-value pairs in the manifest.mf file are represented as a java.util.hashmap which does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.
so you may run into another binary difference when signing the jar files using jdk v5 and jdk v6 jarsigner tool as the order of the manifest.mf entries may change so basically there are two levels of the problem

8789525
queue	fifo
this makes the queue order appear random from user mode
the implementation is still a simple fifo but because of io it doesn t look like one from a higher level of abstraction

8790840
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort is a good one but you may run into memory issues
i ve used heapsort with much success but it s not guaranteed to be stable though i ve never had problems

8792019
persistent	transient
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse
assuming your transient properties are of type string integer or similar it is inconceivable that they would have a significant impact on application performance

8792761
dictionary	map
if the dictionary is precomputed a single time and stored for future use the access will be much faster since no new data structures will have to be created for each evaluation only a string concatenation and a dictionary lookup are needed
try this option using dictionaries of course if the x+y key is not present in the map it ll produce a keyerror which you ll have to handle

8794517
serializable	deserialization
many languages vb.net and c# for instance don t allow serializable based on a constructor enabled class
because when deserializing a class that was serialized it would have to go through the constructor which is impossible in deserialization process because it s not part of the usual code path

8794992
direct3d	gdi
you can not use any direct3d drawing between getdc and releasedc calls as the surface is excusively locked out by dxgi for gdi
however you can mix gdi and d3d rendering provided that you call getdc releasedc every time you need to use gdi before moving on to d3d

8795410
serializable	deserialization
this means that somewhere further up the chain this class is being pulled into another class and that class is the one being serializable
the issue is that depending on how konstant is embedded in this class for example if it is in a collection or a generic list the datacontractserializer may not be prepared for its appearance during deserialization

8796391
udp	tcp
and further down in the article the wcf-based implementation of udp is a one-way channel so they are really only talking about how udp in wcf is implemented and not wcf in general
from the article you mentioned wcf exposes multiple network protocols most notably tcp and is extensible to other network protocols by writing a wcf transport channel

8797731
cpython	pypy
so how is it possible for pypy to be faster than cpython also becomes fairly obvious
pypy has a better implementation including a jit compiler it s generally not quite as fast without the jit compiler i believe which means pypy is only faster for programs susceptible to jit-compilation

8801023
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter has different class naming
all codeigniter classes begin with ci_ while kohana doesn t use any prefixes

8801023
codeigniter	kohana
all codeigniter classes begin with ci_ while kohana doesn t use any prefixes
the only solution i can think of for you would be to refactor kohana session class rename it everywhere or do it with phpbb libraries

8801350
aggregate-functions	sum
time use an appropriate aggregate-functions min max avg .. for each field that is not contained in the group by clause to ensure you get the right value
here i inserted both start and end time for the measure timespan using min and max or include it in the group by clause i did that for unit in the example because you get a wrong result when using sum on both megawatts and kilowatts

8804452
apache	nginx
it s a way to put parts of the apache configuration erverywhere on the filesystem and to tell apache to check the filesystem at every request to see if you do not have some special configuration in place. the only real usage of .htaccess file is to delegate a small part of the configuration to the user if you are a host provider and wanted to allow some web server configuration for your users
nginx configuration is compiled when nginx restart

8809439
factors	matrix
later transformation to a data.frame makes them into factors
this can be fixed with or better not making matrix to begin with this is enough to make a graph though it looks like there is only one line there are actually 4 all on top of each other

8810463
uicontrol	uibutton
hidden uicontrol s do not respond to events this includes ed elements
however if you do not remove the uibutton from its superview it might not get deallocated until the superview is deallocated since the superview retains it

8811456
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
based on your experiences this could be google-chrome firefox safari - websockets ie opera - xhr-polling
i d be surprised if the general speed of the connection over time was different between web browsers but the reason you ll see a delay in the initial connection in internet explorer and in opera is that native websocket support is not available as it s been disabled by default

8811775
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you re only allowed to call setcontentview once i think
i think if you are going to call findviewbyid from inside the declaration of a clicklistener you d have to use your activity.this explicitly like so otherwise i think it is going to try to call a findviewbyid method of a onclicklistener class which doesn t exist

8817147
serializable	deserialization
if the same field consume header and resume from assign list to member if necessary single basic values on the other hand are processed as read header that maps to a value field read value from stream assign value to member note no looping more complex values objects would be processed as read header that maps to an object field read existing object from member merge sub-object from sub-stream or create new object if trivial assign object to member if necessary there is a subtle exception to this in the case of tuple-like data with implicit contracts where for implementation reasons the values are all held in locals until the object s stream is consumed and then the constructor is invoked the order of the parameters to the constructor is implicitly the tag ordering here prepare a local variable per field default values etc consume the sub-stream with the logic as above but assigning to the local variables not members invoke the constructor if you mean how is it serializable then it is serializable in ascending tag-order as per guidance in the wire spec - however it makes a slight exception here in the case of inherited which it implements on the wire via a sub-object for the subclassing
your title asks about deserialization - for which the answer is usually in the order they are encountered in the stream - it assigns data directly to members or adds to lists as it sees it

8819687
implements	extends
a different part of your code may only care about defining lots of concrete animals like dog s bird s etc. with all the details of how they actually implements all their features
by making the concrete classes dog bird ... extends a common abstract interface animal you can use a any now and future concrete class in a library written for the abstract interface -- you don t need to ask the library author to change the library to accommodate new animals and the library author doesn t need to know how features are concretely implemented

8824938
g++	gcc
the string char literal step may involve non-standard behavior which may not work outside of g++ worse than constexpr but that is portable
apparently gcc allows be interpreted as d which allows this to work at least on g++-4.6 and 4.7 but it won t compile on clang which says non-type template argument of type const char is not an integral constant expression

8826112
floating-point	fractions
this is the feature of computer floating point arithmetics scs cclass progintro sx5.html it s important to remember that the precision of floating-point numbers is usually limited and this can lead to surprising results. the result of a division like 1 3 cannot be represented exactly it s an infinitely repeating fractions 0.333333... so the computation 1 3 x 3 tends to yield a result like 0.999999.
instead of 1.0. furthermore in base 2 the fractions 1 10 or 0.1 in decimal is also an infinitely repeating fractions and cannot be represented exactly either so 1 10 x 10 may also yield 0.999999..

8826953
prepare	execute
here is an example if you want a template little different in it s language and syntax then you might be used to...do not name a variable the same name as a column name for example...or be prepare to shift to dynamic sql to build a statement in a variable using plpgsql and execute the variable as sql
execute it like a function not the execute syntax oracle or ms would like

8826963
hex	binary
your program prints bad out that in binary as if it were printable characters though its not not in hex
it works here once i pipe it to a hex dumper so i can read it but i m on linux

8827326
jlist	jtable
as already mentioned in the comments you probably want to look at a jtable instead of a jlist if you want headers
since you asked for guidance the best we can do is provided you with the link to the swing tutorials in particular the jtable tutorial a name-drop of the most important concepts of working with tables will not hurt either

8830923
implements	extends
although we can implements anything to our desire but there are few flaws in your class designs in regards to abstraction
a bouquet is a collection of rose so it shouldn t extends rose but rather have it as a list inside it which you have anyway

8832083
implements	extends
firstly if you don t go with the model of having an activity use anonymous listeners or implements the listener directly that suggests you ll have a whole load of activities which may be extended at some point using your helper class listeners
each time you extends your activity you need to make sure the separate class is updated to cope with it - potentially an out of sight out of mind problem where you want something new from an activity which your generic listener doesn t handle

8833750
profiling	instrumentation
you could start by using instrumentation time profiling and see if there is any part of your code that is taking longer than necessary
you could also use the instrumentation core animation tool which can be used to flag parts of your screen that not drawing animating efficiently

8835439
implements	extends
implements only the selectabledatamodel interface is not sufficient
you also need to extends an datamodel implementation such as listdatamodel

8836572
firefox	safari
the iframe was not loading in safari but it was loading in firefox
and it was also loading correctly in safari on another computer

8836596
super	extends
this is a way to tell mychild extends myparent and call the super constructor of the latter at first
a quick fix for that is to do this this will result in this actually the extends myparent is not like in java

8837847
serializable	deserialization
as with anything serializable you would need to write special handling by implementing readfields
while i have never actually dealt with a container that would swap out a servlet by serializing it and i honestly can t really imagine when a modern container would do this but i have always understood that init is called exactly once for the servlet in its lifecycle so it would not be called again on deserialization

8838768
onclick	onchange
the first so question linked by you gives you the answer use the onclick event instead and check the radio button state inside of the function it triggers
as you can see here the onchange attribute is not supported for radio buttons

8840347
super	self
this restistions also applies to super . this might behave weired if the attribute you want to retrieve is some weired kind of descriptor
edit if you want the code in the update to your question to work as desired you can use the foloowing code this passes the proxy object as self parameter to any called method and it doesn t need the original object at all hence i deleted it from the constructor

8840352
postgresql	mysql
if you are using mysql it would seem you potentially have the following choices albeit none of them particular awesome switch over to postgresql
if my anecdotal evidence and the lack of complaints regarding postgresql in the ticket are any indication it might not be a problem then

8842814
ienumerable	ilist
ilist and list do not define their t as out while ienumerable does
list is a class so can t have out and ilist does not define out because it accepts inputs of type t

8843478
udp	tcp
udp is not point 2 point protocol like tcp so using one server socket bind to specific port you can handle hundreds of clients
it make no large sense to create multiple socket on one udp port

8845868
awt	swing
swing offers components functionality not available in awt such as jtable jtree support for formatted documents rtf simple html in swing components
for more information see things that swing provides beyond awt

8849589
google-chrome	firefox
try to terminate requests manualy it may also be a firefox firebug issue showing aborted connections as running test it in google-chrome
update in firefox 3.0+ only script and jsonp requests cannot be cancelled by a timeout

8854366
fgetc	getline
this was confirmed when i compared my release mode times about 20 µs using getline and 48 µs with fgetc
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

8855116
uiview	subviews
the general method to resize a uiview based on its subviews is sizetofit this method resizes your uiview automatically
if you wanted to constrain the size you ll need to use sizethatfits this method does not resize your uiview automatically rather it returns the size

8859101
oncreate	setcontentview
you re setting the text to hh in the oncreate so clicking it would not change it
also you are calling setcontentview twice so the second time just invalidates everything you ve already coded

8859282
oncreate	setcontentview
there are two things that could be happening here 1 you forgot to call the setcontentview method in your oncreate method
2 your id r.id.back does not exist in the xml file you loaded with setcontentview

8865020
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval sets up a repeating timeout which doesn t seem to be what you want also i think you want to pass a callback to load to be sure you re fading it back in only after the ajax request is complete
i think you want settimeout instead of setinterval

8866108
portrait	landscape
if your changes have no effect upon the portrait display then one file should be good
if not you will want a layout file for portrait the current one and then an adjusted one for landscape mode

8866722
factors	mean
i m still not sure how column a factors into it
it seems you want to create a new column that has two levels which create mean values for column b

8866883
postgresql	mysql
if you re not tied to mysql postgresql does have an extension for gmp which is pretty slick
there is not a suitable extension to do gmp within mysql

8868419
persistent	transient
if you read the message and the stack trace of the exception you ll see that this exception is not thrown by the call to persistent but by the flush error during managed flush persistent doesn t issue any query and doesn t save anything to database
it just asks the entity manager to make a transient entity persistent

8869795
qunit	sinon
its cause qunit doesn t have spies or mocks
but you can use the sinon mocking framework

8872200
gtk	cairo
gtk widget get_window returns a null glib refptr since the widget has not been realized just yet
based on the gtkdrawingarea documentation you need to hook onto the draw signal to handle drawing where your cairo context is already created and handed to you

8872464
vbo	vao
first off vao only remembers the last vertex attribute bindings and vbo binding for an index buffer the gl_element_array_buffer_binding if there is one
so it does not remember offsets in gldrawelements you need to call that later when using the vao

8873549
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview
that is because you can t call findviewbyid if you don t have called setcontentview which is in your oncreate method
you have to declare your edittext and textview in the oncreate method not in the body of your class

8874850
google-chrome	firefox
see a demo here escape key is not working in google-chrome i have changed it to enter key
i think this is a firefox specific issue

8875050
profiling	debugging
for prior versions i have made use of visual studio - make use of sql profiling print stmt by having a parameter to decide to print or not these are to be used and tested in non-prod environments only
in sql server 2008 we can make use of the debugging start debugging

8875096
google-chrome	firefox
not yet but google-chrome 18 will support css filters released later this year
svg filters is only supported by firefox

8875374
ssl	https
the only practical way to do this is to set up a reverse proxy in front of your app - such as with nginx or apache - and have it proxy ssl traffic to your app
the dev_appserver doesn t support https

8876427
client-side	server-side
it would have just made the client-side code of my application more complicated
the biggest thing that should be considered about client-side vs server-side templating is that client-side templating will not work if javascript is disabled on the client for whatever reasons

8877086
mef	prism
to answer your question yes you can use autofac as a di container with prism but then you are missing the possibilities of module loading and many more things prism provides with the mef unity container
edit just a quick side note mef is not a real di container

8877314
postgresql	mysql
it works in mysql but i have not tried it in postgresql
the information_schema schema is part of the ansi sql standard so postgresql will quite probably have it as well

8881813
persistent	transient
if a clonecopypolicy is used then the object from the persistent context will be cloned into the shared cache preserving the transient fields
if a instantiationcopypolicy is used then a new instance will be created for the shared cache and transient will not be preserved

8882386
persistent	transient
first problem persistent doesn t insert in database
it only makes a transient entity attached

8883051
momentjs	datejs
check out the docs for momentjs this should do the trick for you var foo moment stringdatevalue mm-dd-yyyy hh mm
you might want to take a look at momentjs i believe datejs extends the native javascript date object and might not be what you want

8883051
momentjs	datejs
you might want to take a look at momentjs i believe datejs extends the native javascript date object and might not be what you want
i am pretty sure momentjs is was inspired by datejs does not extend the native date object

8883250
multiplying	subtract
my only concern is that i had to multiplying the offset by -1 even though the time interval offset itself is negative
this doesn t make sense because we are trying to subtract from the nsdate rather than add to it

8885730
strcpy	strncpy
edit i m not 100 sure that was the actual motivation for its design. it s arguably not a string function and it s not just a safer variant of strcpy
you can achieve the equivalent of what one might assume strncpy does given the name using strncat this will always 0 -terminate the destination buffer and it won t needlessly pad it with extra 0 bytes

8886805
daemons	systemd
i personally use a modified verison of the init script found here which is as follows but pay attention in case you use that init script to start up the fastcgi daemons do not use any init tools like service monoserve start rhel centos or rcmonoserve start
for me this will not work i suspect the init systemd will spawn another process with different environment variables

8887980
g++	gcc
in the gcc 4.5 release notes g++ now implements dr 176
previously g++ did not support using the injected-class-name of a template base class as a type name and lookup of the name found the declaration of the template in the enclosing scope

8889546
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
you do not need an sqldatasource and an objectdatasource
as you have pointed the gridview to the sqldatasource datasourceid sqldatasource1 the object data source is infact useless

8889612
stateless	stateful
why stateless session beans
stateful session beans sfsb are not exactly what you think they are

8890007
svg	vml
svg has for a long time been an international standard for vector graphics and is now supported as part of html5 - vml has been supported since ie5 and svg since ie9
i ve developed apps in vml in the past - but been very disappointed that ms did not support the industry standard svg

8890007
svg	vml
i ve developed apps in vml in the past - but been very disappointed that ms did not support the industry standard svg
i ve recently developed a new c# app that uses an ie browser component to view large diagrams rendered as svg vml or png bitmaps

8890889
dictionary	map
that s certainly a mutable key value dictionary
it s not clear what you re doing with nsmutabledictionary but if it s simple key value lookup then some implementation of map whether it s hashmap or something else is appropriate

8892510
carrierwave	fog
i dont think you can do this with carrierwave by default but you can workaround this by this monkey patch since you cannot access the rails session request info from the uploader any model you need to define the before_filter in application_controller to load the request data i have tested this patch only in local storage mongoid
i dont know how this will work in amazon s3 fog

8892885
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has a bug getting the size of a popup window to soon so you have to work around that
the fact is that google-chrome firefox and newer ies doesn t allow resize of tabbed windows and windows not opened by window.open google-chrome at least

8893594
rvm	bundler
your use of oh my zsh together with rvm could be the cause
i googled for zsh rvm and found where it says at the bottom if you want to use oh my zsh be sure not to use the bundler package. if rvm should take care of everything this would do for you anyways

8893726
innodb	myisam
innodb is journaled and can recover from crashes where myisam can t much like ntfs vs fat filesystems
myisam has full-text indexing innodb doesn t

8893726
innodb	myisam
myisam has full-text indexing innodb doesn t
innodb has transaction support commits and rollbacks myisam lacks these

8895037
implements	extends
i stumbled across this post while looking to implements jscrollpane on the extjs 4.0.7 grid i couldn t find anything else suitable and i now have this terrible hacky way of doing it apply this to your grid config scroll false and this to your grid s viewmodel so that the internal scrolling is switched off
apply this function to your grid that extends ext.grid.panel the general idea is that layout is called way too many times to know what s going on internally so we ll check the condition of the grid view

8896175
realloc	malloc
note how the last bullet point also fixes the realloc scaling bug mentioned above
c does not decide anything if you have allocated something yourself with an explicit call to malloc it will stay allocated until you free it or until the program terminates typically

8896512
innodb	myisam
if you re using innodb as the table type then you ll be able to make absolutely certain you get the correct id with by simply wrapping the whole thing in a transaction
myisam doesn t have transactions but it s behaviour when getting the last insert id is based on the connection

8899961
udp	tcp
if the fault persists then tcp will not get through as surely as udp
in fact in this case tcp has the disadvantage in that it will attempt to complete a lost cause for longer

8900184
implements	extends
they ll probably be very fast as they aren t implements in r but in low-level c
which makes it in fact even harder to extends them despite the general extensibility of gnu r

8900344
mvp	presenter
mvp means the presenter intimately knows about the view and model so it can wire them together and handle ui inputs
it therefore follows that there is a presenter for each view as they are customized pairs most likely not interchangeable

8900618
jar	war
first according to the proguard documentation you should not have any classes in your war project notably class files that are in the web-inf classes directory in a war should be packaged in a jar and put in the web-inf lib directory you need to refactor your project so your web classes are built in a separate jar
once you have built that jar project you must add it as a dependency in your war project

8904736
g++	gcc
to link c++ code you need to use the g++ command not the gcc command
when compiling the gcc command knows that it s compiling c++ code because of the .cpp suffix but it s a good idea to use the g++ command anyway

8906760
multiplying	division
so the quotient in case of 5 9 is 0 and since you multiplying by 0 tempc comes out to be 0
in order to not have integer division atleast one of the two operands must be float

8906803
equals	compareto
remove will not use compareto rather it will use equals to find the object to remove
you need to override equals on your class as well

8909156
struts	wicket
well you have taken the whole concept wrong.there is no way to compare struts or any other framework with ajax. ajax is the way to load a small chunk of data from the server based on the user requirement.ajax is being in to the market place to enhance the user experience so that we need not to refresh the page every time we want some part of the page to get changed
on the other hand struts1 struts2 or any other mvc based framework spring mvc wicket etc are there to build a complete web-application and you can take ajax as a tool to enhance the user experience

8909549
extjs	gxt
extjs gwt 2.x doesn t support uibinder the reason being the absence of public api to create custom element parsers in gwt
you can add a component gxt windows but that s it you can t add child elements under gxt window since there s no element parser for any of the gxt window superclasses

8909849
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
you can declare it to throw runtimeexception because methods can always throw unchecked-exception whether you specify them in a throws clause or not
so specifying that it can throw runtimeexception is redundant

8910048
knitr	latex
if you do have spaces knitr will be able to produce the output with the long lines wrapped with so will sweave i think if you set
this is a difficult and extreme case because you do not have spaces among those a s so latex may not be able to wrap the words

8913495
rdf	owl
in jena an individual is defined as a subject of a triple whose predicate is rdf type and whose object is not one of the built-in language classes
so if you have ex my_car rdf type ex ferrari . ex ferrari rdf type owl class . note this example is entirely fictitious

8913495
rdf	owl
so if you have ex my_car rdf type ex ferrari . ex ferrari rdf type owl class . note this example is entirely fictitious
then ex my_car would be an individual but ex ferrari would not because owl class is a built-in type

8914772
inline	inlining
the javadoc for the nullprintstream method gives a clue the compiler however cannot be permitted to inline access to them since they are later set to more sensible values by initializesystemclass
this is a coding hack i guess to prevent the compiler from inlining a simple return null implementation

8915529
super	self
using super isn t the only pattern to call base class methods though
if there are no diamonds in your multiple inheritance pattern you can use explicit base class calls for example b.__init__ self param_a

8915541
awt	swing
for awt swing j components because block eventdispatchtread and by wrong implentations for thread.sleep yoour gui will be freeze os stay un_responsible use javax.swing.timer for dealying any event in the swing 6 post here a sscce that demonstrating your real uissues instead of bunch of un_relatted code and with somw anothere missed maybe yes maybe not important classes
1 use java naming conventions correctly player1 should be player1 etc 2 don t use pre_historic awt canvas use swing jpanel jlabel or jcomponent same for 3 don t use keylistener because required focus for your canvas easiest is use keybinding 4 you have issues with concurency in swing use javax.swing.timer rather than wrong implemntations for runnable#tread 5 never use thread.sleep math.max 0 difference

8915739
accelerometer	gyroscope
you can use external cues gps magnetic field gyroscope gravity horizon etc to try to align them but given only a single arbitrary reading form the accelerometer the information just isn t there
definitions acceleration vector this is the x y z reading from the accelerometer and each reading will depend on the phones orientation sometimes written as a a x a y a z

8915790
xslt	xquery
that tells the outer xquery to treat those as literal curly brackets in the xslt
if you were invoking the xslt from an external document with xdmp xslt-invoke you wouldn t need the extra brackets

8918317
equals	compareto
this link provides a good explanation between equals compareto .
use equals instead to compare strings if b.equals c compares the references not the values so you re getting false every time

8918513
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
all these things work even in opera
but there is one bad bad thing the rendering of central part of border-image is a kelly hell there is a difference not only between webkit and mozilla but even between the safari and google-chrome so i added a lot of hacks there

8919112
factors	mean
though i find it more fun than most web programming factors in all basic psychologies for gaming the system can be a very time consuming process and may not be what you have in mind unless you happen to work for digg itself or be a part of a serious start up
here s the php.net standard deviation although i think this so answer is more to the point z-scores standard deviation and mean in php code samples may be nice but we would need some of your data to do so and even then this could get quite complex

8922134
rsa	aes
generally speaking rsa shouldn t be used to encrypt large amount of data as it s quite time consuming
should be used to encrypt key to symmetric cipher like aes

8922987
google-chrome	firefox
this will look ok in google-chrome because it does not ask by default where to put the downloaded file and put all files into pre-configured download directory
i think that in firefox the user will see pop-up that asks what to do with file download or open for each file separately

8925617
inline	inlining
then it can inline the call to the function and the result would be similar to the result with std sort
but in practice compilers tend not to take the first step inlining qsort

8930008
mp3	wav
from working with sound in the flex documentation although there are various sound file formats used to encode digital audio actionscript 3.0 flash player and air support sound files that are stored in the mp3 format
they cannot directly load or play sound files in other formats like wav or aiff

8931394
arraylist	treeset
if you need to sort it only once no adding elements later then just put it to arraylist and use sort method
it will be optimal - o n log n update as jb nizet mentioned in the comment set treeset cannot contain duplicates

8936049
implements	extends
when you design construct implements cfcs as objects that reflect the entities of your application you re speaking a common langauge oo
it means that it is not offers you the ability to design a system based upon a proven structure it extends that language of oo-ness to programmers in other technologies

8937389
dictionary	map
i do not know what you represent by the key of the dictionary but you can create a new intermediate entity with keys of employee employeeleaveentitlement and dictionary key and map this as a collection in your employee class
dictionary types can not be mapped with entity framework

8937730
g++	gcc
note that there are several extensions in use for c++ source code including .c .cpp and .cxx all of which are accepted by g++ as well as .c
there are multiple problems here the c++ compiler in the gcc gnu compiler collection is g++ not gcc

8938250
firefox	safari
firefox is the only browser that allows this
chrome safari and opera do not allow it in the first place while ie is just fooling you that it can but won t actually submit the file selected this way

8938430
quicksort	heapsort
once you have a better grasp of heapsort you may want to look into the introsort algorithm which combines quicksort heapsort and insertion sort to produce an extremely fast sorting algorithm that combines the strength of quicksort fast sorting on average heapsort excellent worst-case behavior and insertion sort fast sorting for small arrays
introsort is what s used in many implementations of c++ s std sort function and is not very hard to implement yourself once you have a working heapsort

8938990
g++	gcc
or use #include cmath with g++ you can check the default include path of gcc by echo | gcc -v -e -
generally cmath is in c++ g++ s include path not gcc

8938990
g++	gcc
generally cmath is in c++ g++ s include path not gcc
use #include math.h with gcc

8943675
addition	multiplication
so in this case what would happen is logically the same as also c# does not do every multiplication before every addition
for example is computed as see the leftmost addition happens before the multiplication

8943738
cassini	iis
my original testing was done against cassini vs 2010 s built-in web server
i pushed locally to iis 7.5 and found this error http error 404.15 - not found the request filtering module is configured to deny a request where the query string is too long. which appeared because i didn t specify the maxquerylength in the section of my web.config as well as the

8944404
ienumerable	iqueryable
yes i would also like to be the extensive extension methods on ienumerable to instead be virtual members but alas they re not
you re running ienumerable s extension method where instead of iqueryable s

8944447
implements	extends
i finally found it after browsing castle validation source code the default validation is prototypewebvalidator and this validator uses prototypevalidationgenerator for client side validation and this implementation doesn t do anything when you call setvaluerange so that seems logical that my client side validation is not working the prototypevalidationgenerator didn t implements this functionnality mainly because the underlying validation api didn t impement it as well
so i decided to extends this because it s a framework and it s the purpose of a framework provide a frame and let you work in it

8944929
tabcontrol	tabitem
perhaps try using the dispatcher to set the selecteditem so it occurs after the tabcontrol changes it s selection
or make it so if the user tries to switch to the newtab it cancels the selectionchanged event so the selected tab doesn t actually change of course the selectedtab will be your newitem since the mousedown event will have occurred when i did something like this in the past i actually overwrote the tabcontrol template to create the addtab button as a button not as a tabitem

8945972
openssl	m2crypto
using dependency i discovered that the openssl libraries were not installed into the python home folder
this was because the script that makes the m2crypto distribution package has a feature which does not include these files

8951536
kerberos	ntlm
using this results in the bind operation being attempted using kerberos which being not ntlm of course will not exhibit the special behavior described above
however the bind attempt using kerberos will fail the password being wrong and all which will result in another attempt being made this time using ntlm

8951536
kerberos	ntlm
the following code shows how you can perform credential validation using only kerberos
the authentication method at use will not fall back to ntlm in the event of failure

8951633
express	node.js
you don t need express so far.
node.js http request does not generate the appropriate header content-type so just add it manually

8952573
comparator	comparable
providing your own comparator is how it s supposed to be used and it s definitely not an ugly hack
right at the beginning this queue orders elements according to an order specified at construction time which is specified either according to their natural order see comparable or according to a comparator depending on which constructor is used

8954658
boost	stl
parts of boost that look like value types such as your matrix example probably do not have any special thread safety support at all leaving it up to the application
most of boost is similar to most of the stl and the c++ standard library in that creating two instances of a type in two threads at the same time is ok

8955835
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure if it should work per specs but in some browsers google-chrome you can set the letter-spacing css property on the element itself and it will be applied to all text drawn on the context
works in google-chrome v56 does not work in firefox v51 or ie v11. note that in google-chrome v56 you must re-get the canvas 2d context and re-set any values you care about after each change to the letter-spacing style

8956059
vim	textmate
the downside is it requires vim to be compiled with ruby support
this is not a direct answer to your question but i think it s even better you should check out the command-t plugin inspired by textmate s go to file

8956948
inline	inlining
with ghc 7 you can instead make it so that it can be specialised and perhaps inline at each use site
i don t know what happens down the llvm road but at the core-level map fromjust and takewhile are not yet inline so if you re desperate enough you can get maybe a few tenths of a percent by inlining them manually if they aren t inline later in the llvm backend but those are very cheap functions so the gains - if at all present - would be small

8957095
dictionary	map
you either need to copy the contents of the dictionary that you passed in into the class member availableexits or you need to treat the map that you passed to the constructor as having changed ownership and instead of allocating the map within the class assign to this.availaleexits in the constructor
the problem is that you are passing the availableexits dictionary to the room constructor but you are not doing anything with the data that you pass in

8957464
implements	extends
extends thread and implements runnable is useless thread already implements runnable
you pretty much always want to implement runnable and not extends thread

8958914
vim	emacs
python lets you set the encoding of files with vim emacs style comments
put a comment at the top of the file like this if you use vim or this if you use emacs if you use neither vim nor emacs then it doesn t matter which one

8959044
spaces	delimiter
this string cannot contain spaces control characters or the character
the use of this delimiter string allows the user to have characters within raw string literals

8959323
google-chrome	firefox
i heard that in firefox the script is not always working but this is how to install it google-chrome follow this link and you should be prompted whether you want to install this extension
firefox ensure you have the greasemonkey plugin installed

8960346
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if the specified obj argument is null the method throws a nullpointerexception
if the specified object is not an instance of the class or interface declaring the underlying field the method throws an illegalargumentexception

8960436
innodb	myisam
foreign keys works only with innodb in mysql
myisam doesn t support them the statements are ignored

8962675
jar	war
you can easily create two artifacts - a jar and a war
i m not sure what the advantage is of having your .class files in a jar as opposed to web-inf classes

8965970
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
update in response to xonegirlz s update above the parent navigation controller the uinavigationcontroller has no knowledge of your uiviewcontroller - you have linked the views together in the view hierarchy but not the view controllers together in the controller hierarchy
if you are targetting ios 5 you can call on the uinavigationcontroller to inform it of the child

8966684
onclick	onsubmit
on that button you can add an onclick handler that calls form.submit
when you submit the form programmatically the onsubmit handler is not fired

8967084
equals	gethashcode
but x and z are not equals
gethashcode must return the same value for two equals objects

8967084
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode must return the same value for two equals objects
since equality is not transitive in this system you can prove that gethashcode needs to return the same value for all objects which causes your dictionary to act like a linked list but with more storage overhead that gets wasted

8967174
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
if you want to see a browser not use double buffering try opera 9.10 out
i haven t noticed any obvious flicker in firefox google-chrome or ie9 even when the drawing is slow so it seems like that is what they are doing but how that is accomplished is a mystery to me

8967408
super	self
the problem occurs when foo of class b calls super foo
when super foo class a reaches the nslog statement self class returns class b and not a

8971482
gif	ico	png	ico
although new browsers support gif and png images but i would suggest always saving the image as favicon.ico
favicon icon behaves differently for different browswrs sometimes if it works in ff does not work in ie. try after clearing the cache of the browser and standard code for favicon ico is just put below tag in your index file or whichever common file for your project

8972120
udp	tcp
i suspect the problem here is simply you are using udp like it is tcp
udp is packet based but a doesn t guarantee that the packets will arrive in order and b doesn t guarantee that packets won t be dropped or duplicated

8972300
nunit	mstest
if you are willing to jump ship the nunit equivalents for classcleanup classinitialize can be applied to static instance methods
answering your question as far as i know - no there isn t a non-static equivalent in mstest

8977668
bash	subshell
the bash documentation says in its section about pipelines each command in a pipeline is executed in its own subshell ... in its own subshell means that a new bash process is spawned which then gets to execute the actual command
each subshell starts successfully even when it immediately determines that the command it is asked to execute doesn t exist

8980892
kmz	gpx
not all programs arcgis use it but it can be handily converted to a kml kmz keyhole aka google earth and vice-versa
i have found that moving geodatabases between gis editors gps navigators and gps handheld units to be most easily accomplished using a program that converts gpx to kml

8981502
webkit	gecko
i know this is the cause but i cannot find where the input would be getting this style because it doesn t appear in the webkit ua stylesheets
in gecko the extra vertical padding on and in gecko is due to user-agent stylesheet containing and

8981763
setinterval	settimeout
the latter should not work because it calls poll immediately and passes its return value undefined to setinterval so i really can t understand why it worked for you
i m trying to get settimeout to call the poll function every 2 seconds it is not the .settimeout method calls the function you pass it exactly once after the specified delay

8981895
cpython	ironpython
cpython is like c++ like ironpython is a dynamic language and has access to dynamic libraries which in turn translates to being forced to write everything
ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython

8981977
intersect	contains
cgrectcontainsrect checks if one rectangle completely encompasses another not just if they intersect
from your coordinates the rectangles don t contains each other but just intersect

8982267
ubuntu	debian
if it was installed using the ubuntu debian package manager try sudo apt-get remove --purge python-setuptools updated if you installed manually probably the setuptools final location will be something like adjust for your environment python version usr local lib python2.6 dist-packages just delete the setuptools stuff there
lame i know but it is your burden for not using the excellent package manager provided by ubuntu stick to dpkg unless you need bleeding edge stuff

8983749
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you could use a linkedhashmap instead you could add the entries in alphabetical order but if you can change the map type you may as well use a treemap
it is not a big hassle to use a treemap

8984779
junit	jmock
one more thing you don t need to set the fields in the test class to null junit flushes the instance for every test
jmock isn t thread safe

8985289
bazaar	git
the truth is that git is clearly winner as of january 2012 among other dvcs git hg bazaar etc. if you will count how many projects hosted on github
and not only because git is superior but because github is so nice as well

8985465
mvp	presenter
this will make it easier to provide a mock implementation of ifooview for unit testing which is after all a big advantage of using an mvp mvc mvvm pattern
if you do not have any data coming from a back-end service or database then in the case of simple applications it is ok for the presenter to take on the role of the model as well

8989786
uiview	calayer
the most proper route which sadly isn t yet available on ios would be your mkoverlay is at some point being used to create an mkoverlayview which will have a calayer as it descends from uiview
you can attach cifilter s as compositingfilter s to calayer s which dictate how the view is composited with the background

8990447
.htaccess	httpd.conf
testing to test whether .htaccess is enabled or not just put some junk text in it and see if it generated a 500 internal error or not
make sure you have this line in your httpd.conf allowoverride all allowoverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files

8991318
prng	random
in particular the seed must be an unsigned int which doesn t have enough bits for a good prng
they recommend using the svid random number functions of which nrand48_r is probably what you re looking for

8991806
monkeyrunner	adb
this is not unique to monkeyrunner
it appears that adb shell input text suffers from a similar problem

8992549
junit	jmock
actually there are two types of problem that i have which i thought to be one a log4j problem in junit
you can actually continue with the junit + jmock even if log4j is not configured properly it will throw an exception but won t stop junit execution

8996405
uiview	calayer
note that there s a layer property in uiview of the type calayer
however coding directly with uiview is easier but it doesn t expose the full powers of core animation

8996405
uiview	calayer
however coding directly with uiview is easier but it doesn t expose the full powers of core animation
coding with calayer does expose you to core animation and a dozen of other apis

8996465
spaces	delimiter
whether it is a bug or an artefact of some sort i don t know but i found out that if i store the results of find to a temporary file and later load them from it into findstr no extra spaces is produced
i couldn t find any other way to fix the extra spaces issue so here s the modified version update 2 following additional comments since values in the files are tab delimiter you can include the delimiter into the search string just after the searched term to prevent matching aaa with aaa bbb

8996465
spaces	delimiter
i couldn t find any other way to fix the extra spaces issue so here s the modified version update 2 following additional comments since values in the files are tab delimiter you can include the delimiter into the search string just after the searched term to prevent matching aaa with aaa bbb
so instead of find i you would have find i where the wide spaces after i is the tab character

8996894
prepare	execute
if the element has a src attribute does not have an async attribute and does not have the force-async flag set the element must be added to the end of the list of scripts that will execute in order as soon as possible associated with the document of the script element at the time the prepare a script algorithm started
the task that the networking task source places on the task queue once the fetching algorithm has completed must run the following steps if the element is not now the first element in the list of scripts that will execute in order as soon as possible to which it was added above then mark the element as ready but abort these steps without executing the script yet

8997771
matlab	simulink	s-function	simulink
for an s-function you need to make sure your c matlab or fortran code is where simulink expects it to be
my guess is your code exists but isn t in the directory simulink expects

8998183
serializable	deserialization
even without using .net and just using this direct sql insert statement for example the xml declaration is not saved into the database with the xml now in terms of the op s question the object to be serializable still needs to be converted into an xml structure from the mymessage object and xmlserializer is still needed for this
however at worst instead of serializing to a string the message could instead be serializable to an xmldocument - which can then be passed to sqlxml through a new xmlnodereader - avoiding a deserialization serialization trip to a string

8999059
multiplying	multiplication
something close is possible personally i find this way more intuitive than because mathematically multiplying functions doesn t mean anything
depending on the interpretation of the operator it may mean composition so but definitely not multiplication of the results of invocation

9001017
implements	extends
basically if your class implements atleast one interface jdk dynamic proxies are used
if you have a class mydaoimpl extends mydao and in your service you inject the dao reference via mydaoimpl mydaoimpl jdk dynamic proxies will not work if the annotations are on your interface as class bases proxies are created with proxy-target-class true and transactional annotation is not inherited

9001220
draggable	droppable
you should make the div.drop s droppable append the draggable on drop and use the revert invalid option so that the draggable reverts if it s not dropped on a droppable
containment restricts the movement of a draggable within the bounds of the given element s

9007058
clutter	cairo
clutter uses cogl for rendering but it can also use cairo for 2d elements
clutter will not replace gtk+ gtk+ is a very complex library that provides system integration complex widgets and other utility api that clutter has no interest in providing

9007987
strcpy	malloc
in c the header for strcpy is string.h not strings.h
in addition to answers about stack space malloc and undefined behavior

9009817
equals	gethashcode
let s say your class looks like this let s say you define equals so that two instances of frob are equals if their foo and their bar are equals but foobar doesn t matter
then you should define gethashcode in terms of foo and bar

9010981
xslt	xquery
if the variable seq is an xs sequence element then the sort key for an element named e is count x xs element name| ref e preceding-sibling so you can just plug this expression into an xslt sort as probably needs a bit of finessing for namespaces or other things you might encounter but you get the idea
if you only have xs sequence to worry about and not choice repetition and so long as the schema isn t written to use lots of complex features like named model groups and substitution groups and wildcards then it shouldn t be too difficult at any rate if you use xslt 2.0 or xquery and forget about trying to code it in java

9011128
requestfactory	gwt
if you use gwt-rpc or requestfactory then you ll also need server-side java classes on your app engine
no gwt modules are not needed for app engine

9011340
spaces	delimiter
the delimiter in this case is the last spaces before ftp or http to break down the regular expression
it s failing because you are splitting on a url not on a delimiter

9012866
mp4	webm
in your site s source firefox doesn t support mp4 videos for html5 video
you can add additional sources webm ogg and fallback to a flash player

9013807
super	extends
doctrine 2.x entities work as popos plain old php objects . to achieve extends correctly doctrine enforces you to use a concept from jpa called mapped super classes. the idea is pretty simple
whenever you want to have a base class and want your entities to extends from it i m not talking about inheritance at db level all you need to do is create your base class as a mappedsuperclass

9016018
mvp	presenter
you can show as many views as you need it is not about mvp pattern
from view perspectives mvp describes relation between model-view-presenter but any view could have child views with own presenter and bound model

9017259
strdup	malloc
you could do this instead or maybe as pmg notes strdup isn t standard
implementing it using malloc + memcpy is a nice exercise

9020973
allocator	stl
the standard way to control memory management within an stl container is through allocator
you cannot use separate allocator for the keys and values because std map only accepts one allocator template parameter

9021131
boost	allocator
you could use a boost flywheight or a boost optional
though not exactly like the standard containers they allow factory allocator strategies and you could use that

9021133
bazaar	git
you are looking for a version control system bazaar git mercurial subversion note that the first three do not require a central store whilst subversion does
i would suggest bazaar

9022008
nunit	mstest
you can hook it up to database or xml file - not as straightforward as nunit s feature but does the job
since nobody mentioned - not exactly the same as nunit s value or testcase attributes but mstest has datasource attribute which allows you to do similar thing

9022512
hex	binary
nchar or nvarchar data utf-16 become two bytes each in big-endian format so n abc becomes 0x410042004300 for converting hex to binary in formats 1 and 2 each two input hex digits become one byte if input is not valid hex an error occurs whitespace and punctuation are not allowed see msdn if you need utf-8 please see my answer here for a udf which will convert text to utf-8 compute md5 hash of a utf8 string
from sql server 2005 onwards convert does what you want convert varbinary 2000 00001340132401324... 2 the styles for converting to from binary are 0 raw data ascii codepoints become binary bytes utf-16 codepoints become two bytes each

9022664
hash-collision	key
most likely because another entry has the same hash hash-collision
if the slot is occupied cpython and even pypy compares the the hash and the key by compare i mean comparison not the is comparison of the entry in the slot against the key of the current entry to be inserted dictobject.c 337 344-345

9022835
hash-collision	key
most likely because another entry has the same hash hash-collision
if the slot is occupied cpython and even pypy compares the hash and the key by compare i mean comparison not the is comparison of the entry in the slot against the hash and key of the current entry to be inserted dictobject.c 337 344-345 respectively

9024960
oncreate	findviewbyid
this is because the system swapped out the first activity and on returning only onresume is called but not oncreate so there is no chance to load the layout again there
i think the point is that when the user resumes the activity the layout is not set and thus a findviewbyid has no anchor to look for and thus returning null

9024960
oncreate	setcontentview
you may just move the call to setcontentview from oncreate to onresume given that you are not referencing views in oncreate
for normal usage this makes no difference as in the android lifecycle onresume is directly called after oncreate and before the user can interact with the activity

9025034
client-side	server-side
i then use this js smarty engine for client-side processing
if the client does not support javascript i can gracefully degrade by just sending the php associated array to the smarty renderer server-side rather than sending it to the json parser

9027284
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome doesn t have scrollbars on os x lion
google-chrome on pc will not display vertical scrollbars unless it needs to

9027333
union	distinct
for the comparer could be as simple as this edit as pointed out in comments distinct is not needed if we apply the custom email comparer to union
you can just union the lists and do a dedupe using distinct once on the combined list

9028081
google-chrome	firefox
i don t have much time to test this right now on all the browsers but it worked on google-chrome 18 and ie9 basically we just do a settimeout with a fixed 100ms delay to allow time for the browser to get the window ready
note that the original answer which was the same principal added an extra check for the readystate of the document but the readystate isn t consistent across browsers for example firefox 9 has a window state of uninitialized until you populate a url or something else on the page

9028826
ssl	https
from your example it s not clear whether you re implementing https for example or your own protocol over ssl tls
rfc 6125 is the latest specification in this area which unifies practices around multiple protocols https ldaps imaps ...

9031081
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
even though addition is faster than subtraction the second implementation reduces the chance of bit overflow caused by addition of large values its not completely eliminated because there is still very small chance since n+1 is there in the formula
but both are equally prone to bit overflow by multiplication

9033462
profiling	debugging
if you don t go as far writing assembly and you don t do daily profiling and this is strictly c it s not worth changing how you write
1 there would be -- in debugging

9034465
jar	war
even if the packaging was not jar #8210
say for example it was war #8210

9034508
implements	extends
the subclass actually implements it the system-default socketimpl implicitly retrieved from socketimplfactory.createsocketimpl in the socket constructor in turn relies on a native method so it s not possible to know the inaccuracy in a platform-independent way
-- edit response to comment if not using a socket subclass that specifies a custom socketimpl via the protected socket socketimpl impl constructor the standard socket instance created by the socket constructor uses a sockssocketimpl which in turn extends plainsocketimpl

9034600
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie took the undefined value simply as not present therefor the string was parsed till the end
however in firefox the substring function failed completely returning the whole string

9036366
cassini	iis
a little reading asp.net dev server cassini iis express and multiple threads
the asp.net dev server cassini cannot handle multiple threads

9036891
cdr	cons
cons persons newp creates a new pair and puts persons in the car and newp in the cdr so when you re done what s in the car of persons is not one of those person-objects
you might find that cdr persons is a person-object though and that you can do send cdr persons getage just fine

9038823
jar	manifest.mf
this is a sample manifest.mf of squryl jar which i built locally manifest-version 1.0 implementation-vendor org.squeryl implementation-title squeryl implementation-version 0.9.5-rc1 implementation-vendor-id org.squeryl specification-vendor org.squeryl specification-title squeryl specification-version 0.9.5-rc1 main-class org.squeryl.logging.usageprofileconsolidator but this can be configured in your build.sbt or build.scala for example
i am using sbt 0.11.2 and sbt adds the manifest information to the jar without any additional configuration i am not sure why you have that problem

9039039
exponent	modulo
in particular if the public exponent is very small not the case here as pycrypto uses 65537 or you encrypt the same material for many different recipients again probably not the case here since each message has its own secret key then a simple mathematical calculation would allow the attacker to recover the rsa plaintext
to avoid this attack the value that is encrypted with rsa needs to be close enough to the rsa modulo so that the encryption operation actually performs a modular exponentiation

9040526
addition	multiplication
also to do operations such as addition and scaling you just need to work on the reduced elements in the array and not on the full matrix
matrix multiplication is a little tricky but doable

9041012
keystore	jks
some application use a keystore file stored in it s usually implied that it s a jks file since jks is the default keystore type in the sun oracle java security provider
not everyone uses the .jks extension for jks files because it s implied as the default

9041012
keystore	jks
java uses its keystore class and related api to make use of a keystore whether it s file based or not
jks is a java-specific file format but the api can also be used with other file types typically pkcs#12

9041012
keystore	jks
when you want to load a keystore you must specify its keystore type
the conventional extensions would be .jks for type jks .p12 or .pfx for type pkcs12 the specification name is pkcs#12 but the # is not used in the java keystore type name

9041629
dictionary	map
when you re using a c++ template a you need to create an alias for it in your .i file so you can use it in python now let s say you want to wrap a function that looks like this on the python side you need to pass a map_string_string to foo not a python dictionary
it turns out that you can easily convert a python dictionary to a map though by doing this so if you want to call foo you need to do this here s full example code that works

9041813
memcpy	memmove
memmove is like memcpy except the destination and source array can overlap
with memcpy you promise that the regions are not overlapping which allows the implementation to perform some additional optimizations

9041813
memcpy	memmove
with memcpy you promise that the regions are not overlapping which allows the implementation to perform some additional optimizations
so memcpy can be faster than memmove

9043233
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller class reference displaying a toolbar uinavigationcontroller class reference configuring custom toolbars uiviewcontroller class reference settoolbaritems animated
you should not mess with the uinavigationcontroller s view tree

9045502
division	multiplication
i ve also taken the liberty to replace division by two with multiplication by 0.5f because the arm processors do not have a division instructions therefore the divisions are executed by software and rewritten as multiplication anyway
it s possible the compiler already optimizes this but nevertheless good practice to avoid division operations if you can

9046212
cobertura	jacoco
i am now switching some of my projects over to jacoco from cobertura and am very impressed by the integration and results - both in maven reports as well as eclipse
not sure about competing solutions but jacoco can even be configured to fail a build if certain thresholds of code coverage are not met

9048570
postgresql	mysql
first of all order is not valid postgresql syntax
you probably borrowed the syntax style from ms sql server or mysql

9050681
implements	extends
the general idea is that you can create the driver once initialize it with the popup implements editor then call edit on the driver each time you are ready to display it with a new model
i usually end up with something like assuming the class extends popup implements editor and has the driver defined internally to flavor this answer with my own approach biases i like a mvp setup where the view and presenter are both interfaces and where the presenter impl doesn t know how the view will end up drawing

9051416
uiview	subviews
i m not saying that uiview is likely to stop retaining its subviews but if you keep a non-retained reference to a subviews and later remove that subviews from its superview you re code is likely to crash
some folks do use assign for outlets pointing to subviews when they know those subviews will never be removed

9052993
uiview	subviews
uiwindow is a subclass of uiview
adding a view directly as a subviews to the window is not usually recommended so instead you should try and add the view as a subviews to the top controller view

9054568
strtol	atoi
btw maybe you would like to use strtol instead
no need to dereference atoi expects a not a char

9054631
macports	homebrew
this is to ensure that even if you have say usr local bin and sw bin in macports will not find things there
i don t know whether homebrew and fink do this too

9055500
piston	tastypie
i am looking for piston specific recommendations to solving these problems
i have already branched my project and started to play with this forked version of piston i m not familiar with this as i use tastypie

9055980
uiview	subviews
you need to make sure that there is a top-level uiview object which is not added as subviews of any other view and that there is a uitableview in the uiview
the uiview should have a referencing outlet view - file s owner

9058164
implements	extends
the downside is that you have to implements one doit for each number of parameters
i ve only implemented it for one- and two- parameter functions but it shouldn t be a problem to extends this update sometimes it might appear that you can get away with having f as the first argument

9058636
octal	decimal
if you computed a string in your interpreter perhaps it would surround it with quotes or something. it would make most sense if your program outputted the string of the octal representation rather than a number which when printed looks like it
first of all a number is not decimal or octal

9058636
octal	decimal	octal	hex
this happens to be possible since any octal representation is also a valid decimal representation of some number
this wouldn t be possible with hex for example. in other words you are converting a number to its octal string representation then parsing that string into a number as if it were a decimal representation

9058636
octal	decimal	octal	hex
this wouldn t be possible with hex for example. in other words you are converting a number to its octal string representation then parsing that string into a number as if it were a decimal representation
for example take the number 42 whose decimal representation is the string 42 and octal representation is the string 52

9059411
typemock	nmock
or you can use a tool like typemock microsoft.fakes etc if you absolutely cannot change your existing code
moq and nmock rhinomock will not help you here

9061679
onresume	onpause
i had a similar problem and realised that onproviderenabled is not immediately called onresume
i ended up not unregstering my listeners in onpause but instead unregistered them in ondestroy

9062070
cpython	pypy
cpython you usually have to change your program a bit so that it becomes fast in cpython and the changes aren t really python code but an extension of it shed skin if it can cope with your program
i think there s no real alternative only using python as psyco does pypy which is increasingly becoming the only python alternative doesn t support extension modules so right now many of projects can t migrate but if yours isn t one of those it can be a nice approach if you can t use pypy right now after doing a profile session and confirming things can t be speed up anymore in plain python the path is usually one of c c++ extension module my personal favorite -- works on any platform and using boost python makes this process pretty simple and straightforward although if you don t know c c++ this may not be so easy

9066506
client-side	server-side
if you mean controlling instance of httpsession on client-side simply you cannot control the session on client-side since it lives on server-side
for controlling the session you have to call to the server-side with asynchronous callbacks or with another technique

9067745
uiview	subviews
a much much more elegant solution is to use a uiview subclass though this isn t always appropriate and recalculate all your subviews on a parent s frame change and be smart only recalculate them if the new frame size has changed use cgrectequaltorect to compare the new frame when you override setframe and before you call
the only catch to this is that the uiviewcontroller you intend to use should probably listen to keyboard events or you could do it in the uiview itself for handy encapsulation

9071767
realloc	malloc
if you knew a priori how much address space to reserve then you d probably not be thinking of calling realloc in the first place though
if you re gambling on realloc never moving always growing then you ve probably got bigger problems to worry about anyway and switching to malloc + copy + free can t possibly solve that

9071767
realloc	malloc
if you re gambling on realloc never moving always growing then you ve probably got bigger problems to worry about anyway and switching to malloc + copy + free can t possibly solve that
besides the check your return value properly point the most interesting point from the second article is a warning about do not realloc your buffer by 1 byte at a time

9071767
realloc	malloc
they warn this is guaranteed to churn your memory heap this is a potentially valid point but it s not a criticism of realloc itself
the same would happen if you used malloc +copy+ free

9078758
serializable	deserialization
and not because of any bug in moose thread queue or threads. a solution is to pass around the object in a serializable form
you could handle serialisation and deserialization yourself or you could use thread queue any to have it done implicitly

9079276
sudo	passwd
the script would probably just look something like g4rb4geb4rg3 is the passwd spawn sudo mount -o loop home user1 desktop adirectory system.img expect passwd send g4rb4geb4rg3 r expect eof
programs like sudo read the passwd directly from the terminal device not from stdin so this is unfortunately not a trivial thing to do

9079437
decimal	ieee
no c# decimal doesn t follow the same rules as ieee 754 floating point numbers
the c# 4 specification is quite clear on how it should behave 4.1.7 the decimal type is a 128-bit data type suitable for financial and monetary calculations

9080288
magento	expressionengine
thinking you can format magento blocks any better in a cms such as expressionengine and use magento just for the backend will put you on a hiding to nothing to end up with a fairly useless setup that isn t going to go anywhere
those that fail to learn magento are doomed to reinvent it badly. performance on magento is a problem on shared hosting however on a modest virtual server with caching on there is no performance problem

9080922
uiview	subviews
i would suggest you to categorize uiview to find the first responder as under this category on uiview which calls on the uiwindow and traces for the first responder
the problem is that uitextview is not firstresponder in your case as per the subviews hierarchy of your app

9081490
boost	stl
just an extra check for sanity regarding moving a file in standard c++ i would probably copy the file as above and then delete it doing something like aside from using something like boost i m not convinced there s another standard portable way to delete a file
i like the simple streaming approach using standard stl operators the idea here is that there is an for std ofstream so you simply pass it the streambuf associated with your input stream

9082486
jboss	glassfish
then you can download any java ee compatible application server glassfish was jboss etc etc. and deploy your applications
the downloadable java ee sdk from oracle.com includes not only the java ee apis but also implementations of these apis glassfish application server the reference implementation

9084065
persistent	transient
if you don t want a field to be persistent and still you use field access for your entities you should either annotate it as transient as nimchimpsky pointed or use java transient keyword
the column annotation doesn t mean that the field is going to be persistent

9084395
stateless	stateful
stateless beans are pooled therefore they have performance benefit over stateful beans also their main purpose is processing without holding any state
sensitive or user specific data shouldn t be stored in instance variables of stateless beans

9085087
jsf	seam
update there is also a third option to create a custom jsf validator not validator method register it with seam and apply it to the input text
you might have a seam or tag around your input text s

9086015
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
you can not even throw it yourself opera 11.52 uncaught exception typeerror domerror is not a constructor uncaught exception typeerror domerror is not a function it s also an interface in java s dom implementation domerror
it s not implemented in firefox source google-chrome 17 has it neither

9086589
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
you cannot use a pointer allocated with as an argument for realloc
the pointers working with realloc have to come from the malloc family of functions malloc calloc or realloc

9086917
haskell	agda
this is impossible to do in haskell functions cannot return types
you can simulate this behaviour using type classes and type families but let us for illustration change language to the dependently typed language agda

9086917
haskell	agda
this tells us that the type of nat is set whereas in haskell nat would not have a type it would have a kind namely
in agda there are no kinds but everything has a type

9086917
haskell	agda
one thing to point out is that set as well as in haskell is abstract you cannot pattern match on it
since we can return types from functions we can define an own version of as follows infix operators are written rather than this definition has very little content and is very similar to doing a type synonym in haskell beyond kinds turtles all the way down as promised above everything in agda has a type but then the type of must have a type

9087899
g++	gcc
g++ -o hwcompiled helloworld.cc then to execute your compiled program . hwcompiled
use g++ not gcc

9087899
g++	gcc
use g++ not gcc
gcc is a c compiler whereas g++ is a c++ compiler

9087913
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome firefox now have release versions that support it and opera has no mention of support yet
the firefox documentation is kind enough to mention what the minimum browser versions are that support it internet explorer 10 firefox 10 google-chrome 12 safari 4 so as mentioned ie9 doesn t but ie10 once released will

9088724
google-chrome	firefox
if you add it in as an object with wmode rather than as an iframe it seems to work fine in google-chrome fyi i can confirm that it was not working correctly in my version of google-chrome windows 7 google-chrome 16
try this this also works in firefox

9089287
haskell	scheme
it is difficult in haskell to capture the notion of a list in scheme unless you cheat and use an extension like data.dynamic
this is because from the point of view of pure unextended haskell it is difficult if not impossible to assign all scheme lists the same type

9089287
haskell	scheme
this is because from the point of view of pure unextended haskell it is difficult if not impossible to assign all scheme lists the same type
this means that while scheme allows you to write functions that take any list proper or improper you re going to have a hard time doing the same in haskell and for good reason

9089659
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the phone is case-sensitive so if the file is awhaaa.wav or awhaaa.wav it will work in the simulator but not on the device
the simulator since it s running on your mac is case-insensitive

9090331
octal	decimal
numbers beginning with 0 and containing no decimal point are interpreted as octal using digits 0-7
08 is not a valid octal number

9092043
oncreate	setcontentview
then you are getting a nullpointerexception when you try to call settext in oncreate
the textview is not part of the activity s view hierarchy until after you call setcontentview r.layout.main

9093058
realloc	calloc
memory management functions specified by the standard are aligned_alloc calloc malloc and realloc
the pointer you are passing to realloc was not returned by any of these and hence the undefined behavior

9093058
realloc	malloc
the pointer you are passing to realloc was not returned by any of these and hence the undefined behavior
reference c99 standard 7.22.3.5 the realloc function synopsis #1 #3 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size

9093058
realloc	malloc
reference c99 standard 7.22.3.5 the realloc function synopsis #1 #3 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

9093155
intersect	contains
create a work list contains the bounding rectangle initially while there are rectangles in the work list take the largest rectangle in the input list r create an empty list for fragments for each rectangle r in the work list intersect r with r splitting r into a rectangular portion contains within r if any and zero or more rectangles not within r
if r was split discard the portion contains within r and add the remaining rectangles to the fragment list

9094801
implements	extends
public class tmp implements tmpinter also look at the java tutorials of inteface
you should implement interface not extends it

9095506
kerberos	ntlm
if the client application does not provide a target name the negotiate process cannot use the kerberos protocol
if the negotiate process cannot use the kerberos protocol the negotiate process selects the ntlm protocol

9095506
kerberos	ntlm
if the negotiate process cannot use the kerberos protocol the negotiate process selects the ntlm protocol
in cross-domain kerberos has to be used

9099377
move	drag
another option might be to setlinearvelocity to a velocity that will move the body to the dragged-to point in one time step
this is a better method if you want a continuous drag with the object being able to bump into things as it moves because it does not teleport the body instantly to the finger position

9103668
gif	png
referencing drew s answer this particular example isn t done as flash or a gif
all they ve done it layered six png images on top of each other and hidden them

9108392
implements	extends
and here is my small adding to it you have to understand what instanceof really does thus the definition instanceof is a binary operator that checks if an instance is of a certain type so when you do this at compile-time m is actually an interface but the actual test against instanceof happens at runtime with an instance not an interface thus the compiler can not be sure if the instance behind m some class that implements this interface is actually a class that could extends date
i mean you could have a class with a declaration like this and you could then do this and it would be perfectly legal because myclass actually extends date

9109654
bash	subshell
each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process in a subshell . from man bash if you instead do this you ll see afterwards that shows abc
there s other ways that commands are executed in subshell too if you background a subcommand that group will run in a subshell whereas just will not

9113112
oncreate	onstart
we can ask the question as to why not directly go to onstart or onresume after onstop instead of onrestart . it becomes easier to understand if we note that onrestart is partially equivalent to oncreate if the creation part is omitted
basically both states lead to onstart i.e the activity becomes visible

9113883
translation	localization
if you do not have translation for a language android os will choose your default values that are stored in the value folder
to work with localisations you can also use sequoyah android localization editor

9115682
firefox	safari
firefox also supports a version of it but the two aren t yet compatible though achieving interoperability is a high priority for both dev teams
neither ie nor safari has yet announced support

9115973
hex	binary
if you want the exact hex or bin data representation you will need to convert it either when you select the data using hex select hex mydata as hexdata from mytable ... and when you output it it will now be a string of hex characters
i think there is an equivalent for binary format which would output 0s and 1s but i m not sure.

9117482
lisp	scheme
lisp isn t a language it s a group of sometimes surprisingly different languages
scheme and clojure are the functional members of the family

9117482
lisp	scheme
common lisp and the more specialized breeds like elisp aren t particularly functional and don t inherently encourage functional programming or recursion
cl in fact includes a very flexible object system an extremely flexible iteration dsl and doesn t guarantee optimized tail calls scheme dialects do but not lisps in general

9117482
lisp	scheme
cl in fact includes a very flexible object system an extremely flexible iteration dsl and doesn t guarantee optimized tail calls scheme dialects do but not lisp in general
that s the pitfall in thinking of lisp as a single language

9118024
prng	random
other good sources of seed data include the position of the mouse cursor the last-accessed address of ram or the hdd or truly random data available from an attached device servers for online casinos often have true rng devices that provide actually random environmental data that can be used to seed a prng
well first cstdlib.rand is not a great prng

9118247
postgresql	mysql
certain databases such as postgresql let you define an index on an expression like this
i m not sure if mysql has this feature

9119631
realloc	malloc
note that your realloc call will also not zero-fill any new memory that s allocated so if you need the realloc then you may want to be using a temporary pointer that you then zero-fill manually before assigning to your object array
the crash is because you re casting malloc d memory to a c array of objects

9120104
implements	extends
when using the transactional annotation spring creates a jdk proxy when the class implements an interface
in your case the jdk proxy of userdao implements dao user will implement dao user but will not extends userdao

9121107
bash	subshell
one thing you can do is to write a tiny program that prints its parent pid if you compile that as ppid and put it in your path you can call it eg one oddness i noticed however is that if you write it doesn t seem to actually run it in a subshell -- you need at least two commands inside the parentheses for bash to actually run them in a subshell
unfortunately there s no easy way to do this prior to bash version 4 when bashpid was introduced

9121363
implements	extends
implements this functionality is not simple since you will either need to have separate queues per target so the waiting code becomes far more complicated or one queue from which you then skip over targets that are at capacity incurring a performance overhead
you can try to extends executorservice to achieve this but the extension appears to be non-trivial

9122355
serializable	deserialization
in 2.0 will be available but you can use different view on serializable deserialization jsonignoreproperties on class may be useful
aside from jsonignore there are a couple of other possibilities use json views to filter out fields conditionally by default not used for deserialization

9124933
swt	swing
but because ibm has its own swt package for gui i am not sure whether it support swing
of course you should use netbeans for building a swing gui

9125512
base	fractions
base 10 log this function calculates base 2 log because finding the number of occupied bits is trivial
this one is super fast because no tostring no biginteger math newton s continued fractions not even instantiating a new biginteger only uses a fixed number of very fast operations one call takes about 20 microseconds about 50k calls per second but only works for biginteger workaround for bigdecimal not tested for speed shift the decimal point until the value is 2 53 use tobiginteger uses one div internally this algorithm makes use of the fact that the log can be calculated as the sum of the exponent and the log of the mantissa

9125544
gson	jackson
gson which i ve stuck with so far does not until issue 231 is resolved
according to this answer jackson supports both generics as well as polymorphism

9128889
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
the system.data.oracleclient classes are deprected
i m not an expert on the system.data.oracleclient classes since i usually use oracle s odp.net

9129371
gson	jackson
afaik gson doesn t handle circular references but jackson and xstream do
jackson vs

9131231
jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
this feature is not only available for servlet 3 containers tomcat 7 jboss 7 jetty 8 glassfish 3 etc. but also for older or other containers with specific asynchronous support eg
tomcat 6 cometprocessor weblogic 9+ abstractasyncservlet etc. other solutions don t have this feature blazeds or use rtmp lcds weborb and the last version of clear toolkit

9131281
ssl	https
from the firewall point of view https looks like yet another ssl connection and it has no idea what going through
so if the only thing you need is just to pass the data - not to actual web server use just ssl connection over 443 port

9131849
hive	hdfs
configuring hive with hbase this is discussion about how it can be done. it is most powerful way to group by hbase data
it do imply running mr jobs but by hhive not by hbase. 2 you can write you own mr job working with hbase data sitting in hfiles in the hdfs

9135023
cvs	svn
note that netbeans support cvs svn and mercurial vcs out of the box
if project structure does not changed you can delete cvs dirs and checkout sources from svn with --force to avoid reconfiguring projects in netbeans find

9135023
cvs	svn
if project structure does not changed you can delete cvs dirs and checkout sources from svn with --force to avoid reconfiguring projects in netbeans find
-type d -name cvs -exec rm -r

9136110
comparator	comparable
if you can using a comparator is actually much simpler
in fact it gives you a couple of additional options that you cannot have with comparable such as defining alternative sort orders

9136187
allocator	stl
things which aren t standardized name mangling or are highly specific by necessity memory allocator will also be incompatible
you can get around both of those issues by only destroying from the library that creates good practice anyway and using stl objects that take a deleter for allocator and exporting using undecorated names and or the c style extern c for exported methods

9136907
multiplying	division
if you want to compare 1 y against x while you are working yet with letters not values and your operations make no errors multiplying the both sides of comparison by y and you have
usually you should check signs in that operation but here we use abs values so it is clean. the result comparison has no division at all

9137378
consistency	acid
key value stores are extremely fast typically in memory and provide eventual consistency
many of the standard database features such as acid may not exist but at the same time none of the limitations such as too many writes etc. also exist

9138149
fseek	getchar
in practice on unix-like systems text and binary modes behave the same way and the fseek ftell method will work
i suspect it will work on windows my guess is that ftell will give the byte offset which may not be the same as the number of times you could call getchar in text mode

9138348
comparator	comparable
you are implementing it wrong as comparable the raw form of does not declare a method comparator string it declares a method comparator object
to get it to compile as is you would need to accept an object instead of a string or implement instead of comparable

9138399
udp	tcp
why not broadcast over a udp address instead
if the clients are listening on that address they ll get the message although it s not guaranteed like tcp if they re not there the broadcaster doesn t care

9141346
udp	tcp
udp does not guarantee delivery but tcp has this built into the protocol
you need to be using tcp if you want to ensure packets are delivered

9142463
google-chrome	firefox
in particular double check the connection header which per the rfc can have multiple values and does on firefox but not on google-chrome
the firefox connection header usually looks like this connection keep-alive upgrade

9142724
google-chrome	firefox
use your custom command to call the publishitem command a few things to look for this has worked for me in firefox but not google-chrome where the item is not saved
scsave uses a lot of front-end javascript so this appears to be a bug with sitecore s google-chrome support

9144780
nunit	mstest
nunit versus mstest isn t really an issue
there s more or less feature parity between the two and the upside of mstest is that it s all built right into visual studio

9145284
implements	extends
that fragment implements nameable is already defined in the fragment class you don t need to repeat that everywhere
this should be enough extends and super in generics signatures are used to constrain type parameters not actual types

9145574
google-chrome	firefox
in fact google-chrome will not animate between flex values just jumps
firefox on the other hand does this nicely

9150803
calloc	malloc
use calloc to allocate memory with zeros
malloc is not guaranteed to zero the memory

9150804
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead
malloc does not initiate with 0 s because of performance issues.

9152722
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
in particular checknotnull utility method which also throws nullpointerexception when its argument is null
illegalargumentexception is a standard not a custom exception

9153469
pthreads	fork
one point to check is that you have not called any cuda api routines before you fork the pthreads
creating a cuda context which is automatic for most but not all cuda api routines before you fork the threads will cause problems

9156090
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
here is link to the docs on qgraphicsview
the qgraphicsscene isn t in charge of the painter.

9156964
innodb	myisam
first change the engine of these 2 table from myisam to innodb
myisam does not support foreign key constraints then add the foreign key removing the extra parenthesis

9157094
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is theoretically worse but common tricks such a median-of-3 and median-of-9 pivot elements make the bad cases really unlikely and by linearly processing the array it is quite well optimizable by the cpu
mergesort is good when you do not need in-place sorting

9157094
mergesort	timsort
mergesort is good when you do not need in-place sorting
to use it in-place and optimize it for presorted and almost-presorted data is not trivial but you might have a look at timsort which is used by python and java7

9157094
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	timsort
in reality a well-optimized quicksort in most situations is hard to beat in particular because it is nice to optimize and benefits from cpu caching
timsort is not a plain mergesort

9160769
jquery	scriptaculous
you can then still call jquery but no longer by using will invoke prototype.js but by using jquery
from what i can tell in this help page your lightbox shouldn t work with jquery but should work with prototype.js and scriptaculous if you are going to use jquery and prototype at the same time one of them will have to run in no-conflict mode or neither will work properly. you can do this by loading jquery first then running jquery.noconflict read the skinny on noconflict here and then loading prototype and scriptaculous

9162555
implements	extends
other implementations may vary and that s the point the use of an abstract class like inputstream allows the implements class to vary and potentially be changed from one version of java to the next whilst keeping calling code happy
the in field defined by the system class doesn t need to reference a concrete implementation of inputstream -- as you ve worked out it can t -- it just needs to reference something that extends inputstream

9166258
cublas	magma
blas doesn t include eigenvalue solvers and cublas is no different in that regard
the utk developed magma library includes a couple of gpu accelerated eigenvalue problem routines

9167763
hive	hdfs
one good strategy is to store the raw metrics in hbase or on plain hdfs might want to look at flume if these metrics are coming from log files and run periodic mapreduce jobs even every 5 minutes to create pre-aggregated results that you can store in plain rectangular files that you can query through hive
when you are just reading a file and hive doesn t have to do anything fancy sorting joining etc then hive is actually reasonably low latency- it doesn t run mapreduce it just streams the file s contents out to you

9169412
set	bag
there are two major methods may be more 1 set the actual size of the img or via css style
2 use image preload and insert your code only when image is loaded ps there is a serious bag in so engine - code formatting does not want to combine with numbered listing

9169835
n-gram	words
in this case text will be indexed in two fields and n-gram will not break the original text
phrase search does not work because edgengram produces additional terms and increases the term position surprisingly of each chunk of the words

9171496
gtk	gdk
my query is if your custom widget is really gtk widget or gdk widget.
not all events of gdk are handled in gtkmm or at least they were not back in 2009 thus beware that your application may crash too often if your widget is extensively using gdk and gdk events are not trapped

9171766
clang	llvm
clang then knows how to produce llvm ir from its ast
however you do have to start with c c++ here and not llvm ir

9173387
oncreate	setcontentview
in oncreate and not out of oncreate
u need to write after setting contentview setcontentview r.layout.main

9173643
vim	emacs
this is because vim s a thin layer on top of ed and ed isn t much more than a line editor that speaks regex
emacs has the advantage of being built on top of elisp

9173842
ienumerable	ilist
of course i ensure that the ienumerable is enumerated only once within my function
usually if it is a list not lazy i return ilist

9176956
comparator	comparable
comparator interface this interface represents an order relation which may be used to sort a list or maintain order in a sorted set or map
can override a type s natural ordering or order objects of a type that does not implement the comparable interface

9178105
onchange	onblur
basically the onchange event is supposed to be fired when the user makes a selection then leaves the input be it select textbox radio button whatever
since this isn t working in ie you could try using onblur instead to detect when the user actually leaves the box

9179607
setinterval	settimeout
do not send ajax requests or start animations with a setinterval setinterval doesn t allow for slow browsers networks or network connection failures
use settimeout instead

9181137
oncreate	onstart
alternatively you could always handle the orientation change yourself that way the oncreate method wouldn t be called when the screen rotates modifications to the manifest file add this method in the activity hope this answers your question
other methods than oncreate could be used onstart onrestart onresume you ll want to consult this page of the documentation in order to decide which one fits your needs better as they all get called in different situations

9190796
crossover	mutation
you will need to adapt the mutation probability not the crossover probability during the search
in a similar manner the evolution strategy which is similar to a ga adapts the mutation strength during the search

9191301
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this is the case when you use interface builder to set your uiviewcontroller as part of uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller and almost always when using storyboards
when your uiviewcontroller is defined in a nib file or storyboard usually as an iboutlet initwithnibname bundle is not called rather initwithcoder is

9191943
ssl	https
unsolicited advice if you want to make your life easier do not reinvent ssl - just use the existing ssl implementation via https
most ssl libraries allow you to inspect the server certificate so check the validity of your server certificate on the client at least check the fingerprint

9194355
junit	jmock
jmock depends upon hamcrest and junit uses and includes some hamcrest classes in it s jar so this is probably where the problem comes from
the easiest fix is to use the version of junit which doesn t have the hamcrest libraries included junit-dep

9194534
move	drag
you d obviously want the locations of drag move touches etc. and you can get those from the event itself
for example based on the above code not the complete solution you were looking for and i hope someone else can shed some light on drag drop frameworks for mobile devices but it s a start

9195378
implements	extends
if you want to use the abstract cost class you can use an anonymous subclass that overrides the run method and use the x1 x2 values if you choose to implements the run method in cost directly provide a constructor on cost to receive the values and use them later when the run method is invoked by the scheduler with this approach scheduling becomes
the compiler error is from the fact cost is extends timertask and it does not override all of timertask s abstract method

9195766
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t seem to pay much attention to that
if i take the top and left properties out of the transition it makes it act a little more like firefox

9195786
primes	modulus
the security of rsa is effectively bounded by the magnitude of the second largest primes factor of the rsa modulus n
finding small primes factors that are less than 2 32 can be done in a fractions of a second on a modern computer simply by trying to divide the modulus n by each such primes and check if the residue is zero meaning n is divisible by that number or not meaning that number is not a factor of n

9195786
primes	modulus
finding small primes factors that are less than 2 32 can be done in a fractions of a second on a modern computer simply by trying to divide the modulus n by each such primes and check if the residue is zero meaning n is divisible by that number or not meaning that number is not a factor of n
if n is composed of only such small primes factors times a single large primes factor q it would be trivial to find that q as well simply by dividing n by all small factors to get n and test n for primality

9196881
inline	inlining
yes for code style would it be sensible to keep the inline tag so a future developer realises that function should be inline and does not remove the definition somewhere else and remove the inlining
the inline is for one definition rule and therefore linking by extension

9198522
firefox	safari
flashplayer versions firefox 11.0.1.152 debug ch 11.1.102.55 ie 11.0.1.152 debug update ie also sends the flash version along x-flash-version 11 0 1 152 - but none of the other browsers do so that s not why they don t work
the obvious reason for the #2032 error when sniffing the actual request and response is that google is responding with a 404 when called from flash in chrome or ie haven t tested safari or opera

9198522
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the obvious reason for the #2032 error when sniffing the actual request and response is that google is responding with a 404 when called from flash in google-chrome or ie haven t tested safari or opera
not a solution but some troubleshooting - what does firefox do differently from the others in terms of the request

9204331
innodb	myisam
here s the mysql docs on foreign keys for storage engines other than innodb mysql server parses the foreign key syntax in create table statements but does not use or store it
and mysql gives database developers the choice of which approach to use. if you don t need foreign keys and want to avoid the overhead associated with enforcing referential integrity you can choose another storage engine instead such as myisam

9204675
realloc	strdup
your earlier line is fine because the string is placed in the .rodata data segment and its pointer will always point to the same data for the entire lifetime of the program. if you allocate the memory for content with malloc 3 you can grow the space required with realloc 3 but this introduces the potential for a horrible error -- whatever you handed the pointer to must clean up after the memory allocation when it is done with the data or else you leak memory and it cannot simply call free 3 because the content pointer might be to statically allocated memory
so you have two easy choices use strdup 3 to duplicate the static string each time you need it and use for the non-static path make your caller responsible for providing the memory

9205760
html5lib	beautifulsoup
in my environment i had html5lib installed as well as beautifulsoup4
beautifulsoup used the html5lib parser and this resulted in my html snippet being wrapped in html and body tags which is not what i wanted

9206197
n-gram	words
alternatively you could use the n-gram to generate the list of possible characters though this might be expensive for long words
remember that you can always cross off all n-gram that contain letters you ve guessed that aren t in the target words

9210267
firefox	safari
when the scrollbar was clicked only firefox 10.0 kept focus on the input element
ie 8.0 opera 11.61 chrome 17.0 and safari 5.1 all removed focus from the input resulting in the dropdown being hidden and since it was hidden click events would not fire on the dropdown

9213332
calloc	malloc
as others have mentioned though the call to calloc will actually zero-out that memory where-as malloc will simply give you a pointer to that memory and the memory may or may not have all zeroes in it
for instance if you get memory that had been recycled from another object then the call to malloc will still have the values from its previous use

9213578
calloc	malloc
also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective
the malloc returns pointer doesn t touch the real memory until the program touches malloc

9214102
cobertura	jacoco
from my experience jacoco is relatively light and doesn t impose much overhead whereas cobertura will impose a tremendous slowdown
on the other hand jacoco merely flags hit or no hit whereas cobertura gives you per-line hit counts

9216515
uiview	subviews
make sure the action is only possible when the scroll view is not scrolling optional disable scrolling on the scroll view use the uiview coordinate conversion methods convertrect fromview and convertrect toview to calculate the new frame for the image view
the new target superview can be the application s keywindow or another full screen subviews if you d like

9216770
config	ini
if not then add your dll to the right config for your wamp
the error that you are receiving means that php does not recognize the xsl extension. php has got a separate ini file for cli and web

9217072
portrait	landscape
if calling activity is in portrait bug does not occur
subsequent calls to captureactivity are ok from landscape mode. i can t find the exact cause but the effect is that views in captureactivity autoset drawable for background and thus obstructing the camera view

9218328
requestfactory	gwt
it is better to create a dto layer or use requestfactory
yes you can but it will really limit what you can put inside those beans not everything is supported in gwt

9225241
uiview	subviews
create this static method as a category on uiview that will let you load any kind of view from a nib file the view needs to be the first item defined in the nib
you would create your view like this if the view inside the nib is not a myview but you want to load it as a subviews of myview with myview defined as the file s owner in the nib file do it like this using that approach just create your view as normal using initwithframe then call loadcontentsfromnibname to loa the contents from a nib

9227531
exponent	modulo
from a mathematical point of view the answer is otoh yes presuming you use an internal representation of the private key that only contains the modulo n and the exponent d and the other exponent e is generated randomly
the formula that describes the relation between the two exponents is 1 e d mod phi n so from a mathematical point of view it doesn t really matter which exponent is which

9227531
exponent	modulo
the difference in length is usually due to a combination of the following the public exponent e is not generated randomly but is a small fixed constant such as 3 or 0x10001
the private exponent d will on the other hand be almost as large as the modulo so the private key data will be almost twice the size of the public key data

9228099
direct3d	directx
direct3d can be implemented in software emulated as but normally isn t
opengl and directx are just apis

9228170
jar	war
it s a good option for when you have a jar library that doesn t change often but you update the war frequently
and obviously you could have a mix so maybe the jar is standalone but you have a multi-module project that contains the two war files

9228783
punctuation	words
a converting all letters to lower or upper case b removing punctuation c converting numbers into words here it would be not that wasy to write a fewliner but there are a lot of already existing solutions if you google it
code snippets libraries etc d removing accent marks and other diacritics look up point b just create the list with diacritics as puncts e expanding abbreviations create a dictionary with abbreviations f removing stopwords or too common words create a list with stopwords g text canonicalization tumor tumour it s it is for tumor- tumour use regex

9232103
rpm	yum
for example yum list | grep something something.noarch v1.0 the rpm spec file should have
in the rpm spec file the requires section should list the package names that are shown in the yum repo not the rpm filenames

9232189
vim	emacs
vim is better for editing especially quick edits
when i need to understand and hack in 8 files simultaneously emacs properties as a tiling window manager with multi-buffer buffers have a 1.2 1 correspondence to files they re often the same thing but aren t necessarily regexp-search and replace are incredible

9232602
keystore	jks
typically there is no need for private key material in a trust store unless you also use the same as a keystore
it s often better to use a separate truststore which you d be able to copy freely across machine without worrying about leaking private key material. what would make sense would be to build a new keystore jks that you would use as a truststore using the ca certificates not sure if you ve been provided with them

9232602
keystore	jks
it s often better to use a separate truststore which you d be able to copy freely across machine without worrying about leaking private key material. what would make sense would be to build a new keystore jks that you would use as a truststore using the ca certificates not sure if you ve been provided with them
you re not doing mutual authentication by setting the truststore only there are no default values for the keystore so they need to specify these parameters explicitly

9233342
factors	mean
you can save yourself some work when you pull in the data by setting to automatically set -- elements to na also you can set it up such that strings are not converted to factors
read.table these two settings mean you re now dealing with somethings that s not auto factored and has the na s where it should

9235978
udp	mtu
good for both udp and tcp sending a 65k byte buffer with udp will not create multiple headers of udp only multiple headers of ip with a single udp header
furthermore with today 1gbit nic s you could use jambo frames and increase the mtu beyond 1500 if this is for a private network

9235978
udp	tcp
for tcp sending an object with a write send will not generate a packet necessarily most likely it will wait until you fill up the mss and then dispatch several objects remember that it is a stream and it has no packet boundaries as udp has
you cannot assume reliability order and load making udp harder to manage in my opinion

9235978
udp	tcp
you cannot assume reliability order and load making udp harder to manage in my opinion
tcp will handle connections when servers or clients start to be overloaded with traffic

9236109
super	extends
super must be the first statement in a constructor hence the logic in your sample is not valid
the proper way is to create the same 4 constructors in your extends class

9236311
division	multiplication
notice that it does not do any division only additions not even multiplication and not that it matters with so small numbers but it might with bigger ones
time complexity is o n loglogn while your algorithm has something near o n 3 2 or o n 3 2 logn as daniel fischer commented assuming divisions cost the same as multiplication

9236832
union	distinct
if you also want to check the xs consider using a union select with x and y interchanged granted no value occurs in both columns at the same time otherwise you will not be able to determine whether x or y with that value is having more than one partner
this query should do the trick it will count the distinct values of x each y has and then return only those y who have more than one partner

9237227
hmac	md5
implement the hmac algorithm on top of the md5 hash you re already using it doesn t look too hard - i ve pasted the pseudocode below
don t bother with hmac - just generate the hash at both ends using a regular md5 by concatenating the message and the key - that should be pretty secure it s what most people do

9238307
layoutparams	viewgroup
there is no list of layoutparams for an imagebutton
an imagebutton is not a viewgroup so does not have layoutparams associated with it

9238307
layoutparams	viewgroup
an imagebutton is not a viewgroup so does not have layoutparams associated with it
the layoutparams are for the parent of the view to tell it how it should perform layout of the view

9239753
fuzzy	stemming
however fuzzy matching will not be reliable if you have just a single word essentially as in your fabulous restaurant example
a good fuzzy matching will use stemming and have a notion of common words and synonyms

9244130
xslt	schematron
once again i ve found out that xsltproc does not conform to xslt 1.0 specs
this also means that the iso schematron skeleton in bugged

9245204
intersect	contains
then the two node-sets we want to intersect are all following siblings of and all preceding siblings of let us denote with the first node-set -- this is and let us denote with the second node-set -- this is finally we substitute in the kayessina formula with and with
the reult of these substitutions selects exactly the wanted nodes if we substitute all variables until we get an expression that doesn t contains any variables we get this expression selects exactly the wanted nodes

9246178
ienumerable	icollection	icollection	iqueryable
here is a summary table | | refine query | don t change query | |-----------------|--------------|--------------------| | in-memory | n a | icollection | | lazy execution | iqueryable | ienumerable |
if you choose icollection the result will be stored in memory - this may not be a good idea if the data set is very large or if you don t always need to get the data

9246222
uiview	calayer
your code assumes that uiview animations run synchronously in the main thread which they do not
you seem to have two options explicit cakeyframeanimation for animating a calayer along any amount of sample points interpolated between them implicit recursive uiview animation for animating a uiview along a series of sample points interpolated between them the former would be much more efficient - still i thought i oould show you both options

9246233
clang	llvm
not even for merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. just for giggles i tried clang and i get a different result
compiled using using apple clang version 2.1 tags apple clang-163.7.1 based on llvm 3.0svn target x86_64-apple-darwin11.3.0 thread model posix the output when compiled with clang is so now the string appears correctly but the length is given as 17 instead of 11

9249126
addition	multiplication
here is a solution just using lookup addition and shifting
the lookup does not require multiplication as it is an array of pointers to another array - hence addition required to find the right array

9249549
namenode	hdfs
lets see some aspects of the process when client writes to hdfs data is written in all replicas and after the write operation finished it should be perfectly available there is also only one place with metadata - namenode which also do not have any notion of isolation which would enable hiding data till some larger peace of work is done
hbase is a different case - since it will write only log to hdfs immediately and its hfiles will be updated with new data after compaction only

9250473
prepare	execute
when using prepare statements with pdo prepare and pdostatement execute you don t have any quoting to do this will be done automatically
but sometimes you will not or cannot use prepare statements and will have to write full sql queries and execute them with pdo execute

9251823
mongoid	mongomapper
i m not sure how mongoid does this but the query you want to get down to mongodb is something like this note that we start with and end with to get the half open interval and that s the same as truncating the full time to just the date part
with mongomapper i d say this perhaps the same thing will work with mongoid

9252673
setinterval	settimeout
i wouldn t do it like this for one of my project but i kept your function to make you more familiar with the code. i used settimeout instead of setinterval because setinterval must be cleared when not needed and settimeout is just launched one time
1 you must specify a unit to the top ie 2 your function won t animate instead of you use a setinterval or a settimeout like you asked an example

9253974
inline	inlining
the rule doesn t fire in many cases because the very simple function f is inline before the rule had a chance to fire
if you delay the inlining the rule should fire for all these cases worked here with 7.2.2 and 7.4.1

9254084
uiview	subviews
i had a similar problem and it turned out that my overlay uiview s frame was not large enough
the clipstobounds property for a uiview is by default set to no which means its subviews are still visible even if they are outside the parent s frame

9255020
pascal	delphi
freepascal lazarus has a unit called macosall.pas which is a translation of the os-x c++ headerfiles to pascal allowing you to call native os-x functions
sadly this unit is not a part of delphi but by opening the unit you can copy the function declaration over to delphi and it should work

9256942
textmate	aptana	sublimetext	aptana
textmate with bundles from ed spencer sublimetext 2 i think you can use same bundles as for textmate not sure
jetbrainswebstorm3 is used by many aptana eclipse based there is a plugin for sencha but not touch i think

9257676
division	multiplication
see computational complexity of mathematical operations which lists schoolbook long division as o n 2 and newton s method as m n where m is the complexity of the multiplication algorithm used which could be as good as o n log n 2 n asymptotically
note from the discussion of one of the multiplication algorithms that the best algorithm asymptotically is not necessarily the fastest for small inputs in practice the schönhage strassen algorithm starts to outperform older methods such as karatsuba and toom cook multiplication for numbers beyond 2 2 15 to 2 2 17 10 000 to 40 000 decimal digits

9258987
opera	firefox
opera does it as mentioned in the other answer
source firefox spidermonkey engine does not cache bytecode

9258987
firefox	safari
source firefox spidermonkey engine does not cache bytecode
source webkit safari konqueror does not cache bytecode

9259272
vim	emacs
vim
or emacs i guess - not sure

9261675
multiplying	multiplication
the matrix multiplying can be written like this and the resulting matrix c can then by formed by combinations of the products of the eight submatrices in a and b it might not be immediately obvious how this helps solve the problem but let s consider a concrete example you have an optimal matrix multiplication kernel which uses an internal block size of 32 and is only correct when matrices are round multiples of that block size
you have a pair of 1000x1000 square matrices to multiplying

9264795
dbcontext	objectcontext
on the other hand dbcontext api has some additional performance impact and additional layer of bugs
in simple project you will probably not find any disadvantage in dbcontext api - you will not see performance impact you will not use corner features available only in objectcontext and you will not be affected by occasional bugs

9264795
dbcontext	objectcontext
in simple project you will probably not find any disadvantage in dbcontext api - you will not see performance impact you will not use corner features available only in objectcontext and you will not be affected by occasional bugs
a lot of information and blog posts was collected since dbcontext api was released so you don t have to be afraid that you will not find description of the api

9265354
equals	gethashcode
when overriding equals i typically check with if but since you re using a special purpose comparer here which deliberately ignores part of the object i probably wouldn t make the type part of the identity
first of all you forgot to override gethashcode so your code is broken

9265445
prepare	execute
when you execute it with two parameters the param list does not match the prepare statement
turn off the prepare

9268837
jruby	mri
i couldn t find a pre-built ruby read-write lock implementation of course jruby users can use java.util.concurrent.reentrantreadwritelock so i built one
you can see it at me and two other people have tested it on mri 1.9.2 mri 1.9.3 and jruby

9270577
prepare	execute
the other two answers do not address the actual differences between multi-query and prepare statements - they are completely different
prepare statements - you create a statement template once then execute it multiple times with different values used for each template using bind_param

9271284
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
from the name it looks like a uiview subclass if this is not a uiviewcontroller you cannot push it like the following
a uiview cannot be pushed on to a uinavigationcontroller

9271382
google-chrome	firefox
found it with firebug i suggest you get the google-chrome equivalent i have a feeling even if it works it will tell you about it
your quotes are not correct on .png they should be the character or google-chrome must allow them for some reason firefox here

9273877
uiview	subviews
generally speaking - uiview hittest withevent will look into its subviews recursively and might return itself or any of its subviews. in your case uiwebview s hit is likely to be handled by one of its subviews not itself
by invoking super hittest withevent you will get the right subviews returned

9274048
uilabel	uitextview
uilabel doesn t have any methods for doing this
you can do it with uitextview because it implements the uitextinput protocol

9274865
implements	extends
the benefit of interfaces is that classes can implements multiple
extends does not allow this

9275430
mvp	presenter
do not make god classes because if you do you have misused the mvp pattern
a standard design pattern for gui is mvp presenter first or any variation

9276282
base	fractions
because of this there is a number class in cocoa nsdecimalnumber that operates in base 10 and can represent 6 100 exactly as 0.060000 the difference you see in excel could be either because it is using decimal math probably not or that it is rounding the number so that the display inaccuracy is not apparent
floating point values cannot represent all fractions numbers exactly

9281478
spaces	delimiter
the tokenizer uses the default delimiter set which is t n r f the spaces character the tab character the newline character the carriage-return character and the form-feed character
delimiter characters themselves will not be treated as tokens

9284709
division	modulo
the download for stl says the stl was developed on sgi mipsprotm c++ 7.0 7.1 7.2 and 7.2.1. and as far as i can tell without actually having the compiler and hardware mipspro passes the division to the cpu and mips hardware truncates to 0 which would mean std modulo has always been misnamed
it seems like a misnomer to me to call it modulo and not remainder in math the answer really should be 9

9284797
google-chrome	firefox
as boris mentioned in his answer your protocol implementation doesn t set nsichannel.originaluri property so that urls will be resolved relative to the google-chrome url and not relative to your tada url
there is a second issue with your code however in firefox loading external dtds only works with google-chrome urls this check is hardcoded

9287697
implements	extends
what the javadoc actuallys says is that randomaccessfile extends java.lang.object and implements closeable datainput dataoutput
randomaccessfile is supposed to extends inputstream although not directly

9289776
queue	fifo
besides basic collection operations a queue provides additional insertion extraction and inspection operations
queues typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner

9289776
queue	fifo
queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner
among the exceptions are priority queue which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements natural ordering

9289862
google-chrome	firefox
upd seems that animation is a bit flaky - when you set height auto - div is visible from the beginning however close button ignores animation on first click i have google-chrome with latest update so i ve added some workaround
also added other styles to support this animation for other browsers like firefox and opera and not only for those who support -webkit

9290773
dictionary	map
without knowing much of the dpll algorithm i d recommend python as well but not for the same reasons as tmc not so relevant here i d recommend it for its lightweight syntax and wonderful ease of use of data structures like lists and dictionary
control structures map in a straightforward way to those of c

9290818
textview	imageview
your textview is now between 2 imageview so no matter what text there is it will not overlap anything
add two more properities of textview and so text will be centered inside yout textview

9293597
factors	matrix
applying the factors row wise is a bit harder because standard blas doesn t have anything like a hadamard product operator you could use
also because you are mentioning blas i presume you are using column major order storage for your matrix which is not so straightforward for row wise operations

9295012
hex	binary
but firstly i have to write a program that will convert this file to hex file. you don t have to and must not write any such conversion program
you have to first understand and internalize the idea that hex notation is only an easy-to-read representation of binary

9296860
apache	nginx
first of all yes use nginx not apache - it s far easier to configure nginx and it s lighter and more efficient
with an nginx proxy up front you get several advantages ability to run several backends for different parts of your site a faster static file server clean restarts if you need to take down your node server nginx can deliver a pretty under maintenance page logging in your node app can focus on debugging and nginx can log requests - keeps it nice and clean and probably other things i ve missed

9300162
valgrind	gprof
here are the biggies i ran across last time i had to do this valgrind only supported on cortex arm processors
gprof not so hot with threads

9300185
rspec	capybara
bundle exec rspec spec i wrote about this in more detail showing how to also set up capybara spork and guard in a rails plugin with a dummy application
create the plugin without test-unit and specify the path for the dummy application add rspec-rails as a development dependency to the gemspec file foobar.gemspec gem specification.new do |s| . . . s.add_development_dependency rspec-rails end run bundle install create a symlink from the dummy app to the plugin spec directory and run the rspec install generator cd spec dummy ln -s .. .. spec rails generate rspec install cd - now edit spec spec_helper.rb or spec rails_helper.rb in rails 4+ not sure about older versions changing this line line 3 require file.expand_path .. .. config environment __file__ to this require file.expand_path .. dummy config environment __file__ now you can run rspec from the root of your plugin and it will pick up specs from the dummy application as well

jboss	weblogic
having said that my simplistic guidance is this use jboss if you are not worried about scaling past several thousand concurrent users
however if you intend to scale beyond that you re going to need something with proven horsepower and robustness - that s weblogic

9303570
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome currently only supports a few data types if your data does not have a recognized mime type the drag drop simply doesn t proceed
this is very clearly in violation of the w3c spec and is not a problem in firefox so long as you provide some sort of data or even safari which allows the drag to proceed whether data is set or not

9304630
udp	tcp
each one has its own headers that is stripped when the data is handled to the above layer and you only gets what you send on the application layer maybe you can miss some packets or get them out of order because udp doesn t give you those guarantees as tcp does
the udp headers are not available to the application when you use the standard interfaces from the operating system socket with sock_dgram sendto recvfrom and such

9306755
mongodb	bson
reference the definitive guide to mongodb the nosql database for cloud and desktop computing book
if you do not specify the _id value manually in mongodb then the type will be set to a special bson datatype that consists of a 12-byte binary value

9308150
operands	scalar
both sides operands of the list assignment operator evaluated and whether the list assignment is evaluated in scalar context or list context does not affect the evaluation of the operands whatsoever
whether a list assignment is evaluated in scalar context or list context only affects the value it returns

9311419
super	extends
so even if you fixed the error allowing test and print to extends object super would not work in this case
the error you get spurs from the fact that super only works with new-style classes classes that explicitly extends object

9312630
google-chrome	safari
i noticed a similar effect in a slightly order version of google-chrome which suggests this is a webkit bug that google has fixed but has not yet been implemented in apple s version
i think this is a bug in safari

9313246
octal	decimal
these numbers are starting with 0 so javascript assumes you re passing octal - values
09 for example doesn t exist there so it returns 0. you can easily go around this problem by passing a second parameter to parseint called the radix so if you want decimal numbers which will be the case most of the times you write parseint 09 10

9314414
cassini	iis
if you re using visual studio as your ide just run the application and it will launch cassini the built in web server
if you aren t using visual studio you will need to install iis on your local machine and run it there

9314468
decimal	ieee
128-bit long double gives 34.02 precision so 33 positions after the decimal point in π. however excess precision won t hurt the compiler will simply cut it off
note that long double is quite often not an ieee format

9316477
fseek	fread
if you need update value you may use either or rather here are the manual pages for ftruncate and fseek + you should probably study flock so two scripts wouldn t overwrite the content at the same time
i wouldn t mix fopen and file_get_content functions in this context either use fopen fread and fwrite or use file_get_contents and file_put_contents

9322147
.htaccess	httpd.conf
well generally speaking .htaccess is just meant for per-directory settings and the httpd.conf for server wide settings
also accessing the .htaccess file adds some small overhead but that s probably not your concern

9325033
google-chrome	firefox
this is non-standard behavior that google-chrome emulates to be friendly to sites designed for ie
firefox doesn t emulate this non-standard behavior

9330024
datamapper	activerecord
the idea of a datamapper is to relate this application-level collection of data with how you are storing it
for a lot of activerecord implementations the framework does not provide this separation of intent and this can lead to problems

9330725
equals	compareto
emphasis added - note that it does not say that the two objects are equals
compareto should only be used for assessing ordering

9333610
swt	swing
in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right
it is better if swing applications do not try to mimic the native look and feel to avoid the uncanny valley effect

9336960
consistency	acid
you can have distributed consistency for a single operation without transactions but not atomicity for groups of operations
although consistency in cassandra is used in a slightly more specific sense than for acid databases in general

9339622
fgets	fgetc
use fgets instead
fgetc returns an int not a char so your ch should be an int

9340279
shadowing	named
the nature of property prevents you from shadowing the baseclass property with an instance attribute without doing more. you can however define a property of your own with the same named or trick python into not seeing the property in the first place
the named property of io.stringio in python 2.6 comes from the class hierarchy in the io module

9341281
octal	decimal
so to escape decimal 62 octal 76 use this code for a range use two dots and not three a..z not a...z
the ascii codes in the are octal not decimal

9343090
scheme	racket	lisp	scheme
instead i resorted to replacing the babel code for scheme support in the ob-scheme.el with basically just the following code this solution creates a new racket instance for every evaluation and hence is not as efficient as an inferior lisp based solution or similar but it works is more straightforward avoids racket issues such as specifying the correct module context for evaluating the code and the evaluation context is always clean as a new racket instance is used
describes a way when configuring emacs to set things up i wasn t familiar with babel or any of the solutions for evaluating scheme code under emacs for that matter

9345359
express	node.js
incidentally the express framework already provides session support
so to actually answer your question s yes node.js is ok as is because it is not a web server in itself

9345545
hex	binary
these are the powers of 10 the position of a binary digit indicates units 2s 4s 8s 16s 32s...the powers of 2 the position of hex digits indicates units 16s 256s...the powers of 16 for binary to decimal add up each 1 multiplied by its power so working from right to left for binary to hex you can either work it out the total number in decimal and then convert to hex or you can convert each 4-bit sequence into a single hex digit for hex to binary reverse the previous example - it s not too bad to do in your head because you just need to work out which of 8 4 2 1 you need to add up to get the desired value
for decimal to binary it s more of a long division problem - find the biggest power of 2 smaller than your input set the corresponding binary bit to 1 and subtract that power of 2 from the original decimal number

9345916
octal	decimal
however if the shell does interpret the leading zero as octal then the second number is just 021 or 17 decimal because the 8 ends the octal number
however the 64-bit shells i tested on mac os x 10.7.3 and rhel 5 both seemed to treat them as decimal not octal. the example code below compiled under 64-bit gives the following output compiled under 32-bit it gives the following output if this was what happened in your shell then the resulting behaviour of -lt would be explained

9347806
clang	llvm
this is actually a bug in clang s preprocessor which is shipped with xcode 4.3 clang 3.1 and it affects all preprocessing not just info.plists
i ve filed a bug llvm bug 12035 rdar 10883862

9349386
client-side	server-side
it s not obvious from the docs but when you supply anything as source that will involve running your code either server- or client-side the jquery ui autocompleter expects you to filter the result
in the case of server-side code you d use the term parameter it passes to your php file

9351645
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome on the other hand updates without uac prompt simply because it installs into user s profile which is not write-protected i mean current user has full rights
firefox plans to implement a service to facilitate the update process

9351737
g++	gcc
the man page of g++ says -xlinker option pass option as an option to the linker
you can use this to supply system-specific linker options which gcc does not know how to recognize

9353865
queue	fifo
that means a queue should always be serviced in a fifo like manner
so basically if using queues for both requests and response the threads awaiting to return data to the client will have to wait untill the calculation message is at the top of the response queue which is not optimal

9353887
vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
you need to use something like emacs or vim or nano to edit files on your linode instance
mate is a command installed by textmate which is an os x app not a linux one

9355085
hex	binary
as long as you are multiplying by 10 decimal and not 10h hex which is 16 decimal then you ll get the answer you are looking for
values stored in cpu registers are just binary numbers they aren t in hex or in decimal

9355131
hex	binary
the number isn t stored as hex decimal or whatever it s up to you to interpret it as such when you want to do something like creating a human-readable string of the value in the register
the integer value it s all stored the same way in the register - as a binary value

9359348
hex	binary
print it in a hex representation note that the above changes out to be a char as well it can not be a char
an md5 hash is a binary blob of 16 bytes

9361578
client-side	server-side
one thing you should know is that geolocation api is browser client-side thing
it is not possible to determine a more-accurate-then-ip location from the server-side

9363156
google-chrome	firefox
your code does work in google-chrome and safari however the s text does need to be transparent so if any other css code is setting a colour for the you ll need to override it
whilst -webkit-background-clip text exists -moz-background-clip text does not so you won t be able to achieve your clipping effect in firefox

9363690
backgrounding	multitasking
look at this guide and the methods that it mentions they will allow you to know if your application is going to the backgrounding for example so that you can release some memory
do not prevent your app from multitasking just because you have memory issues

9363833
twig	smarty
twig is doing a lot of stuff at runtime being the time when a template is execute that smarty does on compile time being the time when a template is prepare for execution
twig is not really pissing away speed here

9364275
operands	scalar
in the constraints of the assignment operator c99 6.5.16.1p1 both operands are pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of compatible types and the type pointed to by the left has all the qualifiers of the type pointed to by the right and an int and an array type are not compatible types see 6.2.7p1 for more on type compatibility
well also it is an initialization not an assignment but the same constraint applies c99 6.7.8p11 the initializer for a scalar shall be a single expression optionally enclosed in braces

9365926
postgresql	mysql
if you are using the standard mysql functions you can use the mysql_insert_id function if you are using php s pdo then you can use the lastinsertid method if you are using a database that supports the returns sql keyword such as postgresql then you can do it in one query
mysql doesn t support it however

9367608
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase server is not couchdb
it sacrifices some of the neat things couchdb does http interface master master replication so it can do other neat things sub-millisecond latency gigantic clusters. in the long long run we d like to get back high-performance versions of the features we had to drop

9368828
rsa	aes
if you have a online connection and not just transport from one point to another you can use diffie-hellman which is based on similar ideas like dsa and use dsa or rsa in signature mode to authenticate the other side to avoid a man-in-the-middle attack
other than that rsa key exchange is also quite usual sending the key aes key encrypted with the rsa key of the server

9370027
client-side	server-side
secondly there is only so much that can be done on the client-side this means every single method on the server side that is sensitive to the user s credentials should verify that the user is indeed allowed to access this functionality and not just guess that if he s accessed that method he must be
update in the case you mention where you render a jquery ui dialog as long as the buttons point to functionality thata verifies on the server-side that the user is who he claims to be then you are safe even though it s not the cleanliest code on the earth

9371681
dictionary	map
i m assuming you have a which is the java built-in dictionary structure
java doesn t let you iterate directly over a map it doesn t implement iterable because it would be ambiguous what you re actually iterating over

9376435
hex	binary
if you try to use it in an instruction which interprets it as a bcd value you will get an error because x007b contains the hex digit b which is not a valid bcd digit
bcd is hex bcd is not binary hex is not binary bcd and hex are representations of binary information

9376793
gtk	gdk
it is usually linked to a window on your desktop but doesn t have to be - in gtk 3 there is an offscreenwindow
a gdk window on the other hand is platform-dependent

9377891
fileoutputstream	filewriter
so at best use fileoutputstream
the solution with filewriter is working however you have no possibility to specify output encoding then in which case the default encoding for machine will be used and this is usually not utf-8

9378840
junit	testng
i did this using junit rules to have the logic in one place
don t know the apropriate tool for testng i m not to fond of the loop construct you are hinting at because it might make it difficult to run a test suit against a single specific database

9382808
profiling	instrumentation
i do not know how cocos compares to that but here is how to monitor the fps build your app using the profiling option so that instrumentation attaches to it
select core animation instrumentation in the graphics category

9385409
innodb	myisam
depends on whether your database stores any records to give you that information - mysql myisam does mysql innodb does not
in english - this is one lookup in myisam and n in innodb

9386647
rational-numbers	fractions
the solution this algorithm is capable of finding the true fractions values of rational-numbers that are artificially terminated due to precision limitations .3333333 would be 1 3 not 3333333 10000000
it does this by evaluating each candidate fractions to produce a value that would be subject to the same precision limitations

9390707
ssms	sqlcmd
these commands are not understood by sql server or other scripting tools like ssms
sqlcmd has its own commands which it parses separately from sql t-sql statements

9392494
cassini	iis
cassini has always lacked features and iis express avoids me having to configure iis for each web application
if you don t get an answer to this question personally i m not aware of any way around this i would recommend using iis express which is available as a free download

9393419
gridview	repeater
ideal way to display data from datatable as html table is using the gridview control - this give you most flexibility and control over the data
if you re not eager to spend time learning how to use the above it s fine the second best approach for what you need is repeater so i ll give the required code for this

9399539
inline	inlining
to declare a function inline use the inline keyword in its declaration like this if you are writing a header file to be included in iso c90 programs write __inline__ instead of inline
the three types of inlining behave similarly in two important cases when the inline keyword is used on a static function like the example above and when a function is first declared without using the inline keyword and then is defined with inline like this in both of these common cases the program behaves the same as if you had not used the inline keyword except for its speed

9399539
inline	inlining
the three types of inlining behave similarly in two important cases when the inline keyword is used on a static function like the example above and when a function is first declared without using the inline keyword and then is defined with inline like this in both of these common cases the program behaves the same as if you had not used the inline keyword except for its speed
when a function is both inline and static if all calls to the function are integrated into the caller and the function s address is never used then the function s own assembler code is never referenced

9399539
inline	inlining
gcc does not inline any functions when not optimizing unless you specify the always_inline attribute for the function like this the remainder of this section is specific to gnu c90 inlining
when an inline function is not static then the compiler must assume that there may be calls from other source files

9399556
namenode	hdfs
the moving parts involved are assuming that you are running on hdfs which you should be doing 1 hdfs namenode 1 or more hdfs secondary namenode s 1 or more hdfs datanode s for mapreduce if you want it 1 mapreduce jobtracker 1 or more mapreduce tasktracker s usually same machines as datanodes for hbase itself 1 or more hbase master s hot backups are a good idea 1 or more hbase regionserver s usually same machines as datanodes 1 or more thrift servers if you need to access hbase from the outside the network it is on for zookeeper 3 - 5 zookeeper node s the number of machines that you need is really dependent on how much reliability you need in the face of hardware failure and for what kind of nodes
the only node of the above that does not yet support hot failover or other recovery in the face of hardware failure is the hdfs namenode though that is being fixed in the more recent hadoop releases

9399556
namenode	hdfs
the only node of the above that does not yet support hot failover or other recovery in the face of hardware failure is the hdfs namenode though that is being fixed in the more recent hadoop releases
you typically want to set the hdfs replication factor of your regionservers to 3 so that you can take advantage of rack awareness

9400182
junit	testng
note using plain old junit 4 here not testng eclipse does appear to look up the class hierarchy for test annotations if the parent class is in the same project
the following example worked for me when running b as a junit test it executes a and passes

9400244
client-side	server-side
if you use a service reference to generate your client-side proxy be sure to check reuse types in referenced assemblies when generating the proxy
the class and object you created server-side doesn t exist client-side

9400244
client-side	server-side
the class and object you created server-side doesn t exist client-side
when you are using wcf you are serializing an instance of a class to data typically xml but it could also be binary depending on your binding sending it across the internet and then deserializing it into an instance of a similar class client-side

9400244
client-side	server-side
this is why private fields on your server-side class do not appear on your client-side class
if you want the attributes available client-side you re going to have to manually add them client-side

9400503
config	ini
i personally prefer config auto as its syntax is less wordy but both solve the problem
the answer is no you cannot parse an ini file using config general

9400503
config	ini
the answer is no you cannot parse an ini file using config general
from its documentation i have found that config general supports the parsing of a file that follows a certain set of rules only and that we cannot configure it to read a different format and i guess that s the way it should be

9400785
google-chrome	safari
your site does not render properly in safari mac which is also a webkit browser like google-chrome
i tried pulling up your stylesheet in safari mac and it downloaded to my desktop instead of displaying its contents

9401225
equals	gethashcode
in that case i d recommend overriding the equals and object.gethashcode methods and not writing a iequalitycomparer
the idea is that equals is the natural equality for that type and gethashcode should match that idea of equality

9401802
oncreate	onstart
for example the order of some common methods called is oncreate oncreatedialog and oncreateview onstart
so you can call getdialog and have it return something in oncreateview or onstart but not in oncreate or oncreatedialog

9401802
oncreate	onstart
so you can call getdialog and have it return something in oncreateview or onstart but not in oncreate or oncreatedialog
eventhough onstart is called called when the fragment is visible to the user adjusting the layout of the fragment at that point looks fine..

9401984
spaces	delimiter
tab delimiter documents should be delimiter by the tab character not by spaces
it s not done for layout it s all about separating content by a delimiter in this case the tab

9403354
ember.js	backbone.js
ember.js i found slightly more moo-ish as an interface though it did not quite click either
frankly backbone.js was less trouble to setup

9404637
ubuntu	linux
if that doesn t work you can always copy the working terminfo from the box you are ssh ing from across to your ubuntu machine
first establish that you do not have an entry for linux on the ubuntu box infocmp linux then on the machine that you ssh from make a copy of the terminfo infocmp linux linux copy it to your remote machine with scp and then on the remote machine install it with # tic path to linux you should also consider installing screen-256color as this is the terminfo tmux works best with

9409459
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
in udp it would be best to keep the payload at the size of the mtu 1500 bytes
unlike tcp udp does not buffer data

9409495
postgresql	mysql
my two cents there is this rumor going around that mysql does not scale very well with the number of rows in a table and that postgresql manages large tables much better in terms of performance
i would definitely prefer to use postgresql for an application with huge tables

9409562
lxml.html	elementtree
take a look at these two versions as you discovered the second version returns no nodes but the lxml.html version works fine
the elementtree version is not working because it s expecting namespaces and the html version is working because it ignores namespaces

9411941
implements	extends
of course this will not let your code inherit the methods set up by the parent classes and you would have to implements those yourself
for example not extends the base model class would make you set up your connection to the database and such

9415540
punctuation	words
you want to change that so it doesn t include any of the punctuation you re using for other purposes
you need to change your definition of a words

9417381
implements	extends
splqueue does not appear to implements the spl serializable interface and so cannot be relied upon to serialize unserialize correctly
you could extends splqueue implements serializable and then construct some appropriate serialization unserialization strategy for this purpose

9418230
innodb	myisam
first make sure subscriber is an innodb table type
the default table type on mysql myisam does not support transactions

9418387
noexcept	throw
exception specifications other than noexcept are officially deprecated -- and unlike many deprecated features removing this would affect little enough source code that i think there s a good chance it really will eventually be removed certainly no guarantee but a pretty fair chance anyway
as for what happens when if you do throw an exception of a type not allowed by the exception specification std unexpected gets invoked

9418426
noexcept	throw
in c++11 the throw has been replaced by noexcept presumably with the hope that compiler implementers will do something intelligent with it
edit since everyone including myself seems to have missed your question 4 bad_alloc will be throw by the operator new function if it cannot allocate the memory

9418563
actionscript	mxml
quick answer no you cannot add state based properties in actionscript
it s an mxml only affair

9422691
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
also when your table cell is tapped you ll want to segue to a view controller probably a custom uiviewcontroller subclass not a uinavigationcontroller
make sure you have set your storyboard up with the following a uinavigationcontroller - this should be set as the initial view controller for your app

9423635
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
mysql s like is case-insensitive by default the following two statements illustrate that string comparisons are not case sensitive unless one of the operands is a binary string but mongodb s regex searches will be case-sensitive by default because javascript s regexes are case sensitive
try using a case-insensitive regex

9423896
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
ot monodevelop is a great solution it could be even better if has one competitor in the linux environment
as far as i know sharpdevelop is using a lot of win32 calls this is why is not 100 percent a .net application and runs only on windows

9425065
coldfusion	railo
the cfvideo tag in railo is a railo-specific add-on for railo and is not available for adobe coldfusion
as gert pointed out the code for raio s cfvideo tag may be available and you could reverse-engineer it into a custom tag for adobe coldfusion but the tag itself is not part of the cfml language as adobe supports it as of coldfusion 9 anyway

9427310
profiling	debugging
because to be even worse the newest intel vtune threading profiling also does not use .dbg files anymore so i really want a delphi to pdb converter
sorry for shouting i have tried several things but no success yet. that s why i created my own stack viewer and minidump viewer which uses delphi debugging symbols .map .jdbg etc note i haven t tested my stuff on 64bit delphi apps yet.

9427377
clang	llvm
clang 3.0 still has some problems on windows i don t know if these problems are also on linux
for example compiling a lambda which clang doesn t support with -std c++0x will cause clang to crash and emit a diagnostic error. i was informed on the llvm irc that this is because clang implements parsing for lambdas but not semantic analysis which is the phase in which it crashes because they forgot to disable parsing lambdas for the 3.0 release and they already know about this bug also the illustrious mysticial kindly agreed to test this guide and made some observations during his testing windows headers seem to work

9429617
inline	inlining
extern and extern inline are out because you d get multiple external definitions if the header is included in more than one translation unit so you need to consider static static inline and inline specification
heptic correctly states in his answer that most compilers consider functions for inlining regardless of whether inline is specified or not ie the main impact of inline is its effect on linkage

9429617
inline	inlining
heptic correctly states in his answer that most compilers consider functions for inlining regardless of whether inline is specified or not ie the main impact of inline is its effect on linkage
however static definitions have internal linkage so there s not much difference between static and static inline

9429856
photoshop	fireworks
most designers i work with use photoshop
fireworks can import those psd files but the file is usually not suitble to extract css properties from

9429896
super	extends
i eventually ended up writing a super class for this
now whenever i write an app i do not extends activity i always extends a dummy class that i create say myactivity

9430719
pascal	delphi
enter pascal code here end
inline assembler does not work the same way in delphi as it does in gcc

9431009
build.gradle	gradlew
all required libraries have been configured in the build.gradle file as described in its entirety here this applies the groovy plugin sets up to use maven to grab the specified dependencies and then adds some extra values to the built-in test task
one extra thing in there is the last line which makes gradlew run all of my tests every time and not just the ones it thinks are new changed this makes jenkins play nicely

9432181
jpql	hql
limit is not supported by jpql
even without it your queries are not valid jpql queries but may be valid hql - and may work if your jpa provider is tolerant

9435812
lisp	scheme
while one can probably argue back and forth over what the correct approach is in my opinion the approach you suggest using the same data structures for reading compilation evaluation and processing is the one that will teach you the most about what lisp and the code is data mantra are about and in particular what the quote operator actually means which is quite a profound thing
it is also incidentally the way most lisps interestingly not including scheme traditionally work

9435812
lisp	scheme
it is also incidentally the way most lisp interestingly not including scheme traditionally work
so yes have the reader generate lisp data conses symbols lisp numbers strings et cetera the exact same stuff the user-level lisp code will deal with

9436012
ember.js	sproutcore
ember.js s design choices make it easier to integrate with projects like jquery ui so a full replacement may or may not be necessary
as someone who has both a sproutcore app and an ember.js app close to a production launch i ll take a stab at your questions re-ordered for clarity

9436084
heroku	engineyard
heroku seems to be more focused on total convenience while engineyard functions more like a service that sets up servers for you that you can work on yourself
i ve not used engineyard for production apps only tested them out

9436408
xdebug	xhprof
not to knock xdebug
definitely give xhprof a try

9437326
treemap	linkedhashmap
but if you fixed that then your treemap wouldn t let you insert multiple keys with the same value which is almost certainly also causing subtle breakages
a better solution would be something like this but basically you should fill in a map without sorting by values sort the entryset and then copy the entries in order to a map like linkedhashmap that doesn t need a comparator but just keeps entries in the order of insertion

9437893
vim	textmate
fyi vim exhibits the same behaviour
textmate doesn t do syntax-checking at all

9439743
textmate	sublimetext
however you can map textmate s txmt to sublimetext using this app there is also a sublimetext plugin that adds a sblm url handler windows-only
sublimetext 2 doesn t have a protocol handler

ssl	https
sandro meier above said correctly that if you have ssl access then this is best way to send via a http post a username and password so anyone else on the network cannot sniff these details
if you cannot use https then i would recommend from your iphone app. 1

9446328
inline	inlining
for example function calls may be inline or not so a call to your function from one place may need extra space on the stack and a call to the same function from another place or at another time may not need it or need less or more
this is called deep inlining in this document

9448203
ssl	https
i had this same issue and investigating the rack middleware handler not force_ssl but similar i could see that it was expecting that header to be set to determine if the request was already processed as being ssl by nginx
try setting this directive in your nginx location unicorn block proxy_set_header x-forwarded-proto https

9448785
jar	manifest.mf
note #3 do not use both the jar-with-dependencies maven-assembly-plugin and addclasspath maven-jar-plugin or you ll double all entries in the resulting jar
note #4 the java jar command line tool does also evaluate the manifest.mf s classpath besides explicit listing of jar files when invoking the tool as shown in my initial example see the index example of the jar doc

9449269
icmp	tcp
in the case your host b vanishes after it has sent its acks host a will not learn about that until it sends something to b which will eventually also time out or result in an icmp error
typically the first write send call will not fail as tcp will not fail the connection immediately and keep in mind that write send calls does not wait for acks until they complete

9450505
gif	png
an 8-bit gif image if compressed as 7-bit pixels wouldn t suffer less compression but also wouldn t benefit because the compression depends more on the repetition of the pixels than the symbol size
what you re seeing is that by using odd pixel sizes your effective compression decreases because of the way png compression works

9452429
uicontrol	uibutton
instead you could just use annotationthumbnail like this if you instead use a uicontrol subclass like uibutton map s delegate will get a -mapview annotationview calloutaccessorycontroltapped message if someone taps the callout accessory
uibutton is not a subclass of uiview so using an instance of uibutton in a place that expects a view isn t going to work

9454940
google-chrome	firefox
choose shell bin bash choose pass input as arguments and paste the following script the script checks if the http prefix is added as google-chrome does not pass it by default and opens firefox with the osx open command
save this service with the name open url in firefox and you are done

9455833
mvp	presenter
this is different when you use the gwtp mvp framework which has the concept of presenterwidgets and allows to nest presenter
the distinction between widgets and mvp is not as clear as you might think

9455833
mvp	presenter
it also depends on what kind of mvp framework you are using
with activities and places ok strictly not an mvp framework you usually don t have nested presenter see thomas broyer blog

9457003
udp	tcp
if you want reliability you need to implement it yourself or use tcp read udp here
udp is not a reliable transport protocol

9457100
udp	tcp
this happens even on localhost if threads are not strictly synchronized sending image over udp is not really great idea
image text are type of data which should really be sent over tcp - partial loss here can have significant impact

9458173
fgets	strtod
if what you mean by command line input is reading input from stdin then that has nothing to do with argv and you should instead be using scanf or fgets + strtod
note that there s also the function atof which is essentially a version of strtod that doesn t give you the extra error checking capability

9458951
comparator	comparable
least and maximum are simply objects and the object class doesn t have a comparator ... method simple as that
least and maximum need to be declared comparable not object

9460220
serializable	deserialization
this way the property will be skipped upon deserialization
java.io.notserializableexception javax.faces.component.html.htmlform the htmlform is indeed not serializable

9460226
opennlp	stanford-nlp
there is little coreference resolution documentation for opennlp at the moment except for a very short mention of how to run it in the readme
if you re not invested in using opennlp then consider the stanford-nlp package which includes a java example of how to run it including how to perform coreference resolution using the package

9460364
sudo	passwd
if you want to avoid re-typing your passwd try opening a sudo screen session first
then your shell will be logged in as root and will not prompt for the passwd

9460921
memcmp	strcmp
if the two strings are using the same encoding you can use memcmp
if they are using utf-8 and your strings don t contain the null character u+0000 you could even use strcmp since in the absence of null itself 0 does not appear in utf-8 encoded strings

9462159
innodb	myisam
innodb support relationships and myisam does not
if your application require this features you should use innodb . other major differences includes innodb is newer while myisam is older

9462159
innodb	myisam
innodb implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while myisam implements table-level lock
innodb has transactions while myisam does not

9462159
innodb	myisam
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not

9462159
innodb	myisam
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

9462159
innodb	myisam
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not

9466068
mp3	wav
all files that handle uncompressed data are pcm files. such as wav bwf aiff or sd2 for example. with encoded files like mp3 or aac you get the raw pcm values after decoding
as far as i know a broadcast wave file will have the bext header extension. if a file does not have the bext header extension it will be a normal wav aiff or whatever file

9469345
floating-point	fractions
you should read what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic jkolesar mait613 floating_point_math.pdf to give an inadequate summary floating point arithmetic is not a magic infinite precision mechanism -- it is an approximate way of representing an infinite set of real numbers using a small typically 32 or 64 number of bits
it does its work in binary not in decimal and the fractions exactly representable in binary are not the same as those exactly representable in decimal

9472214
dbcontext	objectcontext
either one will work but dbcontext has a much easier api to work with
if you are not using code first then the default data context is objectcontext rather than dbcontext which your code is designed to use

9472214
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you are not using code first then the default data context is objectcontext rather than dbcontext which your code is designed to use
if you are using objectcontext then you ll want to do this instead however i recommend right clicking in your model and add code generation item and add the dbcontext template

9474117
agda	idris
agda has universe polymorphism idris has cumulativity and you can have set set in both if you find this too restrictive and don t mind that your proofs might be unsound
i may not be the best person to answer this as having implemented idris i m probably a bit biased

9475304
translation	transliteration
the concept of simply cannot as far as i am aware be directly translation into haskell due to how haskell s io works with the type system
here s how i would do it if you re trying to transliteration the scala you might try this though it would be wrong the problem amusingly is that in this case haskell is too strict it will indeed prompt you forever even though you might hope that it would spit out answers along the way due to laziness

9475787
selecteditem	selectedindex
remember to make sure that selecteditem is not null before you do anything and when you re done handling the command set selectedindex to -1 so that they can select the same item twice and still get the functionality to execute
in your viewmodel add a property to capture selected item then in your xaml bind the selecteditem use mvvm light or some other way to bind the selectionchanged event to a command or wire up an event handler for the selectionchanged event

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
libav then renamed their bizarro ffmpeg to avconv to distance themselves from the ffmpeg project
during the transition period the not developed anymore message was displayed to tell users to start using avconv instead of their counterfeit version of ffmpeg

9477756
ffmpeg	libav
this confused users into thinking that ffmpeg the project is dead which is not true
a bad choice of words but i can t imagine libav not expecting such a response by general users

9477756
ubuntu	linux
if you want to use the real ffmpeg ubuntu 15.04 vivid vervet or newer the real ffmpeg is in the repository so you can install it with apt-get install ffmpeg for older ubuntu versioning your options are download a recent linux build of ffmpeg follow a step-by-step guide to compile ffmpeg or use doug mcmahon s ppa for ubuntu 14.04 lts trusty tahr these methods are non-intrusive reversible and will not interfere with the system or any repository packages
another possible option is to upgrade to ubuntu 15.04 vivid vervet or newer and just use ffmpeg from the repository

9478250
udp	tcp
nats keep a table of active connections sometimes known as a port mapping table that keeps track of how to translate the ip port pair for active tcp connections and observed udp sessions
there are some brands of routers that are known to clear the port mapping out of memory if it doesn t observe any traffic going over the tcp connection for some period of time

9479081
google-chrome	firefox
update as of october 2016 recent versions of google-chrome implement function#name and the various rules for assigning names
firefox still does not but they ll get there

9479086
spaces	delimiter
since each pixel needs at most 4 characters 3 plus spaces insert n after every 17 pixels. you can separate real lines with comments for example pixel11 pixel12 pixel13 pixel14 pixel15 # switch to next row pixel21 pixel22 pixel23 pixel24 pixel25 # etc.
i think you should not use r n as a line delimiter but only n

9481292
factors	matrix
this will work for a data frame that contains only numeric int factors or other variables that can be coerced to numeric but any chars strings chars will cause the matrix to become a chars matrix
if you want anna.table2 to be a data frame not as matrix then you can subsequently do other options are to coerce all factors variables to their int levels

9483266
udp	tcp
however udp doesn t have any congestion avoidance or congestion control mechanisms and senders using udp would continue to pump in data at the same rate
gradually tcp senders would reduce their sending rates to bare minimum and if udp senders have enough data to be sent over the network they would hog up the majority of bandwidth available

9484579
super	self
you call to super is off
you shouldn t be passing self into the method

9486406
moq	moles
in other words moq is not going to be any help to you here
for mocking statics i use a tool called moles which is free

9489360
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tried on my mac with firefox google-chrome and safari
firefox laggs nearly everytime but not always

9489360
firefox	safari
firefox laggs nearly everytime but not always
chrome and safari lag rarely but they do sometimes

9490499
allocator	stl
if you do not want to use boost or stl this is probably the best option and the simplest and you have control of everything you can even write your own block allocator for list elements to speed up things
i think that double-link list is exactly what you want assuming you do not want a priority queue easy and fast adding elements to both ends easy and fast removal of elements from anywhere you can use std list container but in your case it is difficult to remove an element from the middle of the list if you only have a pointer or reference to the element wrapped in stl s list element but you do not have an iterator

9490806
cvs	svn
multiple checkouts i m not familiar with cvs plugin but with subversion plugin i prefer to do things by hand i have trigger jobs that poll svn via subversion plugin and pass revision numbers as parameters to jobs that do actual work
those jobs then use explicit svn calls from shell build steps to update to revisions passed as parameters

9492215
punctuation	words
if they re also punctuation-delimited you might need to enumerate the punctuation
where s means not whitespace should get you what you want assuming the words are whitespace-delimited

9492994
prng	random
in any case random.seed merely sets the seed for the prng pseudo-random number generator used
that is random.seed will affect future random numbers generated and functions which utilize them but will not itself get a random value or shuffle or randomize anything

9492994
prng	random
it is usually fine if it is not called as there is a suitable default seed set but sometimes it s nice - for repeatability in tests or solitaire games - to set a particular seed. for instance try this if using python 2.x remove the parenthesis from the print from random import seed random # should all be the same value whatever that is. seed 1 print random seed 1 print random seed 1 print random # should be two different values and different from above print random print random # should be same as first three values seed 1 print random the key to understand is a pseudo random source prng takes the current internal state - which can be set with a seed although a modern prng has a much larger internal state - and uses that to generate a random value and the next internal state
a true random source specialty hardware that samples static noise does not have the concept of a seed

9498156
nhibernate	bltoolkit
ormbattle does not have a great reputation because it was started by one of the featured vendors rampant complaints of bias and nhibernate and llblgen two of the more popular .net orms were not represented properly
bltoolkit is not a feature rich orm like nhibernate and to a lesser extent entity framework

9498707
oncreate	setcontentview
but when you set alarm from b you are passing intent of activity c though your code of c doesn t have setcontentview method and also you have written finish in the end of oncreate so when activity c is called through the alarm set from b it just call activity c and set notification ..but as you written finish it ends activity c and shows activity b latest from the stack
if you want to cross check.. write logs in oncreate onpause and ondestroy of activity c ..and you will see the activity c is created and destroyed when alarm triggered

9501388
bash	zsh
since dash bash zsh and so on aren t fully compatible you should call the program without a specific interpreter because the author should have known what he does
maybe on your system sh is a link to bin bash but beware

9501656
rpm	yum
i finally decided to install maven2 2.2.1 manually not using an rpm at all the installation steps listed on the maven.apache.org website are very straightforward and all the files on maven is localized under one direction under e.g usr local apache-maven-2.2.1 after that end users only need to make a few lines in his her .bash_profile and that is it
forget about rpm jpackage and yum .

9501874
hex	binary
it would be much more helpful to see a hex view of these files instead of a text editor s intepretation
my guess is that at least one of the files is not opened in binary mode

9508840
couchbase	couchdb
from the comment i understand that damien katz is now working on this new project called couchbase but it s not couchdb s last version but just another nosql database
so if you were used to couchdb you could just use the last version of couchdb

9512432
ilist	icollection
this works on an ilist assuming that we want the first item each not the one with the highest number
be careful with different collection types like icollection or ienumerable as they do not guarantee you any order

9512634
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately i m at work and don t have my ubuntu machine with me to test
it appears that you cannot typically have both 64 bit and 32 bit jdk on the same linux system according to oracle

9516220
inline-functions	inlining
you might not care about naming conflicts of inline-functions but i guarantee that the compiler will
inlining is a later-stage operation during compilation - the compiler will first need to determine the call structure of your program which requires the compiler to correctly resolve all named calls

9516270
mp3	ogg
in a quick view it seems that the jplayer example you ve posted provides both m4a and ogg audio files not mp3
providing an ogg source means that firefox will use its native html5 capabilities

9519049
lisp	scheme
older lisp including emacs lisp until recently had lambda but not lexical scope so although you could create anonymous functions calls to them would be evaluated in the calling environment rather than the definition environment and so there were no closures
i believe scheme was the first language to get this right

9522505
division	multiplication
also the operation you are presenting in your example is a multiplication not a division
in case you might be interested there is the floor division that will return an integer insted of a float

9524360
innodb	myisam
however keep in mind that in such application innodb has far better performance
mysql uses locking table-level for myisam or row-level for innodb which does not allow 2 processes 2 calls to the script to modify the same row

9525780
innodb	myisam
there is a very good reason why you cannot execute disable keys on an innodb table
innodb is not designed to use it and myisam is

9525780
innodb	myisam
innodb is not designed to use it and myisam is
in fact here is what happens when you reload a mysqldump you will see a create table for a myisam table following by a write lock

9526693
decimal	ieee
if exact decimal math matters to you use decimal not float or real
when you are using floating-point values like real and float same thing the sql server round function follows ieee standard 754 and uses the round up algorithm

9526822
subtract	addition
now if you want a proper difference you need to take into account the overflow since the above result doesn t include the sign bit really the cpu doesn t care what gets subtract from what
it uses the same algorithm for integer addition subtraction moreover this algorithm is the same for signed and unsigned integers

9529235
spaces	delimiter
assuming your dates have - between them spaces hypen spaces you can do something like select substring_index datefield - 1 as fromdate substring_index datefield - -1 as todate from .. order by date fromdate substring_index string delimiter count returns all of string up to not including the count th occurence of delimiter
if delimiter is negative it counts from the right and returns the substring from the end of the string instead

9530372
setinterval	settimeout
the function your calling probably doesn t complete itself before you call it again.i assume you re using setinterval
if so i d suggest using it combined with settimeout

9530517
dns	spf
however the server receiving the mail a recipients pop3 server where received mail is stored and filtered is probably going to check whether or not that server is supposed to be sending mail for that domain based on what s in the domain s dns entries
in particular it will probably check the spf record so you will need to set this

9531391
portrait	landscape
your surface and camera management looks correct but i would doublecheck that camera actually accepted preview size settings some camera implementations reject some settings silently as you are working with portrait mode you have to keep in mind that camera does not give a fart about prhone orientation - its coordinate origin isdetermined by ccd chip and is always to right corner and scan direction is from top to bottom and right to left - quite different from your overlay canvas
but if you are in landscape mode everything is correct

9533467
config	ini
you should not be modifying config file like this
if you you have config that can be administered by the user you should be storing it in a database or worst case scenario in a generic file format ini xml etc

9533521
textmate	aptana
since these require ruby they can be a bit more powerful than the textmate bundles
if you need support for a language not already included as a bundle option in aptana you can almost certainly download a textmate bundle and then use the convert textmate bundle feature in aptana commands bundle development convert textmate bundle to create a new ruble

9533521
textmate	aptana
if you need support for a language not already included as a bundle option in aptana you can almost certainly download a textmate bundle and then use the convert textmate bundle feature in aptana commands bundle development convert textmate bundle to create a new ruble
by the way aptana stores rubles in a directory called aptana rubles which you ll find in your user documents directory on mac or linux or in your user directory windows

9534190
ubuntu	debian
then recommend installing the source package via apt-get source php5 if you want to see how php is built in ubuntu apt-get source php5 and peruse debian rules the . configure output in phpinfo is as the changelog for the patch states entirely misleading and not terribly informative
according to this bug report the configure command output was intentionally suppressed from ubuntu debian php builds

9537500
uiview	subviews
update you can convert coordinates automatically using the uiview convertrect toview method
since your button is a subviews of the bigger parent view touch events are not registered outside the bounds of the parent view

9538104
.htaccess	httpd.conf
it is not possible to change the value of safe_mode in .htaccess
the configuration setting can only be set in php.ini or httpd.conf as is explained in the manpages it also wouldn t be safe if it could be set in .htaccess

9539179
emacs	aquamacs
it looks like an aquamacs issue carbon emacs does not replace with
the change in emacs above work fine and i could type brackets but i could not use standard shortcuts anymore ctrl+c ctrl+v for instance

9539179
emacs	aquamacs
the change in emacs above work fine and i could type brackets but i could not use standard shortcuts anymore ctrl+c ctrl+v for instance
aquamacs provides a workaround. menu bar options option command meta keys select ...meta french it worked fine for me

9540234
ubuntu	linux
getting one of the packages directly from will solve that along with knowing exactly what you ve got as opposed to relying on whoever assembled the package for ubuntu
the first recommendation is to not install eclipse from any linux package manager or software repository

9542823
cfstring	nsstring
nsstring is toll-free bridged with cfstring ie you can just cast the pointer the thing it points to can be interpreted as either type and you can manipulate cfstring using vanilla c calls
so you d typically attempt cfstringgetcstringptr to try to get a pointer directly to the nsstring contents as a c string without any copying then fall back on allocating a suitably sized c-style array and cfstringgetcstring if the direct pointer isn t available typically because the encoding you want doesn t match the nsstring s internal encoding

9543168
octal	decimal
decimal 255 is equal to octal 377 use windows calculator in scientific mode to confirm hence a three-digit octal value falls in the range of 000 0 to 377 255 therefore 4715 is not a valid octal value as it is more than three-octal-digits rule
if you want to access the code point character with decimal value 4715 use unicode escape symbol u to represent the utf-16 character u126b 4715 in decimal form since every java char is in unicode utf-16

9543611
octal	decimal
these escape sequences originated in c or maybe in c s predecessors b and bcpl in the days when computers like the pdp-7 ruled the earth and much programming was done in assembly or directly in machine code and octal was the preferred number base for writing instruction codes and there was no unicode just ascii so three octal digits were sufficient to represent the entire character set
by the time unicode and java came along octal had pretty much given way to hexadecimal as the preferred number base when decimal just wouldn t do

9545721
jar	manifest.mf
the easiest solution as thorn pointed out would be to have the jar as a build-time dependency and invoke it statically from your code but if that is not possible you can use a urlclassloader to load the jar dynamically
if the jar is indeed runnable then you can read the main class from meta-inf manifest.mf and invoke main via reflection

9546541
centos	linux
be advised though that you might actually not need to do that insofar the amazon linux ami has been built to be binary-compatible with the centos series of releases and therefore packages built to run on centos should also run on the amazon linux ami
emphasis mine the desired package pptpd is not part of the standard repositories on centos either though but it is available in the 3rd party extra packages for enterprise linux epel repository see letter p - i can t comment on the viability of using this one vs

9549608
inline	inlining
today s compilers are pretty good at deciding themselves when to inline and when not so you hardly ever have to rack your brain about it
personally i ignore inlining during development completely until i have a more or less usable product that i can profile and only if profiling tells me that a certain function is called really often and also within a performance critical section of the application then i will consider force-inlining of this function

9549946
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
backbone.js does have that through underscore.js but it s certainly not the only one jquery apparently has it s own and then there s also mustashe.js that enough for you
no i don t know of a standard way to do this but yes that s what some of the javascriptmvc frameworks do like backbone.js

9550050
multiplying	multiplication
your matlab code doesn t work in double precision too try removing single and computing sin 2 53 because your twooverpi only has 53 significant bits not 175 and anyway you can t directly multiplying such precise numbers in matlab
second the scheme should be adapted to work with single and again the key problem is representing 2 pi precisely enough and supporting multiplication of highly-precise numbers

9551325
ubuntu	debian
when running on your example on ubuntu-10.04 it comes out with wa before vb the old way so ubuntu does not seem to agree with the new way . since postgresql relies on the operating system for this it will behave just the same as the os given the same lc_collate
there is actually a patch in debian glibc related to this particular sort issue but it was objected to and not accepted

9552236
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
the compiler is usually smart enough to know what to inline and what not to inline it can inline-functions you forgot and may not inline some you mentionned if he thinks it won t help
if really you still want to improve performance on function calls and want to force inlining some compilers allow you to do so see this question

9555116
set	bag
extract fields from your data set for example - if your dataset is a text a common way to extract fields is using the bag of words
store the training set and when a new dataset which is not labled arrives - find the k nearest beighbors to it according to the extracted fields

9556793
vbo	vao
the opengl es working group agreed that compatibility with opengl and the ability to to guide developers to more performant drawing by enforcing vbo usage were more important than the possibility of hurting adoption of vaos
so you can indeed bind two different buffers in a vao well the buffer binding isn t stored in the vao anyway only the source buffers of the individual attributes set through glvertexattribpointer but you cannot use client space memory in a vao only vbos

9557413
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if you re using ios 4 or better you can use the new animate method and get notified upon completion of the first animation sequence update please do not call animations from viewdidload it will make the experience laggy and your users unhappy
try calling it async from viewdidappear

9557656
lisp	scheme
lambda x + x x expands into function lambda x + x x it makes common lisp code look slightly more like scheme code and then it is not necessary to write mapcar # lambda x + x x some-list with the lambda macro we can write mapcar lambda x + x x some-list your example fails because is not valid common lisp syntax
common lisp expects either a data object a variable a function call in the form function args... a function call in the form lambda arglist ... body args... a macro form like macro-name forms... a special form using one of the built-in special operators like function let ... defined in the list of special operators in common lisp as you can see a syntax of macro-name forms... forms... is not a part of common lisp

9559081
super	self
the way to do this is to override the method and simply call the super class method method_decorator run_eight_times def undecorated_function self super myrepetitiveclass self .undecorated_function also two comments on your other code there s no point overriding the __init__ method if you re just calling the parent method but if you do need to that you should use super as i have done here rather than using the name of the superclass itself
self doesn t exist in that scope - it only exists inside a method and only then because it s passed as the first parameter

9559502
queue	fifo
as the number of elements required for queue is hard-coded change the definition of fifo_queue to and change the memcpy to
this will copy 120 bytes from fifo it will not copy the dynamically allocated array of fifo.queue

9560315
bash	zsh
per your note signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset. i have noticed that zsh does not ignore the signals sent back and forth between parent and child process but bash does
here s the question i posted myself trapping chld signal - zsh works but ksh bash sh don #39

9563297
debian	linux
i have myself always used linux debian as my server computer as you don t need to lose your processing power for nasty gui thats not required
i would go with linux

9563647
client-side	server-side
your server doesn t know anything about javascript because javascript is executed client-side
php gets executed server-side not on the client

9563716
icmp	tcp
icmp can prove the server is alive
tcp checking can show the web server is working but not the site

9566392
portrait	landscape
pressing back changes the orientation of activity 1 to landscape expected results activity 1 should be in portrait mode observed results behavior is observed only in gingerbread works as expected on froyo
you might be hitting this bug orientation does not change from landscape to portrait on emulator on 2.3 more than 45 people are facing the same issue with the androidd 2.3 emulator host os windows 7 sdk tools version revision 8 eclipse version 3.5 adt plug-in version 8.0.1 platform targeted by your project 2.3 version of the platform running in the emulator 2.3 steps to reproduce 1

tostring	string.format
you re relying on tostring for a double output
if you want to guarantee not to have an exponential notation you should format it using a decimalformat or with string.format

9567573
cvs	svn
the correct simplest and most robust way to do what you want is to use a version control system like cvs svn git etc
even when working alone on a project its a wise idea not just for having the code on different computers but also because it gives you all the benefits of version management like being able to rollback changes etc. there are many free or inexpensive cvs svn and git hosting options

9567980
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this works well but google-chrome still doesn t care
in firefox you can disable ipv6 which eliminates the problem entirely for that browser

9570242
jar	war
you can disable annotation processing by configuration for certain jar files
i used it for jar files only it may not work for exploded war s

9570242
jar	war
i used it for jar files only it may not work for exploded war s
look at line 76 tomcat 7.0.22 # list of jar files that should not be scanned for configuration information # such as web fragments tld files etc

9570357
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you cannot call findviewbyid until after you have called setcontentview
you are attempting to call findviewbyid on an activity from an initializer

9570618
equals	gethashcode
remember that null isn t equals to any object
always override gethashcode too

9570842
union	distinct
now you can see the mess of union s i had to do for this
which should probably be union distinct you should not be creating the in-clause with a group-concat

9574118
udp	tcp
sometimes the resolved name is too long and does not fit in the udp paquet
as a consequence the dns server send a udp reply with a dedicated flag raised in order to ask the client to use tcp this time

9574542
bmp	png
under advanced options in the save as bmp dialog ensure you select the a8 r8 g8 b8 format
if that does not work try saving as png instead of bmp

9575381
dbcontext	objectcontext
however this is not the same as using code first--you can still use the designer with dbcontext
that being said if you want to keep using objectcontext and not dbcontext then there is no value in using 4.3--it doesn t add anything to objectcontext

9576055
super	implements
super makes it possible to write classes designed to cooperatively implements methods as part of complex multiple inheritance trees which need not be known to the class author
but there s no way to use it to correctly inherit from arbitrary classes that may or may not use super

9579164
wordpress	joomla
this is a relatively new shopping cart system based on wordpress a super-powerful php cms sort-of-framework which you can customise as much as you want
it wouldn t have the same steep learning curve as a custom framework and would be much more flexible than a shopping cart built in joomla or magento note that i m not dissing magento here - it s a brilliant system but better suited for high-end commercial projects

9579332
vb.net	vb6
there isn t an exact equivalent in vb.net
edit well ok there s vbfixedstringattribute but i m pretty sure that exists solely so that automated migration tools can more easily convert vb6 code to vb.net for you and it s not really the .net way to do things

9579332
vb.net	vb6
edit well ok there s vbfixedstringattribute but i m pretty sure that exists solely so that automated migration tools can more easily convert vb6 code to vb.net for you and it s not really the .net way to do things
also see the warnings in the article for details on why this still isn t exactly the same thing as a fixed-length string in vb6

9580069
jar	war
here s a quick illustration of a typical ejb + jpa service bean obviously not production quality but just shows how lean they can be. the service layer and entities are packaged as an ejb jar which can be deployed separately and made available to all other modules via global jndi lookup
or they can be deployed within the struts or jax-rs war and as of java ee 6 glassfish 3.x they will be found deployed as part of the module and made available to other components within the same war

9580485
queue	fifo
calling isempty is still okay since that belongs to the collection interface of which queue is a derivative
you re looking for any class that implements the queue interface excluding priorityqueue and priorityblockingqueue which do not use a fifo algorithm

9581376
floating-point	fixed-point
not all the computers in the world use floating-point arithmetic
in particular many devices which have a connection to the world such as sensors and the computers which process their data use fixed-point representations of numbers

9585954
wav	caf
like that answer says the easiest solution will be to use the command-line afconvert tool to losslessly convert your wav to apple s default caf format and use that instead afconvert sound1.wav sound1.caf another possibility and the actual problem the op had is that the file doesn t exist and or pathforresource isn t successfully finding it which would be indicated by path being nil
the most likely culprit is the encoding on the wav

9586476
realloc	malloc
in general c++ arrays cannot be reallocated with realloc even if the storage was allocated with malloc
malloc doesn t give you arrays

9586750
express	node.js
here are some things you need to do implement the pull request linked above in package.json update your express 2.5.8 the version they have 2.4.8
isn t compatible with node.js v1.0.0 remove the hashlib directory from iosdocs node_modules npm install should now work

9588121
xna	slimdx
this can be used to create metro style apps and has been favourably benchmarked against xna slimdx and the windows api code pack
at the moment it seems that microsoft do not plan to support xna in metro style apps

9588491
required	placeholder
first i created a batch file that reads in a text file of websites to add that references your slightly modified batch file to only create websites no ftp s required newwebsiteentries.txt contains a list of websites to create - one per line no www
included site1.com site2.com site3.com lastly the batch file that creates the entries since in my case not all the new sites will be live at once i a default placeholder site who s contents are copied into the newly-created website directories

9589131
ssl	https
summary android 2.3 https ssl checklist if your ca is in android s 2.3 list of trusted ca s -- and thawte is -- there s no need to include the certificate in the app
android 2.3 does not support server name indication so if your server is relying on it for ssl handshaking android may not be getting the certificates you re expecting

9589493
serializable	deserialization
in other words no deserialization isn t creating an object and using the setters to populate the serializable data for you - it s just reaching into memory and giving you the instance you modified to 555
this works in the sample because everything s happening in the same process - your deserialization simply gets a reference to the singleton instance that you modified earlier

9589724
freebsd	linux
the following should work in linux freebsd netbsd osx etc
note that this is a bin sh script for the sake of portability so it doesn t take advantage of bash-isms you may be used to in linux in particular and heretext to read variables

9589976
udp	tcp
the fundamental problem with your approach is that udp does not guarantee delivery
if you have to use udp rather than say tcp you have to implement a scheme that would detect and deal with packets that got lost arrive out of order or are delivered multiple times

9590617
uiview	subviews
one is that uibarbuttonitem isn t a uiview
one way is to loop through the subviews of the uitoolbar or uinavigationbar

9592649
mp3	wav
if your goal is low latency the best option would be to convert to mp3 so you can use just use a soundloadercontext
like the_asman pointed out playing a wav file is not that easy

9593851
strdup	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
you could use strdup to return a copy of a c-string as in you could also use strcpy but you need to allocate space first which isn t hard to do but can lead to an overflow error if not done correctly if you cannot use strdup i would recommend the use of strncpy instead of strcpy
the strncpy function copies up to and only up to n bytes which helps avoid overflow errors

9593851
strdup	malloc
edit there you go there s one complication strdup is not in c or c++
so use strcpy or strncp with a pre-sized array or a malloc -ed pointer

9594607
equals	compareto
if you cannot get anything more clear i believe your only choice is to rely on e s implementation of equals
you should not need compareto because this would give you a definition of the ordering of the elements though it can tell you if two objects are equal

9594756
lisp	racket
i don t know offhand if modern common lisp implementations directly support executing assembly so it may be difficult to write drivers or use compiler-unsupported cpu instructions
i like common lisp but clojure and racket are not to be sneezed at either

9594816
cashapelayer	calayer
you could use a cashapelayer to define the mask then set that as the mask of another layer that renders your obscuring image color pattern whatever
you could also use a regular calayer as the mask with your semi-transparent image as the contents it depends on whether or not you want the ability to customize the size shape of the hole

9595589
lisp	scheme
some lisp like common lisp require this
others like scheme do not

9595642
client-side	server-side
so just in case it s not clear your requirements sound like you need a client-side mashup
portlets won t work because they are assembled server-side

9595886
ssl	https
if https is not listed then curl was not built with ssl support and you cannot use https
you can also look in the very first section for registered php streams and see if https is listed

9600183
pthreads	fork
however there s a win32 pthreads port which is a thin wrapper over the native threads api
a more appropriate example would be fork which cannot be emulated easily on win32

9601095
ssl	https
this is not necessarily related to ssl tls but more of a convenience facility to issue certificates
this has nothing to do with day to day use of https

9605664
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the bounds are not yet correctly set in viewdidload
examine the bounds in viewwillappear

9605942
erd	diagram
no i do not believe you can assume a database erd will always be planar
just thinking of dbs with any amount of complexity i don t see how you could in all cases make the diagram planar

9606443
client-side	server-side
the google charts api looks a the client-side data so you can t hide the data or google will not find it and not render the graph
the only alternative it to make the graphs api call server-side using xmlhttp then capture the result save the image then serve up that image in the browser

9608885
lisp	scheme
emacs lisp is rather different from regular lisp so it s probably not directly useful for classes or self-study if your target is something like scheme or common lisp
but yes emacs has its own lisp interpreter or rather is its own lisp interpreter

9609076
lisp	scheme	lisp	racket
if you were actually asking about scheme or could go for either scheme or common lisp take a look at racket not technically a scheme it actually has a lot of additional features but they do support r5rs and have a fairly short list of unsupported r6rs features
you have a few options for one-click lisp environments

9609120
cpython	ironpython
the bad news is as follows ironpython v2.7.2 rc1 s modulefinder doesn t appear to work so the above script needs to be run using cpython
it then uses cpython s modulefinder but against ironpython s customised runtime library

9614232
profiling	debugging
there may be special profiling type jvms that allow it but it s not possible with any of the standard jmvs - for obvious security reasons
the answer is no - if the jvm was not started with the debugging option you can t connect to its debugging port

9616027
antialiasing	transparent
that parameter is used to hide some antialiasing gaps using canvasrenderer
it works fine for opaque textures like the earth one but not for transparent textures like the shadow because the overdrawing effect

9617234
lisp	scheme
emacs lisp and common lisp are that way
the classical lisps use nil as the list terminator cons 1 nil producing the list 1 scheme is not a classical lisp in this sense

9617234
lisp	scheme
as far as it working consider the following quote from the r5rs scheme report note in many dialects of lisp the empty combination is a legitimate expression
in scheme combinations must have at least one subexpression so is not a syntactically valid expression

9618109
multiplying	multiplication
you can get the correct result rounded down to the nearest integer by multiplying first i ve used parentheses to make the evaluation order clear - you could leave them out if you prefer
note that for large values you ll need to be careful that the multiplication doesn t overflow - perhaps by converting to a wider type or to floating point or by carefully multiplying and dividing by smaller factors

9618659
client-side	server-side
client-side flow the client-side flow also uses the oauth dialog for user authentication and app authorization
the only difference is that you must specify the response_type parameter with a value of token as with the server-side flow you can also request additional permissions using the scope parameter it might be possible but it s not a best practice

9622593
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i suggest you look at using the uitabbardelegate method tabbarcontroller didselectviewcontroller combined with the uinavigationcontroller method poptorootviewcontrolleranimated so when the user selects a tab you can ensure that the navigation begins from the root controller
edit in response to comment it s not an ideal situation but you can reference the uitabbarcontroller in the app delegate

9624368
postgresql	mysql
details not tested postgresql but according to this site it should work select round date_part epoch now
to get the unix timestamp in seconds in mysql select unix_timestamp

9624642
cassini	iis
why is it different with cassini i m not really sure about
i just had the same issue and based on mikael s comment i tried deploying my application to an actual iis server and yes you can specify the actual status description and it will be returned to the client side

9626075
google-chrome	safari
no store works in google-chrome v17.0.963.66 - the page is not stashed in page cache and the back button causes a network request
no store does not work in safari v5.1.3

9627867
ienumerable	icollection
however in the general case it will iterate the entire ienumerable to get the count
if you do not have an icollection you d be better off using either of your two suggested methods when there are more than n elements

9629274
apache	nginx
since you say you have apache running i assume it is there to run dynamic content such as php otherwise it is not needed
in that case the example config below will serve all static content with nginx and pass others to apache

9629682
lodash	underscore.js
lodash is a clone of underscore.js that aims to be faster more customizable and has quite a few functions that underscore.js doesn t have
certain versions of it can be used as drop-in replacements of underscore.js

9633969
equals	gethashcode
you may not return different hash code for equals objects
for instance if one of the three fields you compare is an int you can return that field as gethashcode

9635443
gif	png	tiff	png
parameters imagedata - an array of pixels in an image format supported by the awt toolkit such as gif jpeg or as of 1.3 png see also toolkit.createimage java.lang.string getdescription image.getproperty java.lang.string java.awt.image.imageobserver there nothing such as support for tiff or raw contents isn t displayable common attribute for icon and imageicon that don t generating any error or exception
imageicon s api says public imageicon byte imagedata creates an imageicon from an array of bytes which were read from an image file containing a supported image format such as gif jpeg or as of 1.3 png

9636504
xna	slimdx
in order to get your device working with your program you ll need to either roll back to xna 3.1 or use a wrapper that allows direct input in 4.0 i d recommend going with the wrapper slimdx
if you re using xna 4.0 then your problem is due to xna not supporting directinput properly

9637991
prepare	execute
the two do not mix and pdo is preferred between them as it is more easily secured through the use of prepare statements among other reasons
from the pdo docs pass an associative array to execute rather than a list of arguments representing your placeholders

9644471
rpm	yum
however here is official rpm repository mirror one of many here is list of all mirrors you will need at least 3 rpms gcc-4.4.6-3.el6.i686.rpm gcc-c++-4.4.6-3.el6.i686.rpm libgcc-4.4.6-3.el6.i686.rpm for compilation of c c++ you will also need libstdc++ glibc etc when you run yum install gcc everything is done as you did not specified architecture i assume i386 but url is very similar for x86_64
yum will install rpm from it s repository

9645033
spaces	delimiter
oauth currently builds up headers as needed to be i modified the oauth.js file to reflect this. added a spaces after the comma towards the end of the line here is my working client sample hope this helps
so i am not sure whether this is an error with the oauth module or if instapaper s api is too strict in parsing the authorization headers but i had to add a spaces after the comma for the header delimiter

9645644
prng	random
prints nativeprng does not produce the same values with the same seed sha1prng appears to produce the same values with the same seed the default prng on this system is nativeprng go and try it first good advice but just trying it doesn t always give you the whole answer in this case
note with random a given seed will always produce the same results

9647725
prng	random
it should also be noted that the bn_rand_range function from openssl is also considered to use a pseudo-random number generation prng algorithm though i could not find details as for to what algorithm the function implements
because securerandom is a subclass of the random class securerandom objects can use all the methods of random including the .nextint int n method

9651741
google-chrome	firefox
extensions in google-chrome have way much strict rules than firefox s
in google-chrome there is no toolbar api and google has good reasons for no having it yet i m not discussing its reasons here

9654265
prepare	execute
instead use a prepare statement and thus let the jdbc driver escape the parameters for you this is the proper way to have database-independent robust code that is not vulnerable to sql injection attacks
and it also make it more efficient if you execute the same query several times with different parameters

9655010
google-chrome	firefox
firefox supports devicemotion but google-chrome on windows doesn t
on a lenovo thinkpad with lenovo airbag protection running firefox 10 will provide devicemotion events but strangely won t provide deviceorientation events

9655010
opera	safari
opera 11.61 on windows doesn t seem to support either api
safari 5.1.2 for windows doesn t seem to support either

9655160
nunit	mstest
i ve not yet used it this add-in for visual studio team system will allow you to run nunit tests just like visual studio unit tests integrated in visual studio
it makes visual studio to see nunit test as mstest

9659137
config	ini
my personal opinion is that you should stick with curl because timeout settings handles all possible http states easy and detailed config there is no need for detailed knowledge of http headers
question 1 at first you should check ini setting allow_url_fopen afaik this is the only reason why file_get_contents shouldn t work

9663118
innodb	myisam
on innodb however you can do that
unfortunately you cannot do that with myisam tables since any attempt to edit will lock the table

9666340
firefox	safari
i haven t investigated this much myself yet but i ve found others approaching it conditionally like you having quickly looked at the source of the ie- and the webkit firefox opera-version it appears that the ie-version is somewhat tailored for ie and will have issues if used on the other engines
an example is the implementation of on in the ie-version that uses attachevent which is ie-only maybe also opera and so wouldn t work on firefox safari etc

9667610
implements	extends
for clean oop you should implements the border interface
but if you do not to plan to extends any more your new border class with new classes that inherit from your border it is more convient to extends abstractborder

9671347
factors	mean
however there are other factors to consider for example dns resolution library fragmentation different versions for jquerymobile however it is more likely that another website is using it and the same version than it is with jquery so i would recommend using the cdn version
local in this case means that you host the files yourself as part of your website rather than relying on a cdn also it does not mean they need to be installed on the device

9671710
nsmutablestring	nsstring
don t assume that because you re accepting an nsstring that it s not actually an nsmutablestring
google s objective-c style guide covers this pretty well setters taking an nsstring should always copy the string it accepts. never just retain the string

9675447
innodb	myisam
i see you are using innodb
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam

9675447
innodb	myisam
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam
using count on innodb table perform either full table scan or full index scan every time you do it

9677723
debian	linux
ah right -- pandas we provide backport builds from neurodebian repository so you could easily use stable debian and bleeding-edge pandas
to my answer but here it comes as an echo to ogrisel s answer the best python distribution is debian gnu linux -- it comes with multiple versions of python supported hundreds if not thousands of python modules and extensions packaged so their installation is guaranteed to be flawless in 99 of the cases regardless how complex underlying software extension is majority of them are unit-tested against supported versions and 3rd party modules at package build-time guaranteeing lack of head-ache later on

9679701
visualvm	yourkit
you can start with visualvm
this may find your problem but if it doesn t try an evaluation version of a commercial profiler like yourkit

9679819
jar	war
first solution choose on your project now when you will debug the debugger will find the jar file - not the source
you has to attach source code to the library choose java project second solution run your project on tomcat as war file and debug remotely

9682201
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
now you push uiviewcontroller b b and a exist on memory you uinavigationcontroller still needs uiviewcontroller a it s just not showing and the view can be unloaded if the system needs memory but it won t release a
when you pop uiviewcontroller b it is released and if there aren t references for it again i assume this is how arc works it is dealloced

9682201
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when you pop uiviewcontroller b it is released and if there aren t references for it again i assume this is how arc works it is dealloced
well uinavigationcontroller always has a root

9682875
opera	firefox	opera	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
after delving into some source code i found on a web page that has also resolved the issue not google docs the secret is the following css this only works on google-chrome and perhaps opera though i have to verify if the latter is true as it s printing the background color by default while google-chrome prints with a white background and the colored background in my page might be just obscuring the header footer text
other browsers give differing results firefox and safari ignore the margins apparently and print the headers footers anyway

9683692
serializable	deserialization
serializable data contains of variable names and signature which will be used during deserialization
the y will be default because it was not described in serializable data

9685770
equals	gethashcode
it s checking that either they re references to the same object or that they re equals
your statresult class doesn t override equals gethashcode so two objects with the same values will be seen as different for testing

9689877
jar	manifest.mf
first it s kind of weird to see you run java -jar app and not java -jar app.jar second to make a jar executable.
you need to jar a file called meta-inf manifest.mf the file itself should have at least this one liner main-class com.mypackage.myclass where com.mypackage.myclass is the class holding the public static void main string args entry point

9690195
couchbase	couchdb
touchdb the new couchdb replication compatible database from couchbase does not use the same .couch format nor does couchbase server 2.0
copying a .couch file from any version of couchdb into one of those will not work as the database formats are significantly different especially for touchdb which uses sqlite underneath

9690915
rvm	bundler
if rvm notes doesn t give you the hints necessary to accomplish that then try carefully reviewing the docs for installation on the rvm website
if you use the command bundle install to install your gems off of a gemfile it will install the gems into your default system location for gems as outlined in the bundler docs here

9691556
memcpy	malloc
you need to cast away the const to initialize the fields of a malloc ed structure alternately you can create an initialized version of the struct and memcpy it you can make deneme_init static and or global if you do this a lot so it only needs to be built once
explanation of why this code is not undefined behaviour as suggested by some of the comments using c11 standard references this code does not violate 6.7.3 6 because the space returned by malloc is not an object defined with a const-qualified type

9692906
implements	extends
original answer very few js libraries implements extends -type functionality
nun is very mustache like but server only and no longer maintained swig has extends but isn t very mustache like

9693000
freebsd	linux
freebsd has an emulation afaik but i don t know if you can access it natively
if you want to target other platforms than linux you cannot use futex

9697684
strcpy	strncpy
for a quick fix replace with strcpy month january
or an equivalent like strncpy if you re one of those types who can t figure out how big their buffers should be - september the longest month will quite happily fit in ten bytes - what the former piece of code is doing is trying to set the character at offset 10 of your array to that string clearly not viable because you can t fit 8 bytes into a 1-byte bucket

9699971
implements	extends
to instantiate an object of an interface or an abstract class you need to override all of its not implements methods abstract methods
you can override the abstract methods by either using anonymous class or defining a class that extends the abstract class implements the interface and override the abstract methods

9701547
setinterval	settimeout
it might sound counter-intuitive but i recommend making your asynchronous requests a bit more synchronous currently you re using setinterval to run your check every five seconds regardless of whether a response has come back
what you could do instead is use settimeout to get it started and then set another timeout when your response has come back whether it was successful or not

9706369
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
your error comes from the class static initializers since you do not declare constructor of your class still get error in the fix initialize the list view in the oncreate after you call setcontentview r.layout.show
you can not do like that as static initializer in your activity the reason is that you have nto yet loaded the layout for your activity and thus this call will fail findviewbyid r.id.contentlist

9707452
mp3	m3u
the m3u-url indicates that this not an mp3 file but a m3u file - that s a list of urls to media files
avplayer and avplayeritem are capable of playing m3u8 files - that are m3u files which are utf8-encoded

9708129
opera	google-chrome
i m not sure when opera plans to add support
calc support has landed in google-chrome 19 with the -webkit- prefix

9709469
arraylist	treeset
other than that i m guessing that the problem is in your algorithm for sorted insertion in an arraylist and it is not related to the fact that the arraylist is growing
consider using a data structure that guarantees sorted insertion like a treeset

9712840
client-side	server-side
setting a value client-side does not update viewstate
you have to set the style server-side for viewstate to store it

9713633
postgresql	mysql
where true is pointless as it just adds your databases s true literal t for postgresql 1 in sqlite and mysql to the where clause and that doesn t do anything useful
for example if you say then your sql will end up like this in postgresql and that s the same as just saying when a query is confusing you sometimes it is helpful to add a .to_sql at the end in the rails console and see what the sql ends up doing and if you don t know sql then you should learn it if you intend to use a relational database in any capacity

9714461
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
as for the underlying cpu operations there are some rules of thumb but you have to haul out the appropriate cpu manuals to see which ones apply for integers addition subtraction and logical operations like and or xor are never any slower than any other operation for integers multiplication is harder than addition may be slower than addition etc but may still be very fast as long as there is sufficient cpu-power dedicated to it
and division may be slower than multiplication or may still be fast for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu if there is no fpu floating point is likely slower than integer if there is a barrel or funnel shifter shifts are always fast but if not shifts may take longer depending on how far the shift goes x 4 may be slower than x 1 in modern cpus the instruction scheduling alex mentioned above may or may not depend on the order of instructions it may help to intersperse fpu instructions among integer-unit instructions or it may not cache effects including placement of branches near particular points in cache lines as well as multi-level cache misses and also tlb misses can completely swamp the effects of careful instruction scheduling on some cpus these kinds of things make writing modern compiler-optimizers pretty tricky

9716659
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo to allow a specific command to run without a passwd
this doesn t require you to know the passwd

9717155
inline	inlining
note that inline var obviously cannot be changed so there s no reason to inline non-static var
if you inline geter or seter it will be treated as after inlining this will be changed with reference to the class

9717718
backgrounding	multitasking
i suggest you review the ios programming guide and particularly the backgrounding execution and multitasking section
normally when an app enters the backgrounding it is suspended so it doesn t execute at all

9725644
onresume	onpause
you always go through onresume
the onpause - onresume loop does not go through onstart

9725644
onresume	onpause
the onpause - onresume loop does not go through onstart
if you need this to be executed on the start of your activity put it in onresume

9726244
trie	tree
there are also specialized data structures such as a trie but i have not yet explored
now for your problem you could use the search tree to write a search function such as where tree is the search tree containing the words of the length that you wish to search for and letters is a list of valid characters

9726462
serializable	deserialization
why not simply serializable the collection as json into a hidden form field
your collectiontojson method would call ko.tojson or the mapping equivalent and then you would have to handle deserialization yourself server side

9727752
freebsd	linux
since it s looking for libraries in usr lib you seem to be running the freebsd version of python
since freebsd s linux compatibility is a per process compatibility you cannot load linux libraries into a freebsd process

9728040
spaces	delimiter
for example if you were to enter then would become however your code doesn t have a common delimiter - except for the spaces before it
so you can use align by spaces from the toolbar or ctrl + ctrl + spaces but you ll have to remove what s already assigned to ctrl +

9729770
lisp	scheme
strictly speaking funcall would not be needed but there are some lisp list-2 implementations such as common lisp that separate the variable name space of the function name space
list-1 implementations scheme do not make this distinction

9729773
lisp	scheme
however this means that when you store a function in a variable you can t call it normally hence the need for funcall and apply not all lisp have two namespaces scheme is an example of a lisp with just one namespace.
the majority of lisp have two namespaces functions and variables

9730638
client-side	server-side
you re looking for client-side validation - this isn t specific to fluentvalidation or dataannotations
both mechanisms will work server-side automatically you have to wire fluentvalidation up to do this automatically after model binding or run it manually

9730689
datamapper	activerecord
you don t need to use rails for this datamapper drops nicely into a regular app even something that isn t web-based
you can use datamapper which is a relatively lightweight orm system compared to activerecord in combination with an sqlite database

9731658
multiplying	multiplication
for each pair of matrices you want to multiplying you will want to load the multiplicand and multiplier matrices into memory once and then allow all of your worker threads to access the memory simultaneously
this should be safe because those matrices will not be changing during the multiplication

9732592
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
according the documentation the navigationcontroller of uiviewcontroller this property is nil if the view controller is not embedded inside a navigation controller
that s said if you access the navigationcontroller before embedding into the uinavigationcontroller not push yet it will return nil

9732596
octal	decimal
since 8 and 9 are not a valid digits in octal 08 and 09 are invalid numbers and both interpreted as just 0
08 is string and even in case of arithmetical operations will be interpreted as normal decimal integer echo 08 + 08

9734198
inline	inlining
so the function can be inline but not have its body pasted instead of being called
the compiler can ignore inlining if specified by the inline keyword

9734303
inline	inlining
the compiler is as always free to inline whatever it thinks as long as it takes care that functions that are either explicitly or implicitly inline will not lead to linker errors
how it does that is left open by the language spec -- inlining the function of course works but it is also acceptable to demote the symbol visibility or rename the symbol to a translation unit specific name as if the function were in an anonymous namespace or as most of them do communicate to the linker that multiple copies of that function may exist and that it should discard all but one of them

9736171
opera	google-chrome
specifically json was introduced in ie8 firefox 3.5 - opera 10.5
google-chrome 1 afaik json2.js checks whether json.parse is already implemented and only provides it s implementation if it doesn t

9736776
division	multiplication
the reason why division can be so slow is because processors generally only have one division unit and it s often not pipelined
so you can have a few multiplication in the pipe all executing simultaneously but no division can be issued until the previous division finishes

9736986
inline	inlining
inline is a hint not a requirement
the keyword does change the rules slightly but does not force inlining

9737335
spaces	linefeed
sgml refers to iso 8859-1 mind the spaces between iso and 8859-1 which is not a hyphen as in the character sets you use
it does not allow control characters but three here sgml in html in the html document character set only three control characters are allowed horizontal tab carriage return and linefeed code positions 9 13 and 10

9737851
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in ios 5 you can do this with a custom uiviewcontroller but or you could use one which apple provided
uinavigationcontroller can do it but unless you are also using it to navigate a tree like structure of view controllers it s probably not the best option

9741343
google-chrome	firefox
that said support multiple webdriver instances differs between browsers google-chrome works great with multiple google-chrome instances running locally
firefox has sometimes worked depending on the version of webdriver and firefox ie cannot driver multiple instances locally

9742562
g++	gcc
i think you ll need to modify the header file to get g++ to accept it
gcc accepts it as valid c but that s not helpful if you need to #include it from a c++ source file -- unless you write a c wrapper and invoke it from your c++ code which might be an acceptable workaround

9742872
svg	vml
rapahel uses svg for almost all browsers and fall back to vml on ie
that might explain why the hide call is not working jquery may not be able to hide a vml element

9742940
punctuation	words
frequently if you start with a string of tokens you need to preprocess them for example remove punctuation or special symbols remove words that are not relevant stemming etc
but maybe you can use some symbols say punctuation between cities and countries - melbourne australia so you assign that set of useful punctuation symbols to other symbol # and use that as a context so the next time you find an unknown words next to a comma next to a known country you can use that knowledge to assume that the unknown words is a city

9743184
setinterval	settimeout
instead of setinterval use requestanimationframe
support is not that great at the moment so you may want to shim its functionality with setinterval or the recursive settimeout pattern

9743874
awt	swing
your code isn t runnable 1 don t mixing awt frame with swing jcomponents not sure never tested but i think that awtutilities is only for swing jcomponent then public class gameview extends frame could be public class gameview extends jframe 2 must be 3 for why reason is there code line repaintmanager.currentmanager null .setdoublebufferingenabled true
i saw code for printing where is for faster printing turn double buffering off but value currentmanager null simply doesn t make me any sence 4 never use public void update graphics g this method is used internally in the api use paintcomponent instead 5 for moving with jcomponents use swing timer with calling repaint 6 jlabel is transparent by default remove this.setopaque false

9744170
innodb	myisam
further more innodb runs faster if it is properly tuned using my.ini or other configuration file
at the end i am able to understand following reasons why people are praising innodb it is acid compliant and transaction supported engine it take row-level locking while working on a table while myisam take table-level locks innodb is highly tunable for multi-core multi-process machines to improve concurrency last but not the least comment from my side

9744357
innodb	myisam
if you re going to keep using mysql it s highly recommended you get some experience with innodb
but if you re doing a quick-and-dirty job for a database that won t see a lot of traffic and not worried about scale then the ease of myisam may just be a win for you

9744357
innodb	myisam
but many of my tables will not be updated you can still get a performance lift from innodb if you are doing 99 reading
if you configure your buffer pool size to hold your entire database in memory innodb will never have to go to disk to get your data even if it misses the mysql query cache. in myisam there is a good chance you have to read the row from disk and you re leaving the operating system to do the caching and optimization for you

9746087
setinterval	settimeout
it doesn t use settimeout it uses setinterval which is in custom which is called at the bottom of the animate method
here s a good tutorial as explained in the tutorial settimeout schedules an event to occur a certain amount of time after the settimeout function is called

9746137
fileinputstream	filechannel
the normal reading writing functionality fileinputstream etc does not provide any thread-safety afaik
to achieve thread-safety you need to use filechannel

9751427
png	ico
try using a different service to get the favicon t png will give you a png which bitmapsource will happily load
your problem is that the image that is returned is of type ico which is not supported by bitmapsource

9752937
client-side	server-side
that isn t to say that client-side validation is awful and should never be used
but it should always be backed up by server-side validation

9753084
pbkdf2	md5
php implementations php-crypt-lib pbkdf2 by inanimatt
md5 was designed to be hash which is one way only otherwise it would not be a hash

9753322
hex	binary
note 3 these aren t complex algorithms and you shouldn t need to mess about with high level languages first unless you don t understand the theory maths behind binary hex conversion perhaps
also an algorithm that seems elegant in one language can be an ugly mess in another language you can t detect overflow in an easy clean way in c so the method used for binary conversion above wouldn t be obvious or elegant in c

9753503
noexcept	throw
as of the copy-constructor if you don t define it the implicitly declared copy constructor will be noexcept or not depending on whether all the members of your type are noexcept again not only that they don t throw but that they have that qualification
after the edit your implementation of operator- is guaranteed not to throw any exception well at least if you mark as noexcept that is and it is thus safe to mark it as noexcept

9753503
noexcept	throw
unless you explicitly mark it as noexcept it will not have that qualification
now depending on the implementation of and the copy-constructor it might actually never throw but that does not make it noexcept

9753836
ssl	https
if you want ssl enabled you will have to generate a ssl self-signed certificate at etc certs monit.pem thanks to the following procedure for instance
probably your configuration is ssl enabled but you have not generated the private certificate for https

9755245
ember.js	backbone.js
ember.js would make things even simpler than backbone.js
because of ember.js s binding you wouldn t have remove the element from the dom

9757907
inline	inlining
the way member is defined recursion is confined to go and member itself is not recursive and can be inline
from the ghc user guide ghc ensures that inlining cannot go on forever every mutually-recursive group is cut by one or more loop breakers that is never inline see secrets of the ghc inliner jfp 12 4 july 2002 . ghc tries not to select a function with an inline pragma as a loop breaker but when there is no choice even an inline function can be selected in which case the inline pragma is ignored

9758819
spaces	delimiter
note though that the values are not allowed to have the special characters in them like or - with a spaces prepended otherwise the format is not really definable
since the original string already contains those spaces delimiter try it matches the string anything anything -anything

9760567
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here
by using strcpy - or by using memcpy - or by using strncpy - i would suggest to use strcpy for simplicity because it is common for copying strings and the name is also intuitive

9761106
comparator	comparable
first of all the node class should extend comparable and override the comparator method in it
arraylist class doesn t extend comparable and hence the following will not work s.compareto n 0 s being an arraylist reference

9765291
pygobject	gio
the pygtk faq especially section 20 has some tips for this although some of it may not be relevant to the new pygobject
gio is the io library that gtk+ uses but i don t see a reason why any other library can t be used

9770181
dictionary	map
in summary don t use dictionary or hashtable unless you really have to for compatibility reasons use either hashmap if you don t need thread safety or concurrenthashmap if your map is used in a concurrent environment
dictionary is an abstract class superclass of hashtable . you should not use dictionary as it is obsolete . as for hashtable the advantage it had over other maps such as hashmap was thread safety but with the introduction of concurrenthashmap since java 1.5 there is no real reason to use it any longer - see javadoc as of the java 2 platform v1.2 this class was retrofitted to implement the map interface making it a member of the java collections framework

9773927
extjs	gxt
gwt 2.4 has fixed many of the aforementioned issues and a great widget library is just coming out of beta extjs gwt 3.0.4 a.k.a
gxt which is written completely in gwt not a wrapper of a js lib

9774065
jboss	weblogic
i am not sure what you are using jboss websphere weblogic etc and i am no expert on any of them we stopped using ejbs a long time ago but any time you get a noclassdeffound error it means the current classloader the one that loaded the .class your code id in cannot find a referenced class
i know many many moons ago jboss used to have the idea of a universal classloader

9775394
dictionary	map
see the following for more information and work-arounds entity framework 4 poco with dictionary ef code first - map dictionary or custom type as an nvarchar
entity framework does not presently support mapping a dictionary natively

9776097
express	node.js
only express needs the jade object to render your views.
there is no window object in node.js because it s not in a browser

9778106
ienumerable	iqueryable
the error you are getting error 79 cannot initialize type catalogservice.catalogresults with a collection initializer because it does not implement system.collections.ienumerable is because you re trying to create an ienumerable within the catalogentry object by referencing the item variable
the trick here is to create a iqueryable and then take the firstordefault value as your response if you want a single response or toarray if you want an array

9778585
bufferedreader	ioexception
i m not sure there is any case that you want to continue to run reading from an bufferedreader after it threw such an exception
you should handle your ioexception better and just return or break out of the while true loop

9781617
cpython	pypy
it is used to write cpython extensions
the following doesn t strictly adhere to the requirements but i d like to mention it anyway and it is too long for a comment pypy s rpython can be translated to c

9784439
mvp	presenter
to display data in mvp passive view the view does not know about model
presenter passes data from model to view

9785094
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome worked as expected it checked the manifest file for changes and reloaded everything if the manifest file changed
firefox didn t even download the manifest file from the server so it could not notice changes

9787901
jar	manifest.mf
the jar you are pointing to is not the jar..extract that using winrar and you will get another jar inside it
called jacocoagent.jar .to check whether you got the right jar just extract jacocoagent.jar and look for manifest.mf and it should have an entry for premain class

9788634
cassini	iis
if you are using cassini or the web server built into vs then ssl is not supported
but if you change your web settings by choosing properties from your project you can host in iis

9790149
postgresql	mysql
postgresql does not keep track when a table was last modified
so there is no equivalent for sql server s dbts nor for mysql s information_schema.tables.update_time

9790966
serializable	deserialization
the workstep reference will not include the version number anymore both workstep and process serializable is cleaned up
version number is not serialized and not used on deserialization and a uniqueid can be used instead of the type name

9791177
google-chrome	firefox
the reason that google-chrome doesn t give an error-message is that it doesn t support that nonstandard feature so it s simply ignoring that argument entirely
change this to any of these the reason for the error-message is that in firefox string.replace takes an optional third argument representing regex flags i or g

9791477
udp	tcp
the code to do that would be different for indy ics synapse or whatever other library you re using to write your tcp ip or udp game protocol server code
you could use udp broadcast message but that might not be the right solution for some game systems

9792782
org.json	gson	org.json	jackson
org.json jackson and gson with gson being 10x slower
it s not really fair to compare org.json however because it doesn t include object binding code

9793247
mathml	mathjax
i am told that you can use an xslt translation to convert content to presentation mathml though i don t know how that is done
mathjax only implements presentation mathml not content mathml

9793278
google-chrome	firefox
personally i d drop the top 20px to have firefox 11 render the sub-menus the same as google-chrome and ie9
based on what i can see it looks like google-chrome and ie9 are rendering the page appropriately but firefox 11 is not

9795702
irc	xmpp
i know this is a very old post and the op will likely not see the reply or maybe even care any longer but i would deploy irc over xmpp personally
the big reason for this is the amount of memory that xmpp servers occupy as more and more xmpp clients connect

9795702
irc	xmpp
contrasted with irc i ve personally seen thousands of connections to a single instance and the memory utilization is usually 60-70 less
the irc server does not need to parse the messages passed from the client file transfers are client-to-client via dcc and the design is much much simpler than the xml-based xmpp

9795702
irc	xmpp
and if an irc server netsplits it doesn t take every client offline- only those connected to it
so the impact is minimal compared to xmpp unless you re doing s2s

9795940
serializable	deserialization
however if the bottle neck is cpu time spent serializing and deserializing then try using a faster serializable method such as protobuf.net
as this answer suggests serializable deserialization generally cannot be avoided without a lot of refactoring

9798121
textview	imageview
from the google app widget guide a remoteview object and consequently an app widget can support the following layout classes framelayout linearlayout relativelayout and the following widget classes analogclock button chronometer imagebutton imageview progressbar textview viewflipper listview gridview stackview adapterviewflipper descendants of these classes are not supported
so if we check the code for example textview the textview can be used in widget has the annotation remoteview but the webview dont have the remoteview

9798213
dbcontext	objectcontext
documentation for dbcontext says the following dbcontext wraps objectcontext and exposes the most commonly used features of objectcontext by using simplified and more intuitive apis
you can access the underlying objectcontext whenever you need to use features that are not supported by dbcontext

9798936
dictionary	map
searching with the dictionary can be further improved with something like a bloom filter if the average case is the object not existing in the hash map
dictionaries are usually implemented in two ways a hash map or a binary tree

9801396
email	dkim
i haven t used domainkeys identified mail dkim via actionmailer with amazon ses myself yet but here s how i d approach it review authenticating email with dkim and take note of the closing note specifically note if you are using the amazon ses smtp interface to send email and your client software automatically performs dkim signing you should check to ensure that your client does not sign any of the headers listed above
we recommend that you check the documentation for your software to find out exactly what headers are signed with dkim

9803386
xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin
see this and this guides. unfortunatelly catalog support in xjc is not always working as expected and it s a bit hard to debug it
resolving schemas from maven artifacts if you re using maven you can use maven-jaxb2-plugin which can resolve schemas within maven artifacts rewrite_system maven org.example a

9807301
wadl	wsdl
the service list page is an html page listing the services and providing links to the appropriate wsdl documentes for those services or wadl docs for the rest based services
it s not a wsdl document

9809017
ssl	https
this article using curl in php to access https ssl tls protected sites has some workarounds fixes for this error when using curl in php
you are most likely seeing this error because you are using a self signed certificate that the ssl client doesn t trust

9810607
slug	permalinks
yes in wordpress you cannot have duplicate slug categories taxonomies tags
so if your theme allows for media files and permalinks to have their own page and the slug is the same as another one it will usually append a number to it because the database does not like it

9811858
express	node.js
i m not familiar with the vhost functionality in express
however i think you re asking for trouble by running what is effectively 3 different apps with 3 different scalability needs in a single node.js process

9815222
profiling	debugging
this profiling your cpu activity and see s what threads are in use and what is doing the most processing
you also need to factor in a couple of more things -you are probably running in debugging mode this means that some of your cpu is being dedicated to vs and to check for exceptions and what not

9817409
viewdidload	viewdidappear
simple saying we are not allow to call presentmodalviewcontroller pushviewcontroller in a viewcontroller viewdidload viewwillappear
we need to call this in viewdidappear

9817605
viewdidload	viewdidappear
simply saying we are not allow to call presentmodalviewcontroller pushviewcontroller in a viewcontroller viewdidload viewwillappear
we need to call this in viewdidappear

9820403
tabcontrol	tabitem
you should better have a fixed tabcontrol size relative to the size of window and let the tabitem resized according to the size of tabcontrol
edit make sure that the row or column that contains the tabcontrol is not auto sized

9820403
tabcontrol	tabitem
edit make sure that the row or column that contains the tabcontrol is not auto sized
if your code looks like following your tabcontrol will be resized according to the active tabitem

9823239
vbscript	vba
edit for what it s worth this also worked for me by inserting it into a vbscript .vbs file text in windows xp and adding this line to the bottom of the file call vbasolution i do not know whether or not it requires office to be installed or if the appropriate dbf drivers come with windows
this worked for me using both microsoft access vba and microsoft excel vba

9823788
javassist	cglib
javassist javassist the javadoc of javassist is way better than that of cglib
the class engineering api is ok but javassist is not perfect either

9823788
javassist	cglib
the class engineering api is ok but javassist is not perfect either
in particular the proxyfactory which is the equivalent of the cglib s enhancer suffer from some drawbacks too just to list a few bridge method are not fully supported ie the one that are generated for covariant return types classloaderprovider is a static field instead then it applies to all instances within the same classloader custom naming could have been welcome with checks for signed jars there is no extension point and almost all methods of interest are private which is cumbersome if we want to change some behavior while javassist offer support for annotation attributes in classes they are not supported in proxyfactory

9823788
javassist	cglib
in particular the proxyfactory which is the equivalent of the cglib s enhancer suffer from some drawbacks too just to list a few bridge method are not fully supported ie the one that are generated for covariant return types classloaderprovider is a static field instead then it applies to all instances within the same classloader custom naming could have been welcome with checks for signed jars there is no extension point and almost all methods of interest are private which is cumbersome if we want to change some behavior while javassist offer support for annotation attributes in classes they are not supported in proxyfactory
on the aspect oriented side one can inject code in a proxy but this approach in javassist is limited and a bit error-prone aspect code is written in a plain java string that is compiled in opcodes no type check no generics no lambda no auto- un boxing also javassist is recognized to be slower than cglib

9825715
implements	extends
let s say that c and d are two classes that extends a and implements b
you could have even declared a type argument for which there is not even an existing type that you can use like saying something that extends serializable and closable and comparable and appendable

9827533
content-length	content-type
for wget no formatting is applied but for google chrome wireshark shows text formatted with spaces and newlines it really is different data - the content-length is 210 in this case
note that content-type is still text javascript - they are not rendering into html

9827635
.htaccess	httpd.conf
another option is that your apache server could not get the .htaccess
check if the allowoverride option is all in the httpd.conf file

9827665
tiff	bmp
we can put anything in a blob column - docx tiff exe the database doesn t care
in order render a blob as a picture we need an application which can interpret the binary protocol bmp

9828186
equals	gethashcode
firstly as i think you understand wherever you implement equals you must also implement gethashcode
the implementation of gethashcode must reflect the behaviour of the equals implementation but it doesn t usually use it

9828186
equals	gethashcode
the implementation of gethashcode must reflect the behaviour of the equals implementation but it doesn t usually use it
see - especially the notes to implementers so if you take your example of the item implementation of equals you re considering both the values of id and name to affect equality

9829548
uiview	catransition
this extra uiviewcontroller serves as a container for the other two kind of like how currently self.view is a container for the two uiview you have
you cannot use catransition to switch between two view controllers but you can simply use the view controller s view and switch it with another view controller s view

9831582
consistency	acid
i have not found a case where making data immutable does not solve the consistency problem
this combined with making transactions part of the data model as immutable data write once read many the acid requirements are met

9831787
onchange	onblur
so this does work in newer versions of chrome and chrome on android the onchange event is invoked when the date is chosen the onblur event is not invoked when the dropdown is dismissed only once the control loses keyboard focus here is an example showing which event is generated using plain javascript
the onblur function is invoked when the date time picker is dismissed

9833304
voip	sip
not all android-powered devices support voip calls using sip
even 2.3+ android phones may not support sip

9833408
fseek	fread
ok got it this time i think. the issue is this line fseek file size_segment seek_cur
it isn t needed because the line fread segment size_segment 1 file

9833819
persistent	transient
the identity value of an entity should be managed by the persistent layer and ideally would not be settable by anything else - the persistent layer should assign a new identity value upon persistent and set it upon retrieval
furthermore you should be able to use a transient not persisted entity without needing access to its identity

9834914
sudo	passwd
what you should do is follow chris james s answer sudo -u postgres psql postgres # passwd postgres enter new passwd to explain it a little bit.
caution the answer about changing the unix passwd for postgres through sudo passwd postgres is not preferred and can even be dangerous

9834914
sudo	passwd
caution the answer about changing the unix passwd for postgres through sudo passwd postgres is not preferred and can even be dangerous
this is why by default the unix account postgres is locked which means it cannot be logged in using a passwd

9836997
http	spdy
to speed up a things you can also reduce number of requests needed to load your page compress for your http responses combine your css js files together and minimize them for example by using yui compressor or google closure compiler put small images into one big bundle so that they are loaded using single request online tool for putting images together implement spdy support on your server -- that s probably not something you ll do but it s interesting idea worth mentioning
caching tutorial -- this is pretty good article describing http caching process and related headers

opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
doing works in google-chrome ie 9 not 8 and opera at least version 11.61 which is the one i have installed
it doesn t work in firefox don t know why

rvm	bundler
googling turned up not only this question which didn t help me - this project isn t ready for bundler plus we re using rvm so sudo is out but also irc logs from when i asked the same question on the rvm irc channel a year ago
hmm this sounds familiar. if you don t feel like sifting through the irc log here s the summary newer versions of rubygems 1.6.x which rvm installs by default with ree-1.8.7 which is what we were using don t play well with the mysql gem

division	addition
edit as per the request of the op here s some addition the op s problem is that they think of as division in the mathematical sense and the operator in the language performs some other operation which is not the math
division

9841437
spaces	delimiter
in fact the actual solution is even uglier but when all the tags are stored in a single text field there s no other way the code above assumes that tags are delimiter with spaces
if not you ll have to modify the code to match how they are delimiter

9841519
sudo	passwd
channel.on_close do puts shell terminated end channel.on_eof do |ch| puts remote end is done sending data end channel.on_extended_data do |ch type data| puts got stderr # data.inspect end channel.on_data do |channel data| if data sudo passwd for # username puts data works channel.send_data # passwd n else #puts output not matched # data end channel.on_data do |ch data| puts in third puts data.inspect end end channel.on_process do |ch| puts in process end ssh.loop end end
i think you need to add a n to the passwd you send

9841616
gridview	repeater
the repeater might work as it doesn t depend on viewstate but gridview - forget about that
also forget about repeater

9842589
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
for example multipart boundaries are case-sensitive but the access- type for message external-body is not case-sensitive.
looks like the mime type in a content-type header value is case-insensitive so application pdf and application pdf are equivalent

9843094
inline	inlining
as others have already mentioned the getters are inline
if you want to avoid inlining you have to replace the automatic properties with manual ones and tell the compiler not to inline the getter or both if you feel like it note that the first change does not make a difference in performance whereas the second change shows a clear method call overhead manual properties auto getter

9843251
udp	tcp
most other transport protocols commonly udp but others as well do not behave in this manner and datagrams will not be acknowledged unless the overlayed application layer protocol implements it
the fact that you are asking this question in this manner tells me you have a fundamental gap in your knowledge on transport layer protocols. you should read up on icmp and tcp as well as the osi model

9844148
multiplying	subtract
now every time you multiplying your number by 10 multiplying the threshold by 10 too
if your float and int are both 32 bits you shouldn t have to worry about subtract out the int

9844530
inline	constexpr
i wouldn t think inline functions particularly represent this but template meta-programming does exactly this
also constexpr in c++11

9846203
memcached	apc
memcached would require that your server runs the actual memcached server along with having the memcached extension installed while apc doesn t require anything special besides the extension
if you serialized your data you could use apc or memcached to persist an object array that contains your data

9848654
flot	highcharts	jqplot	highcharts
jqplot is free in my opinion has better chart than flot it doesn t have events
highcharts is free for personal or non-profit project this library has beautiful charts is cross browser and has events

9851769
opera	google-chrome
update 1 opera 15 has been released its ua string looks like google-chrome but with the addition of opr
in this version the google-chrome object is defined but chrome.webstore isn t

9853008
fileinputstream	filewriter	fileoutputstream	filewriter
instead use new outputstreamwriter new fileoutputstream file standardcharsets.utf_8 and new inputstreamreader new fileinputstream file standardcharsets.utf_8
ditch filewriter and filereader which are useless exactly because they do not allow you to specify the encoding

9854585
factors	mean
now the definition of in memory depends on the operating system compiler and linker options the executable format and a million other factors
on many modern operating systems when a process is created the executable file is mapped into memory this means a memory region was reserved for the executable but doesn t mean the executable has been loaded in that location yet

9859190
google-chrome	firefox
this is browser compatibility issue and google-chrome and safari are webkit based browser so they both render similarly
in firefox by default the elements are not vertical-align top

9859247
super	self
that s not the same as saying that super always reaches nsobject because there are classes in objective-c that don t derive from nsobject such as nsproxy
what super means is that objective-c calls the method on the self object but does not use the implementation of the method in the same class as the one where super was called

9859277
google-chrome	firefox
in safari google-chrome the cells are aligned at the top because webkit knosw two elements cannot occupy the same space and restyles a few other elements to get the right output which is why webkit is the best
in firefox the cells are pushed to the bottom because the image is aligned at the baseline

9861777
rdf	owl
have a look at rdf alchemy it is a ordfm for python
it doesn t generate a load of python classes from owl rather supports mapping python classes to terms in an ontology thus providing a way do serialise instances of objects to rdf

9862800
division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
however i have been careful to use signed integers wherever i wasn t sure although for my particular problem domain i would usually get a slight efficiency increase using unsigned values due to the large amount of integer division i do
i sacrificed this efficiency because i was concerned about accidentally promoting a signed integer to an unsigned and then dividing which is not safe unlike addition subtraction and multiplication

9862870
queue	fifo
unfortunately you cannot straightly use the plain old .net queue object
queue is made for blind fifo logic so that you cannot perform anything else but that

9866284
google-chrome	safari
i just tested some reports in google-chrome 19.0.1+ and sql server 2012 reporting services 11.0.2100.60 and didn t have any problems reports rendered directly off the report manager in google-chrome fine
in terms of general incompatibility ipad support is a big deal where i work and reporting services doesn t appear to support safari

9867186
rational-numbers	fractions
we must have somewhere a standard answer about not doing equality comparisons with floating point numbers. 1. every machine fractions is a rational-numbers of the form x 2 n
now the constants are decimal and every decimal constant is a rational-numbers of the form x 2 n 5 m

9870302
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you can not run findviewbyid until the setcontentview has been called please be sure that you declare text inside the main.xml
textview t textview findviewbyid r.id.text

9870727
keystore	jks
so here is what i did create the keystore file i used java s keytool for this
after creating a self-signed certificate it needed to be exported to the desired format keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.jks -srcstoretype jks -destkeystore keystore.pfx -deststoretype pkcs12 note exporting the certificate to a file and using it directly does not work

9872434
namedtuple	dictionary
of course you could create a bunch of dictionary s where you used the same keys in each one but assuming you will have only valid python identifiers as keys and don t need mutability mynamedtuple.fieldname is prettier than and is prettier than finally namedtuple s are ordered unlike regular dictionary s so you get the items in the order you defined the fields unlike a dictionary
in dictionary s only the keys have to be hashable not the values

9874012
ilist	iqueryable
if you had used ilist or anything other that iqueryable this would not be the case however
using iqueryable defers the sql execution and chains the select statement so there will only be one request

9875168
jtextfield	jlabel
within your renderer you use a jtextfield which doesn t make sense because this object is just used to present the data within your tablemodel
normally a jlabel is used for presenting since you wont ever edit a value within a renderer

9876310
innodb	myisam
here is how you make a script to convert all your myisam tables to innodb just run this script when you are ready to convert all user-defined myisam tables
any system-related myisam tables are ignored and should not be touched anyway

9876837
rsa	aes
rsa cannot encrypt data larger than key s size
so you can encrypt an aes key with rsa and the whole image with aes 256 bit generate different aes key for each image

9876837
rsa	aes
so you can encrypt an aes key with rsa and the whole image with aes 256 bit generate different aes key for each image
also rsa is very slow and thus is not good for encrypting large data if you want to split up an image to a large number of blocks of size 117 bytes and encrypt them one by one

9877268
multiplying	addition
you can perform that coercion yourself by multiplying by 1
in addition to kolink s answer ie might not be coercing your string-y numbers into actual numeric objects for the comparison

9881054
couchbase	couchdb
that version of the software is no longer supported by couchbase
the new piece of software that you have is probably couchbase server 2.0 currently a developer preview and that software is not couchdb it is a combination of couchdb and membase technology

9882369
implements	extends
nor can the containing class implements asynctask
asynctask is an abstract superclass not an interface so you extends it rather than implements it

9882369
implements	extends
asynctask is an abstract superclass not an interface so you extends it rather than implements it
but regardless a method cannot extends a class or implements an interface

9887071
cassini	iis
am not sure if you can perform a get post call to a service that is hosted on cassini from fiddler
i would rather host it in iis and then use fiddler to invoke the service

9888516
config	ini
if you can change the file-format i already read that you cannot but for completeness... then a solution like this would be appropriate if you really can t alternate the file s format then i fear that your only option is to parse manually the config file
unfortunately the format of the provided ini file is not correct according standards

9897718
xlib	xcb
unfortunately xlib is not very thread safe especially in that regard
you could do it with xcb

9900331
google-chrome	firefox
firefox did not support box-sizing unprefixed for years firefox has historically had weird outline behavior and this was also the case for years firefox refuses to behave reasonably when it comes to positioned table-cells citing undefined behavior as an excuse while other browsers appear to cope just fine safari and google-chrome have lots of trouble with certain css selectors sometimes with fixes that really take you back to the good ol days of ie5 ie6 and ie7 google-chrome seems to have lots of trouble in the repainting department in general for example not reflowing layouts correctly when media styles are updated
it seems that half of google-chrome s bugs can be worked around simply and only by forcing a repaint again ie5 6 7-level stuff a few strains of webkit have been known to outright lie about support for certain features meaning they actually defeat feature detection mechanisms of all things if you do have a legitimate reason to be targeting certain browsers by all means sniff them out with the other tools given to you

9900787
onclick	onchange
a quick explanation of how it works a button is created that has an onclick function that calls the media library dialogue by calling mediabrowserutility.opendialog which along is passed the parameter target_element_id which tells media library what element to set the value in once they user clicks insert file so we simply pass along the id of our textbox in the widget for it to receive the url of the image that the user selected
hope this helps someone as i couldn t find any resources out there that explained how to do it so i spent quite a while digging through magento to work it all out what i would like to do in the future is have it so it displays the image after you select it in the widget and it stores the url in a hidden field but having an onchange bind is not fired when the value is set to the element from js mage adminhtml browser.js in the insert function so without changing the core files it is a lot harder to do

9911302
memcpy	memmove
from the manpage for memcpy the memory areas should not overlap
use memmove 3 if the memory areas do overlap

9912306
client-side	server-side
key insight you cannot control the client-side
you have to expect the worst and do all the validation and security stuff server-side

9912696
firefox	safari
i include these directions for printing firefox has the best print output internet explorer is second
you may want to turn on the print background option in your browser in firefox or internet explorer go to file - page setup - check print background colors and images although chrome and safari will work they do not have the print background options

9914653
udp	tcp
udp is a connectionless transport
it does not guarantee data deliver like tcp does especially over a large network like the internet

9915461
fuzzy	stemming
text_exact lowercase that s about it text_stem lowercase and stemming text_phonetic lowercase and double metaphone do not stemming use fuzzy matching with text_exact because it handles typing errors
do not use fuzzy against the other fields

9918572
postgresql	mysql
i would go with redis and if you decide later you need more i would first look at redis + sql db postgresql mysql etc.. it will give you both of two worlds caching speed and the aggregation power in case you aggregations would need to go above and beyond min max incr decr
whoever tells you postgresql is not fast enough for writing does not know it

9918572
postgresql	mysql
whoever tells you postgresql is not fast enough for writing does not know it
whoever tells you that mysql is not scalable enough does not know it facebook runs on mysql

9918573
subtraction	addition
subtraction is not associative
associativity means for things x y x and operator over such things x y z x y z x y z consider 1 - 1 + 1 normal evaluation 1 - 1 + 1 0 + 1 1 right to left evaluation 1 - 1 + 1 1 - 2 -1 the reason you have flexibility with addition is that it is associative which allows you to attack the evaluations in any which way and of course if you take reflexivity commutativity into account you can order the numbers in the set of additions any which way as well

9918573
addition	multiplication
you re probably getting confused because mentally you re probably not really doing subtract but doing the equivalent of adding inverses in which case the only binary operator you re messing with is addition
the same thing happens with multiplication division

9921499
bash	subshell
there s also the added complication of the command_not_found_handle shell function bash s exec seems to suppress running it based on test results
the exec keyword in general makes the shell not look at its own functions if you have a shell function f running f as a simple command runs the shell function as does f which runs it in a subshell but running exec f skips over it. as for why creates two files with or without an exec this is simple enough the shell opens each redirection and then uses dup2 to move the file descriptors

9923016
getdate	datepart
select dateadd day case datename weekday getdate when sunday then -2 when monday then -3 else -1 end datediff day 0 getdate i prefer to use datename for things like this over datepart as it removes the need for setting datefirst and ensures that variations on time date settings on local machines do not affect the results
finally datediff day 0 getdate will remove the time part of getdate removing the need to convert to varchar much slower

9926643
mvp	presenter
the idea is to move the contact with view inside the presenter as the goal of the presenter is to deal with the logic and retrieve update data to from the view according to mvp
inside the presenter you will have also the rpc services you do not have to declare them because gin will magically make instance for you by calling gwt.create here is an example of a simple presenter at the end i must note that there are some activities like the one for the menu which deal with places and the view directly in order to display the current state

9928230
gitolite	gitosis
from there you can follow install gitolite under apache
from the comments i wouldn t use gitosis for that kind of fine-grained control gitosis is obsolete and not moving since 2009 even though some forks are still a bit active this comment and that question illustrate that most features are easier to do with gitolite

9928230
gitolite	gitosis
from the comments i wouldn t use gitosis for that kind of fine-grained control gitosis is obsolete and not moving since 2009 even though some forks are still a bit active this comment and that question illustrate that most features are easier to do with gitolite
so with gitolite the umask use for the git repo checked out by the git user within a gitolite environment will be the one described in the doc section most often used changed variables the default umask that gitolite uses makes all the repos and their contents have rwx------ permissions

9929829
sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
sctp is message-oriented like udp and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like tcp
sctp is not yet widely used

9931025
strdup	malloc
it s easy with strdup
note that this will malloc the copy so you have to call free on the pointer later not to get a leak

9932109
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
here is a good article on performance for dictionary vs hash vs sortedlist vs sorted dictionary collections essentially inserts are expensive but retrievals are not
from msdn the sorteddictionary generic class is a binary search tree with o log n retrieval where n is the number of elements in the dictionary

9932791
entity-relationship	diagram
no an entity-relationship diagram should not contain procedures triggers nor sequences
an entity-relashioship diagram is used to represent the relashionships between entities in a database

9934395
ssl	https
ssl does nothing for you because you still rely on client input
also note that browsers should not send referer to http pages when referred by https pages

9935081
queue	fifo
i m not sure what you mean by top-bottom queue and neither does google but in general an array is not a good choice for a queue
in queues you insert at the front and remove from the back fifo

9935893
plone	buildout
some of the tests for the components of plone change global state and then do not clean up after themselves causing failures in tests that run later which depended on that state being a certain way
the environment we use to develop plone buildout.coredev uses the plone.recipe.alltests buildout recipe to set up a script that can run all the tests successfully by isolating some packages from others

9938590
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
both approaches are ok because you use a bufferedreader which highly improves performance over a no-buffer approach
in your second case there is not need to wrap the fileinputstream in a datainputstream

9939179
ssl	https
to remotely capture http or https traffic with charles you will need to do the following host - machine running charles and hosting the proxy client user s machine generating the traffic you will capture host machine install fully licensed charles version proxy - proxy settings - check enable transparent http proxying proxy - ssl proxying settings - check enable ssl proxying proxy - ssl proxying settings - click add button and input in both fields proxy - access control settings - add your local subnet ex 192.168.2.0 24 to authorize all machines on your local network to use the proxy from another machine it might be advisable to set up the auto save tool in charles this will auto save and rotate the charles logs
client machine install and permanently accept trust the charles ssl certificate configure ie firefox and chrome to use the socket charles is hosting the proxy on ex 192.168.1.100 8888 when i tested this out i picked up two lines of a facebook https chat one was a line to someone and the other from you can also capture android emulator traffic this way if you start the emulator with where local_ip is the ip address of your computer not 127.0.0.1 as that is the ip address of the emulated phone

9939568
division	multiplication
division may be heavier than multiplication but a commenter pointed out that reciprocals are just as fast as multiplication on modern cpus in which case this isn t correct for your case so if you do have 1 x appearing somewhere inside a loop and more than once you can assist by caching the result inside the loop and then using y
the compiler optimization might do this in any case. also certain formulas can be redesigned to remove division or other inefficient computations

9947295
inline	inlining
inlining determines whether the compiler chooses to copy the code for a subprogram inline which generally makes the compiled product slightly bigger and thus require slightly more space in the shared pool in return for not having to jump to the subprogram at runtime
generally inlining is not something that you d manually specify with a pragma it s something that would be taken care of automatically by the compiler by setting plsql_optimize_level to 3

9947851
innodb	myisam
the innodb table would not have the same problem since you created it with all the data already in it so it would all be stored sequentially on disk
you could test this theory by rebuilding the myisam table

9951030
setcontentview	findviewbyid
2 you can use setcontentview to set an existing layout whether it contains a listview or not
if it contains an existing listview you ll need to say findviewbyid r.id.mylistlayoutid and make sure to include in your xml

9951705
apache	nginx
setting up https in apache isn t too hard and then just use modproxy to send requests internally to your play application
any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used it with https

9957160
xslt	xquery
xslt 2.0 is a complex specification and there are other implementations from ibm and intel for instance but not as open source projects
if you want to use saxon 9 and extension functions you need to use one of the commercial editions or you need to use the new mechanism of integrated extension functions or you need to use saxon 9.1 still available . as for formatting dates xslt and xpath 2.0 have support for the schema data types xs date and xs datetime and there are functions to format these like . as for support for xslt and xpath 2.0 xpath 2.0 is a subset of xquery 1.0 you should be able to find implementations for that beside saxon

9957897
haskell	scheme
update be careful that you re not writing scheme programs in haskell
accumulating parameters are rare in idiomatic haskell which uses laziness rather than tail recursion

9958843
google-chrome	firefox
just change your code a bit like this open your file with all 3 major browsers ie google-chrome firefox see result for each one when you choose file and click the submit button repectively
as i tested the result for ie was the full path on hard disk to the file c documents and settings dungpro my documents a wallpaper abc.jpg while google-chrome replace the path with a fakepath c fakepath abc.jpg and firefox just give you the filename only abc.jpg yes the fake path or filename only are what make it displayed 404-file not found

9960515
google-chrome	firefox
results google-chrome places me right where firefox did far away in hood oregon
empirical conclusion google-chrome calculates your geolocation using wifi hotspots if available whereas firefox does not

9960784
namedtuple	dictionary
internally they are very different namedtuple instances do not have per-instance dictionary so they are lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples
from an api viewpoint probably not much though namedtuple keys are always strings with some limitations any valid python identifier may be used for a fieldname except for names starting with an underscore

9961409
mp4	webm
update native mp3 and h264 support is now available on desktop firefox version 20+ i m using it to follow podcasts and the occasional mp4 video too
if it doesn t work there s an hidden option to enable about config media.windows-media-foundation.enabled true it also works with html5 youtube that should anyway use webm but might be more fine tuned for h264 mp3 usually is a fraunhofer thomson patents problem

9964241
google-chrome	firefox
in this stackoverflow question you will see that google-chrome does not support to access its download page
but i found this firefox api that supports to access its download manager window

9965850
sqoop	hadoop
several things to note exporting data from mongodb to hadoop using sqoop is not possible
this is because sqoop uses jdbc which provides a call-level api for sql-based database but mongodb is not an sql-based database

9965850
sqoop	hadoop
this is because sqoop uses jdbc which provides a call-level api for sql-based database but mongodb is not an sql-based database
you can look at the mongodb connector for hadoop to do this job

9970561
sctp	tcp
sctp has some special features to permit an established connection to survive routing changes nearly transparently but it s not widely available yet
i assume you re really talking about tcp

9971646
config	ini
however if your software shares settings with a legacy application it may be easier to use its config file rather than duplicating the information elsewhere
the .net framework does not support the use of ini files directly

9971932
jpql	hql
because jpa is the orm tool which the motivation is to map the database records to the objects such that the database records can be manipulated using the programming language instead of sql it does not encourage the use of sql hql jpql to perform the update
to prevent from using error-prone sql or jpql to update the objects once you use criteriaquery to retrieve a list of object you can simply loop through the result objects and then change the properties of the object one by one in order to do the bulk update or delete

9972748
punctuation	words
it s biggest advantage is that it takes punctuation marks into account when splitting the sentence
str_word_count works on a string which means you only need to implode not to explode again and using a second argument of 1 will count the occurrences of each words

9973025
strdup	malloc
the better libraries will provide their own allocation and deallocation functions which do more or less what the new and delete operators do but there will always be things like strdup .
first when you speak of new and delete i assume you mean the expressions and not the operator new and operator delete functions. the new and delete expressions are not related to malloc and free and only manage memory incidentally

9973087
bmp	png
if you want a speed up use bmp which will eat up your hdd or if pixel-quality is not needed try jpg which should get encoded faster than png
png encoding takes a while and you can t improve it with any buffering .

9973763
queue	fifo
you seriously need to refactor your whole design to use just one thread that waits on a queue for stuff
creating new threads for each write is grossly inefficient and is likely to lead to a somewhat indeterminate write order since the order in which threads get the mutex is not guaranteed to be fifo

9979444
decoder	encoder
if you want to save the i-frame as a jpeg image you still need to transcode the video frame you first need to decoder the i-frame using a h264 decoder and then encode it using a jpeg encoder
this is so because the jpeg encoder does not understand a h264 frame it only accepts uncompressed video frames as input

9980839
decoder	encoder
what it looks like when you open the file is not the same as what it will look like if you run it through a json decoder - the json decoder will also decoder the u#### escapes
if you want the file to contain raw unicode rather than u#### escapes don t use a json encoder

9981980
fossil	git
if you are afraid that you might be lost choose fossil
of course this also means that with fossil you can t do as many things as with git no rebasing for example at least not for the moment

9981980
fossil	git
of course this also means that with fossil you can t do as many things as with git no rebasing for example at least not for the moment
for fossil there are few hosting online services available

9982565
serializable	deserialization
this would happen if your class had been serializable and deserialized by datacontractserializer for example when sending data between client and server some reference datacontractserializer doesn #39
if this is the case then one possible solution that worked for me so a quick check fix for this problem i assume that you want to initialize the field yourself and not serialize it would be to create method however as you probably noticed you won t be able to pass wagon during deserialization - you ll have to initialize it differently

9984307
cassini	iis
more than likely when you are running from visual studio cassini it is accessing your user certificate store even though you re loading it from bytes
could you please try this and see if it solves your issue this will cause iis which runs as the asp.net user which likely doesn t have access to a user store to use the machine store

9985171
prepare	execute
i am not certain about mysql but some databases also let you specify a number of rows to cache before a prepare statement actually execute across the network - if this is possible with mysql doing so will allow you to tell the database that although you are calling execute on the statement for every row read from the csv that the database should batch up the statements up to the specified number of rows and only then execute across the network
in this way performance is greatly increased as the database may batch up 5 or 10 inserts and execute them using only one round trip over the network instead of one per row

9986719
png	ico
an ico file can contain multiple images a png cannot so imagemagick makes a png for each image in the ico file
from the wikipedia page emphasis mine the ico is an image file format for computer icons in microsoft windows

9986848
gdi	direct2d
you should be able to rely on any old article that talks about these techniques but that use gdi or gdi+
rendering custom chrome like that shouldn t require any specific tricks for direct2d

9986906
acs	adfs
now your ad users are set up but if you want your applications to be accessible to users outside of your domain you can federate adfs with another organization s adfs server or use acs to enable login using consumer identity providers such as google yahoo and liveid which are provided as built in options
if you did introduce acs like this you would configure your corporate adfs server as an identity provider on your acs instance alongside google yahoo and what not so that when your users browse to your site they will be prompted to select which identity provider they wish to sign in with

9986906
acs	adfs
if you did introduce acs like this you would configure your corporate adfs server as an identity provider on your acs instance alongside google yahoo and what not so that when your users browse to your site they will be prompted to select which identity provider they wish to sign in with
here s a fantastic whitepaper that demonstrates using adfs to authenticate to cloud applications more detailed info about deploying adfs such as deploying the adfs proxy can be found in technet

9988415
floating-point	fixed-point
also note that if your platform is doing fixed-point because floating-point operations are forbidden or not available then you ll have to do something different along the lines of manually doing the decimal conversion
model the integer as the underlying floating-point value multiplied by 32768 and go from there

9989269
mvp	presenter
mvp is not about the view being completely agnostic to your model it is fine under mvp to have a view that will only work for your specific model classes
the main point is to keep as much of the model handling and event handling as possible in the presenter
