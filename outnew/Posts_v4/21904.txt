10001085
g++	gcc
try with g++ driver.cpp -lgl -lglu -lglut -o a not sure about the order of the libs but that looks ok. the idea when you build your command line is that if a requires a symbol from b b must appear after a in the command line
the link order problem happens or not with gcc ld for shared libraries depending on most likely among other things - i m no expert here whether the --as-needed link flag is set or not

10002054
daemons	systemd
i was using rake or runner cron whenever gem to schedule background tasks but was finding my server load was just so high because i would be getting hit constantly with rake runner loading up the rails environment. delayed_job workers are your rails daemons that stay running so you aren t constantly firing up rails every time a background task is required
you can also use the clockwork gem clockwork runs as a separate daemon and can be used to trigger jobs of any sort that either getting added to a job queueing systemd or run right away

10002054
daemons	systemd
you can also use the clockwork gem clockwork runs as a separate daemons and can be used to trigger jobs of any sort that either getting added to a job queueing systemd or run right away
use delayed_job for what it s good for a job queueing systemd which can be distributed over multiple nodes or not . use something else to add jobs to the queue at the right time

10009595
serializable	deserialization
so define all your possible structs then define enum which collects info about what structs in total you have define helper function which lets to determine any struct size then define serializable function and deserialization function serializable usage example i think this is most simple serializable approach in c
but it has some problems struct must not have pointers because you will never know how much memory one needs to allocate when serializing pointers and from where how to serializable data into pointers

10013070
consistency	acid
which brings us to some caveats however consistency using a cursor you do usually not operate on a consistent snapshot of the data but on a row
so your concurrency consistency isolation guarantees drop from the whole database acid to only one row

10015089
ssl	https
the juggler_url doesn t get the same treatment and so it s not updated to load via ssl
i m not sure what juggler s purpose is but it appears that that url won t load via ssl in any case so even if it s url was changed to https it still wouldn t work

10015596
inline	inlining
the call to files.walkfiletree takes 2 parameters a start path and a file visitor which i have inline
i think the inlining can be confusing to some people if you re not used to this style. this is a way of defining the actual class right in the place where you wish to use it

10015668
oncreate	onstart
unfortunately the expanded state always resets whenever the focus is lost and oncreate is not called when it gets the focus again but onstart
so my workaround for now is to manually store the ids of all expanded items and expand them in onstart again

10018317
prepare	execute
it sort of depends on how often you plan to run this loop to execute thousands of statements but that is one of the exact purposes of prepare statements and stored procedures - since the query does not have to be recompiled on each execution you get potentially massive performance gains when querying in a loop over a simple sql statement execution which must be compiled and execute on every loop iteration
those gains may still not match the performance of a prepare statement built up into a long multi-insert in a loop as you re asking but will be simpler to code

10019167
postgresql	mysql
however this syntax and the check constraint feature itself do work in oracle ms sql server including sqlexpress msde ms access postgresql and sqlite
you can implement a check constraint in your table definition edit as stated in the comments mysql does not honor check constraints

10024003
uiview	subviews
here s a few different approaches from easier to harder uitableview header footer if you re meaning to assign those header footer views to the uitableview s tableheaderview and tablefooterview properties you can do that in the storyboard in ib -- just drag a uiview of some sort from the library toward the top or the bottom of the table until you see a blue line above or below the prototype cell s the table header footer views might or might not be what you re after though they re part of the scrolling content of the table that is they appear above the first row and below the last respectively so they can be scrolled off the screen
views above below if your intended use of these views is as header and footer in that they always appear above or below the table regardless of where it s scrolled then what you really need is to have the header footer and the table view all be subviews of a root view

10025225
google-chrome	firefox
the problem does not occur in google-chrome which respects z-index-values at any time
firefox s native fullscreen-mode using the fullscreen-api hides everything but the element you requested fullscreen for regardless of z-index s. the solution is quite easy though wrap a container-div around the video and other content such as the subtitles and request fullscreen for that container instead

10026195
g++	gcc
you can find out your compiler version like this g++ --version that doesn t tell you if you are using c++11
to use c++11 features you would have to call the compiler with thr flag bear in mind that gcc doesn t implement 100 of c++11 yet and how much it implements depends on the version

10028333
super	implements
specified by getdeclaringclass in interface member returns an object representing the declaring class of the underlying member note that you cannot know if the implements class only calls the super to determine the class from which the method is inherited you would need to class.getmethod mymethod .getdeclaringclass
example outputs class java.lang.string class java.util.abstractcollection class java.lang.object i noticed from the question that you wanted to get super class that overrides the method if available

10028646
rpm	yum
interaction with the user while un installing rpm is not a good practice
the philosophy behind it is that rpms should able to be un installed automatically for example when installed via yum

10029298
ssl	https
in my case i want both because some services require ssl authentication and others don t as the information they provide is not sensitive
the authentication services implementation do they own validation and refuse to answer if the request didn t come from an https scheme

10029776
required	placeholder
also there is no need of the single quote in front of every string parameter as you already do for the category parameter however this code required further refinements
if you don t have a term value or employer value the formed sql string doesn t contains the placeholder for the respective parameter

10030928
hex	binary
take the address of your length variable and pass that address to .write but this is not usually refered to as writing an integer as hex
this is sometimes referred to as writing an integer as binary or simply writing an integer

10033557
profiling	debugging
if you do not have heap corruption but instead have a true out of memory problem then finding and solving it usually requires a proper tool called a profiling like aqtime
perhaps your allocation code is wrong in a way you can understand if you simply debugging your code and find that somewhere you are trying to grab an unreasonable amount of memory either in one or a series of calls to some memory-allocation function

10035473
vbscript	vba
if it happened so that you referenced the microsort vbscript regular expressions library then you ll find the answer in the documentation
vba does not have regular expressions

10036924
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
firefox and internet explorer already use hardware acceleration for 2d transforms so i wouldn t be surprised if the webkit browsers google-chrome safari include it in the near future
you re right css 2d transforms aren t hardware accelerated in mobile safari but 3d transforms are

10037880
mktime	strtotime
php documentation so if the month was 1 january you would be running mktime with 0 as the month value which means december in the previous year
unfortuantely what you want to do is not currently possible using strtotime in php

10039017
ssl	https
you ll need to setup the ssl cert properly which it sounds like you have as the other commentator said this will depend upon which webserver you re using
more likely than not apache apache you ll need to modify the apache settings to support the https version of your site

10039017
apache	nginx
for a domain that will have both http and https 80 and 443 you would do something like this assuming apache is listening on 127.0.0.1 this would not be the case for most apache installations so be sure to change the ip
it also goes without saying that you need to change the paths and domain name in the following if you are using nginx there is a similar dual block you ll need to have for 80 and 443

10039026
oncreate	onstart
its best to use preferences in onstart method instead of oncreate or onresume method
it seems your activity is first activity of your application in oncreate method sharedpreferences might not initialized properly

10039527
boost	allocator
an even better solution is to use an existing graph library like boost graph
one thing that jumps out immediately is that in you are allocator twice leaking the first allocator and are not checking result of the second allocator

10042300
primes	modulus
see also to determine whether i is primes you would want to make sure that i is not divisible by all integers from 2 to floor i 2
is the modulus operator

10045666
implements	extends
while each activity will have its own separate class this does not restrict you from making smart design-decisions when implements your application
for example you might try grouping similar activity s by having them extends an abstract class

10046011
dictionary	map
in general starpy handles this quite well by treating each ami action as a dictionary of key value pairs which obviously maps quite well to ami s syntax
if you decide not to use starpy you may still want to see how they map generic dictionaries to ami actions

10047911
punctuation	words
therefore i think this regular expression is what you want if you want to include digits from other character sets and some other punctuation then you can use for the second term
in other words should a german character not match

10048795
datamapper	activerecord
there is no need to define any attributes in a datamapper model it will be fetched from the associated table and cached
that is not possible datamapper implements the activerecord pattern which expects the tables to be there

10050367
freebsd	linux
the only platform documented nicely and up to date is freebsd which is largely due to a single person not associated with zimbra as far as i can see
i m currently trying to set up zimbra on arch linux and i m getting behind those reasons

10050454
daemons	systemd
also it s worth noting that sysloglogger is basically wrapping the c openlog and syslog functions so basically all post-log configuration happens on the systemd daemons
generally that s desirable but sometimes you may want your rails app to log directly to a specific destination like to simplify automated deployment change attributes not allowed by syslog or run in environments without access to the systemd daemons

10053109
addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
let s look at the difference in simple mathematical way for our easy understanding of course both have much more complicated mathematical operation with repetitions involved in it encryption decryption reversible addition this can be reversed by taking the sum and subtract one of the addends multiplication this can be reversed by taking the product and dividing by one of the factors so here we could assume one of the addends factors is a decrpytion key and result 7 20 is an excrypted text
hashing not reversible modulo division this can not be reversed because there is no operation that you can do to the quotient and the dividend to reconstitute the divisor or vice versa

10055210
mathml	mathjax
but whether this works will depend on the features of the mathml renderer you are using not all renderers implement the linebreaking features of mathml3
it should work with mathjax but not in firefox s native mathml rendering

10057538
serializable	deserialization
the accepted answer to this question shows how to de serializable an arbitrary json object into a dictionary
do not use json deserialization at all

10058960
google-chrome	firefox
onclick event on option tag will fail on most versions of ie safari and google-chrome reference if you want to trigger an event whenever user select why not simply use and if you want to do something with the specific option user selected this way you are guaranteed to call check if and only if an option is selected
edit as user422543 pointed out in the comments this solution will not work in firefox

10059093
inline	inlining
i d hope it d inline elem and foldl too of course
if not you could certainly force inlining and probably create a simple fusion rule but maybe the defaults suffice

10060855
dictionary	map
with that said i don t see any reason why you can t hash each entry in the dictionary split each entry on whitespace multiword entries are tuples of hashes split document on whitespace hash each word do the matching with the hashes essentially you re matching arbitrary items not inherently words
the client can produce the words-items map and pass the items to the server

10061427
implements	extends
contrary to lucene s docs it is not straightforward to implements these classes due to the unusual coding patters stemming from the top-performance requirement on the tokenization procedure
for example there is no way to just slightly modify the behavior of standardanalyzer by extends it you must start from one of the base classes

10064813
octal	decimal
use scanner output enter 3 integer numbers +3364 -1293 +0007 you have entered 3364 | -1293 | 7 a side note be careful when you are using leading 0 s with integer numbers like 0007 because it s interpreted in java as octal number not decimal number
so 010 is actually 8 in decimal base system not 10

10065339
jscrollpane	jinternalframe
you are actually adding the board to the jinternalframe cir and to the jscrollpane while you should do something like
because you are not adding the jscrollpane to the internal frame

10066393
dictionary	map
you are right in your comparison of hashmaps and dictionary
map is not a datatype in python

10066402
dictionary	map
in essence a map in java is like a dictionary in python both data structures create associations between keys and values with expected o 1 performance for the get and contains operations
the map data structure in java should not be confused with the map function in python map function iterable ... apply function to every item of iterable and return a list of the results

10066410
profiling	debugging
iow it s not available in the version of mscorlib.dll that ships with monotouch which is a superset of the silverlight 2.1 profiling
what s happening is likely a different version of a pre-compiled assembly that is used when building debugging versus release

10066506
mp3	wav
bear in mind licensing issues restrict the availability of mp3 on all platforms namely linux
wav would be a portable choice but it would be comparitively huge so might not be ideal for that reason

10067390
uiview	subviews
or you could create a uiview subclass and place the uiwebview within it as a subviews then make its hittest withevent method return views beneath the uiwebview
here is a generic hittest method for a uiview subclass that gives priority to any interactive subviews that aren t uiwebview even if they re underneath the uiwebview

10069031
mp4	webm
from what i understand the browser tries the sources in order so your example would attempt mp4 first them .webm and finally the .ogv file
if the webm file doesn t exist then that is your problem

10072401
ienumerable	icollection
so if you were exposing obj you should use ienumerable if the collection is not meant to be modified by users of your code
otherwise you should use icollection if you can

10074598
keystore	jks
coming from openssl converting your private key + certificate into a pkcs#12 store .p12 is usually the easiest this is supported directly via oracle openjdk with the pkcs12 keystore type
you could convert your pkcs#12 file into a jks store but that s not necessary. however if you don t have any keys cert yet the easiest way to generate a self-signed certificate for tomcat is to use keytool directly

10074627
accelerometer	gyroscope
for more information see how to test applications that use the accelerometer and how to test applications that use location data
camera compass and gyroscope not currently supported

10075546
spaces	delimiter
not sure thought if the id attribute is allowed to have spaces i guess not
change the delimiter # to

10077432
onchange	onblur
the problem is on ie the onchange event doesn t work on input elements
thus you have to use the onkeypress or the onblur event depending on what you want to do

10077692
google-chrome	firefox
i got a hint from this question which was similar fullcalendar not loading from json except in google-chrome my original json-events.php was returning dates in the format jan-01-12
once i modified the return date format events started showing up in firefox and ie

10079734
prng	random
if you want to be 100 certain you can replicate the sequence in all future versions include your own prng the mersenne twister
no this is not guaranteed to hold true across different .net versions the current implementation of the random class is based on donald e

10080863
apache	nginx
keep in mind that nginx may not be running under the same environment as you are and usually pronounced apache we add env-vars in the server config file via setenv
however nginx doesn t have such a feature.

10081270
single-quotes	double-quotes
third the shell doesn t replace variables inside single-quotes so you need to switch to double-quotes and then escape the double-quotes you want passed to jruby
finally i d wrap and in double-quotes just in case it contains spaces or any other funny characters

10082669
implements	extends
the approach is to implements then c1 and c2 can both be derived from interf1impl which implements the common f1 and g1 methods
however this approach won t extends well if you have another class c3 public interf2 which wants to share an implementation of f2 with c2 but doesn t want to implements interf1

10083174
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsview isn t really a good place to handle scene-specific events
instead you ll need to override qgraphicsscene mousepressevent

10087902
google-chrome	safari
i d like to point out that this is not only a google-chrome defined behavior
safari and mobile safari on ios behaves this way

10092440
requestfactory	gwt
anyway when crafting your own headers you should add a prefix to avoid conflicts with other things on the network adding headers something like myapp-date or x-myapp-date like gwt does it with x-gwt-permutation and x-gwt-module-base in gwt-rpc and requestfactory
date is a predefined header of http and by definition xmlhttprequest the thing behind gwt s requestbuilder cannot let you set it to an arbitrary value

10092717
express	node.js
check out this tutorial for the image upload portion on the node.js side using express here s a tutorial for the frontend drag and drop functionality update you might also consider which makes mongodb interaction a bit easier--but the native driver isn t too bad to use by itself
you can get away without using most of the node.js modules aside from the mongodb driver

10094411
udp	tcp
generally you ll easily fit five udp packets in there
udp gives no guarantee to the received ordering of packets so basically the first packet you recvfrom might be the first packet you sent but must not be - that s what tcp is for which guarantees ordering of received data

10095433
haskell	ocaml
note that it currently does not support true parallelism you won t have two threads running ocaml code in parallel but it doesn t matter as ocaml is much faster than many other languages for example on a quadcore the language shootout shows that ocaml outperforms even haskell with multicore capabilities
yes ocaml is suitable for concurrent programming

10097098
factors	matrix
and although it is possible to use the last element as a uniform inverse scaling factors it is probably better to do your scaling with the upper left 3x3 submatrix and leave the bottom row exclusively for the camera
if as your question suggests the convention is that points are column vectors and the last elements of the first 3 rows determine the translation then the first 3 elements of the bottom row are not a positional offset the 4th row of a transformation matrix is used for perspective projection which is how the camera maps 3d points onto the 2d viewport

10098375
opencv	emgucv
you have two options wrap it yourself taking a look at how cvinvokecalib3d.cs or maybe another class inside emgucv pinvoke folder define opencv functions pinvoking ask on emgucv forum to add it to emgucv svn for you
emgucv is an opencv wrapper but right now the function you want to use is still not wrapped

10101213
google-chrome	firefox
which works in google-chrome 18 but not firefox 10 or 11
as for firefox you need to copy it manually

10101460
client-side	server-side
here s how you iterate through an array in jstl note that i pluralized your username variable since it s an array since you array is an array of arrays you can nest two iterations note that javascript executes at client-side whereas the jsp is executed at server-side
when js code executes it doesn t have access to your server-side java array

10101948
ssl	https
the first step to enable ssl in your erlang web application is to configure the underlying web server
for example if you re using inets you can use the file config inets_https.conf an example configuration file using apache like syntax looks like servername erlangweb_https serverroot docroot documentroot docroot bindaddress 0.0.0.0 modules e_mod_inets port 443 sockettype ssl sslcertificatefile my.cert sslcertificatekeyfile my.key sslverifyclient 0 you can also configure it using erlang syntax more information about erlang web server configuration files at and specifically for inets once you have that in place you can redirect users to https in your application controller like follows assuming the server is using default ports if your server is not using default ports the above redirection becomes for more information about configuration parameters in erlang web to reduce verbosity you might want to have look to erlang web annotations

10102303
rtp	rtsp
in my experience this can be the case if wireshark does not have enough information about the rtp session
for example 1 if i sniff an rtp session that has been setup using rtsp or sip and sdp then wireshark will show detect rtp

10103155
punctuation	words
breaking words on whitespace is not going to cut it consider also punctuation marks etc
assuming that your stopword list only uses the latin alphabet a practical choice would be to assume that words are sequences consisting of only latin characters

10104197
profiling	instrumentation
in any case this is usually a difference you can ignore between the total memory the profiling reports and the real amount of memory your app uses and it is not the reason for the difference between 5mb of managed memory used and the 30mb instrumentation reports
monotouch and therefore its profiling does not know about any memory allocated by native code

10110369
namenode	hdfs
if you followed this tutorial the relevant directory is app hadoop tmp dfs data reformat the namenode note all hdfs data is lost during this process
restart the cluster when deleting all the hdfs data and starting from scratch does not sound like a good idea it might be ok during the initial setup testing you might give the second approach a try

10111217
apache	nginx
it is up the web server software iis apache nginx to decide whether or not to serve a page
for example the mod_sequester module for apache lets you control serving of content based on date time ranges

10112983
apache	nginx
my guess is that nginx as front-end does not know and not even should where the web files to be served are but apache
when i go to any browser and type ip shows nginx default page so i guess it is listening to 80 port

10114381
udp	tcp
hint udp does not have connections so you don t have a listener socket
for tcp you open a listener socket on which connections can be accepted

10114726
memcached	apc
so the solution emil vikström provided that relies on the lru model of memcached will unfortunately not work
without modifying the source code of apc itself here s what i would do define a namespace constraint that your entries conform to

10115138
client-side	server-side
if you want to stick with client-side validation you might also consider a javascript polyfill library like webshims lib which lets you use html5 features in older browsers
also note that although client-side validation improves the user experience it does not protect against malicious attacks so you may still want some server-side validation in addition

10115138
client-side	server-side
also note that although client-side validation improves the user experience it does not protect against malicious attacks so you may still want some server-side validation in addition
anyway for server-side pattern validation you can use the is_match validator

10115177
innodb	myisam
for truncate see below you will need innodb as your engine for all tables that are involved in your transactions
myisam does not support transactions

10118628
client-side	server-side
if you want xslt stylesheets to be applied on the client-side to xmls received from server not opposite as you ve written you just have to return pure xml to the client with construct embedded
if you want to apply xslts to xmls at server-side and return html to client - please dont bother

10122203
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
otherwise your code you would have worked just fine ie you had a uiviewcontroller or one of its subclasses and you ve embedded it via code or via interface builder into a uinavigationcontroller
if you have subclassed uinavigationcontroller and not having a uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller which is most common then you should do this instead because self is already a navigation controller

10125564
opera	firefox
it s not just this though seems to disregard background colour css as do all apart from opera currently
spacing seems a little worse in firefox too more bunched up

10126270
apache	nginx
javascript bottle.py server or php under apache nginx or daemons in php for extra fun it has full shell access and can run commands asynchronously which allows to launchd desktop applications without blocking
it doesn t need apache

10127609
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
despite what daniel ribeiro says i d suggest you keep these uploads well away from apache
you need an event based server apache s implementation is good but imho not as polished as nginx lighttpd

10127672
email	dkim
this can happen if you are using different email
spf and dkim are recommended not required

10127675
matplotlib	colormap
in your example edit thanks for the clarification. here is a description of what you can do first choose a matplotlib colormap object in your case for white and black you can take the binary colormap
or create your own colormap as you did if the colormap you want doesn t already exist

10130481
svg	vml
svg is also not supported on older versions of ie
however in this case there is a good fall-back solution as ie has supported an alternative vector format called vml since ie5.5

10130481
svg	vml
given the above it s clear that svg with vml fallback is a very good bet
the only down-side with svg is that android v2.x doesn t support it

10130506
cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
-1 is a reserved value at the c level of cpython which prevents hash functions from being able to produce a hash value of -1
as noted by dsm the same is not true in ironpython and pypy where

10130669
inline	inlining
also just because the function isn t marked inline doesn t stop the compiler inlining it if it calculates that doing so would be advantageous
inlining a function can have several advantages it can make the program size smaller

10130773
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
it s not a matter of bufferedreader being a problem - it s your try-with-resources statement which was introduced in java 7
you ll need to close the reader manually as an aside i d advise against using filereader - use an inputstreamreader wrapping a fileinputstream so you can specify the encoding

10135917
google-chrome	firefox
firebug must be installed and they still might not work in google-chrome userscripts
i haven t tested that way in a while. in firefox if firebug is not installed or it is not active for the page then unsafewindow.console.log calls will display to the new web console ctrl shift k

10143728
coalesce	isnull
coalesce taxtypecode2 taxtypecode1 will return first not empty
you can also use isnull taxtypecode2 taxtypecode1

10146882
pascal	delphi
since delphi xe2 is using the free pascal compiler when targeting ios you can use any programming technique of fpc
in fact if you do not need firemonkey and prefer using native user interface you do not need delphi xe2 at all

10146913
prepare	execute
pdo is a data-access abstraction layer that supports multiple dbms interfaces drivers some of which support server-side prepare statements mysql 4.1+ some of which don t mysql 3
in the event where the pdo driver does not support server-side prepare statements pdo will emulate them on the client-side and use the generic query interface to execute them

10147348
stateless	stateful
a few remarks on statelessness http protocol in itself is stateless requests do not depend on each other do not need to be called in some predefined order
web applications are usually stateful

10153407
trie	tree
you are describing a simple trie lookup except that you would return a leaf node even when there are excess characters
not sure what you re thinking of with an n-way tree but most likely it s exactly the same since it s the obvious solution v

10158401
bash	zsh
dr answer the behaviour you see in bash is documented
the behaviour you see in zsh is not that i ve found and i have a theory which might be wrong

10159298
profiling	instrumentation
i would say you are in trouble if you cannot figure it out with gdb and if you can t create a new instance for some reason and test with a profiling
profilers instrumentation the code

10160645
jlist	jtextfield
i recommend not trying to render the html js in the gui instead provide a jlist in the gui of the image+name objects chosen by the user using jfilechooser
when each image is selected you can show the preferred name in a jtextfield that allows the user to edit it

10161349
margin	text-align
either you use the margin 0 auto to center the container towards its parent container or you change display inline to display block
text-align center caused the content to be centered within the container and not the container itself being centered

10161882
move	drag
in the version of eclipse i m using indigo service release 1 the rename option doesn t come up for the default package unlike other packages - but if you select all the classes then right-click and select move that will let you put them in a new package
as far as i can tell the rename option is for renaming classes without changing their package but move certainly works for moving between packages. screenshots of the process original situation select all classes and show the refactor part of the context menu select move click on create package and type in a name mypackage in this case the final result alternatively if you want to move them to an existing package you could just drag and drop the classes

passenger	webrick
phusion passenger is a full fledged rails server
when it is used webrick is not involved

equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
see sortedmap note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

10162800
factors	matrix
in here x and x are homogeneous vectors which means that the 3d vectors x and h x do not have to be equal but they can differ in magnitude by a non zero scale factors
so basicly what we would like to do is multiply every pixel in an image with the homography matrix

10165434
google-chrome	firefox
-webkit-gradient is for webkit browsers only safari google-chrome etc
this means it will not work in firefox internet explorer opera or any other browser that does not support -webkit-gradient

10172158
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext is not only for code first development
dbcontext acts like a wrapper around the objectcontext

10174193
opengl-es	glkbaseeffect
well you can look at this blog which uses glkit to build a basic opengl-es 2.0 application
there s also links to other blogs if you re looking to dig more into it glkit + opengl-es 2.0 + ios5 programming blog the only thing it doesn t cover is glkbaseeffect but if you want to build custom shaders like you said you definitely don t want to use it anyway

10174499
ienumerable	ilist
parallel.foreeach will not always use getenumerator in ienumerable
an enumerator by design is not concurrent if your item implements ilist parallel.foreach will use the indexer to allow each thread to access the element in the source without waiting on the enumerator to iterate through the list

10174611
memcpy	strcpy
however what a company feels about a problem does not affect the existence of said problem that not validating your inputs to memcpy is responsible for a class of vulnerabilities
buffer overflows which is the security issue with memcpy strcpy et al. are os-agnostic

10175756
cpython	pypy
the real speed difference comes from the fact that unlike cpython which is interpreting whole program as bytecode pypy uses just-in-time jit compilation into machine code for rpython parts
pypy isn t python interpreter implemented in python it s python interpreter and compiler implemented in rpython which is a restricted statically typed subset of python rpython is a restricted subset of python that is amenable to static analysis

10184696
jar	war
firstly what you want is the jar file to be available to be downloaded by users of the war file
including the file in web-inf lib as a standard dependency of the war project is not what you want

10184753
casting	autoboxing
the jls specifies that boxing conversions can only occur during assignment conversions method invocation conversions or casting conversions
since you are neither assigning 5 to a variable passing it as an argument to a method nor explicitly casting it to integer it will not be autoboxing for you

10185707
client-side	server-side
apparently for client-side validation the value property of the rendered html control is used which makes sense for example for textbox controls which are rendered as a simple and whose value property contains the content of the text box
if a custom control consists of multiple html controls client-side validation is not feasible according to the following knowledge base article how to extend a web form control to work with the validation controls by using visual basic .net or visual basic 2005 note this article demonstrates how to extend the calendar control for server-side validation only

10185707
client-side	server-side
if a custom control consists of multiple html controls client-side validation is not feasible according to the following knowledge base article how to extend a web form control to work with the validation controls by using visual basic .net or visual basic 2005 note this article demonstrates how to extend the calendar control for server-side validation only
for client-side validation to occur the validation controls hook up to the corresponding html control s value property

10185707
client-side	server-side
thus client-side validation is not appropriate for the calendar control
by the way for server-side validation you can use the validationproperty attribute to specify which property is used for validation

10187091
client-side	server-side
the downside to it is that it is client-side only so if a user doesn t have javascript enabled they will not be able to sort the table i d say that is not a major problem the average user always have javascript enabled
the other option is to build a server-side sorting this can be as easy as adding in your database query

10188557
jar	war
you should put the code you wish to share into a jar and include that as a dependency in the war you want to use
java ee visability standards state that classes from one war shouldn t be available to classes in another war when they re packaged as an ear

10189033
persistent	transient
when annotations are used to define a default access type the placement of the mapping annotations on either the persistent fields or persistent properties of the entity class specifies the access type as being either field- or property-based access respectively
when field-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the instance variables and the persistence provider runtime accesses instance variables directly. all non-transient instance variables that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

10189033
persistent	transient
when field-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the instances variables and the persistent provider runtime accesses instances variables directly. all non-transient instances variables that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent
when property-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the getter property accessors 7 and the persistent provider runtime accesses persistent state via the property accessor methods

10189033
persistent	transient
when property-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the getter properties accessor 7 and the persistent provider runtime accesses persistent state via the properties accessor methods
all properties not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

10189033
persistent	transient
all properties not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent
mapping annotations must not be applied to fields or properties that are transient or transient

10192959
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason google-chrome doesn t want to see the namespace
i found that the b dataa selector works for firefox and ie and the dataa selector works for google-chrome

10192983
rdf	owl
however even though rdf list is well used in existing data on the web it doesn t constrain in any way the use of the predicates rdf first and rdf rest so you can have many first elements for a given list without triggering an inconsistency
so if you really want to model linked list in a strict way you need pretty expressive features of owl

10193227
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
the reason viewdidload is not being called is because it was already loaded the first time it appeared in your app i assume on launch
you will notice that viewwillappear and viewdidappear will always be called before after the view presents itself in your application

10197432
realloc	malloc
allocating memory for an array of struct is as simple as allocating for one struct then you can access each item by subscribing array regarding the realloc part instead of which is not syntactically valid looks like a mix of realloc function prototype and its invocation at the same time you should use in fact you should use a different variable to store the result of realloc since in case of memory allocation failure it would return null while still leaving the already allocated memory and then you would have lost its position in memory
but on most unix systems when doing casual processing not some heavy duty task reaching the point where malloc realloc returns null is somehow a rare case you must have exhausted all virtual free memory

10201349
postgresql	mysql
if you are lucky enough to run the current postgresql 9.1 there is an elegant and fast solution with a single command using the new data-modifying ctes
no such luck with mysql which does not support common table expressions cte not to mention data-modifying cte

10202385
cpython	ironpython
so platform of python implementation must match to language in which it is being extended cpython is not extensible in java but java implementation of python called jython can be extended in java and similarly .net implementation ironpython can be extended in .net languages
answer is simple python cpython interpreter is written in c and it can call other c libraries dynamically your c extension module or embedded c code can be easily called from any other c code

10205506
stateless	stateful
no stateless session beans can have state but that state is not being persisted bound to a session
part of that state are injected ejbs or other pojos which could be stateful beans etc

10205955
oncreate	onstart
oncreate onstart and onresume are lifecycle methods called by the operating system and shouldn t be called directly
you can however override them to have your code executed at these stages of the activities lifecycle however if you want your asynctask to start after all of your view s have been inflated and drawn to the screen then you need to put the code in this in the above example toreturn is a view in your oncreate method

10214527
calloc	malloc
if we add a malloc 0 before calloc of arr1 we can register that neither array is allocated in physical memory before iteration
as a page might not be used it is more efficient to do the mapping on request. this is why when the process do a calloc the sufficient number of pages are reserved but not necessarily actually allocated in real memory

10215056
rsa	aes
rsa is slow enough that you generally do not want to use it to encrypt a lot of data
instead you typically use rsa in conjunction with some symmetric-key aka private key encryption algorithm such as aes

10216023
orika	dozer
orika is supposedly very fast though i have not indecently confirmed that check out the benchmarks they posted on their site
here are a couple dozer apache propertyutils orika modelmapper dozer is pretty fast and has a good number of configuration options

10216229
lxml	libxml2
for windows lxml provides prebuilt eggs with libxml2 and libxslt staticly compiled in as stated in the lxml install documentation so you do not need to install them separately
from the lxml documentation get the easy_install tool and run the following as super-user or administrator on ms windows the above will install the binary builds that we provide

10216521
prng	random
you really want to make use of the platform you re running on s underlying pseudorandom number generator prng - dev urandom on a unix linux system or the crypto-api on a windows system - as these have been studied extensively and produce really random numbers that are suitable for use in cryptosystems
php doesn t make accessing these random sources all that easy but examples do exist on how to do so like this -

10217018
dbcontext	objectcontext
it discovers entity sets based on dbset properties defined on the dbcontext derived class or in general it discovers your model based on your code
objectcontext does not do any discovery and is not convention based

10217464
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the views bounds are not yet set in viewdidload
viewwillappear according to paul hegarty s cs193p lectures is for geometry-related initializations

10218801
erlang	ocaml
erlang cannot have exhaustive pattern matching because of dynamic types unless you have a catch-all in every which is just silly
ocaml on the other hand can

10219190
mp4	h.264
this support does not use hardware decoding and it does not limit netstream functionality. flash.media.stagevideo flv and mp4 are encapsulation formats. flv can contain vp6+mp3 or h264+aac or any of them taken alone . mp4 can contain h264+aac. the docs don t say anything about flv not beeing supported on ios
however on ios if flv h264 won t play you won t be able to remux it to mp4 on the fly because of the following restriction otherwise you would lose hardware decoding note this method is not supported for h.264 video in air 3.0 for ios. flash.net.netstream appendbytes nothing is said about sorenson or vp6 not beeing suported for on the fly remuxing thus they should be

10219620
jsf	seam
you can do that even with acegi of course it s just not that easy since you ve already mentioned jsf jaas fits even better than acegi you can annotate any backing bean with rolesallowed and if user session does not meet requirements securityexception will be thrown
this works for servlets and beans ejb backing not for jsps however it wouldnt make much sense anyway you can read about rolesallowed here but if you re already considering it don t miss seam security - it s built on top of both security annotations and jaas and it s also pretty addictive to use

10221773
rspec	capybara
module rspec core class examplegroup include capybara dsl include capybara rspecmatchers end end the git issue for this
because rspec.configure not including capybara dsl in spec_helper.rb it is an ugly solution but you can add this to your spec_helper.rb

10225869
drawimage	putimagedata
syntax drawimage image sx sy swidth sheight dx dy dwidth dheight jsfiddle with two images sadly i couldn t find a mushroom with transparency so it is a house -
don t use putimagedata as it will replace the pixels use context.drawimage document.getelementbyid mushroomimg 0 0

10226424
client-side	server-side
client-side for feedback without loading you can do something like i ve written this example inline - as your form will probably be larger i would advise you not to use the attribute onsubmit and instead attach a proper event handler
have a look at preventdefault as well as this is usually a better alternative to return false . what you will really need to do is validate in your php server-side that it is only numbers before you save it to the database

10227510
implements	extends
the purpose of one interface extends not implements another is to build a more specific interface
for example sortedmap is an interface that extends map

10230603
daemons	systemd
note that if you have a daemons process that keeps a log file open the daemons is likely to keep writing to the old file not the new one and the space won t be released until the daemons does terminate or more accurately closes the file descriptor for the old log file
a file is not physically deleted at the inode level if the file systemd has inodes until the last open file descriptor closes on the file even if there are no name references left for the file because its last name has been unlinked aka deleted

10230748
backgrounding	multitasking
i wouldn t ever rely on this being called and try and do all the clean-up you need to do in your delegate methods for transitioning into the backgrounding and your backgrounding task completion blocks which do get executed for at least a few seconds before the app gets jettisoned
if your application supports multitasking the default for anything linked against ios 4.0+ this method will almost never be called

10231288
haskell	ocaml
in ocaml which is somewhat similar to haskell i would do something like
i m not practical with haskell i just did it in ocaml and in c++ but what you are going to do is to call the type checker function recursively on each parameter and check if they do correspond

10233429
wadl	wsdl
wadl is one such protocol but it isn t too widespread and wcf does not support it
you still get a wsdl because wcf will describe everything it can from the service

10236954
postgresql	mysql
you should never use addslashes for quoting strings for a database it s highly recommended to use dbms specific escape function mysqli_real_escape_string for mysql or pg_escape_string for postgresql you should be doing this i m assuming that id is actually a number as well
you shouldn t be using addslashes to quote strings for postgresql you should use pg_escape_literal pg_escape_literal escapes a literal for querying the postgresql database

10238048
serializable	deserialization
in the future add an int value __ver or any other name that does not collide with arguments that you pass to info.addvalue and set it to a constant that you maintain in your class to indicate compatible and incompatible changes in serializable
without preparation on your part you may need to resort to a hack when your public myclass deserialization constructor gets the value of bool d enclose the code in try catch and set d to its default value when you catch an exception

10238350
thin	unicorn
gem thin if not you re looking at rails trying to use the default server
personally i would look at using unicorn on heroku but be careful with how many workers you might need

10239503
ssl	https
google does not issue ssl certificates for double-wildcard domains hosted at appspot.com
therefore with https you must use the string -dot- instead of . to separate subdomains as shown in the examples below

10239568
rational-numbers	fractions
the idea behind nested intervals is that there s an infinite number of rational-numbers between any two integers so you could store the new node as a fractions of its previous and next nodes
storing and querying fractions can be troublesome and this leads to the matrix encoding technique which transforms those fractions in a 2x2 matrix and most operations can be done by some matrix algebra that isn t obvious at first sight but can be very efficient

10239806
touchesbegan	touchesended
then call it at the end of touchesbegan and touchesmoved.
for this to work touchesended canceled needs to not choke on a nil event

10241129
g++	gcc
so try g++ -ic mingw include test.cpp -lpthread i kicked myself when i stumbled on the answer it s kind of a faq for libraries and gcc
for most gcc options order doesn t matter but for libraries it s critical

10241265
mp3	ogg
firefox doesn t support the mp3 format as audio source
if you add a second source file in ogg format the script should work in firefox too

10242146
required	placeholder
you may also expect it to adopt uipickerviewdatasource s methods and you will receive warnings if you do not implement the required interface
it may serve as documentation intent platform compatibility or it may be a placeholder for future extension

10242319
junit	testng
by design junit does not support dependencies between tests
you could try testng which specifically allows dependencies

10244841
super	implements	super	extends	implements	extends
also notice that when implements constructors super or any of its variants with arguments super x y z can only be called at the very beginning of the method
by calling the super method you re not overriding the behavior of the method you re extends it

10244841
super	extends
by calling the super method you re not overriding the behavior of the method you re extends it
a call to super will perform any logic the class you re extends has defined for that method

10245429
udp	tcp
you might want to use a random iv and prepend it to the ciphertext you send over udp instead of passing it via an out-of-band channel
tcp is not a good out-of-band channel because it is insecure

10246425
google-chrome	firefox
when i visit the site from google-chrome nothing happens
but when i visit it from firefox the script link does not return status 404

10247860
google-chrome	firefox
driver.maximize_window this seems to work fine - unless i am using google-chrome
i m not sure if this is a defect as it works flawlessly in ie9 and firefox

10251681
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is used for arrays of primitive types while mergesort for object arrays
the main reason why mergesort is used for objects that mergesort is stable - it does not reorder elements that are equal for primitives the stability of the sort is meaningless as you cannot distinguish two values that are equal

10251844
equals	gethashcode
the fact that all fields are the same does not matter to .net if you need field-by-field equality semantics you need to provide an implementation of equals that supports it
when you override equals don t forget to override gethashcode as well - these must be overriden together

10252036
onresume	onpause
i m pretty sure onresume is fired whenever you re activity gains the foreground no matter if it was already running in the background or not
the home button does not kill the application it should call onpause when hit and onresume when you come back to the app afterwards

10254781
cassini	iis
it sounds like from the exception operation is not supported by this platform that cassini many not support custom headers which would be quite strange but a possibility
what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception

10254880
udp	tcp
well there s not much between tcp udp if you ignore the connect disconnect latency
if your protocol can keep a tcp conection up and disable inappropriate latency-inducing optimizations like the nagle algorithm i don t see why tcp should be struck off as a solution though there is the slight complication of requiring a protocol on-top to exchange any message larger than one byte

10254998
google-chrome	safari
object google-chrome 18 not supported hello blink
object htmlunknownelement safari 5 not supported hello blink

10256020
jar	war
if you really insist to keep the jar elsewhere and manually manage the build path for some reason then you d need to manually add it in the deployment assembly section of the project s properties as well to get it to ultimately end up in the web-inf lib folder of the war
build path or not you need to make sure that the primefaces jar file ultimately ends up in web-inf lib folder of the built and deployed war file

10258722
jruby	mri
try starting here here s a summary of java tools available you can use with jruby as well don t forget to check the wiki as well there s a page on profiling object allocations
that s a mri specific api - there s not an api equivalent for jruby probably due the way the jvm works there are multiple gc strategies with most vms and there s no consistent api to work with the gc even a system.gc call does not necessary trigger garbage-collection immediately

10258722
jruby	mri
that s a mri specific api - there s not an api equivalent for jruby probably due the way the jvm works there are multiple gc strategies with most vms and there s no consistent api to work with the gc even a system.gc call does not necessary trigger garbage-collection immediately
but there s a standart monitoring api called mx available for java applications and since your jruby app is a java app you can use those of course you might need to understand some of the internals how your ruby classes are seen by the jvm but it ain t that hard

10261840
roboguice	robolectric
works fine with roboguice and ormlite
robolectric creates its own database so a unit test doesn t modify the database on the device you are testing with

10264503
.htaccess	httpd.conf
possible duplicate of zend mod rewrite not working i believe the issue is that allowoverride is set to none for the web directory you are using which means the .htaccess will not be processed
you will have to edit httpd.conf and set allowoverride all

10268639
super	extends
to extends it you need to explicitly call the constructor of the parent with a super call
note that the super call is not always at the top of the __init__ method in your sub-class

10269715
udp	tcp
although you often read hear that the tcp will guarantee that your packets will arrive vs udp which doesn t guarantee that your packets will arrive in order it is apparent obvious that the first is not actually true at all
tcp will do it s best to get your bytes to the intended recipient including retrying for a long time but this is not a guarantee whether or not the send man page indicates for the send return value that on success these calls return the number of characters sent

10276171
google-chrome	firefox
try the element disabling a link works for me in google-chrome
firefox doesn t seem to play nice

10280824
memcached	apc
memcached scales well while apc s cache doesn t
there are many other advantages of using memcached over apc s user cache but for me these were the primary three reasons to not use apc s user cache

10281760
jtextfield	jlabel
which adds a red jlabel to the left of the jtextfield and because you re using borderlayout for the jpanel then it automatically makes the jlabel the smallest it can possibly be
the jlabel could contain the number and because it isn t editable it will always be there no matter what the user changes in the jtextfield

10281760
jtextfield	jlabel
the jlabel could contain the number and because it isn t editable it will always be there no matter what the user changes in the jtextfield
you could also format the jlabel to make it red by calling setforeground color.red

10282287
awt	swing
i believe it will eventually surpass awt swing and swt
while swing may be common when using java more often than not it leads to slow and bulky user experiences

10282522
google-chrome	safari
update just fire up google-chrome and on windows ctrl+shift+i safari its ctrl+alt+i and you should see the network inspector update 2 and just for reference if you want network inspection that isn t dependent on a browser fiddler is always part of my personal tool kit
you can use built-in web developer tools in google-chrome and or safari etc to inspect all http request responses between your client browser and the server web site

10284151
mp4	h.264
you may also want to take a look at geraint davies mp4 mux
it s not possible with the link you posted hax264 is a directshow video transform filter for decoding h264 avc video you can try the x264 directshow filter from monogram or our open source h264 directshow source filter that implements limited parts of the h.264 specification

10284169
jruby	mri
i have read that jruby is roughly equal on speed with mri. no that s not normal
once the jvm has warmed up rails requests under jruby are usually significantly more performant than under mri both in terms of raw execution speed and garbage collection

10284169
jruby	mri
that said whilst jruby will probably consume less memory than the total sum of multiple rails processes under mri you will definitely need to allocate a little more up front for a single jvm process
be generous to jruby and jruby will reward you for your kindness - you can read more about tuning jruby and the jvm here update you do not need to set config.threadsafe

10285969
.htaccess	httpd.conf
so here are 2 options available with you option 1 enable mod_proxy and retain current directory structure put this code in your .htaccess under public_html site2.com directory option 2 retain current directory structure and create a symbolic link like this then put this code in your .htaccess under public_html site2.com directory options +followsymlinks -multiviews imho option # 2 is going to be much easier for you since it just requires creating one symbolic link i believe you are using some flavor of
your current setup is not going to support what you are trying to get unless you enable mod_proxy in your httpd.conf

10286689
noexcept	throw
but you could just throw in the noexcept anyway
it is valid for the subclass s override to be noexcept even if the base class is not

10287595
erd	diagram
if you already have an erd what additional alternate property do you want to illustrate with a uml class diagram that the erd doesn t give you
on the assumption the diagram is for human consumption only you re not code generating from it then you should use uml to expose the information you re trying to communicate

10288841
strcpy	strncpy
you shouldn t be using functions like strcpy as they give you no protection against buffer overflows
use the safe versions instead like strncpy

10289045
implements	extends
here is a link to an api for the bindingtablemodel it looks to implements tablemodel but does not extends abstracttablemodel or defaulttablemodel
a tablemodel is a tablemodel is a tablemodel regardless of the ultimate concrete class that extends it

10290054
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome will not bug you with a blocking message
i faced this issue without any chance to bypass it it is a builtin firefox security feature to display this warning message and it cannot be bypassed through a configuration flag - that s why you keep getting the message manually or via webdriver that won t provide a bypass mechanism by clicking on the alert box

10290517
strcpy	malloc
also strcpy does not pad but you might know that
strlen namebuffer+1 strlen namebuffer +1 you also have to do something like this when you malloc all to prevent overflow you have to limit the length of fscanf ie the 1 ensure you have actually read something into namebuffer

10290632
quicksort	heapsort
so it would not matter which one you select if your own quicksort is implemented properly
std sort is most likely to use quicksort or at least a variation over quicksort called introsort which degenerates to heapsort when the recursion goes too deep

10290935
profiling	instrumentation
do not use activity monitor for profiling memory performance in your app
use the instrumentation app and the various memory-related tools it provides such as allocations and leaks

10291145
required	placeholder
3 you can use more advanced jquery plugin like this it a lot easier to setup and not required to much effort here are couple more i hope it helps in certain way
if you are just using the idea of watermark there are many alternatives and a lot easier way to achieve it 1 you can try using 2 in the html5 there is a new attribute for input text called placeholder that will do exactly what you want

10291700
inline	inlining
alternative you can change the header to have a static inline version however this doesn t provide a non-inline version of the function so the compiler may be forced to create a copy of this function for each translation unit
notes the c99 inlining rules are not exactly intuitive

10293402
allocator	stl
this is the very first time in your program that the std allocator is required to actually allocate memory
the stl has never been developped with forking in mind so it is perfectly possible than it simply does not work in this usecase

10295410
ienumerable	ilist
in general you cannot bind to an ienumerable eg a linq query
the databinding infrastructure can only handle an ilist non-generic or an ilistsource

10299201
lemmatization	stemming
one distinction between the two that i found many people including myself to make is this stemming is used to refer to a rule-based or machine-learning based technique that removes parts of a word mostly endings that look like grammatical morphemes lemmatization is used to refer to a process that does the same but using an actual dictionary of the language to deal with highly irregular forms such as the plural women but again not everyone will agree with this distinction.
first stemming refers to the process of reducing a word to its stemming

10299557
postgresql	mysql
note remember that this will impact the change you did in artifactory_home etc artifactory.system.properties artifactory.jcr.configdir filesystem-postgres or artifactory.jcr.configdir repo postgresql
the link to the repo.xml file is broken and not correct because it point to mysql configuration

10300002
union	distinct
the query below should give you the output you want sorry no coalesce this time select last_name pri_sec_name from select primary_name as pri_sec_name last_name from members where primary_name is not null union all select secondary_name as pri_sec_name last_name from members where secondary_name is not null a order by last_name pri_sec_name
if i understand correctly i think you are looking for something like this select distinct coalesce primary_name secondary_name as pri_sec_name last_name from members where coalesce primary_name secondary_name is not null order by last_name coalesce primary_name secondary_name update it sounds like in some cases you have one row for a last_name where both primary_name and secondary_name are populated

ienumerable	ilist
autofac has implicit collection support such that you can register multiple individual items and when you resolve an ienumerable of those items you will get all of the registrations this would allow you to greatly simplify the registrations since you wouldn t have to actually build the list ahead of time - you could just register each of your ichecker or inotifier instances directly and resolve the ienumerable of them
if you have the ability to change your serverchecker constructor to take ienumerable rather than ilist then you re done - you don t need to do the c.resolve thing anymore

10301317
ienumerable	ilist
if you have the ability to change your serverchecker constructor to take ienumerable rather than ilist then you re done - you don t need to do the c.resolve thing anymore
that s possibly a better design anyway because ilist implies the collection can be modified later which is probably not what you want

10301317
ienumerable	ilist
it may be that serverchecker copies the contents of the ienumerable into its own list so you could modify a local copy but you wouldn t want folks to think they can or should modify the contents of the central dependency like that. if it has to be ilist you could add another registration that creates the list on the fly that way you still can avoid doing the c.resolve ... call in the resolution for the serverchecker - autofac will suddenly know about how to create the specific type of list
if you really want to get fancy with it you could add a custom autofac registrationsource such that if anyone tries to resolve ilist autofac would automatically do the resolve of the ienumerable and create a list.

10303145
jlist	jtextfield
consider creating a method that creates these components for you that returns a jpanel that holds the components and perhaps have all created jlist share the same listmodel and all jbuttons the same abstractaction
or another option if you are using cardlayout to swap jpanels and you want all of the panels to hold these components above consider not doing this but moving the jlist jbutton and jtextfield out of the cards and on to a less dynamic portion of your gui

10305501
wordpress	expressionengine
i m assuming that you re coming from something like wordpress maybe where every piece of content has the_content and the_excerpt .
aside from a handful of global variables and some fields which are universal to all entries like etc expressionengine isn t like that

10305846
profiling	debugging
you could use a memory profiling such as the one in xdebug to find where all that memory went
memory exhaustion can be very difficult to debugging because the error only tells you where the memory finally ran out not where the bulk of it was used

10307756
hive	hdfs
since partitioning column is a virtual column you can not put a partitioned hive table on top of your data as it is regardless of whether your to-be-partitioning column is present in the middle of the file or at the end
you need the appropriate directory structure to be present in hdfs for partitioning to work

10309478
coalesce	nvl
----edit---- in situations where you do use nvl if you find yourself doing nested nvl like nvl col1 nvl col2 0 take a look at the coalesce function where this would be expressed as coalesce col1 col2 0 - returns the first non-null argument
nvl always evaluates both arguments so even if col1 is not null it will evaluate func_call decode does short circuit so the first valid condition stops execution

10310832
directx	gdi
while gdi+ is slower than say directx i find that there are a lot of things and tricks that can be used to speed things up
a lot of cpu is used for preparing the data before drawing it itself so gdi should not be the only bottleneck there

10314396
super	extends
of course i don t know about logic around consolidateaccount or even if it has a constructor that takes a string but this is just to give you an idea because it would appear that you need to call the constructor of the class that savacct is extends this is indicated by the super call
just to be sure you re not going on a wrong path instead of adding a new constructor which will essentially need to call super acctno name owneracct lastmonthbal

10318496
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
implement touchesbegan on mainview and check if the touch is in the top 30 pixels or points
implement touchesmoved where you check if move direction is down and pulldownview not visible and if so drag the pulldownview down into visible area of main view or check if move direction is up and pulldownview visible and if so push upwards out of visible area

10318496
move	drag
implement touchesmoved where you check if move direction is down and pulldownview not visible and if so drag the pulldownview down into visible area of main view or check if move direction is up and pulldownview visible and if so push upwards out of visible area
implement touchesend where you end the drag or push movement by checking in which direction the pulldownview was moved

10322294
direct3d	direct2d
this can t be directly compared to you usage as we ve gone from bit-bashing in c++ to direct3d in c# using slimdx but i imagine you will see performance benefits even if they re not the orders of magnitude we re seeing
i would advise you to take a look at using direct2d with slimdx

10322294
directx	direct2d
you will need to use directx 10.1 as direct2d isn t compatible with directx 11 for some reason
if you have used the drawing api in wpf then you will already be familiar with direct2d as its api is based on the wpf drawing api as far as i can tell

10322892
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper is an orm an object relational mapper
in this case one that follows the activerecord design pattern do not confuse this with ci s ar which is no activerecord it s a query builder

10324372
ssl	https
this worked for everything except for ssl redirecting which i decided was not a big enough issue to hold up the project
in the system every page is explicitly set to either http or https

10326803
inline	inlining
leave aside partially whether or not to inline a function is solely a decision that is best made by the compiler and you should rely on it to make the best decision
you are completely at the mercy of the compiler with inlining

10328381
atoi	strncpy
that is when you call strncpy with final set to 1 strncpy copies one character and does not append the terminating nul-character which will then cause atoi to fail
also if you are using 0 and 1 characters in your huffman coding this won t work anyway because numbers 01 and 1 will both be interpreted by atoi as 1 one even though they are different codes

10330638
ssl	https
named virtual hosting does not work for https because the server cannot interpret the host header until the connection has been made and making the connection requires the completion of the ssl encryption handshake used by https
ssl certificates without extensions can only have a single server host name as their subject and thus the certificate and connection will only work for a single host name

10331393
client-side	server-side
there are 2 main issues currently both of which have workarrounds authorization first if you have a look closely at how google drive auth works you will realize that after a user has installed your drive application and tries to open a file or create a new file with your application drive initiates the oauth 2.0 authorization flow automatically and the auth parameters are set to response_type code and access_type offline . this basically means that right now drive apps are forced to use the oauth 2 server-side flow which is not going to be of any use to the javascript client library which only uses the client-side flow
the issue is that drive initiates a server-side oauth 2.0 flow then the javascript client library initiates a client-side oauth 2.0 flow

10332648
sudo	passwd
sudo and se-linux usually give you plenty of options to avoid entering passwd
this being said su opens its controlling terminal to read the passwd not stdin

10333668
awt	swing
i have seen a lot using swingutilities.invokelater presumably in some kind of belief the swing isn t dependent upon awt
swingutilities.invokelater exists only because eventqueue.invokelater was introduced in 1.2 but swing was available for 1.1

10333725
postgresql	mysql
if you are on an older version of postgresql you will need to run the the script uuid-ossp.sql from the contrib folder which is part of your postgresql installation
it s not clear if you refer to mysql which does not have a newid function or to sql server which does have a newid function and is also targeted in the answer you have linked to

10334903
postgresql	mysql
all database engines i ve been closely working with this is sql server oracle postgresql mysql sybase sqlite informix and firebird will optimize it to the same plan
the fourth query however won t parse on all engines you cannot reference a table in an on clause before it had been used in a join clause mysql offers straight_join clause which affects the join order used in the plan

10336061
hex	binary
if not here s one method for hex outputs 00|7b|0b|ff|42|63|
you do have to convert the raw binary to hexadecimal or base64 representation

10338057
implements	extends
up to java 4 volatile could be re-ordered by compiler with respect to any previous read or write leading to subtle concurrency bugs making it impossible to implements a double check locking very common idiom for a singleton
this is fixed in java 5.0 which extends the semantics for volatile which cannot be reordered with respect to any following read or write anymore and introduces a new memory model

10338198
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so you re not switching the views of a single uiviewcontroller telling it to switch from view1 to view2 to view3 and so on
you need to be telling the view controller hierarchy which in your case probably needs to be managed by a uinavigationcontroller to push and or pop view controller on and off its stack

10338641
allocator	stl
it appears that you re not only doing your own custom allocator but that you re also not necessarily trying to define an stl-compatible allocator
however i think it s useful to recognize that for all their faults stl allocators were designed to handle this case

10338641
allocator	stl
however i think it s useful to recognize that for all their faults stl allocator were designed to handle this case
allocation is separate from construction notice that allocator construct does not allocate space for the element it should already be available at p see member allocate to allocate space

10340508
haskell	scheme
imperative for - or while -style loops aren t impossible in scheme although they are pretty much impossible in pure functional languages such as haskell they re slightly out of place in scheme under many circumstances
but scheme s flexibility that allows you as the developer to make that decision enables important performance or maintainability optimizations in certain circumstances

10340816
serializable	deserialization
fixup after deserialization use a serializable that can support object references not xmlserializer
xmlserializer is a tree serializable

10344185
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
all exceptions which are subclasses of runtimeexception are unchecked-exception and in general you re not supposed to declare that a method throws them
both exceptions are runtimeexception subclasses you don t have to explicitly declare them in the throws part of the method declaration

10346882
super	implements
in each overridden instance method you would finally call nsnotificationcenter s respective super method
additionally you would provide a method to retrieve your own list of observers for the given name for example however there are two issues with this approach first nsmutabledictionary would retain all observers in a naive implementation which is probably not the same behavior nsnotificationcenter implements

10348910
rspec	capybara
you have to take into account that isn t rspec who is trying to make that ajax call but capybara
also what rails is doing with that method put and remote true is using ujs which capybara with rack test doesn t handle well out-of-the-box because it implies javascript

10349253
textview	imageview
you want to be able to first select an imageview then a textview
if they match correct answer will be displayed somewhere if not wrong answer will be displayed if you click on a textview before an imageview is selected nothing happens if you click on a textview and another textview is already selected nothing happens if that is correct you can do this like this you keep two variables in your onclicklistener you update their values like this instead you could just iterate through the textview array and call setclickable false

10351108
printwriter	bufferedwriter
or maybe there s an exception somewhere which printwriter isn t going to report because it swallows them
personally i d recommend taking just a writer or bufferedwriter instead of a printwriter and declaring that reverse can throw ioexception

10351641
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as long as you hold a reference to your asihttprequest in your uiviewcontroller it will work
secondly you have to make sure that your entire uiviewcontroller is not deallocated which happens for example with non-root view controllers are popped from uinavigationcontroller

10354222
google-chrome	firefox
obviously this is for google-chrome though not firefox
i also found jquery debugger in the google-chrome store

10356698
concave	angle
3. sort these points based on maximum angle from the center point 4. use your four points in your bounding box and your midpoint s in sorted ascending angle order to create the ordered point list of your concave polygon
i am not sure if i understand your minimal surface step above but i believe this algorithm will work for taking a cut out of image to generate a concave polygon

10357759
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you need the objectcontext instance backing your dbcontext object you can do the following
dbcontext does not set isolation level

10358179
scala	typesafe
preinstalling scala on your phone some guys claiming that there are problems with ides but things getting changed fast the current version of the intellij idea 12 not only has a good support of scala as a plugin but also contains ui designer for android
moreover you can use eclipse which has a support from both android by google and scala by typesafe sides

10358995
super	self
if you fail to assign self to the result of super s initializer or if you fail to check for nil then you may be holding on to a dangling deallocated pointer exc_bad_access and you may not initialize your ivars properly you would effectively assign them to another region if an exc_bad_access were not encountered
the two cases in more detail fail to assign self fail to check for nil and yes i have seen both of these

10360291
mdpi	hdpi
in other words use an mdpi device to figure out the relative size on the screens and from there on apply the given scaling ratios to produce resources for the ldpi hdpi and xhdpi buckets
obviously you do not actually have to scale up that mdpi resource - all you need determine is the size for that screens density and then you can use whatever source file to produce images for all buckets

10360627
scheme	racket
as stated in the question this is really really not the way to do things in scheme
nevertheless you can achieve what you ask in racket by set

10363117
scheme	racket
scheme is defined by a standard
racket isn t

10363170
scheme	racket
however the default language that is used in racket diverges from scheme in a few places most notably it has immutable pairs
this is not something new it had similar differences when it was called plt scheme

10363170
scheme	racket
this is not something new it had similar differences when it was called plt scheme
it s also not something that is unique to racket the scheme standard s are so minimalistic that the language that they define is impractical which means that all scheme implementations add their own extensions

10365197
ssl	https
below is tested ok on ics... sample ssl connectionmgr on androidhttpclient libs
from your stacktrace i would suggest that you register both http https and see if that does not work

10365302
ienumerable	ilist
.select already returns an ienumerable so it should work without
tolist returns a list not an ilist or similar interface but a concrete c# class

10365663
super	self
you should be calling super with the current class not the parent
- but keep in mind that the same self is passed to all three of these __init__ methods when f is created and that self is always of class final

10365979
ssl	https
if you re not using single-sign on sso for authenticating to your website but use plain usernames and passwords in a form transmitting that over an ssl tls connection from your application will be no different from doing so from a browser over https provided that the overall configuration is correct
this is already what happens when you post a form from a browser anyway. by using ssl tls as you suggest you re actually not sending your password in clear provided it s configured properly

10372242
scheme	racket
unfortunately from the online documentation it doesn t look like mit scheme provides this function
if you re able to use a different system racket provides the expand function as well as local-expand which works correctly inside macros

10372783
appfuse	spring
but i suggest you have a look at appfuse project i m sure you ll get good hints from its source code
hibernatetemplate is not recommanded any more in spring 3.1

ssl	https
to get the certificate of server thumbprint you can run this in powershell register and map wcf port with netsh map to wcf port setup your host set to https and enable transport security detailed references how to create and install temporary certificates in wcf for transport security during development msdn configuring http and https msdn how to configure a port with an ssl certificate msdn and if you run into problems with add sslcert stack overflow question self-hosting using ssl and wcf - can t bind certificate to port stack overflow question using netsh bind an ssl certificate to a port number is failing stack overflow question certificate on wcf service that does not use iis

10376406
google-chrome	firefox
just goofing around with jsfiddle and the google-chrome dev tools and firefox web console i found that they both supported onload and onerror or so i thought
results of testing google google-chrome 18.0.1025.165 and firefox 12.0 supports does not support events don t seem to fire as you can see from the fiddle in google-chrome using the load event causes infinite loops

10378907
serializable	deserialization
from the serializable interface s docs if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

10379655
quicksort	mergesort
invariant of quicksort is that each recursion downwards the right side is always greater than or equal to the pivot and at least equal to the left side
whereas mergesort that is not the case

10380867
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
extract from treeset javadoc emphasis mine note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

10381707
bellman-ford	dijkstra
however bellman-ford can detect negative cycles and report their existence but it cannot produce a correct answer if a negative cycle is not reachable from the source
indeed shortest path algorithms have trouble with negative numbers this is true for dijkstra s algorithm but not for shortest path algorithms in general

10381815
jms	jta
it concentrates on webapp support servlets and jsps provides a jdbc connection pool and jndi support but doesn t have ejbs and jms for example
glassfish is a full-stack java ee server which supports everything on the java ee spec servlets jsps ejb jms jpa jta etc. oracle has tutorials on java ee

10383377
jar	war
a jar file doesn t normally contain dependencies in the maven sense
so you must be talking about a war or ear or similar file a so-called uberjar file produced by combining lots of jar files

10385263
rdf	owl
however all owl ontologies can be written as rdf graphs so you can directly store them in a triple store without any preprocessing note that any conformant owl tool must be able to serialise ontologies in rdf xml
strictly speaking owl is not rdf

10385263
rdf	owl
strictly speaking owl is not rdf
the specification of owl defines ontologies as a radically different structure than sets of triples

10385361
ssl	https
note the default dav lib subversion uses neon has sspi the windows implementation of domain authentication authentication disabled for non-ssl connections it only works for ssl connections - for exactly this reason
you should set up your server with ssl access it via https not http

10385487
uiview	subviews
to 2. whenever you implement drawrect in a uiview subclass and have lots of instances of that class your memory usage will grow dramatically
reason is that a lot of optimization tricks in uikit view subviews handling when zooming or scrolling don t work with such objects because the framework doesn t know what you re doing what you are drawing. so - independent of retina or not - avoid implementing drawrect especially when having many objects or many layers of subviews

10386248
uiview	subviews
my experience never add subviews to a uiview that s backed by a catiledlayer never add sublayers to a catiledlayer unfortunately that seems to be the only practical answer - apple s implementation goes horribly wrong in many different ways not just performance - the rendering itself starts to exhibit visual artifact bugs some of apple s rendering code goes weird etc
in practice i always do this uiview view +-- uiview w catiledlayer tiledlayerview +-- uiview subviewsview ...and safely add views and subviews to subviewsview

10386912
webclient	httpwebrequest
or the difference in behavior between webclient and httpclient on your machine may just have to do with dns caches or some such
webclient uses httpwebrequest which unfortunately is not very asynchronous even if you use the asynchronous methods

10387713
junit	testng
i suspect what you re trying to do will be easy with testng - junit does not have the grouping capability that testng does
i always recommend that people switch to testng which is just like junit 4 except with more functionality

10390676
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
regarding the techniques you mention webgl is supported in google-chrome and firefox for android
on ios mobile safari does not enable webgl but an implementation exists used strictly for in-app ads so it is likely that there may be broader webgl support in the future possibly requiring a custom web view wrapper to enable it

10392157
ssl	https
if you are not using https you are already insecure by design and nothing you come up with will fix that short of re-inventing ssl
so what should you do if the transport is secure https client makes a request for authentication sending username + password in plain-text

10392465
portrait	landscape
for instructions on how to get it working in portrait just follow this issue 178 - zxing - running zxing in portrait i would strongly suggest reading the thread to get the background info on the change but here is the basics of it in order to make screen work in portrait set portrait orientation for the activity in manifest and then config the camera use camera.setdisplayorientation 90 in cameraconfigurationmanager.setdesiredcameraparameters camera camera . but be aware that setdisplayorientation int requires android 2.2 setdisplayorientation int does not affect the order of byte array passed in previewcallback.onpreviewframe
refer to javadoc for additional info because preview frames are always in landscape we need to rotate them

10393265
aggregate-functions	sum
i m not sure about mysql but i know that in sql when you do an aggregate-functions like sum kills then you can t reference the row via row kills
i don t know if this is your problem but you could try doing sum kills as kills in your select statement

10394756
implements	extends
you can implements a checkbox in them and make is have
listview already extends scrollview and doesn t need to have another one to surround it

10394983
apache	nginx
when running servers such as apache each instance consumes a significant amount of ram so it becomes important to only have a monolithic instance that handles all one s needs
with nginx the memory and cpu utilization is so low that running dozens of instances of it is not an issue

10396822
stateless	stateful
timers can be created for stateless session beans singleton session beans mes- sage-driven beans and 2.1 entity beans
timers cannot be created for stateful session beans

10398558
postgresql	mysql
this works because distinct on postgresql specific like distinct sql-standard are applied after the window function
window functions with the over clause require postgresql 8.4 or later and are not available in mysql

10399303
implements	extends
also your b should implements callable not extends thread
although it would work it is only because thread implements runnable as well

10401429
cakephp	yii
in cakephp you cannot use composite primary key this is the main deal-breake r for me
composite primary key is supported in yii. cakephp enforces convention while yii favors convention you are not forced to follow a certain standard

10404234
prepare	execute
you did not post the code which handles the database interaction how query is built and execute but if you prepare the string your data should be inserted updated in it s entirety as expected
i ran the string through pdo prepare and resulted in notice all the escaping of the escape characters

10405080
profiling	instrumentation
okay i have a similar problem with opencover and the way to fix this is i am told is ngen uninstall assembly details profiling intellitrace is probably trying to instrumentation the libraries in order to perform tracing but it cannot do so as it will not get the jitcompilationstarted events unless they override the jitcachedfunctionsearchstarted event
best thing is to just uninstall the profiling scenario assembly on the development machine

10406388
queue	fifo
we are rolling out this new type of queue in two regions now and plan to make it available in many others in early 2017
these queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once in the order that they are sent and without duplicates . ... emphasis mine as emphasized these new fifo sqs queues will cover the use case at hand but are not yet available in all sqs regions initially only in us east ohio and us west oregon

10406388
queue	fifo
these queue are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once in the order that they are sent and without duplicates . ... emphasis mine as emphasized these new fifo sqs queue will cover the use case at hand but are not yet available in all sqs regions initially only in us east ohio and us west oregon
also the sqs faq for fifo queue outlines notable differences between standard and fifo queue that should be considered upfront for example a throughput limit of 300 transactions per second

10406388
queue	fifo
i ve only tested it shortly myself so far but have been pretty pleased with the offered features and language integrations see client libraries and beanstalk support - given their competitive price tag and especially the free tier makes it a good candidate for exploring a message queuing as a service solution not the least in combination with their second product ironworker an easy-to-use and massively scalable task queue ... which provides functionality not even available from amazon-web-services as of today
fifo message ordering unfortunately i haven t been able to figure out whether true fifo is supported by ironmq directly consequently i actually doubt it - accordingly you d need to file a support request to verify this

10406867
uiview	subviews
uiview touches do not get passed to subviews if they lie outside of the superview s bounds as mentioned by the solution
however if you want these subviews to respond to touch override hittest withevent of the superview

10406949
equals	compareto
you need to define equals hashcode and compareto for your player object correctly
since it s a treeset and not a hashset implementing hashcode isn t so important - but it s good practice. equals and hashcode need to take into account all of the fields

10408071
clang	llvm
for starters gcc 4.2 is not very old and puts a lot of limitations on the language. that being said your mac if it has gcc 4.2 installed should also have clang installed
xcode includes both clang and gcc built with llvm as clang and gcc g++ respectively

10408506
ssl	spdy
spdy as deployed in the wild does not have this problem since it is generally deployed over ssl port 443 using npn to negotiate spdy support
ssl is key since it prevents intermediaries from interfering

10408840
super	implements
it is right when you clone an object you should always call super.clone as first statement and then cloning the rest part of your object by hand this is because when you clone an object you have to make sure that the super class part of the object get clone in the right way too .
if an object do not support clone it throws clonenotsupportedexception this means that if you try to clone a super object and you get the exception you can t implements the clone object also in your subtype and the object cannot be cloned .

10416126
svg	vml
which basically every browser except ie8 and below will use svg
if you want it to work in all modern browsers then use html5 if you want to support old browsers then you could use the js library raphael uses svg if available vml if not

10416747
coalesce	nvl
as others said nvl can be cascaded but the preferred solution would be to use coalesce instead
however the two functions are not entirely interchangeable 1 as mentioned elsewhere coalesce only evaluates the arguments from the first until it meets one that does not evaluate to null 2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion

10420268
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
note that if you take away the animation and apply an actual transform perspective 500px to the .face you will see the same result in firefox or google-chrome as what you experience in safari with your code
so i think actually safari may be doing it correctly and firefox and google-chrome perhaps are not

10423668
backgrounding	multitasking
your app does get some running time when it is in the backgrounding but i m not sure it would be enough to run the web traffic that you d need
check out this post running app in backgrounding and send frequent http request and check out the multitasking guide here multitasking guidelines you can also look at push notifications

10424801
heroku	engineyard
plus the added inconvenience that i could not get to the log files on heroku and figure out what is going on
having deployed the same exact code to engineyard and watching it scream without any funky spikes in performance i have to say engineyard is by the far the winner and easiest to deploy to once you get your system setup

10426791
implements	extends
once implements both methods should follow this template
there is a tip on fxexperience that deals with an issue just like that. to paraphrase you extends the textfield and override the replacetext and replaceselection methods filtering all input that is not a number

10427933
jar	manifest.mf
maybe your jar only contains the .java files not the compiled classes
check that your jar file has the following structure at least jarfile.jar |---------- swong |---------- startup.class |---------- meta-inf |---------- manifest.mf it seems like the class startup is missing

10429195
innodb	myisam
introduction doctrine2 uses innodb which supports foreign keys used in doctrine associations
but as myisam does not support this yet you can not use myisam to manage doctrine entities

10429721
opera	firefox
since h.264 is currently not a royalty free format it is unfit for the open web platform according to mozilla 1 2 google 1 2 and opera
short answer firefox doesn t support mp4 as it s not open source

10434310
clang	llvm
arc in clang doesn t work by rewriting code from objc to objc but emitting the extra retain release llvm bitcode during code-gen
that means it is not possible to know how the compiler fix it without going to llvm ir assembly level

10435035
tiff	bmp
tiff jpeg png are supported
bmp gif interlaced images are not supported

10436341
google-chrome	safari
a minor difference but still a plus for google-chrome
i my opinion the increase in speed is simply made by the way the browser renders a page safari seems to rebuild everything from scratch while google-chrome similar to opera build up the page even if it s not fully loaded

10436341
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i my opinion the increase in speed is simply made by the way the browser renders a page safari seems to rebuild everything from scratch while google-chrome similar to opera build up the page even if it s not fully loaded
google-chrome has done a lot of these feels faster improvements like loading browser gui first then loading libs

10437177
jar	manifest.mf
the problem arises when you enable jar indexing using maven will omit your entries from meta-inf index.list
when you use the jar at runtime java will look at index.list for finding classes not manifest.mf

10437575
lxml	elementtree
here is how you can remove comments with lxml output
comment is an xpath node test that is not supported by elementtree

10438417
udp	tcp
because tcp is not message oriented unlike udp and other more exotic message protocols you are sending and receiving a single stream of bytes
basically if you were to consider your client as the writer of a book and your server as its reader then in the world of tcp all punctuation is removed

10439922
jms	jta
i would change the sender code to technically you can cache the jms connection instance in the emailqueuemessenger instance
your code should not close the jms session as this will be handled when the transaction completes although i have seen variances between jms jta implementations on this point

10441030
mongodb	bson
to deal with this issue the following may work mongodb object serialized as json
in python you can use the simplejson encoder to convert bson to json as follows it will convert all simple objects but will have difficulties with others for example datetime will not work

10442767
ssl	https
while https request can be sent via http proxy this is almost never done because in this scenario the proxy will validate server s certificate but the client will be able to receive and validate only proxy s certificate and as name in the proxy s certificate will not match the address the socket connected to in most cases an alert will be given and ssl handshake won t succeed i am not going into details of how to try to address this
finally as http proxy can look into the request this invalidates the idea of security provided by https channel so using http proxy for https requests is normally done only for debugging purposes again we omit cases of paranoid company security policies which require monitoring of all https traffic of company employees

10448419
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql example here
in mysql you could do this example here however i am not 100 certain this is the best way to do it

10448859
draggable	droppable
if you take a folder to put it into another one it s like draggable droppable taking a folder and droppping it over another one will not reorganize it but trigger an action which will be to move the folder inside the other
take a look at jquery ui documentation for sortable and draggable droppable

10450866
decoder	encoder
what happens if the decoder receives a code z that is not yet in its dictionary
and the decoder can determine the unknown character as follows this situation occurs whenever the encoder encounters input of the form cscsc where c is a single character s is a string and cs is already in the dictionary but csc is not

10450866
decoder	encoder
and the decoder can determine the unknown character as follows this situation occurs whenever the encoder encounters input of the form cscsc where c is a single character s is a string and cs is already in the dictionary but csc is not
the encoder emits the code for cs putting a new code for csc into the dictionary

10451088
profiling	debugging
if you did not profiling and ensured it was a bottleneck then this discussion could be completely off.
remember than profiling debugging builds is pretty much useless

10451430
udp	tcp
this will work equally well with tcp udp or any other protocol that uses sockets
udp is not the natural choice

10457201
boost	stl
here s a solution using a range adaptor that is implemented with zip_iterator that zip function creates an adaptor with begin and end members that return a boost zip_iterator so the loop variable is a tuple of the elements of each underlying container and as it s a variadic template you can do it for any number of containers so you don t need to write for_each_for_three_ranges and for_each_for_four_ranges etc. you could also use it with for_each
1 the algorithms in the stl are not meant to cover every possible case if you need for_each_on_two_ranges then write it as you have and use it

10458881
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
any subclass of runtimeexception including runtimeexception itself is an unchecked-exception which means the compiler won t force you to check for it in a try catch clause
in contrast any exception which is not a subclass of runtimeexception is called easily enough a checked exception

10458881
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if it were a checked exception that is not a subclass of runtimeexception but you were sure that you could never trigger it then it d be safe to catch it
rather than completely swallowing it it d be best to wrap it around an unchecked-exception

10460160
google-chrome	firefox
also it highly depends on the browser on how this is displayed i guess you are using google-chrome like me where the link provided by you looks like a webpage if you open it in firefox you will see the live bookmark styled page however the entries don t show
i m not sure if this is because of some problem with your markup or some problem with firefox and atom feeds

10460284
addition	multiplication
with this in mind and rewritting the assertion with the operands reordered to collect similar terms we have the comparison of d s row size with the column size of a suggests a multiplication operation an addition operation would require a comparison of each matrix dimension which doesn t occur here
likewise for d and b - on this occasion d s column size is checked against the row size of b - this test is consistent with a multiplication operation so we have

10460763
bash	zsh
some shells notably zsh and perhaps bash version 4 but not version 3 have a syntax to do that
with zsh you might just type and if you would want to remove any file whose name starts with foo recursively in subdirectories you could do the double star feature is with imho better interactive completion in my opinion enough to switch to zsh for interactive shells

10461517
octal	decimal
note octal values are denoted in java by leading zero normal decimal number cannot have a leading zero
because 0123 in not decimal digit its octal base 8 so this is equal to 83 to convert a number k to decimal use the formula that defines its base-8 representation an octal numeral consists of an ascii digit 0 followed by one or more of the ascii digits 0 through 7 and can represent a positive zero or negative integer

10462205
innodb	myisam
the compound unique key can replace the primary key unless the cake framework cannot deal with compound priamry keys it s also good to have another index with the reverse order besides the index created for the primary key index invoice_id category_id if you want to define foreign key constraints you should use the innodb engine
with myisam you can t have foreign keys

10462351
postgresql	mysql
see the entry in the pspp manual on how to import data from postgresql in pspp
to my knowledge mysql is not currently supported by pspp

10464042
udp	tcp
mqtt-s can run over udp but there aren t any publicly available libraries for it yet
there is a run down of some experiments done on mqtt power usage on android at i think that mqtt itself really makes use of the tcp delivery and ordering guarantees

10464073
google-chrome	firefox
the zoom i posted above works well in google-chrome and ie8+ firefox not supported as mentioned -- additional information here is an example on how to zoom exactly with the zoom option. example application can be found here the zoom option normally handles the zoom as your browser does
in google-chrome and ie it works

10464883
piston	tastypie
tastypie is more tightly coupled to the orm than piston but there are methods that you can define in a tastypie resource to specify how to handle create read update delete and you would just not set the queryset meta field
piston on the other hand has a more direct initial approach to having you define one or more of these methods

10466409
arp	icmp
it will only send an arp if it needs to send something to the ip address and doesn t know the destination mac address yet
maybe the icmp echo request is that something the authors use in their examples to cause the source machine to send an arp

10468763
awt	swing
i m rellative new in java my first touch was java1.6.009 then i can t compare changes for awt and when born swing in java1.3 and rest in java1.4 my example
api quite exactly talks then i m understand that that robot should be ignore if is invoked from edt or not using the class to generate input events differs from posting events to the awt event queue or awt components in that the events are generated in the platform s native input queue

10469249
cdr	cons
what you can do when given a list l is to use cdr to produce a new list which has the same elements as l does except that the new list doesn t hold the first element
a little more detail a list holding the three values 1 2 and 3 is represented as cons 1 cons 2 cons 3 . let us name the cons-cells the first thing to note is that the entire list is given by the value c1. we can not delete the number 1 from the list by manipulating the cons-cell c1

10471124
super	implements
remember that a super class can be the object reference instance of a sub class not viceversa
also as the java documentation states queue is an interface and linkedlist implements it

10471907
ubuntu	linux
for linux especially ubuntu fedora and other top distros packaging is really the way to distribute your application
download-install-run is a windows thing and it s not the way people on linux install software well people new to linux might... you should also try for distro acceptance which will reduce your burden over time

10474104
postgresql	mysql
the only changes are to the settings.py database section and the postgresql installation of course
the point of the error message is that mysql doesn t support transactions when you re altering schemas

10474311
scheme	racket
scheme doesn t have a concept of a keyword at least not the type you re talking about
some implementations like racket and guile have keywords for keyword arguments like # foo

10474455
innodb	myisam
the edge over innodb
but considering that myisam does not fully support referential integrity constraints and transactions and used uses table level locking i would definitely go for innodb

10474455
innodb	myisam
but considering that myisam does not fully support referential integrity constraints and transactions and used uses table level locking i would definitely go for innodb
what you are risking is data integrity here and you d need a special scenario to warrant a need for myisam in my honest opinion

10477064
mri	rubinius
in mri two threads cannot run code simultaneously but a context switch can happen at any time
in rubinius and jruby threads can run code simultaneously

10477216
backgrounding	multitasking
if your app is not running in foreground it can be either in backgrounding mode or in suspended mode
please refer to the app launch cycle section of ios app programming guide - app states and multitasking

10478330
jsf	seam
seam security does not rely on javaee security or jboss but only on servlet and jsf apis
it is obviously the easiest option for jsf seam-based web application

10479140
implements	extends
while it is not possible to both extends a class and implements an interface what you probably what to do can be achieved using delegation
just create an instance of base in the initializer of your anonymous class and use its methods from the methods you implements from interface1

10480101
dbcontext	objectcontext
for more complex tasks you can still convert a dbcontext instance to an objectcontext instance through iobjectcontextadapter
for example i ve read that dbcontext doesn t have the ste self-tracking entities capability

10480101
dbcontext	objectcontext
for example i ve read that dbcontext doesn t have the ste self-tracking entities capability
ste was created for objectcontext and i don t think it was ported to dbcontext but you can try to implement this capability yourself

10480327
uialertview	mbprogresshud
also if this flow doesn t fit fire off the performsegue method when the animation is over or the user responds to the uialertview that you have fired off
or if you haven t been using mbprogresshud take a look at that

10480774
factors	matrix
nnma is based on a factorization technique but the result is not factors of the original data matrix. i mention this because this alternate term though incorrect is widely used so i would include it in my search engine queries
in essence this techique can be used to remove sparsity from a matrix or put another way to populate the missing cells the customer at row r has not reviwed the product of column c

10481755
calloc	malloc
you need to cell either calloc or memset for this purpose or
malloc does not implicitly zero out the allocated memory

10481880
translation	localization
there is some support for localization using resources.resx and if you want to provide a multi-lingual application you could store the translation strings in resources.resx
however wpf localization as described by microsoft is not based on resources.resx

10482779
scrollable	panels
if the header included in the scroll bar and then put this in rootlayoutpanel or rootpanel or use dockpanel in layout panels. for example we want to have scrollable header and center part but west panels and bottom always in view and then put this in rootlayoutpanel
layout panels do not work properly in scroll panels

10484352
profiling	debugging
what s likely happening is the particular menu isn t visible by default for some reason in the current profiling
you can verify this is the case by doing the following while debugging view - other windows - command window debug.quickwatch theexpression the debug.quickwatch command will directly invoke the quick watch feature

10485756
sudo	passwd
so basically whoever has sudo access to your server can always access alter all mysql data
but you should definitely define a passwd for the root and store it safe - not on the server not even obscure and possibly limit it to be able to connect only from localhost

10487437
oncreate	onstart
i don t recommend calling flurryagent.onstartsession from oncreate due to the nature of the activity lifecycle
if a user were to navigate away from an activity for a while take a call text message etc and then return onstart will be called but not oncreate

10487437
oncreate	onstart
if a user were to navigate away from an activity for a while take a call text message etc and then return onstart will be called but not oncreate
if don t call onstartsession from onstart you wouldn t be tracking this new session and you might run into errors with events that occur inside your activity

10487623
g++	gcc
normally these compilers are located on similar path for g++
above error means that the current gcc version used is not able to find its own cc1 compiler

10491017
google-chrome	firefox
ie and google-chrome will convert the newlines in the string to elements in the html when the text is set using innertext which is what knockout uses
firefox doesn t have innertext so knockout uses textcontent which doesn t do any conversion of the string

10492036
rtp	rtsp
i am not certain which ports you can try 1024-65355 solution 2 find a streaming server which allow rtp over tcp your mobile network might not be doing any nating or it is doing smart nating which doesn t break rtsp
rtsp rtp udp works like this 1 session management on tcp layer 2 media on udp layer if you don t have the nat correctly done on your wifi network the udp traffic may not be received to the device

10492036
udp	tcp	rtp	rtsp
rtsp rtp udp works like this 1 session management on tcp layer 2 media on udp layer if you don t have the nat correctly done on your wifi network the udp traffic may not be received to the device
in this case 1 device tries to fall back to rtsp tunneling over tcp. 2 if the streaming server doesn t support rtp over tcp the device will fail to stream solution 1 configure our wifi router to nat the udp ports to your device

10492308
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
calling the property window.rootviewcontroller returns an instance of uiviewcontroller and that class does not have a publicly visible property called delegate
uinavigationcontroller however does

10493335
nfa	dfa
the thompson-mcnaughton-yamada algorithm is an extension that turns the regex into an actual nfa stored in memory as opposed to a transient simulation
converting the nfa to a dfa determinization is not part of mcnaughton or yamada s extension

10493874
profiling	benchmarking
if this doesn t help it s time to move to server-level profiling to see which processes are causing the problem
5 yes - benchmarking

10494494
google-chrome	firefox
firefox in its plugins and extensions gives access to browser s google-chrome the ui stuff around the page which makes this possible although i am not sure of the api that you have mentioned
google google-chrome however is clear about its exposure to browser s google-chrome to the extension and gives access only through browser actions and page actions

10494829
gridview	repeater
use paging in gridview - check this link also adjust display property like display header with available visible cells to load the grid faster. its even better if you bind the grid data using jquery and not from server side
use this link to get started instead of using gridview you can use repeater or even jquery templates also with custom paging

10496558
implements	extends
in as3 you may add listeners to all objects that extends flash.display.sprite instances which implements methods of ieventdispatcher for you.
so if you have a class which do not extends flash.display.sprite you ll have to extends eventdispatcher in order to add listeners to your instances and handle events.

10499458
google-chrome	safari
from the blog post it seems it is buggy in safari so maybe google-chrome has not implemented it yet
i m unable to activate that experiment myself there s no developer tools experiments in my google-chrome flags but from safari i found this explanation in short it is a little utility that allows you to enter blocks of html and css and have it rendered on the fly

10499966
spaces	delimiter
you are calling substitute on spaces characters that are not only your temporary delimiter but also a pattern in your concatenated strings
the dirty yet quick solution is to use a temporary delimiter pattern that won t appear in your h2 l2 n2.

10508007
oncreate	setcontentview
try scrolling to the x y position of the button like this edit this code will not behave as you would expect if it is placed in oncreate
even though you have called setcontentview the layout has not been measured and initialized yet

10509384
super	self
an alternative method of initializing the super-class is by using super though this will actually initialize the super-class of self dynamically by looking it up in the object s __mro__ method resolution order in python 2 super self dog .__init__ self name dog in python 3 you can further reduce the syntax and avoid repeating yourself super .__init__ self name dog edit since you re not actually using the name argument passed to dog you can further reduce some syntax by accepting arbitrary keyword and positional arguments in the dog initializer and passing them up the initialization chain in your scenario the initializer might be simple enough to not need this but it s useful to know for when you have more arguments and or a deeper class hierarchy
having the language force the super class to initialize before or after means that you lose functionality

10511101
junit	mockito
the annotation is to denote that this should not be used during the application flow and the function is meant only for junit purpose
some of the things which i can think of are use mocking frameworks like easymock or mockito to mock the configurationfactory and use this mock objects in other calling areas

10512359
persistent	transient
so if loadtransientstate is only concerned with the persistent of information while tombstoning then it may be appropriate to move it inside the if block
if it deals with some other form of transient data then probably not

10513119
memcpy	strncpy
if you re certain the source and destination buffers are the same size go with memcpy
if not strncpy does bound checking and it s the way to go

10513169
memcpy	strncpy
even if underlying implementation is not so different memcpy is much faster because it does not have to check what it s copying strncpy will stop when it ll copy the end of string character null
edit some considerations about performance of strncpy compared to memcpy

10513169
memcpy	strncpy
look this implementation of strncpy now look at memcpy implementation memcpy will always be faster than strncpy for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe
note it s not your case because you will use it massively but in general i think that if you have to copy a string then use strncpy

10518261
udp	tcp
udp is sort of like a radio broadcast as it is generally not targeted to a specific ip but broadcast over the entire network
thus you normal tcp ip connection will not be able to work on the udp server

10518261
udp	tcp
thus you normal tcp ip connection will not be able to work on the udp server
see this link on how to write a udp client

10519387
google-chrome	firefox
yes google-chrome supports userscripts but not fully as greasemonkey
for example check out this userscript docs online viewer it works well with greasemonkey in firefox but not with google-chrome natively

10521548
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
supported browsers opera safari google-chrome if html 5 input types are not supported on a browser they will behave as regular text fields
refer to w3 - input types w3 - input type number w3schools - html 5 input types open this example on ie and google-chrome and see the difference

10523986
serializable	deserialization
the xmlserializer doesn t serializable properties which don t have a setter iirc it only serializable public properties with both public getter and setter
you have a few options replace the system.numerics.complex type with a type which you create and has a full property change the myclass class to handle the serialization and deserialization of the complex numbers via the ixmlserializable interface

10525626
equals	compareto
also as bohemian mentions you should override hashcode if you re overriding equals but that s not why your treeset is allowing you to add duplicate items
not only do you need compareto to compare the level but you also need it to compare the title since equals compares the title

10528232
cassini	iis
t work asp.net dev server cassini iis express and multiple threads
if so i ve seen quite a few people saying that cassini cannot execute requests in parallel

10531815
union	distinct
columns that are formed by using the set operators union union all crossjoin except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns being modified are not affected by group by having or distinct clauses. top is not used anywhere in the select_statement of the view together with the with check option clause

10533036
ienumerable	iqueryable
so when you have to simply iterate through the in-memory collection use ienumerable if you need to do any manipulation with the collection like dataset and other data sources use iqueryable
ienumerable ienumerable is best suitable for working with in-memory collection. ienumerable doesn t move between items it is forward only collection

10533036
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable ienumerable is best suitable for working with in-memory collection. ienumerable doesn t move between items it is forward only collection
iqueryable iqueryable best suits for remote data source like a database or web service. iqueryable is a very powerful feature that enables a variety of interesting deferred execution scenarios like paging and composition based queries

10533093
ienumerable	iqueryable
so when you have to simply iterate through the in-memory collection use ienumerable if you need to do any manipulation with the collection like dataset and other data sources use iqueryable
ienumerable ienumerable is best suitable for working with in-memory collection or local queries . ienumerable doesn t move between items it is forward only collection

10533590
google-chrome	firefox
browsers based on webkit google-chrome safari have html5 speach input
example unfortunately firefox doesn t have such method

10535005
jsf	seam
so the short answer is no you cannot use xml to configure cdi beans and as cdi and jsf are two different things you wouldn t be able to re-use a jsf config file without changes - obviously
the solution to your problem comes with seam solder which uses the extension mechanism of cdi to add exactly that functionality and much more

10536383
implements	extends
i m not as familiar with elisp but the common lisp loop functionality is implements via a macro
you can extends the language -- often lisps only have one special form for conditionals and all of the others are implements in lisp on top of that one

10538134
dns	spf
in the latter case don t forget to configure the nameservers in your domain registrars panel to the he dns servers ns1.he.net - ns5.he.net
the records you will have to add are as follows an a record for www.domain-name.com pointing to your ip a cname record for domain-name.com often represented in a dns panel as pointing to www.domain-name.com optionally mx and spf txt records if you wish to use e-mail services on your domain server this is a whole separate subject to deal with especially spf records can be tricky additionally while this is not part of the question - please don t use wamp for public production servers

10538318
jar	manifest.mf
it might work to add class-path lib to the ejb jar manifest.mf but directory class paths are not required by the javaee spec so i do not know if they are supported by websphere application server
referencing the properties files directly in the manifest.mf class-path also doesn t work because only jars and directories are supported see above for javaee caveat regarding directories

10539473
nsmutablestring	nsstring
here s my solution which is similar to peter s or if you already have an nsmutablestring of course neither solution tackles cases where there isn t any
nsstring has plenty of methods to work with

10541470
vmware	virtualbox
images are also available for other virtualization products such as vmware parallels virtual pc and hyper-v ie6 xp image for virtualbox on windows about 764mb ie6 xp image for virtualbox on mac about 717mb ie6 xp image for virtualbox on linux about 771mb preparing the image for use virtualbox settings enable the network adapter but do not connect the vm to a real network
virtualbox settings create a read-only shared folder. this folder is going to be used to transfer data between the host os and the guest os

10542455
implements	extends
extends not properly implements but should be more than enough to explain
extends filestream or create a wrapper for it

10546007
realloc	malloc
also my suggestion is that instead of allocating memory fresh for each element you can allocate memory for constant size each time first allocate memory for 16 elements and then when you find that array is full when pushing an element realloc for 16 + 16 32 elements
in this way you can avoid calling malloc again and again and also it is not good idea to keep mallocing for small size data seperately

10546740
daemons	systemd
if normal threads are not running and remaining threads are daemons threads then the interpreter exits
for example the hotjava browser uses up to four daemons threads named image fetcher to fetch images from the file systemd or network for any thread that needs one

10547462
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined
you can call realloc only on an address that was returned to you by an prior memory allocation function like malloc or calloc otherwise it gives you undefined behavior

10548136
xslt	xquery
many apis don t define it either but invariably they return the nodes in the node-set in document order - not because xpath requires it but because xslt requires it and xslt has set the expectations for how xpath engines should behave
if you want node sequences with control over the ordering you will have to move to xpath 2.0 or xquery 1.0 which is a superset of xpath 2.0

10550490
google-chrome	firefox
this code works in firefox when opening new windows so hopefully it works in your case as well i hope my edits to the code for this answer didn t introduce any errors... just make sure you don t start looking for the new tab before google-chrome has had the chance to open it
as mentioned in my comment on your post i m not sure if the google-chrome driver handles tabs the same way as it handles windows

10550724
bellman-ford	dijkstra
so in bellman-ford when you arrive at a node you test to see if the new path is shorter
in contrast with dijkstra you can cull nodes in some most cases dijkstra will not explore all complete paths

10550899
client-side	server-side
so in your example it s changevattotal and not the id of the client-side html input element
this is why there s a request showing up in firebug with no effect on the xforms instance the server-side xforms engine doesn t find a xf input element with the id so it doesn t know what to do with that request

10556949
octal	decimal
leading 0 conventionally indicates a number written in octal notation instead of decimal
8 and 9 are not valid octal digits

10557037
interpolation	splines
this may not work if that s a deal-breaker for you. as an aside jason davies put together a nice little animation of curve interpolation
martin doms recently wrote a blog entry about splines and bezier curves that you might find useful

textview	imageview
if it is not null then re-use the ui elements textview imageview etc
to have all imageview elements visible use a global boolean such as showimageview which will be toggled by the button press

10558655
ubuntu	freebsd
this code works both on freebsd ubuntu and my windows computer given you have the correct headers also its been minified and some definitions removed suck as socket descriptor defs because those are pretty much - it is what it is
select is portable to win32 as well as unix though it isn t the recommended choice if you are doing any heavy lifting on sockets in unix ie freebsd

10559220
implements	extends
that s not to say you shouldn t explore new patterns but always rationalize whether the time and effort to implements and maintain them is justified
one thing to note here is that models are not supposed to extends from factories instead you would normally use the factories directly which in turn should return a model initialized

10560312
queue	fifo
nowhere to put them it still has unprocessed packets queue up
it s not a fifo

10561479
hex	binary
unless you do the equivalend of data.encode hex in java on the other side that won t work
it should give you an error if the string is not a valid hex-representation of a binary string

10564122
boost	allocator
perhaps boost serialize may be of some help here
the size of the vector will not influence the size of your struct since a vector allocates memory to hold objects on the heap with the default allocator at least

10564597
g++	gcc
difficult question to answer because you might have many different compilers on your system and it s really a question of which one you re using that said gcc g++ is a common compiler on unix-based systems and visual c++ is a common compiler on windows - there s a reasonable chance you ll be using one of those
if you re on a unix-based system and you want to find out if you ve got g++ say you can do which g++ to find out which version if you ve got it do g++ --version in terms of visual c++ hiding the console window when you re programming a windows gui it just doesn t show it if you ve set the subsystem to windows in your project settings

10566301
google-chrome	firefox
not being able to stop the beep is apparently a bug in google-chrome
return false works in firefox without a beep

10570954
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
update it doesn t work on opera mac opera on mac while in full screen mode hides only the common osx menu thus height differs only by few pixels which is too dangerous for me
i ve ended up with following solution which works in every browser i care about google-chrome firefox ie safari mac opera

10572670
ethernet	wireless
so for a layer 3 protocol you should not be concerned about 802.11 at all and write your code as if you were expecting it to run on ethernet network
to make it work you should first connect to a wireless network of some sort which is conceptually equal to plugging a wire into a ethernet card

10572775
junit	jmock
note that jmock has changed a lot in the version that goes with junit 4
i recommend using junit 4 and the latest jmock when writing new tests rather than investing time learning something that doesn t have a future path

10576127
apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
in theory you could build a pure-node web server that emulated the functionality of apache lighttpd nginx but i wouldn t recommend it
in fact for serious production services i d recommend always fronting your service with nginx or an equivalent see this and this

10577383
client-side	server-side
if the xml is compliant with the wsdl then the likely issue is that the client-side unmarshaller has been supplied with datatypes that are different than those presented in the wsdl
if the xml is not compliant with the wsdl the server-side xml marshaller is creating an incorrect message or it is creating a correct message and the wsdl is incorrect...it happens

10578718
google-chrome	firefox
webkit google-chrome safari does not support transitions on pseudo elements
it should work in firefox

10582144
codeigniter	yii
and if you are coming from yii codeigniter doesn t implement that feature of layout
edit by default codeigniter doesn t have

10583360
spaces	delimiter
note that i assumed all spaces were tabs in your input so if they are not my count may need to be tweaked
how the problem is best solved depends on how your data is delimiter

10584581
serializable	deserialization
if xml file doesn t exist then just start manipulating your objects and when you re done give the option to save serializable
i can help with the serialization deserialization process if needed

10584632
haskell	ocaml
one example is this haskell presentation of fibonacci you can also write that with tail and zip but this doesn t make the point clearer. see that you do not memoize a function but a list it is the list fibtable that does the memoization
you can write this in ocaml as well for example using the lazylist module of the batteries library however there is little interest in doing so as you have seen in the example above ocaml does not particularly favor call-by-need evaluation -- it s reasonable to use but not terribly convenient as it was forced to be in haskell

10584735
move	drag
in which case you might need the extra precision of handling all the touch events yourself - so when a touch starts you test against all the controls or groups to see which has the closest centre to your tap position and then as you get the touch move events you can update this centre position
i ve not made anything quite as complex as what you re describing but i did make an app where the user could drag small images onto a large image to apply as decorations

10590944
jsf	stripes
still jsf might have performance issues as compared to action-based frameworks like stripes which work more closely to http requests without building component model which is using more memory more network bandwidth
but for application which does not have to be extremely performant jsf 2.0 is a very good and rational choice

10593677
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
there are checked exceptions unchecked-exception runtimeexception and its subclasses and errors error and its subclasses
technically checked exceptions are all exceptions that aren t unchecked-exception or errors section 11.1.1 of the jls but mdash

10593816
gradle	ivy
you can edit the template for the web.xml to change the servlet mappings by running the grails install-templates command you can use ant maven or gradle to build a grails app but since is not the standard method my experience has been that some minor tweaking may be necessary
i have used the ant integration which uses ivy for dependencies to build and used gradle to wrap ant and modify the build for special requirements

10598653
sudo	passwd
to sum up i really don t recommend using php or any language for that matter to run a series of commands which then uses sudo
look at exec system etc obviously if you are going to use sudo for root access stuff not recommended then you would need to either supply a passwd somehow or set the user which php is running as to not require a passwd

10601050
setinterval	settimeout
cleartimeout is used to cancel a settimeout that has not yet happened or to stop an setinterval with clearinterval
a settimeout that has executed is done

10602150
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
if you have added your uinavigationbar by interfacebuilder and it s not added by uinavigationcontroller using self.navigationitem will get you nowhere
you have to add an iboutlet for your uinavigationbar - the same as you did with callhelp button

10602329
floating-point	fractions	base	fractions
this is because the inner representation of floating-point numbers is in base 2 so the fractions where the denominator is not a power of 2 cannot be represented with 100 precision
the same way as you cannot represent 1 3 as the decimal fractions with finite amount of decimal places. so the value of velocity is not exactly -0.07

10606997
postgresql	mysql
so either you need to use postgresql locally and change that adapter to postgresql or go the easier route and use sqlite locally and add that to the development group
note that heroku only uses postgresql so i would not suggest developing off of mysql since there are some inconsistencies in some syntax and how you do a couple of things between the two platforms

10607613
google-chrome	firefox
however firefox and internet explorer do not allow you to overwrite frames whereas google-chrome does
you are probably accidentally destroying or rewriting frames but only google-chrome is actually letting you do it

10608777
google-chrome	firefox
this can be pretty reliable on mac but far less reliable on windows for a number of reasons among which the fact that many windows users don t have java installed and that google-chrome blocks java applets by default without intervention by the user
other options include creating a cab file installer only works on ie creating a xpi firefox extension that packages the plugin requires restarting the browser only works on firefox creating a crx google-chrome extension that packages the plugin only works on google-chrome microsoft clickonce used to work pretty well for one click installs of msi files from a web page but recently i think it doesn t work on many if any browsers

10610198
move	drag
i also found if i reduced it to 2 ms of sleeping then i couldn t grab the scroll bar thumb and move it around
i think the problem here is that there is a mouse event in the event queue for the press and drag but between drag events new items are added to the list causing the thumb to move and since this happens more frequently than my drag events the thumb never goes where i want it to be

10611032
memcpy	realloc
use memcpy instead of strcat or strncat
there are many problems in the code but i ll tackle the big ones you re allocating memory and assuming it is ready for use you should consider the case where realloc has moved your data or when the call itself fails and data_aux isn t big enough upon successful completion with a size not equal to 0 realloc returns a pointer to the possibly moved allocated space

10612249
rvm	bundler
next check if your deploy.rb has require rvm capistrano require bundler capistrano this line is not needed anymore hope this will help
to avoide such problem you should have most recent versions of rvm currently it is 1.13.5 installed in both places locally and on remote server

10613344
uilabel	nsstring
in uilabel vertically text alignment is not possible
but you can dynamically change the height of the label using sizewithfont method of nsstring and just set its x and y as you want

10615534
clang	llvm
instead they distribute llvm-gcc and clang which are not gcc
you can see this with gcc -v like you did it shows llvm build

10619817
expression-blend	silverlight
for those who frighten away the moment they see references to blend and system.windows.interactivity you do not have to have expression-blend installed
you can download the blend sdk for .net 4 or silverlight

10620236
ubuntu	linux
on redhat it is etc sysconfig network and on ubuntu it is etc hostname
if not on linux glassfish requires you to set up the etc hosts file correctly and this is where most of my problems like this come from

10622999
haskell	ocaml
although i do not know the language you are using it seems like this because the code style is similar to a patter matching in haskell
pattern matching in ocaml needs to be done explicitly by using the match .

10623113
serializable	deserialization
in your example you only serializable the manager but not the os-thread which has no representation in java
after deserialization you have a second manager instance which no attached os-thread

10623200
inline	inlining
so what you re seeing isn t a comparison between a standard method call and a delegate invocation but a comparison between an inline operation and a delegate invocation
and that operation probably boils down to just a single machine instruction about as fast as you can get. make your execute methods a bit more complicated to prevent inlining and or do it with the methodimploptions.noinlining compiler hint

10623972
profiling	debugging
discussing this situation internally we re not sure that submitting the debugging build will pose too much of a problem so long as it was signed with the app store distribution profiling as you mentioned it was
the app will likely be slower as the debugging switches are turned on and optimizations are turned off for the debugging configuration though it will still run

10624616
serializable	deserialization
during serializable the objects instance variables are sucked out and converted to bytes and written on a file typically a file with .ser extension then during deserialization the bytes are read from the file and then converted to instance variables and are used to create new object identical to the one which was serializable
their constructor are never called so it reaches the state when it was serializable not when it was created

10625886
implements	extends
then you can create a custom log writer by extends the zend_log_writer_abstract class and implements the abstract methods to use your dynamodb adapter for writing the data
if zend framework doesn t support dynamodb then you will need to create a custom adapter that extends zend_db_adapter_abstract and implements all of the methods appropriately for dynamodb

10626562
imperative	declarative
it seems to me that you have not yet understood that sql is a declarative language not an imperative one
and yes there are stored procedures but these are a procedural extension to sql and don t alter the fact that sql is essentially declarative

10628922
octal	decimal
07 is a valid octal notation with decimal value of 7 and it is not less than 1
08 and 09 are prefixed with 0 but are not valid octal notation so a string comparison is made

10631297
inline	inlining
the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

10632339
moq	typemock
since you ll probably end up writing mocks stubs i suggest using existing mocking framework like moq or fakeiteasy
edit - if code is that tighly coupled your options are limited to refactoring this is obvious but with legacy system might not be possible worth the effort use paid tool like typemock isolator

10633193
udp	tcp
if you are thinking about connecting devices that are under the same wifi ap router and without setting up any server then i would suggest you to consider using udp multicast which has been available since api level 1 udp does not guarantee data delivery could be lost so i would use udp multicast for device discovery and open up a tcp connection for data that requires guaranteed delivery
tcp listening port can be advertised via udp multicast so that everyone can connect with each other over tcp

10635672
avassetexportsession	avassetreader
note that avassetexportsession doesn t give you much control over the file output it ll export audio into a m4a file
if you need more control over the type of output you ll need to use the avassetreader and avassetwriter classes to perform the export rather than the avassetexportsession

10636702
scheme	racket
if by standard scheme in the racket ide you mean the racket language what you get when you prefix your code with #lang racket then the top four differences to look out for are a different module system a different macro system depending on how old your code is immutable cons-cells unless you import mutable ones no one-armed ifs in racket use when to port code from guile to racket find out which files are at the bottom of your dependencies find the files that do not depend on other files. open such a file in racket add the line #lang racket at the top and try to run it
you will most likely encounter some unbound identifier errors. if you are lucky the function is present in racket but not included in the racket language

10640020
textview	imageview
the its a textview not a textfield and you have to make it change size dynamically
there s an imageview behind it that changes size as well

10641785
webkit	gecko
to paraphrase my write-up on escape sequences for css identifiers in theory as per the spec any character can be escaped based on its unicode code point for the u+1d306 tetragram for centre symbol 1d306 or 01d306 but older webkit browsers don t support this syntax for characters outside the bmp
because of browser bugs there is another non-standard way to escape these characters namely by breaking them up in utf-16 code units d834 df06 but this syntax rightfully isn t supported in gecko ++and opera 12 ++

10642059
opera	safari
some userscripts work on opera though and there are some older safari extensions that run some userscripts but i don t hear good things about them
there isn t a good compiler for converting userscripts into safari or opera extensions

10645541
equals	compareto
that class s compareto must return 0 to indicate that two artifact s are equals
treemap and this treeset doesn t use your equals method at all except if you fetch the entryset or keyset

10649018
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
realloc void ptr size_t new_size requires the given area of memory that ptr points to to be previously allocated by malloc calloc or realloc and not yet free with free otherwise the results are undefined
use realloc only with malloc calloc or another realloc and clean it up with free

10652410
google-chrome	firefox
to only target firefox with a padding without compromising ie and google-chrome use a browser specific hack for firefox and give it a padding-top
in ie and google-chrome the select tag text is aligned center automatically not in firefox

10654791
client-side	server-side
alternatively look at hooking the click event on the form submit button and perform client-side checking of the value then canceling the click if the value isn t valid
you ll still need to perform server-side validation of the value though because you cannot guarantee that users will have javascript enabled on their machine which means they d be able to submit invalid data

10661999
move	drag
so say its the computer s turn and it is taking a while to calculate the next best move
if meanwhile the human player tries to drag a chess piece on the gui the gui will inform the game class of the human s attempt to move the game class will check if it s the human s turn by checking and if it s not the human s turn game will inform the gui this and the gui will set the piece back to where it was and perhaps pop up a warning message

10661999
move	drag
if meanwhile the human player tries to drag a chess piece on the gui the gui will inform the game class of the human s attempt to move the game class will check if it s the human s turn by checking and if it s not the human s turn game will inform the gui this and the gui will set the piece back to where it was and perhaps pop up a warning message
after the computer has requested game to move its piece game will tell the gui to move the computer s piece and then game will set turn humanplayer now allowing the human player to move

10662225
mdpi	hdpi
android automatically scales resources up and down when they are not available at the device s native density xhdpi for the galaxy nexus docs and more docs so if you have an image that is only in the mdpi folder at 100x100 the system will automatically scale it up to 150x150 for hdpi and 200x200 for xhdpi
obviously you are going to lose quality here so you should provide images at multiple densities commonly hdpi and xhdpi

10662438
persistent	transient
using v2 of googles plugin there is a persistent property that allows merge of a transient object that has id fields set
transient means not persistent and not detached

10664156
lisp	scheme
historically due to the way namespaces works in lisp this problem is not that big a deal in lisp but it is possible to make mistakes
historically scheme and elisp both used the same macro expansion algorithm but then schemers started experimenting with other algorithms

10664303
prepare	execute
first you prepare the statement next bind the parameters finally execute the query get the results
you need to execute the query first as simply preparing the statement is not sufficient

10664506
prepare	execute
prepare does not execute the statement
you can use mysql query to execute the statement

10665914
realloc	malloc
for performance reasons it might be better to call it not for each new element but once in x elements so you reduce the number of calls to malloc realloc
you can do that by calling realloc

10668025
equals	gethashcode
and as henk said it is better to not override equals gethashcode at all.
it depends on the type it is implemented on but it should give good dispersion of values and it is not a must for gethashcode to return a unique values

10668170
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is more correct of course you could just embed isnull over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and coalesce may just win
if not use coalesce how do you want type casting handled

10669660
coalesce	isnull
here is a slight different example the plan for the coalesce version this time - again you can see the whole branch that represents the subquery repeated verbatim and again a much simpler plan doing roughly half the work using isnull you can also see this question over on dba.se for some more discussion my suggestion is this and you can see my reasons why in the tip and the above question trust but verify
i always use coalesce because it is ansi standard supports more than two arguments and doesn t do quite as wonky things with data type precedence unless i know i am using a subquery as one of the expressions which i don t recall ever doing outside of theoretical work like this or i am experiencing a real performance issue and just want to compare to see if coalesce vs

10669660
coalesce	isnull
i always use coalesce because it is ansi standard supports more than two arguments and doesn t do quite as wonky things with data type precedence unless i know i am using a subquery as one of the expressions which i don t recall ever doing outside of theoretical work like this or i am experiencing a real performance issue and just want to compare to see if coalesce vs
isnull has any substantial performance difference which outside of the subquery case i have yet to find

10674000
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure if this is what s happening in google-chrome but it certainly prevents the testcase from working in firefox
if i add it as here everything works at least in firefox it does anyway

10675121
super	implements
when it calls super things blow up this same sort of thing could happen for other methods as well if they call super and the diamond doesn t have to only appear at the root of the class hierarchy
i m not sure to what limitations the author of the python tutorial was referring but i would guess it has in part to do with the way that method attribute lookup is implements in python the method resolution order or mro

10675121
super	self
class b expecting the signature of a method from class a when it calls super instead gets a method from c which might not have that signature and might or might not not implements the desired behavior from class b s point of view
class a object def __init__ self foo print a

10677091
uiview	subviews
that said to set a custom class as the main view property of a view controller just select the view in the xib go to the identity inspector and change the class from uiview to your custom class
adding content to the view controller s view in the xib just involves adding subviews - these are not affected by drawrect

10678750
apache	nginx
i m not really familiar with nginx but consider the typical mod_php setup in apache
if you re using mod_php then you re using the prefork mpm for apache

10683454
implements	extends
if defaulttablemodel is not flexible enough for your requirements then do not hesitate to implements your tablemodel by extends abstracttablemodel
abstracttablemodel has only the following three abstract methods so it is really easy to implements a concrete tablemodel by extends abstracttablemodel

10684001
pthreads	fork
from the pthreads spec section you quote above
the reference to create handles using fork isn t elaborated on further in this section but the spec for fork adds a little detail the child process shall have its own copy of the parent s file descriptors

10688828
jpql	hql
entitymanager.createquery expects a query string in jpql not hql and not sql
jpql does not define a cast function

10689290
dbcontext	objectcontext
with dbcontext and dbset ef 4.1+ and ef 5.0 yes
with objectcontext and objectset no unless you wrap your first query to a property but it will allow only querying but not adding attaching or deleting

10690672
cpython	pypy
i m just guessing though you would need to follow why and how the same code is is not compiled on cpython
chances are pypy has some #defines different than cpython for good or bad reasons and pygame chooses to use something else based on a badly thought out #else with implicit assumptions that tries to compile invalid c

10690755
realloc	calloc
do not free ptr if realloc is successful
some folks may point out that in some esoteric systems calloc may not do what you expect specifically for pointer and floating point types

10691115
google-chrome	firefox
there is an oddity with google-chrome s text wrapping the line above sits over the image
it doesn t appear in firefox though

10692596
dictionary	map
and can generate sets as well as dictionary these are both roughly equivalent to the following
in python 3 map returns an iterator not a list

10698062
client-side	server-side
you cannot really do anything from the server-side to influence those table names - those names only exist on the client-side in your ado.net code
what you can do is on the client-side - add table mappings - something like this would rename the table first result set to workers and table1 second result set to orders before you actually fill the data

10698735
spaces	linefeed
in java it would be equivalent to which includes horizontal tab 09 linefeed 10 carriage return 13 form feed 12 backspace 08 spaces 32
if you want to specifically allow only spaces 32 you can further optimize the regex above by making the capturing group non-capturing with string.matches you are not going to be able to get the words individually anyway

10700117
layoutparams	viewgroup
your right the fragment does not have layoutparams because it is a conceptual container you either need to adjust the layout params of the inflated view in the fragment or to the container you attach the fragment to
the example assumes you are inflating a viewgroup

10702338
decimal	ieee
decimal cannot use the fpu
you get best performance with float or real which map to a standard ieee floating point number which is supported by the fpu

10703127
namenode	hdfs
hdfs intended for batch processing you re know when you running a query that will read many of your files one-by-one but really suck when you doing random access operations and it is pain in the neck to maintain it or even deploy you re know all of these zookepers namenode and so on
on the other hand gridfs is slower at batches but not in the case when you do a lot of random accesses but have a bigger storage overhead compared to hdfs

10703667
prepare	execute
prepare statements is a different concept altogether
you can prepare a query that can be execute multiple times and properly parameterized statements are sql-injection safe though maybe not proof

10703892
prepare	execute
the idea behind prepare statements is that you create placeholders for the parts of your sql statement that will not be known until run time
many learners start off by creating sql as a string which gets execute by calling mysqli query somequery

10706336
spaces	delimiter
first answer above does not work if parent directory name contains a spaces
the following works calling the above with parameter of c temp parent dir with spaces myfile.txt gives following the above works by replacing spaces with colons these should not exist in windows paths then replacing directory delimiter with spaces to so individual directories are passed to getparentdir as separate arguments

10707544
plone	buildout
re-run bin buildout or bin buildout on windows from the main plone directory on the command-line do not run from the bin directory as your current working directory
answering your other questions yes packages listed on pypi.python.org are eggs in the sense that you install them as eggs in buildout not classic products

10709967
prepare	execute
so execute doesn t execute a string of sql it execute a prepare statement that is identified by a name and you need to prepare the statement separately using prepare
from the fine manual synopsis description execute is used to execute a previously prepare statement

10710641
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
what happens is that if the click registers less than half of a character though greater than 0 pixels it is not visually selected however firefox and opera still select the node itself
trident ie and webkit google-chrome safari do not do this

10712345
gam	mgcv
using the example from survey regtermtest if we use the package gam gives the output while gives the error reported by the op
this will work if you use the library gam but not mgcv

10713324
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome you simply need to supply the protocol name of the host as a permission in your manifest.json
in firefox i think you may need to use components.classes to get a cross-domain requester as described in the mdn page for using xmlhttprequest but i m not 100 sure about that

10715145
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is because your nsstring property can be passed an nsstring instance or an nsmutablestring instance and therefore we can not really determine if the value being passed is an immutable or mutable object
if your property is being passed an nsstring instance the answer is no - copying is not less efficient than retain

10715879
bmp	png
reference here 1 to make pngbase64 from canvas. 2 to make bmp base64 from canvas
todataurl is not implememented in android 2.x so i have done some workaround involves creating a bmp base64 data and png base64 from canvas

10716961
dictionary	map
it could be rewritten as there doesn t seem to be any real point in doing it like this there s no benefit in having the dictionary which is called a map in the code contain the find function that i can see
this code simply inserts the function find_city into the cities dictionary using the key _find

10718199
google-chrome	firefox
what i know is that by default browsers dont save cookies for localhost so login does not work in google-chrome unless u explicitly set cookies for localhost in google-chrome
use firefox instead of google-chrome

10723350
vb.net	vb6
this is ony available in vb.net
unfortunately vb6 doesn t have the exit select clause available

10723565
equals	gethashcode
if you do the following edit from msdn if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values in other words if two objects have same hash code that doesn t mean that they are equals cause real equality is determined by equals

10723565
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values in other words if two objects have same hash code that doesn t mean that they are equals cause real equality is determined by equals
from msdn again the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

10723639
ssl	https
when you enabled https endpoint in any web application and bind ssl certificate to it the certificate bind to https endpoint is could be a single certificate or it could be a chain and it is depend on several factors as below when the certificate is created as self signed root then it will have only one certificate in the chain
this certificate can not be validated to have ssl tunnel because there is no other part to verify it and that why it is called self signed root when you buy certificate from a reputed ca certificate authority in almost all cases you will get 3 or more certificates 2.1

uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
rather than subclassing uinavigationbar to customize its interface just use its uiappearance methods and then create a uinavigationcontroller like normal
this may not be an answer to your question directly but it d probably prevent problems if you were using uinavigationcontroller as it was meant to be used

10726333
udp	tcp
so you could implement tcp algorithms on top of udp but you wouldn t want to
tcp s problems are in its algorithms not its headers

10726587
client-side	server-side
you are confusing server-side code and client-side code
javascript can t access a 2d array that s created on the server adding to you script tag will not give you access to your server-side variables

10727054
equals	compareto
if a and b are equals and c and b are equals then a and c should be equals that is not the case with your compareto function
you are defining what is to be the least element by defining the compareto

10727054
equals	compareto
a treeset is actually a tree-structure behind the scenes doh and which node in that tree it hits of two equals ones depend on the details of the implementation and possibly order of insertion
your compareto equals doesn t obey the normal recommended rules certainly bad for a tree trying to use them

10728297
gmail	hotmail
if a significant proportion of your users are on outlook gmail yahoo or hotmail and these typically add up to around 75 of email clients then a lot of bootstrap s goodness is not possible
mac mail ios mail and gmail on android are much better at rendering css so if you are targeting mostly mobile devices it s not quite so bad

10729759
factors	matrix
edit you could also factors the logic in onpaint that you use to build the world transform into a separate method that doesn t need a graphics object and returns a matrix which you can then use with graphics.multiplytransform or invert and use to modify your input coordinates
save the graphics object s world transform matrix graphics.transform invert it so it goes from page to world coordinates - i think that in this case page coordinates are equal to device coordinates but if not you ll have to do more work to account for the scaling and use it to transform your point before doing hit testing

10730545
build.gradle	gradlew
occasionally you ll need to adjust build.gradle to generate eclipse settings in some very specific way
there is gradlew support for eclipse if you are using sts but i m not sure how good it is

10733894
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
which version of safari ar you using jquery support about browser compatibility jquery actively supports these browsers firefox current - 1 version internet explorer 6+ safari current - 1 version opera current - 1 version google-chrome current - 1 version any problem with them should be considered and reported as a bug in jquery
there are known problems with mozilla firefox 1.0.x internet explorer 1.0-5.x safari 1.0-2.0.1 opera 1.0-9.x konqueror jquery generally works with konqueror and firefox 1.0.x but there may be some unexpected bugs since we do not test them as regularly

10735796
serializable	deserialization
examining the source code of android core classes reveals code like this from message class or this from intent class my suggestion in your code if there is no functional difference between zoom null and zoom 0 then i would just declare zoom as a primitive int instead of integer or initialize it to zero in the constructor and ensure that you never set it to null then you can be guaranteed that it will never be null and you won t have to add special code to deal with that in your serializable deserialization methods
most serializable code that i ve seen uses either flags to indicate the presence absence of a value or precedes the value with a count field for example when writing arrays where the count field is just set to zero if the value doesn t exist at all

10735879
strtol	atoi
so the structure noww looks like this next you need something that will read the structure from an input stream two things here i ve used strtol as a conversion function from string to int
atoi is used but strtol gives you slightly more flexibility and crucially better error cchecking alkthough i ve not bothered to implement it here

10738373
vim	emacs
i ll tell you how i d do this in vim so that maybe you can get an idea of the equivalent solution for emacs those two settings allow me to jump to the tags found in both projects
sorry i m not an emacs user

10738434
centos	linux
see the system requirements page for more information. and php.info shows the same # the remedy is to simply restart your apache server service httpd restart # credit to following for suggesting service httpd restart - # # # drupal 7 install on centos 5.4 worked after applying the above steps # if your mysql server is not running check by ps -ef | grep mysql then you can run etc init.d mysqld # ...to start it and to make sure it starts when the machine is restarted or cold booted chkconfig mysqld on
i have been successfully able to install php-5.3 on centos 5.4 linux

10739227
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt can not render xsl-fo tags
a typical xslt fo tempate lools like this notice that there is no reference to xml data

10739453
ember.js	sproutcore
since ember.js kinda evolved from sproutcore 2.0 it shouldn t be to much work to use the existing code
iv e ported the excellent example by johannes to ember.js and created a jsfiddle see

10740658
union	distinct
columns that are formed by using the set operators union union all crossjoin except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns being modified are not affected by group by having or distinct clauses

10746815
sudo	passwd
if you don t have a passwd you cannot use sudo in the default configuration
either give yourself a passwd or edit the sudoers file

10748647
viewdidload	viewwillappear
view setup should be done in viewdidload or in loadview if you re not using a nib for exactly the reason you re describing
if you need to know the controller s top-level view dimensions to set up the subviews then do it in viewwillappear

10752287
ubuntu	linux	daemons	systemd
the upstart init daemons used on ubuntu has its own specific features but unless you need to use them just keep it stop start minimal and it will probably work anywhere
not all linux systemd use the same init daemons ubuntu uses upstart but they all use start and stop functions in the script

10754274
uiview	subviews
you do not need to show that viewcontroller at all what you need is the uiview subclass zbarreaderview
you can show that as a subviews of any view controller root s view

10755160
spaces	delimiter
if you do not want spaces then amend the above formula to similarly if you want to concatenate with comma as a delimiter then use this and so on.
i think this would need some vba coding no you don t need vba for this put this formula in k1 and drag it down this will concatenate the data with spaces as a delimiter

10755329
bazaar	git
in cvs svn bazaar and no doubt a dozen other tools once a file is added that means it ll be included in the next commit
not so git

10761049
prepare	execute
indeed that statement could have been prepare only once per iteration of the first cursor and execute with different values on each iteration of the second cursor
i suspect your problem is that mysql does not support create view from within a prepare statement

10763261
google-chrome	firefox
here are a few benchmark stats webview version used was sourced from javafx 2.2 build 9 compliance running a html5 test to test html5 compliance scores out of 500 google-chrome 19 402 + 13 bonus points firefox 12 345 + 9 bonus points webview 2.2b9 296 + 7 bonus points ie 9.0.6 138 + 5 bonus points running an acid3 test webview scores 100 100 same as the other test browsers but like ie9 the final rendering has a slight imperfection

10763453
netbsd	minix
some of that is also out-of-date as -- in 3.2 -- minix adopted the netbsd bootloader
there is some documentation how netbsd boots but it s not a good as the site you re talking about

10764558
factors	matrix
you are correct that there is information regarding the scale factors of the image mebedded in the document
this is the current transformation matrix but it is not as simple as a single value or even a single matrix

10765139
implements	extends
your test class should not be extends thread but instead should be implements runnable
it works because thread implements runnable

10766632
svg	vml
so be sure if you want to keep it simple non-dynamic and things still aren t working to try putting the filter svg above the style even if this causes a flicker
first articles to read moving-to-standards-based-web-graphics-in-ie10 notice specifically the sections use svg not vml and use css3 not dx filters in that second section they mention dx filters are not the same as svg filter effects though both use the css property name filter

10767148
spaces	delimiter
once the spaces has been substituted back into the variable you cannot run it through any further make functions that work with spaces delimiter without the same behavior occurring
what is happening is that i m guessing somewhere else in the makefile there is a line that does something like the following when that happens addprefix treats any spaces in the incdirs variable as a seperator to the next variable and will add the -i there

10767827
uiview	subviews
uiview + uiscrollview your pdfscrollview +---------------------------------------+ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - uiview not a subviews - - +----------------------+ - - - label s - - - - - - - +----------------------+ - +---------------------------------------+
instead of subclassing the uiscrollview subclass a uiview and place a uiscrollview and uiview as subviews with the uiview not being a subviews of the scroll view

10768022
spaces	delimiter
i don t have a windows machine to verify this but i am pretty sure you cannot have spaces after the
delimiter

10770081
ssl	https
og report since your ssl is suspicious it seems the reason why it s not working
i have parsed two urls on the facebook og debugger. the report is this http request - no errors working fine https request - og image error error unable to download og image the image referenced by the url of og image tag could not be downloaded

10771413
portrait	landscape
name your ipad portrait launch image default-portrait.png do not use default.png as the ipad portrait launch image
meaning there is no portrait landscape etc.

10773527
n-gram	words
if kakasi fails to convert some of n-gram s entries it could be said that n-gram s better because its lexicon is richer -- enhancing the accuracy of the collation
however since the corpus of kanji-based words which need to be converted into kana to be collated properly is not finite - family names among others are a big problem as they can be read almost any way you can imagine - there can t be a solution that provides 100 coverage

10773736
freebsd	linux
i cite the source page the tool is believed to support linux freebsd macos x and windows cygwin environments since it isn t a real windows application you don t have any file windows can execute such as a .exe or .msi file
you need to use the tool and then more or less use it as an linux application

10775521
postgresql	mysql
take a look at this function at postgresql official documentation
you have to write a function to do that in postgresql since there isn t something similar to mysql s insert .

10776723
firefox	safari
note that firefox doesn t support .mp3 playback inside tags see why doesn #39
t firefox support the mp3 file format in audio thus this solution with your will give satisfying results in chrome only not tested on opera and safari

10777120
pascal	delphi
for a free ide you can try lazarus which uses the free pascal compiler and supports linux freebsd mac os x darwin win32 win64 and others
delphi xe2 supports native development for windows mac and ios this ide is not free but you can try the delphi xe2 starter edition which is very cheap

10777582
hex	binary
to convert a value to hex you need to separate out 4-bit chunks by shifting right and masking with 0x0f and indexing into an array of hexadecimal digits
assuming that this is a homework here s a couple of hints the value in the variable is not in decimal hex or any other system it is in whatever system that your hardware supports most likely it is binary

10778739
mp4	webm	h.264	webm
given that you should try this both of these methods will result in a loss of quality in your resulting videos as they are re-encoding the already encoded material and in my opinion even the webm codec is not nearly as good as a properly encoded mp4 using the h.264 codec
while the direct answer to your question would be like this i think you might find better results using the vp8 or webm codec as it will give you much better results and is actually preferred in modern versions of firefox

10778804
comparator	comparable
java s treeset similarly exposes a constructor that takes a comparator and others that don t
treeset s contract is essentially to throw a classcastexception if you try to insert an element that isn t a comparable if you didn t provide the treeset with a comparator when you created it

10780519
bazaar	git
it s bazaar annotate as it happens blame is a built-in alias for annotate
i m a git user not a bazaar user but since bazaar provides this alias for a common git command it s likely that bazaar some-git-command is a good way to find the bazaar equivalent of a given git command

10783921
operands	scalar
there are also causual ordering constraints the second call to cannot preced the first since it requires the results of the first as an argument. 5 4 c++03 states except where noted the order of evaluation of operands of individual operators and subexpressions of individual expressions and the order in which side effects take place is unspecified
between the previous and next sequence point a scalar object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression

10784847
apache	nginx
apache is not that good at proxying because it has to fork or start a new thread for each connection thus loosing all the benefit of node
further than that i wouldn t use apache at all if i needed to optimize things nginx is much better as a server it s even faster than node.js for serving static files for example

10787175
addition	modulo
in addition trove provides an more memory-efficient implementation for storing primitive values than standard java collections
if the array is not sparse and you really really do need the whole blob in memory you will probably have to use a two-dimensional structure with a map matching offsets modulo 1024 to the proper 1024-byte array

10788136
noexcept	throw
having to think about whether or not i need to append noexcept after every function declaration would greatly reduce programmer productivity and frankly would be a pain
well then use it when it s obvious that the function will never throw

10788461
noexcept	throw
as a programmer reading code the presence of noexcept is akin to that of const it helps me better grok what may or may not happen
therefore it is worthwhile spending some time thinking about whether or not you know if the function will throw

10788602
comm	grep
so that simply says either a match was found or echo if all you re wanting to do is see which items are in file1 and not in file2 use comm
assuming is an array you say list but i m assuming you meant array you can iterate through it like so if is a file then you can simply grep through it when egrep finds a match it returns true otherwise it returns false

10790610
udp	tcp
so i m not surprised that your setup works in lan as lan round trip times rtt are usually about 5 80 ms but fails over the internet where an rtt of 250 ms is normal. you can try to send your data less often and switch to udp which is non-ordered and unreliable but faster than tcp
i think udp is standard for voice video over the internet as you can compensate for the lost packets with a minor degradation of the voice video quality

10791599
serializable	deserialization
this looks likely to change in 9.4 you seem to want to store a pre-parsed form that s a serializable representation of how v8 represents the json in memory and that s not currently supported
it s not even clear that v8 offers any kind of binary serialisation deserialization of json structures

10791599
serializable	deserialization
you can t write a data structure that involves any kind of graph of pointers out to disk directly it has to be serializable
this serialisation and deserialization has a cost and it might not even be much faster than parsing the json text representation

10792295
qthread	qobject
you must implement all the threaded code that interacts with the model via events not by reimplementing qthread run but within a qobject
after you instantiate the qobject simply move it to a separate thread

10792815
onclick	onchange
to trap arrow presses bind to the onclick event
on the input fields bind to the onkeypress rather than the onchange event because the onchange event isn t called until the control loses focus

10793295
email	dkim
your from address is gmail.com and you are not sending email from gmail server but from another server
using domainkeys identified mail dkim and sender policy framework spf it is now possible and most sysadmins do specify authorized email sending servers for that domain in the domain s dns records

10797771
aggregate-functions	sum
you will surely got the error because an aggregate-functions cannot perform on an expression containing an aggregate or a subquery
i would like to know what your expected result in this sql select sum count id as count from table when you use the count function only 1 result total count will be return

10798893
queue	fifo
dispatch queue are fifo data structures that run tasks asynchronously
in contrary to run loops a dispatch queue isn t tied to a particular thread the working threads are automatically created and terminated as and when required

10800833
agda	ats
agda is not designed to be a general-purpose programming language
ats is a dependently-typed language that is designed for low-level programming though it s somewhat less elegant than agda

10800939
hex	binary
the key you have is almost certainly a bunch of hex values and not ascii characters
you are doing which treats it like any other string and converts it to its binary ascii bytes

10801252
primefaces	richfaces
standard jsf and primefaces does not support request based el evaluation in attributes
richfaces is the only who supports that

10803241
innodb	myisam
and yes using innodb makes a difference
if you were using for instance myisam you wouldn t have transactions at all so any change will be permanent similarly to autocommit true

10803731
factors	mean
and space o 1 using itertools as the op is demo this is more efficient by a factors of factorial n
assuming you were using it for lengths larger than 2. alternatively we can combine them in the opposite order and map list onto the tuples if you d like edit in response to op edit i need to find the minimum number of permutations that give all possible couples of numbers --op i m not sure what this mean but based on how you ve phrased it you almost certainly don t need to do any of this

10803988
profiling	debugging	profiling	instrumentation
go to edit scheme window - select profiling app - change build configuration to debugging
try using configuration that doesn t strip debugging symbols as this seems to help in most cases when you have any problems using instrumentation

10806211
firefox	safari
you would have to view your mobile site from a desktop browser but this can be done in firefox by changing the useragent to match that of a mobile device ipod android etc. if you plan on using webkit on your site firefox is not a great choice as it does not render webkit css styles
an alternative is to use safari and its development tools which can be activated in the options menu

10806892
super	self	super	implements
you ll notice that it calls super init you have an additional custom init but only takes one parameter
notice that it calls self not super finally override the classes default initializer as specified in documentation to summarize you may implements as many custom initializers as you d like in your subclass

10806892
super	self	super	implements
notice that it calls self not super finally override the classes default initializer as specified in documentation to summarize you may implements as many custom initializers as you d like in your subclass
one initializer should be deemed your designated initializer and only this method should implements super init where init is the designated initializer of the superclass which may not be init

10807365
equals	gethashcode
to function correctly gethashcode needs to return the same results for all objects that return true for equals t
the reverse is not necessarily true - gethashcode can return collisions for objects that are not equal

10809135
xuggle	vlcj
i heard xuggle is fine but i really couldn t get it to work after trying hard for a few days so i would recommend vlcj which works great and its really easy to set up
the libraries used in vlcj are included in videolan s folders when installing vlc

10809952
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome you can request keyboard support by calling the method with a flag docelm.webkitrequestfullscreen element.allow_keyboard_input
this does not work in safari and the method won t be called

10810040
udp	tcp
udp does not so the receiver needs to check them if the order matters
if a tcp packet is lost the sender can tell

10810392
scheme	racket
that is scheme readers produce the same output for these two forms and the resulting file should work fine as scheme input
if this were my code i think i wouldn t do the define v1 ... dance and just write the thing out as a big piece of data that a scheme racket program can slurp in with a single read but that s your choice not mine

10811585
express	node.js
derby doesn t control your server and it works on top of any normal express server
you should probably stick with node.js code as much as possible and not use rails along with derby

10813695
uiview	subviews
the ui components you re talking about are all subviews of the uiview that is owned by the uiviewcontroller that you re creating
but that uiview and its subviews aren t actually created at the time the init method is called so you can t change them there

10814278
ssl	https
for the same reason as you should use a host name verifier that always returns true you shouldn t use trust managers that don t do anything as you ll see a number of examples around offering a quick fix for some ssl error messages.
when you make a connection to an https uri with java it uses the java secure socket extension jsse unless you really want to use a custom implementation of ssl tls but that s very rare

10818532
jpql	hql
there are some features of jpql that hibernate doesn t implement yet also
hql is a superset of eql or jpql

10827661
mef	prism
if you want to use mef container in your module anyway for example because you re not very familiar with di paradigm or you have some very specific tasks you can try something like don t forget to register your mef container itself in your boostrapper
i think it corresponds not to prism or mef but to dependency injection principle and best practices in general

10827661
mef	prism
yeah i knot that mef isn t di container but here it s used almost as di container so i suppose to use the same practices here
in best practices of di this book is very cool i highly recommend it it s good to have such steps in di workflow register all necessary types in prism - by bootstrapper.configurecatalog method resolve root object with all nested objects

10828487
connect	geddy
geddy is not better than connect express the big thing that differs is the structure of it
like josh3736 said in his comment geddy makes a lot of assumptions about how you want to build your app like rails which may or may not be a good thing

10828675
prepare	execute
optimizer improve the ability of the planner to choose parameterized plans tom lane a prepare statement is now parsed analyzed and rewritten but not necessarily planned
when the prepare plan is execute with parameters the planner might replan it for every constant or it might execute a generic plan if its cost is close to that of a constant-specific plan

10831330
ssl	https
now all you need to ensure is that your piwik installation resides somewhere that has a valid ssl certificate
all resources such as the requests to piwik of the site requested through https have to go through the very same protocol since otherwise you will receive varying warning messages from different browsers along the lines of your connection to xyz is encrypted however it contains resources that are not secure ...

10834128
grouplayout	miglayout
it might be better done using a more powerful layout such as miglayout or more modern j2se layout such as boxlayout or grouplayout
grouplayout can provide the type of alignment this ui needs while not stretching the center fields to the same width which is also fixable in a nested layout as above but requires 2 more constraining panels

10835738
xslt	xquery
this moving of documents relies on information studio specific properties which get assigned automatically to the result of the main xslt output but not to any secondary output coming from xslt result-document calls
it is possible to replace the xslt step with an xquery step that explicitly copies these properties to all results but that makes it depend on that specific version of information studio

10835937
serializable	deserialization
from what i understand you want deserialization to understand upper_case but you want to serializable in lower_case
add a mixin in the deserialization config but not in the serialization config as such however you can t do that with jackson 2.x mixins are shared by the serialization and deserialization config

10836343
lxml	elementtree
anyway you can use lxml and the following xpath expression the result will be a element
afaik elementtree does not support xpath

10839370
qthread	qobject
a qthread is conceptually a thread controller not a thread itself
in most cases you should deal with qobject

10839789
qthread	qobject
well a qthread is a qobject but you really should not derive from a qthread
do not derive from qthread and you ll be fine

10840109
ciimage	uiimage
the reason why ciimage s -createcgimage fromrect is so slow is that this is what actually triggers the processing and output of the raster bitmap
assigning the output ciimage to a uiimage does not cause the image to be processed and output rendered

10842236
spaces	delimiter
from on sgml and html white spaces is not permitted between the markup declaration open delimiter
and the comment open delimiter -- but is permitted between the comment close delimiter -- and the markup declaration close delimiter

10842789
spaces	delimiter
see bashfaq 105 additionally in order to preserve spaces tabs and newlines and not concatenate to mush you must quote the variable that you echo
when you use a null string as the delimiter for read it essentially never sees the delimiter and encounters end-of-file so it sets the return status to 1

10843642
portrait	landscape
it turns out that it s not the split view controller per se or the tab bar controller for that matter that s causing the portrait landscape mixup
basically if a uiwebview is taller than it is wide the os considers it in portrait mode and if it s wider than it is tall the os considers it in landscape mode

10844310
google-chrome	firefox
firefox a lot of the times has more informative error messages than google-chrome error syntaxerror json.parse unexpected non-whitespace character after json data good luck
not sure if this will help you but i was getting the same error in google-chrome and it was because of a 0 that trailed my json data the 0 trailed the json data because i forgot to add an exit

10845959
strcpy	strncpy
using strncpy 3 is better than strcpy 3 but things like strlcpy 3 are better still
the original problem is obviously that strcpy 3 was not a memory-safe operation so an attacker could supply a string longer than the buffer which would overwrite code on the stack and if carefully arranged could execute arbitrary code from the attacker

10845959
strcpy	strncpy
the original problem is obviously that strcpy 3 was not a memory-safe operation so an attacker could supply a string longer than the buffer which would overwrite code on the stack and if carefully arranged could execute arbitrary code from the attacker
but strncpy 3 has another problem in that it doesn t supply null termination in every case at the destination

10846534
portrait	landscape
i am currently working on a portrait orientation only app
i have not found a way to launch the app with the landscape launch image shown

10847517
qthread	qobject
you should not derive from qthread
implement everything on a class derived from qobject

10851378
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
edit tested with an image that could not be loaded this had the proper effect in google-chrome and ie even ie7 but not in firefox or opera
however even in firefox and opera the effect was better than if the width and height attributes were left out because the width attribute still had an effect even though the height attribute didn t

10851952
union	distinct
use a union - one query for each half select distinct substring vendor 1 locate - vendor from feed_data where vendor like - union select distinct vendor from feed_data where vendor not like -
or use if select distinct if vendor like - substring vendor 1 locate - vendor vendor from feed_data

alternately you can set the contrasts for a particular factors ahead of time
i m still not at all sure this is a good idea i think the possibility of getting confused about what the contrasts mean is too high

10857237
onclick	onfocus
on ios 4 this does not trigger the onclick handler and hence gives the user a regular input
using onfocus to trigger the plugin seemed to work better

10858592
inline	inlining
member functions defined within the class definition are implicitly inline but that does not mean that they are inline the code need not be inline at the place of call
compiler implementors have dedicated quite a bit of time and resources to come up with heuristics that determine whether actual inlining should be done or not based on the size of the function the complexity and whether it can be inline at all or not a recursive function cannot be inline

10858889
operands	scalar
if you ask me it totally sucks that there isn t a vbroadcast with a register operands
in case you don t want to use a temporary memory location just for broadcasting a value across all of the register s locations you may consider doing something like that shufps xmm0 xmm0 0 vinsertf128 ymm0 ymm0 xmm0 1 it is assumed that xmm0 contains the scalar value in the lowest dword of the register at the beginning

10859898
datamapper	activerecord
i ve used datamapper which prefers composition with success in the past but it isn t as feature-packed as activerecord and may not offer what you need
while i personally also prefer composition over inheritance activerecord does not

10862395
gradle	ivy
essentially all you have to do it doesn t look like it possible at the moment to generate the ivy.xml through gradle but once you have your pom file you could use ivy itself to generate the ivy file described here
here s the gradle docs that tells you how to generate the pom

10863228
pdfbox	itext
perhaps such a wrapper is available in pdfbox in the meantime
as far as i know this is not possible with itext at least some time ago while i searched for a similar issue

10864646
realloc	malloc
also i should note that in same cases you don t have to do a copy even when realloc increases the size for example if the next block in the heap is free
malloc does not initialize memory to zero

10867294
inline	inlining
but you don t need to defined the function inside the class for it to be inline you can explicitly request it the inline keyword on the other hand does not mean that the function will be inline but rather that it can be defined in multiple translation units that is if multiple translation units include the same header that contains that definition the linker will not fail with a multiple definition error
now on actual inlining the compiler can decide to inline or not any function regardless of whether the function is declared as inline provided that it sees the definition of that function the code that it will inline which is the reason why in general functions that are meant to be inline should be defined in the header either inside the class definition or marked inline outside

10867294
inline	inlining
now on actual inlining the compiler can decide to inline or not any function regardless of whether the function is declared as inline provided that it sees the definition of that function the code that it will inline which is the reason why in general functions that are meant to be inline should be defined in the header either inside the class definition or marked inline outside
additionally newer toolchains can perform whole program optimization or other link time optimizations by which the linker can also decide that a function should be inline

10867344
super	self
maybe you should change that line to something like super addnewfamilymemberform self .clean_password
super is not actually an object and you can not do super.method

10871077
prng	random
proposal when in need of strong random numbers it is not uncommon to combine one or more sources of real entropy with a strong prng using the entropy gathered to re- seed the prng each time new entropy is available
the prng can be used to generate much more basically unpredictable data than the entropy source would actually provide in the same time

10871077
prng	random
edit the prng approach may not be the best choice for cryptographic key generation
for that one should only use truly random bits to produce a secure key

10874082
innodb	myisam
for example innodb will refuse to initialize if the innodb_log_file_size setting doesn t match the size of the log files ib_logfile0 ib_logfile1 ...
sounds like innodb is disabled on the second machine so mysql silently falls back to myisam which has different limitations 1000 bytes per key instead of 3500 the last time i saw something like this it was because of a configuration problem mysql can t setup innodb on startup so it disables innodb

10874863
super	self
self message will start looking for methods in the class of the receiver super message will start searching in the superclass of the class defining the method that contains the super message expression so the class of the receiver isn t relevant in this case
in your second example super new and self new end up calling the same method defined somewhere in the behavior hierarchy because that s the closest method definition of new in both cases

10875232
implements	extends
structure implementation how to implements a discovery proxy how to implements a discoverable service that registers with the discovery proxy how to implements a client application that uses the discovery proxy to find a service topology start discovery service structure backbone start service s every service will announce its startup to the discovery service start client s every client will discover find resolve services endpoints from the discovery service notes discovery process uses udp check your firewall it can block connections services must announce their startup thus self-hosted services is ok but iis-hosted 5 6 ones is not because they started automatically when 1st invoke happends
solving iis-hosted 5 6 issue by extends hosting using servicehostfactory so that you can start your iis-hosted 5 6 services manually without being invoked for the first time you can also use wcf routing service

10879560
config	ini
config can be managed by end user who do not understand programming languages
it makes more sense to factor out config and use a simple ini file which uses simple key-value pairs for config parameters

10881509
vb.net	vb6
which is pretty common in vb.net there are a lot of old vb6 declarations floating around on the internet that will not work in vb.net
a sure sign of trouble is this particular function it takes two arguments of type dword if you see long in the declaration then you ve got a bad vb6 one

10882657
sudo	passwd
you can use visudo to edit the sudoers file and allow users to run a command using sudo without using a passwd
it s not a good idea to store passwd in plain text in a script

10882919
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome extensions are multiple zipped-up files which do not have these limitations
as for your second question i suggest you to read how can i mimic greasemonkey firefox #39

10883340
implements	extends
after some trial and error and looking at the error messages i came up with this which compiles i m not sure whether it will allow you to implements what you need
type that just extends resource like for directory

10885783
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode documentation states implementations are required to ensure that if the equals method returns true for two objects x and y then the value returned by the gethashcode method for x must equals the value returned for y
however you are perfectly free to return the same hash code for two objects which are not equals as well

10887757
opera	firefox
here s what i discovered jsonp produces ugly flashes on the screen with firefox and does not work nice with opera
so xhr is better for older firefox versions and for opera

10890788
move	drag
in this case you will likely want to do the following in the mousedown begin an nstimer set for an appropriate guard time not so long that people will accidentally move the pointer and not so short that you ll trigger before the user drag in order to call you back later to trigger the popover
in the mousedragged use a guard area to make sure that if the user just twitches a little it doesn t count as a drag

10891741
portrait	landscape
portrait image needs to be 768x1004 note 1004 not 1024 20px is for status bar png is the preferred file format
landscape image needs to be 1024x748 note 748 again 20px for status bar

10896487
fileoutputstream	filewriter
if you cannot open a file using new fileoutputstream file then you shouldn t be able to open it with new filewriter file
because the source code for the constructor is this in other words the first thing that the filewriter constructor does is to call the fileoutputstream constructor that you say doesn t work

10896576
client-side	server-side
supports multiple web servers with client-side state management you can distribute incoming requests across multiple web servers with no changes to your application because the client provides all the information the web server needs to process the request
with server-side state management if a client switches servers in the middle of the session the new server does not necessarily have access to the client s state information

10897376
onclick	onfocus	onfocus	onblur
see it in action you have some button event listeners register them via on.pausable node event callback instead of on gather handlers into an array add onblur event listener add onfocus event listener to resume button event listeners please note that handler.pause is pausing an onclick listener not an event
the onclick event is waiting in the event queue and therefore is not accessible in the execution time of onblur

10897752
ecdsa	rsa
the problems the ssh-keygen utility usually defaults to generating rsa keys but your implementation may default to ecdsa which github does not currently support
if you are truly generating rsa keys you may be trying to paste your private key to the server instead of your public key

10902441
mathml	mathjax
either mathjax isn t actually running so the native mathml support is being used instead or you have mathjax configured to use nativemml instead
you could add something like somewhere before your script that loads mathjax to see if mathjax is actually running

10903423
vbscript	vba
i m not fluent in vba vbscript but my guess is that s where it goes wrong if you want to discuss the regex some further that s fine with me
i m not eager to start digging into this vbscript api which looks arcane

10905123
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
if you find there are too many things left out by backbone.js then go and search for them in the other frameworks and choose the one is nearest your needs
and if you are still not confident in the choice maybe backbone.js is not for you and you have to look some other solution ember.js sproutcore extjs javascriptmvc are all good

10905510
spaces	delimiter
comma spaces de-limited columns in csv files can be easily handled
not that i am specific you can have any delimiter and r has powerful regular expression matching

10907288
noexcept	throw
you have used the noexcept specificatiom together with the noexcept operator
returns true as comparing two integers does not throw and you are using that true as the argument to the noexcept specification telling the compiler your function never throw

10907288
noexcept	throw
returns true as comparing two integers does not throw and you are using that true as the argument to the noexcept specification telling the compiler your function never throw
the declaration says this function does not throw as long as does not throw which is always the case for an int

10909888
apache	nginx
for example bind apache to 127.0.0.1 81 bind nginx to 0.0.0.0 80 make nginx proxy domains that apache should serve it s not a direct answer to your question but that s imho the best solution best performance best protection for apache allows to migrate apache websites to nginx step by step uwsgi supports php now ... again for best performance and security
i recommend that you put apache behind nginx

10910978
boost	stl
use a better pointer std unique_ptr from the c++11 standard i would still advise boost ptr_vector even if you have access to c++11 because it provides additional guarantees null not allowed by default and sugar coating dereferencing an iterator gives a reference not a pointer than you have to dereference once more
lateral thinking you do not actually need a shared_ptr here what you want is a stl -like collection in which to store polymorphic values

10912509
base	fractions
i believe the problem lies in value base
do not forget that 10 is not a finite fractions in binary system and thus this calculation is never correct

10913020
comparator	comparable
more importantly it is strongly recommended that comparator and equals be consistent as explained in the comparator javadoc it is strongly recommended but not strictly required that x.compareto y 0 x.equals y
generally speaking any class that implements the comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact

10916506
udp	tcp
both of them involve a process setting up a listening socket and the other sending a message udp or performing a connection attempt tcp to said listening server
your idea of doing udp messages before establishing the connection doesn t really change anything

10917062
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals function as well
overriding gethashcode is not enough

10919953
ubuntu	linux
ffmpeg from ubuntu 10.04 does not appear to support filters so you will have to get a more recent version
you can follow a step-by-step guide to compile ffmpeg on ubuntu or you can simply download a linux build of ffmpeg

10921802
onclick	onchange
instead i suggest you add your onclick in the code behind either in your page_load or page_prerender
it looks like your bracket is in the wrong place in your onchange you re only passing one parameter and not the client id

10922300
decimal	ieee
in a limited number of decimal digits for instance
well the classic example is ieee 754 double-precision floating-point numbers which is what javascript uses are very very good but they re not perfect

10923542
client-side	server-side
client-side javascript is run by the user s browser
it isn t interpreted server-side like php is

10925248
profiling	benchmarking
note i haven t tried to understand the algorithm to figure out if contention is likely in your example. my initial advice would be to profiling your code and see if that offers any insights
and take a look at the way you are measuring performance to make sure that you aren t just seeing some benchmarking artefact

10925807
jar	war
packaging dependant jars as a folder of artifact project s jar
defining the maven war plugin jar itself as a dependency for maven war plugin - this is not required at all

10925807
jar	war
defining the maven war plugin jar itself as a dependency for maven war plugin - this is not required at all
war manifest goal in the maven war plugin configuration

10925888
profiling	debugging
only fully optimized binaries whose profiling data was collected from the same build would ever be released
i m not an expert but from what i understand mpgo guidance data uses method signatures like used by debugging symbols and file offsets which aren t stable between builds

10927326
client-side	server-side
javascript client-side script can react to user input and events
with php alone you can t because it is a server-side script and so when the page reaches the client it cannot be edited via php

10928201
fossil	git
while i am a die-hard git aficionado for this particular case i would rather recomment fossil with its fossil server or fossil winserv modes or mercurial with its hg serve mode
also note that while cen pointed you to the right question i also voted to close this answer as exact duplicate if by social coding you mean something like code sprint where a group of people sits on a lan you might as well not mess with setting up complicated schemes as git is able to access repos on windows machines via shares using the file schema

10928259
serializable	deserialization
as long as you re using json or xml added fields shouldn t be a problem as long as no specific version schemas are enforced the default .net xml serializable for instance doesn t include fields that have their default value which can be set with the system.component.defaultvalue attribute
so the new fields will be treated the same as the omitted fields while deserializing and get their default values default class values that is the defaultvalue attribute only applies to serialization designer behaviour . removed fields depends on your deserialization implementation but can be made so that those are ignored

10933323
operands	scalar
that is if the left operands is true the right operands is not even evaluated
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

10933694
allocator	stl
if you manipulate a const object as you say read only access created in one dll in another dll then it doesn t involve c++ allocator so it should be safe
if you modify an stl container delete or add new element to it it usually involves allocating deallocating memory

10934734
acs	adfs
in short acs is not a could version of ad adfs
you shouldn t use acs as an identity provider

10934734
acs	adfs
acs offers a nice rules engine that was designed for normalizing incoming claim types from various identity providers or for simple authorization policy such as generating role claims
but acs capabilities here should not be confused with fully powered directory authentication and authorization solutions such as ad and adfs

10936786
ssl	https
short answer is use https by creating your own ssl certificate
even gmail did not have an option to use https all the time until 2008

10937757
persistent	transient
they are part of your core data model but not persistent
in this case transient properties are commonly used

10939892
google-chrome	firefox
edit does not work in google-chrome works in firefox
the problem is in the fill atributte this.style.fill google-chrome change white by #ffffff

10940805
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
it makes sense to multiplying a duration by a dimensionless number but only rarely to multiplying together two durations and when you do the result is not a duration since its units are seconds-squared
short version there are mathematical structures which have addition but not multiplication so don t worry about it

10941625
ssl	https
a common use of this is to support ssl and non-ssl clients on different ports such as for protocols like pop3 and smtp which support implicit and explicit ssl tls on different ports
tidhttpserver does this for supporting http and https urls on a single server you can use the tidhttpserver.onquerysslport to customize which ports use ssl tls versus not

10942806
centos	linux
11.2.0.x.0 where x 3 is not supported by rhel 6.x or centos 6.x or oracle linux 6.x
also make sure you re running 64-bit linux

10947289
implements	extends
technically the abstract class could implements all methods but that wouldn t make for a good example
the intention is that extends classes will implements the abstracted methods

10949133
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to be much more aggressive with the report submission which will make it a bit easier to test
from my experience firefox does not always send csp report at all - it may be using some kind of heuristic to not send repeated messages

10949223
mef	prism
you can easily use unity or mef but this is not truly di container without prism
prism just provide some integration of everything

10949916
jar	manifest.mf
the zipgroupfileset is a task that will take a list of jar files expand them and include the classes themselves into the target jar
i filter out manifest.mf and properties files so they do not collide with my own such as a log4j.properties file in a library jar

10949916
jar	manifest.mf
i filter out manifest.mf and properties files so they do not collide with my own such as a log4j.properties file in a library jar
this creates a single jar with all contents of all lib jars

10952466
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to do this with jquery and setting the async property to false the above code is working for me in ie9 google-chrome 19.0.1084.52 m and firefox 12
i was having the same problem where google-chrome was not sending the ajax request to the server in the window.unload event

10952480
implements	extends
so the routine would look something like however i am not sure the expense of performing these operations on your big integer objects is worth implements to replace the simple loop shown above
unless you expect to extends the function and would require a much longer loop. to be faster than the loop the big integer square root implementation would have to always converge within 4 iterations to beat the average expected 4.5 iterations of the existing while loop

10953546
listview	gridview
see msdn represents a view mode that displays data items in columns for a listview control
afaik gridview has columns listview does not

10954527
express	node.js
btw even though express calls itself high performance they re naughty for not posting measurements
express is a convenience wrapper around node.js and should not add much latency to your server

10955685
quicksort	mergesort
parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place
if not using the in-place then the space complexity for quicksort is o n which is the same are mergesort

10955685
quicksort	mergesort
if not using the in-place then the space complexity for quicksort is o n which is the same are mergesort
so to generalize quicksort is probably more effective for datasets that fit in memory

10955685
quicksort	mergesort
the other general time to use mergesort over quicksort is if the data is very similar that is not close to being uniform
quicksort relies on using a pivot

10955979
wordpress	joomla
all three have an enormous base of available plugins but i am the type that likes to create my own plugins and wordpress proved easiest for me to work with
i had difficulty comprehending the backend knowledge of joomla but i am only a newbie programmer and i did not really do any plugin development with drupal so i cant comment on that

10955981
udp	tcp
with udp that is not an issue because it is stateless
a similar problem took out bitbucket in january although it was syslog protocol rather than snmp--basically they were inadvertently using syslog over tcp due to a configuration error the syslog server went down and all of the servers locked up waiting for the syslog server to ack their packets

10956700
floating-point	fractions
for the simple cases like 0.1 that is not representable as a fixed-length floating-point number no matter what the number of bits available
this is the same as saying that a fractions such as 1 7 cannot be represented exactly in decimal regardless of the number of digits you are allowed to use as long as the number of digits is finite

10957322
inline	inlining
there s more information on inlining of methodbase.getcurrentmethod on this thread paraphrasing heavily it states that the refcrawlmark does not stop the calling method being inline
however requiresecobject does have the side affect of stopping the caller being inline

10957580
postgresql	mysql
other databases such as postgresql allow you to index an expression which would effectively allow you to index reverse col_name without creating the extra column
so it it s possible just not with mysql right now

10957615
libstdc++	libc++
looks like it s just not in libstdc++ yet
it s also not in libc++ vs11 beta has it

10960546
awt	swing
awt is outdated
swing is outdated maybe less so but not much work has been done on swing for the past 10 years

10962428
bufferedreader	printwriter
try this do not use bufferedreader with printwriter ...
printwriter is itself the bridge between byte level socket data and character form

10963921
implements	extends
for example if you create an applet then it must extends applet class so here the only way to create thread is by implements runnable interface
java does not support multiple inheritence so if you extends thread class then no other class will be extended

10964922
client-side	server-side
client-side should only be used to supplement and not replace server-side validation
you must perform server-side validation too

10967108
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
websockets work with google-chrome firefox opera but not ie but you can use a lib that fixes things to use flash if ie is that important
there s such an example for aleph the only thing you need to do wrt closure s websocket object is change the constructor for the wrapped socket to whatever firefox s websocket is for firefox can t remember what it is but it s not websocket or at least that s what you used to have to do but it works with google-chrome anyway

10970412
multiplying	modulo
use long s for the product - this will be enough to hold the result of multiplying two integers
you also will want to compute the modulo on each iteration so that you avoid overflow this is safe to do from a mathematical perspective as it doesn t change the result modulo 1000007 at the end

10972953
memcached	apc
be sure to not cache whole pages that fills the cache pretty fast instead use memcached for the wordpress object cache
for generall performance make sure to have a recent php version 5.3+ and have apc installed

10973348
decoder	encoder
run with different input strings which require different padding you can check the base64 strings with this online-encoder decoder
unfortunately the combination of the two iterator_adaptors binary_from_base64 and transform_width is not a complete base64 encoder decoder

10975030
hex	binary
if you want to represent non text binary data bytes which aren t the direct result of encoding text in a string you should use something like base64 or hex
when you want to encode a string as binary data to write some text to disk you should carefully consider which encoding to use

10977020
client-side	server-side
since you are using it in javascript client-side you should do this instead render .setuser document.getelementbyid textbox1 .value .start
i am not a .net guy but using textbox1.text is supposed to be for the server-side code eg asp.net

10980823
uiview	uiwindow
window is a property on uiview
window the receiver s window object or nil if it has none. read-only property nonatomic readonly uiwindow window discussion this property is nil if the view has not yet been added to a window

10982351
vsto	add-in
vsto comes with project types that build the deployment manifest required for detecting dependencies and loading your add-in at runtime
the pias provide managed access to the com object-model but it also supports unmanaged access should you want more control over how your solution is loaded hence you always have vsto runtime but not always pias

10982466
metaphone	soundex
there are also metaphone and several other similar algorithms that might work
there s a previous question about soundex with python here soundex algorithm in python homework help request the hardest part is probably finding a good dictionary but i ve had luck with this search qs n form qbre pq download+word+list sc 8-18 sp -1 sk no matter what you do it s not going to be perfect

10986494
trie	tree
build a specialized string data structure such as a string trie or ternary search tree to quickly lookup whether a word is interesting or not
i d have good experiences with building a ternary search tree of words as it allows quick lookups of words

10986724
queue	fifo
it puts it in a fifo queue and it has to wait until after the current iteration of the run loop is done and possibly also wait for other actions that were in the queue before you put this new action on
now you might ask when performing an action on the current queue asynchronously why not always just call the function directly instead of wait until some future time

10987194
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to be a bug in google-chrome s web inspector which is why the firefox people aren t seeing it
you can verify correct state in google-chrome by manually traversing the dom which shows that the web inspector is lying note to test you need to change the active frame from the dropdown to result fiddle.jshell.net

10987390
strncpy	malloc
in this case you ll want after the strncpy
the second case may seem to work because the buffer that you get from malloc happens to be initialized to all zeros but you shouldn t rely on this

10987916
spaces	delimiter
you can use scanf to do what you want -- read and consume the text following the phone number up to the newline -- but its not pretty you actually need two scanf calls to consume the newline as well as any spaces or other cruft that might be on the line
scanf and both read fields delimiter by whitespace and ignore leading whitespace

10987921
vfork	posix
for the two specific actions you are asking about touch you can achieve a similar effect by opening and closing the file you want to touch be careful not to use the o_trunc flag on open ls it is a little more painful because you will need to use dirent.h on posix systems and walk the results of opendir readdir make sure to call closedir when you are done if you want to replace the system and popen calls with something equivalent using vfork there is some care involved
the vfork call is a little tricky to use because if the child does anything other than exec right after the call you take the chance of corrupting the memory state of the parent

10988230
jar	war
typically a war project should not have any code in it but rather just some configuration and stuff like html jsp css and java script and bundle jar projects that contain java code
the jar projects will have the code

10991549
awt	swing
so it seems that swing can not be used so easily in embedded awt objects but the reason i dont see yet
after andrew thompson described in his comment that 3 different ui libraries are not the best choice i started to try the awt choice class

10992700
lzo	lz4
due to issues with lzo licensing we decided to evaluate the suggestions in this thread that are bsd mit licensed are very similar to lzo for easier integration and are suitable to run on low end hardware think inexpensive 32bit mcus not pentium2
we tested lz4 lzf fastlz and compared the results to lzo

10992903
qlineedit	qlabel
i agree with little_su qlineedit with input mask does not look and behaves as nice as the standard windows ip control
i worked out a complete qwidget-based ip control embedding 4 qlineedit and 3 qlabel for dots

10996636
.htaccess	httpd.conf
what you can do is to have this rule in .htaccess enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory then inside your post.php script have code like this
well mod_rewrite cannot query your database hence it cannot be completely done via .htaccess itself

11000726
uiview	uiwindow
second animatewithduration is a uiview method not a uiwindow method
i guess the compiler allows what you wrote because uiwindow inherits from uiview but sending a class message to a subclass that does not implement that method is a bad idea

11003401
implements	extends
i m not sure what your requirements are for this project but i would check out the spring layout - this layout lets you specify things like it is much easier imo to implements a nice fluid layout like you are describing here
edit just to try and add to the discussion maybe you could have a class called portraitpanel that extends from panel and in there you could maintain a list of your image panels

11004063
bash	subshell
even if it could call bash s builtin the xargs in your example runs in a subsell
the subshell cannot modify it s parent s environment anyway

octal	decimal
plus values like 08 and 09 are raising errors because 8 and 9 are not valid octal digits
the solution below uses some math tricks to add a 1 digit before each time component to force set a to use decimal notation and then subtracts out the extra time at the end

11004907
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
they are expected to be included in firefox 14 and google-chrome 18 browser support onpropertychange - is supported in ie tested in ie 7 domattrmodified - is supported in ie 9 firefox and opera mutationobservers - is very new and it worked fine in google-chrome 18
not sure how far it is supported and yet to be tested in safari

11005846
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
firefox isn t an old version of google-chrome or anything - it s a different browser with a different rendering engine
it s sort of like asking if you can force internet explorer 3 to render like mobile safari

11007076
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
opera ie is not supporting it yet
you are after the html5 drag and drop api a pretty good description dnd basics you can even drag and drop stuff between firefox and google-chrome

11007681
redmine	trac
redmine trac etc managing workflow over repos in a central gui place instructions here for redmine and be sure not to clone the unstable development branch in github. you need to download some stable archieve
however i would probably go with trac comparison here . redmine was some rails -hack and unstable master -branch does not sound good

11011569
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not have this problem and can display all of them with no slowdown
here are my jsfiddles that includes 10 css3 style examples jsfiddle for firefox just 1 example is enabled

11015507
rdf	owl
you ought to be able to output an owl rdf from protege or convert using this online tool
that s not an owl rdf file

11018269
bash	subshell
bash doesn t have threads and processes don t share memory
and subshell are still different processes - they inherit their state from their parent but they have no shared data with them

11019837
trie	tree
compact suffix trie code black white as white e white eir white en white ere white he white heir white hen white here white ir white n white r white re white s white the white their white there black w white was white when suffix tree code
i m not able to understand how that tree gets generated from the given input string

11019837
trie	tree
you essentially create a patricia trie with all the suffixes you ve listed
when inserting into a patricia trie you search the root for a child starting with the first char from the input string if it exists you continue down the tree but if it doesn t then you create a new node off the root

11021207
debian	linux
even then the dns caching feature of nscd is disabled by default at least in debian because it s broken
the practical upshot is that your linux system very very probably does not do any os-level dns caching

11026914
google-chrome	firefox
well google-chrome s property inspector right click inspect element says your inputs have border 2px inset and your textarea has border 1px solid
firefox s property inspector doesn t show any value for border at all for the textarea though so that and looking through your stylesheet leads me to think that you ve applied border-radius but haven t set a border for your textarea at all

11026914
firefox	safari
firefox s property inspector doesn t show any value for border at all for the textarea though so that and looking through your stylesheet leads me to think that you ve applied border-radius but haven t set a border for your textarea at all
it just happens that firefox s default textarea has a 2px inset border and webkit s chrome safari has a 1px black one

11027069
cpython	pypy
rewriting the above to use a with statement in the most popular python known as cpython you usually don t need the with statement as the built-in garbage collection features will figure out that you are done with the file and will close it for you
but other python implementations like jython python for the java vm or pypy a really cool experimental system with just-in-time code optimization might not figure out to close the file for you

11027142
implements	extends
moq expects your class to be abstract or you to implements an interface and thus mock the interface which is what ad.net has described hope this helps
one of the approaches that i was gonna suggest is the same as the response by ad.net but if you do not wish to modify your existing structure and still test you could do something like below modify your original class as follows and in your test project extends this class as follows and now in your test create an instance of type mocksender and call the send method on it

11028392
innodb	myisam
change engine to innodb first
myisam does not support foreign key constraint

11031713
rdf	owl
you are correct that in rdf you store statements not individual terms or concepts. however everything has a type even if it s just rdfs resource or in owl typically owl individual or owl class
thus you all always add something via a statement of the form thing rdf type type just pick the appropriate type

11032822
dbcontext	objectcontext
you d have to use dbcontext which is a wrapper around objectcontext with additional methods added in ef 4.3 4.1 correction thanks to slauma as far as i remember - also there s a way to extract the objectcontext from dbcontext when needed here s the other way around here s a link to the constructor
you re using objectcontext which does not have the entry method

11033807
rspec	capybara
you have to add capybara gem to your gemfile run bundle and require capybara rspec in spec_helper just like arcanerain pointed out
visit is capybara method not rspec

11037069
interpolation	splines
this might be the way to go from your description i would say that a parametric splines interpolation may suit your requirements
i have not used the above library myself but it does have support for splines interpolation

11039356
ienumerable	iqueryable
by returnning ienumerable you are not allowing the rest of the expression tree to be converted by the iqueryable provider
the linq to objects versions of the query operators work on ienumerable

11040602
flask	django
the three frameworks i have looked at in any detail django pyramid and flask all handle it differently
the closest to what you are looking for is django which has a urls.py file that you place all of your url configurations in but again it points to function level items not higher level .py files

11041906
mvp	presenter
not exactly what you want but an option words of caution a few notes if you are doing mvp
you ll need to have the same reference to the bindinglist in your view and presenter obviously

11043178
ioexception	bufferedwriter	printwriter	bufferedwriter
there s also a school of thought that says you shouldn t use printwriter or to be careful if you do because it swallows ioexception s
if you don t close the bufferedwriter you might lose some buffered but un-flushed data

11043858
qthread	qobject
it s bad style to derive from qthread like you are doing and use it as a generic qobject
qthread is conceptually a thread controller not a thread itself

11044973
firefox	safari
ie and firefox implement the spec correctly by putting the properties on the prototype
chrome and safari do not they put the properties directly on the object

11044985
comparator	comparable
or you need to pass comparator in constructor like as follows
you need to implement comparable interface a priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit insertion of non-comparable objects doing so may result in classcastexception

11045030
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
i d start by following the instructions here if you are not comfortable with that i d test against firefox or google-chrome which represent a much larger userbase in any event
safari support has only recently been added to webdriver and as far as i know you can t drive safari without safari-driver which takes the form of an safari browser extension that you need to compile

11045441
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
no as of current stable release of google-chrome you cannot use it inside swt
the reason is that google-chrome and essentially chromium doesn t support activex like ie firefox safari etc but is based on npapi

11046289
punctuation	words
it basically appends spaces where necessary and searches for that in the string this assumes that commas and other punctuation have already been stripped out
if matching a sequence of characters is not sufficient and you need to match whole words here is a simple function that gets the job done

11047285
setinterval	settimeout
you wouldn t want setinterval for that because with the indeterminate length of time the ajax call would take things would very quickly become chaotic
instead just initiate a settimeout upon completion of the previous cycle

11048978
stringbuilder	stringwriter
methods by forwarding on to an instance of stringbuilder that it stores in a field
this is not merely an internal detail because stringwriter has a public method getstringbuilder that returns the internal string builder and also a constructor that allows you to pass in an existing stringbuilder

11048978
stringbuilder	stringwriter
this is not merely an internal detail because stringwriter has a public method getstringbuilder that returns the internal stringbuilder and also a constructor that allows you to pass in an existing stringbuilder
so stringwriter is an adaptor that allows stringbuilder to be used as a target by code that expects to work with a textwriter

11049030
implements	extends
an rmi server is called via its stub and the protocol is implements by the stub not the client
however you can export the same object as both an rmi jrmp remote object and an rmi iiop remote object by extends neither unicastremoteobject nor portableremoteobject and calling the exportobject methods of both those classes and registering it in both an rmi registry and a cosnaming service and running both rmic if necessary see the preamble to unicastremoteobject and rmic -iiop

11050045
spaces	delimiter
update your previous regex eats up letters because it matches the character preceding the spaces as long as it s not a backslash
therefore that character is considered part of the delimiter and removed from the output along with the spaces

11050087
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you can also cast a nsmutablestring to a nsstring but not the other way around then you need to make a copy
nsstring objects are immutable this means that when you modify a nsstring you are in fact creating a new string and not modifying the old which is not very effective

11050087
nsmutablestring	nsstring
with nsmutablestring the string is kept in a buffer than can be modified
so the simple rule is that if you need to modify the string in any way use a nsmutablestring and if not nsstring

11055716
cagradientlayer	calayer	cashapelayer	calayer
well a calayer with a path is my mask but still. another problem however is i cannot switch to using a path instead of a mask because i am using gradients and cagradientlayer does not have a path property like cashapelayer which is why i used a mask
straight from the calayer class reference additionally layers that .

11056652
scheme	racket
this will work fine in racket some comments the name + for the procedure will be troublesome because it will clash with the primitive add operation in scheme
it s simpler if you use a different name like add this will fix the first error -1+ is not a procedure in racket replace it with sub1 this will fix the second error

11057638
multiplication	modulo
of course this only eliminated one multiplication
if you want to eliminate or reduce the modulo i guess that based on h_two size and h_1 size you can predetermine the steps where you have to explicitly call size something like this note i m not sure of the formula didn t test it it s more a general idea

11058194
ssl	https
lastly if you site is available over both you will probably need to look at the https server variable to determine if you are on ssl or not and use this to determine your link http or https
you will always get that message if you are pulling content from a non-ssl site when viewing over ssl

11060526
prng	random
it is very easy to calculate the seed by observing the output. br go for securerandom - use native prng as given in the link above because it takes random values from the dev random file for each call to nextbytes
this way an attacker observing the output will not be able to make out anything unless he is controlling the contents of the dev random file which is very unlikely the sha1 prng algorithm calculates the seed only once and if your vm is running for months using the same seed it might be cracked by an attacker who is passively observing the output

11060526
prng	random
this way an attacker observing the output will not be able to make out anything unless he is controlling the contents of the dev random file which is very unlikely the sha1 prng algorithm calculates the seed only once and if your vm is running for months using the same seed it might be cracked by an attacker who is passively observing the output
note - if you are calling the nextbytes faster than your os is able to write random bytes entropy into the dev random you might land into trouble when using native prng

11062068
daemons	systemd
you may want to use which instructs mysql daemons to listen to all network interfaces
2 - let s setup your ssh tunnel the reason for you error error 2013 hy000 lost connection to mysql server at reading initial communication packet systemd error 0 is not obvious to me

11062435
nexus	artifactory
i call these release candidates and nexus professional has functionality to manage these for me
i assume artifactory also supports staging not every release is needed sonatype s blog addresses this point

11065399
gradle	ivy
note that one key difference between sbt and gradle is its dependency management sbt ivy with a a revision which can be given as a fixed one 1.5.2 for instance or as latest or dynamic one
see ivy dependency that means the -snapshot mechanism support can be problematic even though mark harrah details in this thread it is true the cache can get confused but it is not true that ivy doesn t understand resolving snapshots

11065868
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has a developer tools enabled not sure about ie
you re missing the final for the statement also if you re using firefox check out firebug

11068013
prepare	execute
you ll need to write a stored procedure to which you can then pass the sanitized input to use my example you ll need to change some variables like the database name and the correct user and pass and such to make it run on your database of course example stored procedure you create an sql statement to prepare in our case since the create database statement will not work with a variable and then you just execute it
finally you do a to execute the stored procedure

11068138
google-chrome	firefox
play with it google-chrome or safari with this jsfiddle
for background-clip values firefox does not support text but supports border-box padding-box and content-box

11068396
fink	macports
fink same problems as macports
my solution simple using macports version for real development and perlbrew only for testing but not with dependent binaries like gd and so on

11068523
super	implements
return true else return super end end if your controller is not inheriting from devise registrationscontroller then you would need to specify your custom controller when setting up your routes
and then obviously implements your own new method

11072299
punctuation	words
in perl 5.16 s matches the following characters u+0009 character tabulation u+000a linefeed u+000c form feed u+000d carriage return u+0020 spaces u+0085 next line u+00a0 no-break spaces u+1680 ogham spaces mark u+180e mongolian vowel separator u+2000 en quad u+2001 em quad u+2002 en spaces u+2003 em spaces u+2004 three-per-em spaces u+2005 four-per-em spaces u+2006 six-per-em spaces u+2007 figure spaces u+2008 punctuation spaces u+2009 thin spaces u+200a hair spaces u+2028 line separator u+2029 paragraph separator u+202f narrow no-break spaces u+205f medium mathematical spaces u+3000 ideographic spaces
your filter could be much simpler written it works as designed the character at the end of the words in the example file matches s so it is not substituted

11072715
printwriter	bufferedwriter
if you have multiple printwriter s on the same underlying stream there can be problems due to the printwriter s internal use of a bufferedwriter and due to issues with locking
in summary the current printwriter implementation in the oracle openjdk codebase is thread-safe but you still need to be careful in some situations and there is also the possibility other implementations of might not be thread-safe

11073666
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in this case the server will not even attempt to read .htaccess files in the filesystem
grep -i allowoverride httpd.conf when this directive is set to all then any directive which has the .htaccess context is allowed in .htaccess files allowoverride all save and close the file

11073762
implements	extends
the reason it is less common to extends thread is because then the class can t extends anything else and if you re only overriding the run method then it would be kinda pointless to extends thread and not implements runnable
there is almost no reason to extends thread basically the only reason you would want to extends thread is if you were going to override things other than run which is generally a bad idea

11074371
implements	extends
time line code will always have to be decorated by the interface you can not implements the interface via timeline code
the clean approach would be creating a symbol and implementing a class which extends movieclip and implements the desired interface

11074501
onclick	onmouseup
as they are different events you cannot cancel onclick from onmouseup if you call preventdefault or cancelbubble or whatever you are stopping the onmouseup event from being processed any further
the onclick event is still pending yet to be fired so to speak

11074501
onclick	onmouseup
but if you reset this to false directly from onmouseup you will not be dragging any more when you receive your onclick event because onmouseup fires before onclick does
so what you need to do is use a short timeout so when your onclick event is fired isdragging will still be true and your onclick event handler can simply have if isdragging return false

11075672
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested it with google-chrome 18 and firefox 13 and can confirm that it works with firefox but i didn t have success with -webkit-selection on google-chrome it ignored it and according to this so question it doesn t exist and the answer says that selection should also work on all browser but doesn t for me too
as already metioned in this answer google-chrome forces the selection to be transparent but you can work around this using background rgba 255 255 255 0.99

11077291
mp4	webm
then there are a couple of things to consider firefox doesn t support mp4 playback neither does opera
you will need to convert the video from mp4 to webm or ogg format and put them in the same directory as the mp4 to suit your example

11077291
mp4	webm
i ve added a flash fallback flowplayer for firefox and opera and any browser that doesn t support mp4 playback
i may create the webm or ogg files on the server but this also helps with older browser like ie8

11081387
jquery	scriptaculous
you ve got several javascript libraries loaded into the page including scriptaculous prototype and jquery
seeing that you re not using jquery.noconflict you re going to have to use jquery instead of if you re set on using jquery

11081705
uiview	subviews
there shouldn t be any difference in the performance of creating controls as long as you respect some rules when doing it programmatically and these are if you aren t using a nib file override the method -loadview and in there only create a uiview and set it to self.view
then in -viewdidload method initialize you view hierarchy - you subviews of self.view their subviews buttons labels etc..

11082475
equals	compareto
your observations are correct that treeset does not use equals and .hashcode for comparison
from the javadocs this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

11082475
comparator	comparable
from the javadocs this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals
basically they are saying that for treeset equality is determined not through .equals but through .compareto on the comparable interface

11085745
decimal	ieee
first i cannot find a primary source from wikipedia we have if a decimal string with at most 15 significant decimal is converted to ieee 754 double precision and then converted back to the same number of significant decimal then the final string should match the original
and if an ieee 754 double precision is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant decimal and then converted back to double then the final number must match the original

11085745
decimal	ieee
and if an ieee 754 double precision is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant decimal and then converted back to double then the final number must match the original
therefore regarding compliance with the standard converting a string 31.0000000000000497 to double will not necessarily be the same when converted back to string too many decimal places given

11087221
decimal	ieee
python currently uses a variant of this code for its float-to-string and string-to-float conversions. even the current ieee 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic recommends but doesn t require that conversions from binary floating-point types to decimal strings are always correctly rounded
here s a snippet from section 5.12.2 external decimal character sequences representing finite numbers

11088000
octal	binary
if your software is being used for some sort of bookkeeping required by law for tax purposes you may be required to follow standard accepted rounding practices and these are based on decimal arithmetic not binary hexadecimal or octal which are the usual bases for floating point mdash
binary is universal on everything but mainframes

11088556
google-chrome	firefox
if you view the source ctrl+u or use google-chrome as your browser you ll see that the missing attributes are appearing in the xml output
rather than expect anyone to read through all the comments in the earliest answer i ll just post the outcome here firefox doesn t display the xmlns attribute at least not when it matches a default

11088749
bower	npm
i d be very interested in a more elegant solution though that would transparently work with jasmine-node and bower
i don t think there s a jasmine-browserify package yet and it doesn t really match bower npm s way of doing things avoid global exports

11088749
bower	npm
i don t think there s a jasmine-browserify package yet and it doesn t really match bower npm s way of doing things avoid global exports
for now i just include node_modules jasmine-reporters ext jasmine.js and jasmine-html.js at the top of my and require all my specs in a top-level spec_entry.js that i then use as the entry point for a bower bundle that i put right afterwards in the

11088793
haskell	agda
disclaimer previous text use agda notation and it is more about agda than haskell
in haskell if we have data void it doesn t mean that void is uninhabited

11090811
multiplying	division
especially considering that it depends on an efficient mulhs ie higher bits of a multiplying instruction to be efficient. note that this code is not size independent - to be exact the magic number changes and maybe also parts of the add shifts but that can be adapted
actually division by constants is a well known optimization for compilers and in fact gcc is already doing it

11092477
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in other words a uiviewcontroller inside of a uitabbarcontroller can contain a uiscrollview but you cannot put a uitabbarcontroller inside of another uiviewcontroller or within a uiscrollview
from the uitabbarcontroller class reference when deploying a tab bar interface you must install this view as the root of your window

11094499
innodb	myisam
you re trying to use foreign keys on a myisam table which is not allowed they only work with innodb
take a look here all i ve changed from your original is the table type from myisam to innodb and then i added the constraint

11096282
client-side	server-side
3 - bind the data to a grid as i stated i have not found a way to bind data to a gridview from the client-side
i feel the better solution is to use drop the gridview altogether this is more a server-side control and not flexible for this type of situation and in it s place you can generate the grid from javascript

11099553
isnull	nvl
edit2 looking at the sql server example it appears that the isnull function is being used to ensure that the column is never null
if this is acceptable you could do the following create or replace view some_view as select some_field some_other_field cast nvl field_of_interest 0.0 as binary_double as field_of_interest from some_table where field_of_interest is not null

11101399
ienumerable	ilist
it shouldn t execute the query right away as long as itemqry is an ienumerable or iqueryable type
if the itemqry is the correct type it won t get executed until the .tolist is called which converts it to an ilist type

11105477
sudo	passwd
another option that you have use sudo but run it not directly from some script but using pexpect or expect that will enter the passwd for you
that is also may be not ideal from security point of view because you need to save the passwd in the script

11107343
google-chrome	firefox
not sure what it is in google-chrome or ie9 but it shouldn t be hard to find in those
in firefox it s

11107655
ssl	https
if you try to enable ssl sslengine on on apache httpd without configuring a certificate and its private key you ll get this error and it won t be listening on that port 443 unless you ve configured another one error server should be ssl-aware but has no certificate configured hint sslcertificatefile if you can t rely on a well-known ca this certificate can be self-signed or issued by your own ca although this is not practical since you would have to distributed your certificates independently
in principle ssl tls doesn t strictly need x.509 certificates but https more or less expects such certificates

11110031
implements	extends
if you want your child class class to use the constants and define the methods then your child implements the interface
not sure if you are asking about extends an interface but that is also possible you implement an interface when you want your class to use the constants described and define the method signatures contained in the interface

11110031
implements	extends
not sure if you are asking about extends an interface but that is also possible you implements an interface when you want your class to use the constants described and define the method signatures contained in the interface
so if you want your parent class to use the constants and define the methods then your parent implements the interface

11111286
aggregate-functions	sum
condition while the where clause cannot contain aggregate-functions
try this the difference between where and having clause is that the having clause evaluates the aggregated functions like sum count max etc.

11112117
client-side	server-side
placeholders is a client-side technique
you cannot create placeholders with server-side technology

11114031
set	bag
if a set of fields are dereferenced bag. name1 name2 or bag. 0 1 the expression represents a bag composed of the specified fields
but be careful doesn t give you the first tuple in the bag because bags aren t ordered

11115389
libstdc++	libc++
you could do one of the followings switch to libc++ by using apply the following patch to usr include c++ 4.7.0 type_traits as documented in if you check bits shared_ptr.h you did find a std common_type and the clang developers claim that it s actually a bug of libstdc++ although i don t believe a bug of libstdc++ alone would cause the non-existent type to appear
clang++ and libstdc++ doesn t match perfectly yet

11115972
onresume	onpause
if you save a reference to the mapviewcontainer s parent i made it static in onstart you can add the mapviewcontainer to the parent in onresume if it s not already contained
here is what i did in onpause i do not set mapviewcontainer null so i can reuse it

11119331
postgresql	mysql
on postgresql you can add a functional index on lower bar but mysql doesn t support this
mysql will unless you have set a case-sensitive collation do case-insensitive matching automatically and use its indexes

11119891
super	extends
you can only add elements to a generic collection declared with super not extends
this may be easier to remember with the acronym pecs producer - extends consumer - super popularized by josh bloch in effective java 2nd edition item 28

11121378
translation	localization
if you would like to manage application locale per user you can store the current locale in the session of course you should also use the translation function __
check out the internationalization and localization section of the cake book. oh yeah there is also something very important which is mentioned in the fine print of that article there s one other aspect of localizing your application which is not covered by the use of the translate functions and that is date money formats

11121397
innodb	myisam
from the documentation innodb does not have a special optimization for separate index creation the way the myisam storage engine does
therefore it does not pay to export and import the table and create indexes afterward. the fastest way to alter a table to innodb is to do the inserts directly to an innodb table

11121447
base	fractions
if on the other hand you handler involves lengthy processing or blocking calls data base or file access then you should hand of the processing to an executionhandler that transfer processing from the io worker pool to a another thread pool
if your handler pipe line does not do any blocking or any lengthy processing it is very probable that the i o processing will always be a lot faster than the network the io thread will be idle and waiting for work quite a large fractions of its time

11121844
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
ilist implements icollection and icollection implements ienumerable
therefore ienumerable will work for any well designed type of collection or enumeration but not ilist

11121844
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection
therefore ienumerable will work for any well designed type of collection or enumeration but not ilist
for instance does not implement ilist but icollection and therefore also ienumeration

11122064
client-side	server-side
that prevents the client-side validation so you will always get a postback which may not exactly be what you want though
the validation will still be done just server-side

11123701
onreadystatechange	onload
these ie versions do not fire an onload event but do for onreadystatechange
ie9 in standards mode fires both with onreadystatechange for all scripts firing before onload for any

11124218
inline	inlining
there are good reasons to inline resources but as with most things it also has its tradeoffs
the simplest case for inlining is cases where the cost of an http connection is much more than the resource itself ex if you have a 10x10 icon you need to show a dedicated request for that may not be worth it vs

11124725
inline	inlining
events are using delegates as a mechanism for invocation so event invocations won t be inline either
inlining a delegate is hard because the target is not necessarily known at compile time

11125621
serializable	deserialization
serializable requires you to have a parameterless constructor but does not limit you to that one constructor
keep the no-arg constructor for deserialization but add another constructor that takes your values and does the required initialization when you need to instantiate the class in code

11128561
udp	tcp
unless you absolutely need to be sure that other machines got the message you could do it with udp
mind that i m not saying don t use tcp i just want to make it straight that you should take udp into consideration as well

11130169
rsa	aes
your file is almost certainly not rsa encrypted
its probably encrypted with aes under a random symmetric key and the key is then encrypted with rsa

11130241
serializable	deserialization
hadoop then uses the registered serializable to create new instances of these objects when the sequence file is read back in
if the classes you register as the output types are interfaces or the actual objects you output are sub-classes of the declared type than either you will not be able to instantiate the interface at runtime or the instantiated class will not be the sub class you are expecting and your deserialization will most probably fail with an ioexception

11132661
ienumerable	ilist
iqueryable extends ienumerable
both do not project inflate their data until being iterated whereas ilist objects pull all their data and are populated when assigned to

11134152
kerberos	ntlm
i found the answer here kerberos does not work in a load-balanced architecture and iis drops back to ntlm authentication
because you cannot use ntlm for delegation any applications or services that require delegation do not work

11135578
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the reason to copy instead of retain arc is impliciting retaining the object for you is because nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring
this means that str could be an nsmutablestring and could later change its value which is probably not what you want

11138965
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
use strstr based on domain we can determine whether string is found or not if domain is null string not found this function is case-sensitive
for case-insensitive searches use stristr

11140472
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear happens before viewdidappear
for speed purposes i would do it on the viewdidappear on a secondary thread in a async way so the ui thread wouldn t slow down

11141594
layoutparams	viewgroup
the reason why they aren t appearing is that they haven t been added using addview so call this after you ve set each one s layoutparams
remove the ondraw call this isn t used for viewgroup unless you explicitly request it do be

11144043
profiling	debugging
i am using ad hoc distribution provisioning profiling when debugging the app in my device
this is not the problem because i m not debugging the app

11145179
haskell	scheme
your use of parentheses in your code sample and your emphasis on tail recursion suggests you re coming to haskell from lisp or scheme
if you re coming to haskell from an eager language like scheme be warned tail calls are not nearly as predictive of performance in haskell as they are in an eager language

11146360
pthreads	fork
process.setsid works without eperm error after you fork take a look at rexec or unicorn for examples of pthreads daemonization in ruby
the setsid 1 program doesn t get an eperm error because it fork before calling setsid 2

11146802
client-side	server-side
the important bit is that your javascript code continues its execution regardless of the completion of the round-trip as there can be a significant delay when your client remember that js runs client-side makes an ajax call to the server slow server slow connection and so on
so you can t expect to do things like because doesn t actually return a value like a regular function the variable r cannot be valued by .post instead you should organize your code based on the done event which is fired after the ajax call has completed it guarantees if there have been no failures like server-side errors not found pages etc. that we actually have a response to use in your code on success. with that event we can call a function that receives the response as a parameter and actually uses it

11148678
haskell	agda
in haskell types give a partial specification. sometimes this specification fully determines the meaning outcome while leaving various implementation choices. going beyond haskell to languages with dependent types as in agda coq among others types are much more often useful as a complete specification
where types aren t enough add formal specifications which often take a simple functional form. hence i believe the answers that the modeling language of choice for haskell is haskell itself or math . in such a form you give a functional definition that is optimized for clarity and simplicity and not all for efficiency. the definition might even involve uncomputable operations such as function equality over infinite domains. then step by step you transform the specification into the form of an efficiently computable functional program. every step preserves the semantics denotation and so the final form implementation is guaranteed to be semantically equivalent to the original form specification . you ll see this process referred to by various names including program transformation program derivation and program calculation

11149054
trie	tree
i do not know c# personally so i can t help you with the code but what you want to use is called a trie
this is a specific type of tree for strings

11152003
innodb	myisam
either file was retrieved correctly or it was not at all retrieved less than 0.01 since innodb is acid compliant
when we shifted to myisam failure rate increased to 20 with lossy data as well same as your case

11155293
git-svn	svn2git
if your repository has no trunk branches tags layout you may use smartgit for conversion that also uses another translation engine not git-svn
if the repository is local and has trunk branches tags layout you may use subgit the resulting repository will be at path to svn repository .git it has another translation engine than svn2git svn2git uses git-svn in it so it shouldn t have this problem

11157350
google-chrome	firefox
it would appear that google-chrome will fire the click and context menu events as the op is expecting.
but ie and firefox do not which is more the behaviour i would expect

11157867
ubuntu	linux
puttygen exports private keys des encoded which causes some software openssh on ubuntu to silently ignore the key and prompt for password
to use putty .ppk key in linux openssh first export the key start puttygen file - loadprivate key conversions - export openssh key private.key in this example now on the linux machine re-encrypt the key using passphrase change command ssh-keygen -pf private.key enter the same passphrase 3 times old new new to actually not change it

11158685
prepare	execute
i would recommend dropping your test database then re-create it and migrate after these steps you can run your specs bundle execute rspec spec gerry3 noted that a simpler solution is to just run rake db test prepare however if you re using postgresql this wont work because the rails environment gets loaded which opens a database connection
this causes the prepare call to fail because the db cannot be dropped

11162108
svg	vml
do not attempt to change transformations in your vml svg image at any point in time while panning
with the mousemove implementation of panning you already have move or scroll the html container that holds your vml svg image instead

11163217
automake	autotools
the libtool and automake autotools can be used independently of one another or not at all depending on what you need autoconf to do
therefore it s not required to use automake to generate makefile.in

11165854
persistent	transient
note because onsaveinstancestate is not guaranteed to be called you should use it only to record the transient state of the activity the state of the ui you should never use it to store persistent data
instead you should use onpause to store persistent data such as data that should be saved to a database when the user leaves the activity

11166040
implements	extends
and the class which extends it has to implements the abstract methods or define itself as abstract
final if defined user cannot extends this class

11167187
google-chrome	firefox
code that relies on the trick does not work in google-chrome because google-chrome does not support the inline processing of xml within javascript
this is a perk of firefox which supports e4x while google-chrome doesn t

11167187
google-chrome	firefox
it uses the e4x feature so it will not work in google-chrome
it should throw the same error in greasemonkey as it does in firefox they re nominally the same js engine but due to pure dumb luck about how gm sandboxes scripts you get away with that erroneous code for now

11169132
client-side	server-side
if you can t do the api call client-side as suggested above because you require your app access token to be send for your actions to be published then i d suggest still doing it server-side but not via cron but triggered by the user himself by embedding an img or script element into you re page put out by php if you re directing the user to a new page or created and put into the dom client-side via javascript which has it s source set as the address of your php script publishing the action
if you use a script element you could even control the outcome of the operation and react to it client-side by just returning appropriate javascript code in the response

11169137
umask	sudo
when you run a command using sudo it will preserve the users umask
pip just installs files it doesn t change access rights so you ll end up with the files having the access rights set conforming to the current user s umask which may be owner-readable only 0077 and therefore readable by root only

11169137
umask	sudo
pip just installs files it doesn t change access rights so you ll end up with the files having the access rights set conforming to the current user s umask which may be owner-readable only 0077 and therefore readable by root only
that means you can set umask to something sensible like umask 0022 before running sudo pip install

11169905
udp	tcp
this is a fundamental limitation of udp not a limitation of async await
if you need to keep your messages in order i recommend tcp

11174150
g++	gcc
if you are going to compile both c and c++ you are better off compiling always with gcc it will choose the language based on the file extension than g++ will always compile as c++
you will need to change your linker options to include c++ standard library and -lm if you use it as those are automatically added by g++ but not gcc

11174150
g++	gcc
you will need to change your linker options to include c++ standard library and -lm if you use it as those are automatically added by g++ but not gcc
alternatively a better option is to call the g++ for c++ and gcc for c files

11174517
rar	zip
the php manual gives a brief overview - but there are basically two types or archive compressions - zip gzip bzip compression but with ability to compress multiple files to one archive - rar tar archiving to a single file with ability to reduce size in building the archive if you re not expecting to gain much by way of compression then look at one of the archiving functions tar rar etc
the best known is rar but the licence does not allow php to create rar files so you ll need to use tar

11174900
serializable	deserialization
if this is the case you ll have to add actual methods to mypoint do the serializable and probably the deserialization too
if your errors are because your point class isn t serializable you can probably get by by implementing that interface which generally means you do nothing beyond that

11179130
serializable	deserialization
you can just define a custom function to serializable your data type in the io monad
also it s generally not advisable to use show for serialization purposes since some of your data types like psq have no read instance it s a pain in the butt to define read instances in general string representations are very space-inefficient so i would recommend you use a proper serialization library like binary or cereal to do serialization and deserialization

11179175
implements	extends
that s simple for which extends idisposable but as ienumerator doesn t the compiler inserts a check to test at execution time whether the iterator implements idisposable you can iterate over types which don t implements ienumerable or so long as you have an applicable getenumerator method which returns a type with suitable current and movenext members
as noted in comments a type can also implements ienumerable or explicitly but have a public getenumerator method which returns a type other than ienumerator

11180528
oncreate	setcontentview
you shouldn t call setcontentview twice in your oncreate
either call setcontentview r.layout.main or call setcontentview tv but not both

11180697
ssl	https
you need to install and configure an ssl certificate on both the load balancer and the server
your initial https request ended up being an http request on the server that is a good indication that you did not configure a secure channel between the load balancer and the server

11180769
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you want to use dbcontext you must turn off that default code generation - in property window remove custom tool for edmx file download and install dbcontext t4 generator you can get it directly from extension manager in visual studio in ef designer select add code generation item from context menu in the designer surface not on entity now ef will add two .tt files to your project - one will be responsible for creating a new class for every entity or complex type defined in your edmx file and the second will be responsible for creating class derived from dbcontext and exposing sets for all your entity types
so i guess you are using default code generator provided by edmx designer - it will use objectcontext and heavy weight entityobject based entities

11181351
implements	extends
what you are looking for is jsr 211 . it is not available on all j2me phones but the part of it that is usually implements first is the one that allows switching from one midlet to another
however from the code you posted it looks like you are confusing extends the midlet class with implementing the displayable interface

11181556
implements	extends
what he means is that you should provide an interface and an abstract class implements parts of this interface the abstractfoo class may even not be abstract if it s possible to provide a basic complete implementation
but if you need a class that is a foo but can t extends abstractfoo it s still possible with an interface

11182921
implements	extends
update class form_element_abstractelement extends validator_abstractvalidator implements form_elementinterface you are extends an abstract class validator_abstractvalidator and also implements the interface validator all together that is not possible
extends the class and implement the interface individually and implement the interface validator in a separate class not in validator_abstractvalidator because it s an abstract class you ve already declared before

11183076
punctuation	words
the standardtokenizer does this based on the following taken from lucene javadoc splits words at punctuation characters removing punctuation. however a dot that s not followed by whitespace is considered part of a token
splits words at hyphens unless there s a number in the token in which case the whole token is interpreted as a product number and is not split

11185307
dictionary	map
of such a zipped iterator you can also create a dictionary which might also be called a map as it maps items to values however you can not directly iterate over key-value pairs in dictionary this is a rather obscure error message as we passed a dictionary not an int
by default when iterating over a dictionary one will iterate over the keys but we instructed python to do unpacking on our values

11185807
interpolation	splines
i think you need to specify how many points you want the splines to interpolation the curve with although you are specifying control points the curve doesn t know how smooth you want it
try something like this then as pointed out in juan mellado answer you can get a position on the line using spline.getpoint t where t is value between 0-1 start and end points of the splines

11191372
opera	firefox
however mozilla does not yet implement any of these and neither does opera so this can t be done in those browsers yet
firefox 20 and later supports document.caretpositionfrompoint

11194977
jar	war
embeded or monolithic jar doesn t matter
which matters is bundled or war deployment

11195244
robocopy	xcopy
you should look into using robocopy instead
because the leading path in your exclude file does not match the leading path specified as your xcopy source

11196437
profiling	debugging
also in security.java dont forget to add your public key from your market place account edit profiling page
debugging notes logcat will show all errors as inappbilling tag this project creates a shared_preferences named inappbilling and debugging is set to true the androidmanifest.xml may not be needed since this project does not have a home screen

11196467
emacs	aquamacs
get the latest version of slime from here - you want the cvs snapshot tar file unpack the slime tar file and copy it into library application support aquamacs emacs slime seems to work ok for me.
there seems to be a fairly easy way to set up aquamacs 2.4 and slime for clojure install clojure install aquamacs 2.4 from here install the aquamacs slime package from here this will not work so.

11197924
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
other browsers behaved differently in our experiment google-chrome 19 triggered onerror only on 407 proxy authentication required and opera 12 on 100 101 204 4xx and 5xx
we had the same issue and after examining our cdn logs we discovered that firefox triggers the onerror event when a script returns with http status 304 not modified so a cache hit

11198049
google-chrome	safari
it looks on my machine the delay is not constant and is between 4ms and 16ms in google-chrome and about 2ms in safari
bizarre console.log behaviour in google-chrome developer tools my speculative solution to this is to do something like console.log a.tojson

11198867
info.plist	ipa
i ve had this exact problem before when i have a different bundle identifier set in the info.plist to the app id you set up in the provisioning portal
if that doesn t work you might try checking the log of your device when attempting to install the ad hoc ipa

11200844
super	extends
please read up on producer extends consumer super pecs - i may need to do the same read only in case you would like to ensure that a method takes as a parameter a collection of items using generics - when you use - the list can contain any subtype of t but cannot add to the collection since it does not know at runtime the specific type of t that the list contains
write only for the list can contain t regardless of the actual parameterized type using super will allow that to happen

11203683
implements	extends
i think drag and drop isn t an easy topic so i am afraid i can t make it that simple and i agree with ekholm you will definitely need a decent c# wpf knowledge to succesfully implements this
even when you get your code to run you will be stuck when you want to modify extends your dragdrop code

11204069
apache	nginx
for that you need to look at the web server - if apache mod_proxy comes to mind or some of the other modules can evaluate apache s req res chain and go from there if it s anything like mod_perl this is not very fun
iirc you can do similar things with nginx

11205564
client-side	server-side
as this is client-side it will not look to the server to retrieve the date and hence you get local system time rather than server time
you will need code to execute on the server-side to get server time

11205899
postgresql	mysql
moodle supports mysql mssql oracle and postgresql
access is not really a suitable db for use with a web application and if you are developing any moodle site without mysql then you are being denied the tools you need to do the job

11206343
rsa	dsa
to see exactly what is used for each cipher suite openssl ciphers -v can be insightful edit in respone to the question about dss cipher suites dss dsa cipher suites need dh parameters and of course a dss dsa based server certificate instead of only an rsa one
this is true not only for export cipher suites but for all suites using dss dsa for authenticity

11207077
ienumerable	ilist
a list is ienumerable but the reverse is not true
if you need list operations you should change your method to return an ilist instead of ienumerable

11207281
division	multiplication
last but not least there are different instructions for signed unsigned multiplication division
as noted in the comments imul is a special case because it can also be used for unsigned multiplication

11208940
vb.net	vb6
dateadd is an old vb6 method that was carried over into vb.net for backwards compatibility
you could get it to work in c# as well if you included the microsoft.visualbasic namespace in your c# project but i wouldn t recommend using the method in c# or vb.net

11210862
cassini	iis
use iis express rather than cassini and you will find that the response includes the reason
the reasonphrase does not work in cassini

11211398
inline	inlining
you can also suggest that a function should be inline using the inline keyword before a function note that it still doesn t actually force it and the compiler might decide to avoid the inlining .it s generally not such a good idea to do this manually as modern compilers tend to figure out the best possible inlinings on their own
this article explains inline functions really well i found it very helpful edit 1 there are several reasons why one might want to do that inlining you speak of

11214443
rational-numbers	floating-point	floating-point	fixed-point
get around it by using rational-numbers or fixed-point instead of floating-point arithmetic
that is not javascript adding extra precision that is your computer s floating-point representation not being able to accurately represent your number

11216144
ubuntu	linux
in addition i should point out that the below section is bsd-stat specific the sm flag doesn t work when i test on ubuntu
linux has a stat command if you re interested in it read the man page

11216772
apache	nginx
the docs for it is here i m not familiar with nginx but what you re describing is similar to apache
they must have kept things similar for people that are familiar with apache

11216928
apache	nginx
not only is it useful to have nginx serve static images but having nginx proxy to apache is a big win as well
this is because slow clients cause apache to keep threads busy for longer than needed

11219801
textview	imageview
here very first thing you should get rid of is android.r.layout.simple_list_item_1 it not gonna give you more than one textview per row
problem is that each item in my listview holds three textview and an imageview

11224636
flask	django
from your description i would advise going for a micro-framework like flask . you could go with something even more minimal like bottle but since you do need html forms and probably a database flask makes this a bit easier on you if you re a beginner since it already has a templating engine included jinja2 and hooks for sqlalchemy
i think this would a be a good compromise between having some work taken care of by the framework and still not using something completely overkill like django

11226053
daemons	systemd
there s the tex daemons which is part of pytex and which looks like it s doing something like what you need
i ve seen this systemd working but haven t used it myself and i m not sure of its current status

11226932
jpql	hql
jpql starts with select update or delete
obviously it may work in hibernate i.e hql but that query is not standard and not portable

11226977
jpql	hql
it s not a valid jpql query
it s a valid hql query but hql ain t jpql

11227074
tabcontrol	tabitem
you can find the code for this in this so answer the site that originally contained the code is not around anymore and you use the control in the xaml the same way as you would a regular tabcontrol
this is because wpf will unload tabitem that are not in use which means if the text property is not bound to anything it will get reset

11229522
icarousel	uitableview
you might run into some problems when trying to scroll the tables though i ve run into troubles with uitouchgesturerecognizers on my custom views in the end had to disable those of the icarousel
i m doing a project using the icarousel right now you can supply your own views for the carousel in there shouldn t be any problem with adding uitableview as subviews to the returned view or just return the tables

11234167
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
first of all you can t ping ports as ping is using icmp which doesn t have the concept of ports
ports belong to the transport layer protocols like tcp and udp

11234736
implements	extends
there is no reason to show the binary code that implements that function because it is not readable and it might not even be available
jquery extends default javascript behaviour

11235272
implements	extends
t has to extends implements both itest and iboldface
your constraint doesn t mean that it has to extends implements one of the types - it has to do both

11237086
pdcurses	ncurses
in a nutshell you want pdcurses
what you did is not how to use ncurses at all

11238825
postgresql	greenplum
here s the 3rd one it may bypass greenplum s limitations this 4th way also works in postgresql which supports except operator tested in sql-fiddle that all 4 work in postgresql
there are 3 main ways to do this kind of query not exists correlated subquery not in subquery left join with is null check you found that the first way does work in greenplum

11240968
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i have done a similar thing to use a qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview to display items in a model
despite it s name qgraphicsview isn t part of the model view framework so i implemented a custom view class which drew the model data on the qgraphicsscene

11241183
move	drag
if you move them over in project navigator instead of removing them they will turn red because the actual files are not at the place they were but this can be a guide especially if you re moving a lot of files around for what still needs to be set properly
now you can drag and drop them from finder onto the group that s associated with the folder where you put the files

11242127
vb.net	vb6
for example if you write the vb.net editor will remove the set
2 - yes you can use a vb6 dll in a c# or vb.net project this should be not issue but you wont be able to edit or compile it is visual studio

11242550
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
stack allocation has its pros and cons pro it is very fast - it only takes one register subtraction operation to create stack space and one register addition operation to reclaim it back con stack size is usually limited and also fixed at link time on windows in both cases the number of elements in each arrays is a compile-time constant 3 is obviously a constant while sizeof a sizeof int can be computed at compile time since both the size of a and the size of int are known at the time when array is declared
when the number of elements is known only at run-time or when the size of the array is too large to safely fit into the stack space then heap allocation is used as already pointed out this should be malloc sizeof a since the size of a is already the number of bytes it takes and not the number of elements and thus additional multiplication by sizeof int is not necessary

11243999
haskell	agda
haskell unlike agda does not have dependent types so there is no way to do exactly what you want
types cannot be parameterized by value since haskell enforces a phase distinction between runtime and compile time

11244164
lisp	scheme
scheme different lisp dialect created in the 70s
not directly compatible with emacs lisp or common lisp

11244164
lisp	scheme
dialects like common lisp emacs lisp visual lisp islisp and others try to keep the heritage
dialects like scheme or clojure felt not bound to the names and the syntax

11245313
innodb	myisam
innodb creates indices automatically for foreign keys
myisam does not support foreign keys at all

11245313
innodb	myisam
from the manual for storage engines other than innodb mysql server parses the foreign key syntax in create table statements but does not use or store it. .
at a later stage foreign key constraints will be implemented for myisam tables as well

11248652
hive	hdfs
try running this from your job-tracker hadoop fs -ls user hive warehouse that s the default path at least
the data is stored on hdfs not on the local file system

11254239
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome for ios is just a skin over the built in safari browser
that is it is not the google-chrome version of webkit

11254239
google-chrome	safari
that is it is not the google-chrome version of webkit
it should behave identically to safari itself

11254715
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so say you have a modal view that you present when that view is dismissed viewdidappear will be called and viewdidload will not be called
simply put you would want to create any controls or arrays in viewdidload where as in viewdidappear is where you would want to refresh those controls or arrays

11255651
gson	jackson
gson does not have a built in feature to simply handle deserialization of such a json sequence
see comments. if switching json-to from-java apis is an option jackson does have such a feature as demonstrated below

11257960
pascal	delphi
it is the old style of oop programming in turbo pascal 5.5 days deprecated but still available
note that i discovered a weird compilation issue on newer versions of delphi sometimes an object allocated on the stack is not always initialized

11259593
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome for android supports ws rfc6455 - it s available on ics onwards but not the standard browser
ws rfc6455 is supported by firefox mobile on android devices with at least armv7

11260069
stateless	stateful
with this in mind if i entrust the task to keep conversational state in the underlying technology such as a coockie or http session i m implementing a stateful service but if all the necessary information the context are passed as parameters i m implementing a stateless service. it should be noted that even if the passed parameter is an identifier of the conversational state a ticket or a sessionid we are still operating under a stateless service because the conversation is stateless the ticket is continually passed between client and server and are the two endpoints to be so to speak stateful
the adjective stateful or stateless refers only to the state of the conversation it is not in connection with the concept of function which provides the same output for the same input

11263319
namenode	hdfs
when the number of files are huge a single namenode will not be able to keep all the metadata
in fact that is one of the limitations of hdfs

11266287
jms	jta
the exact code is not important begin jta transaction set accountbalance 100 lower for account #345 in database add jms message transfer 100 to otherbank account #987 to queue commit jta transaction otherbank is a separate bank and we assume you communicate with it over jms
the begin transaction and commit are handled by jta

11269305
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in ie and firefox but unfortunately doesn t work in google-chrome
the reason is google-chrome doesn t support domattrmodified event

multiplying	multiplication
multiplying two such matrices with a naive algorithm should require 10 18 operations
of course we have better matrix multiplication algorithms but you re still not getting below say 10 15 operations

11272667
implements	extends
you cam implements this by extends fmt formatnumber functionality
for this create a class extends org.apache.taglibs.standard.tag.rt.fmt.formatnumbertag to set maxfractiondigits to 5 by default when not supplied

11274684
g++	gcc
i recently set up a rig to compile c++ programs with clang using g++ s standard runtime library and it compiles+links just fine
yes for c code clang and gcc are compatible they both use the gnu toolchain for linking in fact. you just have to make sure that you tell clang to create compiled objects and not intermediate bitcode objects

11275492
spaces	delimiter
it looks mighty similar to the one after it which is just a generic spaces in a string but they are not the same as the alert suggests
a potential issue with this in terms of obfuscation is that the strings are very clearly delimiter thanks to proper monospace fonts and syntax highlighting so i am not sure how useful raw spaces themselves will be

11275673
spaces	delimiter
you refer to excel csv which does not exists and you show spaces delimiter data in your example
furthermore access is limited to 255 columns and a csv is not so there is no guarantee this will work edit re various comments it is possible to import a text file manually into ms access and this will allow you to choose you own cell delimiter and text delimiter

11276931
factors	mean
o means at most using some constant factors θ means equal using some constant factors 47n ln n o n 2 but it s not θ n 2
if you want to express best case average case or worst case you usually write them explicitly best case is o 1 or θ 1 average case is o lg n worst case is o n . sometimes you also running time is o x then you mean running time is at most proportional to x

11278759
hex	binary
you were on the right track thinking that you need to encode the binary data to hex before displaying it
binary data is not displayable but hex is

11280446
implements	extends
why not to go for virtual properties in your base class basevm with default functionality implements in it
in case other derived classes want to extends it they can always override it as per funcitonality required

11280635
uiview	subviews
uiview animation is not good option for doing this instead of it try cakeyframeanimation
this is sample code for scaling uiview you can use this after you add your uiview as subviews then you can call this method as scale it

11280835
lisp	scheme
note in emacs lisp mode commonlisp emacslisp are the closest things i know to clojure. we can see that even local function usage isn t added to syntax highlighting having done a small check with clojure-mode i can see the same thing going on there defn s show their function name highlighted but usage is in the default face color.
i made a theme based on the lighttable color scheme i ve just released it as a gist

11281515
required	placeholder
try disabling this option if not required otherwise try using code like this
if you have allowusertoaddrows enabled on your datagridview then you might be accidently deleting the empty row at the bottom of the dataview which is a placeholder for the next user created row

11281742
memcpy	calloc
when doing memcpy we tell it to copy n bytes which does not include 0
but as we use calloc to allocate the final destination memory with the space for the terminating 0 character it is initialized to 0

11281997
ftp	smb
but you can run a web service on your machine and downloard the files you want by http or ftp
i ve tryed to do that a few months ago the only way was to implement the smb protocol what is not that simple.

11282765
uiview	subviews
additional references to update with other references if you want uiview geometry uiview frames and bounds about clipstobounds source apple doc setting this value to yes causes subviews to be clipped to the bounds of the receiver
if set to no subviews whose frames extend beyond the visible bounds of the receiver are not clipped

11285538
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview	setcontentview	findviewbyid
moving your findviewbyid calls inside of oncreate after calling setcontentview should fix it
you re calling findviewbyid as part of your field definition at which point the layout isn t inflated that happens when you call setcontentview

11285538
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you re calling findviewbyid as part of your field definition at which point the layout isn t inflated that happens when you call setcontentview
findviewbyid isn t finding the view so the reference is being set to null

11286207
udp	tcp
by default netcat works in tcp mode but rtp protocol is udp based
the transmission control protocol tcp although standardized for rtp use 5 is not normally used in rtp application because tcp favors reliability over timeliness

11286690
ssl	https
just google for creating a self signed ssl certificate iis 7.5 and you ll find plenty of examples
imagine the issues is that your login page is accessing your local web server over port 443 for ssl and your web site is not configured to respond to that https request

11293592
daemons	systemd
as to changing the name of the device file such things are done by configuring the udev daemons though i am confident that changing the partition number is a bad bad idea why would you want to do it so maybe this isn t even possible
to adress mounting as device names are generally not reliable across kernel updates and i heard also when removing adding other disks you should change your etc fstab to reference your partitions by file systemd uuid an etc fstab entry like dev sdb4 home ext3 defaults 0 0 becomes where youruuid is the filesystem uuid which you can get as root with blkid only use the string between the quotes

11296350
jar	war
you shouldn t care about how the jar files are segregated into the war file it s only used by the container
segregating the jar files could be useful in your source project

11300897
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome you re asked permissions when indexeddb installs for the first time on a host origin port and protocol matching but this is apparently not the default behavior in firefox
according to this helpful mozilla support ticket there seem to be two types of permissions in firefox indexeddb and indexeddb-unlimited. only the latter comes into play

11303005
union	distinct
as blorgbeard commented the distinct clause in your solution is unnecessary because the union operator eliminates duplicate rows
there is a union all operator that does not elimiate duplicates but it is not appropriate here

11303005
union	distinct
there is a union all operator that does not elimiate duplicates but it is not appropriate here
rewriting your query without the distinct clause is a fine solution to this problem select code_1 from tbl_data where code_1 is not null union select code_2 from tbl_data where code_2 is not null

11306662
config	ini
if none is loaded then make sure you put a php.ini file into the config file path value in your case etc php.ini it seems
most likely no ini file at all is being loaded i don t know if etc php.ini.default is seen or not by php

11306871
qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager
note that your request with plain qtcpsocket may not work with proxy servers as well as qnetworkreply provided by generic qnetworkaccessmanager
qwebview doesn t use qtcpsocket directly

11306871
qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager
qwebview doesn t use qtcpsocket directly
it uses qnetworkaccessmanager

11308599
innodb	myisam
go for innodb
you read it right that myisam engine does not support the foreign key integrity checks

11314259
apache	nginx
php + apache wasn t built for maintaining long running connections
there are php standalone websocket solutions you could look at but you are 80 likely to be using apache and 20 nginx which doesn t support websockets quite yet but will soon

11315708
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome open the javascript console wrench- tools- javascript console
in firefox firefox- web developer- web console things that were wrong lots of globals used but are not actually global

11318618
opera	google-chrome
-- seemed to work ok i m not sure what the maximum length of window.name can be edit 2mb cross-browser much more if you re excluding opera -
the only thing i found was in google-chrome if you visit another domain the window.name is lost but in other browsers the name still there so it s doable not 100 certain you should rely on it always working in the future though

11319781
ubuntu	debian
i m not sure if this exactly answers the question but here s what i got so far on ubuntu lucid checkinstall 1.6.1 i tried to build an open-source project which built just fine
then i tried packaging it for debian this basically failed at the same building file list.

11319912
cassini	iis
also confirm that you re using iis express and not cassini
cassini will not handle that correctly but iis express will

11323919
stateless	stateful
if you do not care about the state - stateless bean is the right choice
right stateful beans

11324203
backtracking	greedy
please see catastrophic backtracking and watch out for greedy
i will not attempt to rewrite your regular expression since we do not have the requirements but the main issue here is your name group the is greedy

11326372
onkeyup	onkeydown
onchange occurs only when you blur the textbox onkeyup onkeypress doesn t always occur on text change onkeydown occurs on text change but cannot track cut paste with mouse click onpaste oncut occurs with keypress and even with the mouse right click
so to track the change in textbox we need onkeydown oncut and onpaste

11327360
postgresql	mysql
postgresql can be setup like this with a create sequence seq_name and using nextval seq_name on every insert
mysql does not have native support for this you can simulate the behavior of a postgresql sequence by creating a table with only one column and an auto_increment on that column

11331954
expression-blend	silverlight
i got the following underline hover error message in expression-blend the equivalent triangle authored via blend for silverlight is
unlike wpf silverlight does not support converting a string to figures

11333357
required	placeholder
hmmm it seems that your sql statement doesn t required the single quotes
for example you can try running this block instead check out the php manual on pdo prepared statements it looks like it here that the quotes are not necessary around the named placeholder

11334159
base	fractions
absence of literally fractions power units of measure does not anyhow discounts f# unit facility as it allows presenting seemingly fractions exponent unit relationships the other way around having smallest fractions as a base dimension has inferred signature of this way avoiding introduction of imaginary naturally fractions
has inferred signature of where all unit measure conversions stay valid relative to some derived implicit base dimension

11335841
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using google-chrome i m using version 20 open the console press f12 and you will see that you will get an error origin null is not allowed by access-control-allow-origin
in mozilla firefox you will get object xmldocument but if you do this remotely in your host everything will get working normally.

11336172
exponent	addition
update with f# 4.0 support for fractional exponent has been implemented
in addition to what has already been said the best resource for information about not just f# units of measure is andrew kennedy s phd thesis who actually designed f# units

11338428
udp	tcp
base on this principle voip generally use udp for data packets not control packets
short answer if you can tolerance with any packet loss udp is better otherwise tcp

11340281
profiling	debugging
profiling do not necessarily help debugging profiling may use more memory
try a profiling

11341017
noexcept	throw
strictly speaking there are two things that noexcept offers anyone can check at compile-time if your function is declared as noexcept
this is in practice useful only in one std function move_if_noexcept you get a run-time guarantee that if your function nonetheless tries to throw an exception it does not get out of the function because std terminate is called instead

11341017
noexcept	throw
more interestingly to list what noexcept does not offer automatic checking at compile-time if the function really doesn t throw even more importantly it does not offer any exception safety guarantee
i believe that the second item is often overlooked when learning the noexcept

11341017
noexcept	throw
i believe that the second item is often overlooked when learning the noexcept
if you want to provide a no-fail guarantee note that this is different than no-throw guarantee because the function may fail but not throw you can simply implement it in your function and throw nothing and document it somewhere

11341365
rtp	rtsp
this sps and pps information was not included in rtp packet
i m using live555 library for rtsp streaming so i ve used subsessions fmtp_spropparametersets function to get what i need

11341946
extjs	gxt
this may not be your issue but i noticed ext-comp- and guess you are using extjs
i m using gxt and while finding by id worked for many things on some submit buttons it didn t

11344149
vbscript	jscript
this will use jscript to get the utc date and time into a format that vbscript can then understand and operate on once you have utc then you can apply your own rules to convert that to ist predictably
asp vbscript doesn t understand the concept of timezones just what the current server time is

11344149
vbscript	jscript
asp vbscript doesn t understand the concept of timezones just what the current server time is
jscript asp does and luckily enough you can mix and match your scripting languages in asp

11344328
google-chrome	firefox
different browsers behave differently for window.open and focus . for this code window.open www.sample.com mywindow .focus google-chrome 20 opens a new tab and focuses on subsequent open calls regardless if focus is called or not
firefox 13 opens a new tab focuses on first open does not focus on subsequent open calls disregards focus

11345317
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m experiencing the same issue since google-chrome 20 update
this thing happen in windows xp and mac os x 10.6.8. safari and mobile safari that share webkit engine with google-chrome works perfectly like firefox and ie. my css code is exactly like yours. looking in the inspector it seems that the font doesn t get downloaded. sometimes while navigating different pages that share the same css external file in my website the font loads and get displayed properly

11345496
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview r.layout.match_selection_layout before calling findviewbyid
otherwise findviewbyid will return null since the parent view has not yet been inflated attached to the screen

11345633
email	dkim
but email that are signed might fare better against spam checking software than email that aren t signed
if you have added a dkim adsp record that says all or discardable to dns then you need to make sure all outgoing mail is signed

11346225
opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
see below list of browsers and their respective compatible files html5 browsers and their supported audio file formats firefox osx win webma oga safari osx win mp3 m4a mobile safari ios4 ipad iphone ipod mp3 m4a opera osx win webma oga google-chrome osx win webma oga mp3 m4a ie9 win mp3 m4a can install the webm codec.
mp3 files are not supported by firefox and therefore jplayer will not play them while running in the firefox browser

11346937
jpql	hql
if you are not concerned with portability you can turn off the jpql validation that was added to dali in the the indigo release
if you have a jpa project with the hibernate platform selected you will still get whatever validtion hibernate tools has for jpql hql

11349905
junit	mockito
for testing frameworks junit is the standard unit testing framework
note that the frameworks mockito and powermockito are not testing frameworks themselves but they can be used within junit

11350136
portrait	landscape
first i think there s a typo in your question -- on a 640x960 display 640 wide is portrait mode not landscape
portrait is vertical landscape is horizontal

11351593
union	distinct
use union not union all to remove duplicates total runtime 178.901 ms
linked by tag_id mark_id the distinct should not be necessary if you have defined multi-column primary or unique keys on the columns

11352028
punctuation	words
if the descriptions themselves are in plain english i would see if i couldn t find a way to remove some very common words as well as punctuation and replace them with a space
edit also remove capitalization with a tolower function call for instance let s say that carpet description 1 is as follows this carpet is a wonderful addition to any room with a red floral pattern combined with a beige rustic look and carpet description 2 is a stylish rustic floral pattern complete with a contemporary red and beige running the common words remover would remove let s say the a with and this is to you would have carpet wonderful addition any room red floral pattern combined beige rustic look and stylish rustic floral pattern complete contemporary red beige then you could go through the string and do a string match and trigger a data grid match if there are over a certain number of matches

11353247
google-chrome	firefox
before debugging anything you probably should switch to google-chrome if you aren t using that already
i was looking at the google example and it worked fine there but in firefox 13 the google sydney link is sometimes missing when i reload the page

11354532
google-chrome	firefox
modal dialog are blocked as pop-up by default in firefox google-chrome and safari
the modal dialog in google-chrome are buggy and aren t truly modal - see

11356045
opera	firefox
update 1 your code does not work in opera
in addition the second event fires after a extra 500 ms delay in firefox and consecutive events do not maintain the same interval

11356219
uiview	subviews
all last moment layout should be done in -layoutsubviews for an uiview subclass which you override
when adding to table view cell you should add your subviews to cell.contentview not to cell.view directly

11365579
serializable	deserialization
remember you can add anything to the serializable stream and you are not required to add everything in your class
however you will want to at least make your class correct after the deserialization constructor runs

11366327
implements	extends
a class may extends a class that itself extends another class or implements an interface
this is not the same in theory or in practice as one class extends two classes itself

11367500
imperative	declarative
imperative programming is where mutable state is stored and read thus the ordering and or duplication of program instructions can alter the behavior semantics of the program and even cause a bug unintended behavior
in the most naive and extreme sense which i asserted in my prior answer declarative programming dp is avoiding all stored mutable state thus the ordering and or duplication of program instructions can not alter the behavior semantics of the program

11369137
jboss	glassfish
seam is not distributed alonside jboss
it is a framework intended to support development of web applications much like spring or struts and is not tied to jboss in any way you could use seam equally well in glassfish or any other application server and jboss does not require seam at all

11369249
super	self
you cannot directly tell it to call the super method
target is only a pointer to an object super does not have a separate pointer address from your self instance

11369304
multiplying	modulo
the code would look something like this not tested and not particularly elegant pretty much just insert matrix modulo s after each multiplying
if you have the choice modulo is probably more convenient basically you take your matrix modulo a number m after each power or multiplying and the individual entries of the matrix will never grow beyond m - 1 2 but obviously the result will be an algorithm for modular exponentiation thus different from what you have now

11370572
daemons	systemd
the official jenkins installer for mac sets up jenkins to run as a launchd daemons
these run in the systemd context and they have no access to any desktop or gui session which means it is not possible to draw windows on the screen any tool that displays windows like iphone simulator or sikuli is going to fail

11371082
prepare	execute
with the static sql all of that happens on the first execution and then mysql hangs on to the prepare statement
for performance reasons we wouldn t want the overhead of a hard parse every time a static statement is execute

11372621
ioexception	printwriter
btw in case you are thinking that the printwriter really doesn t have much utility remember that both printwriter and printstream absorb ioexception s from printing logic
from the javadoc for printwriter prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream

11375749
ng-switch	ng-show
normally you could use ng-switch for something like this which conditionally adds removes things from the dom unlike ng-show ng-hide which just hide show things
but ng-switch doesn t play nice with tables because it requires an extra element for the switch statement

11375787
profiling	debugging
you can t test on your device with a release profiling
change your development profiling to debugging not release

11379733
exponent	modulo
you could use fmod but since sqrt 3 cannot be exactly represented you d get bogus values for large exponent
i m rather confident that you actually need integer results 1 + sqrt 3 n + 1 - sqrt 3 n so you should use integer math exponentiation by squaring with a modulo at each step

11382570
ubuntu	linux
oracle does not include ubuntu in its list of supported linux flavours
basically it only certifies against enterprise grade distros such as rhel suse and inevitably oracle enterprise linux

11384729
viewdidload	viewwillappear
view frames are not actually useable in viewdidload
you should move all of your geometry-manipulating code into viewwillappear

11384850
udp	tcp
if you want a very low latency network channel use udp - this is lower level and does not do nearly as much work as tcp
udp simply does its best to deliver each packet to the destination without maintaining connection open packets don t necessarily arrive in order and there is know way to know if the packet even got to its destination

11385658
kerberos	ldap
your question seems to suggest that whether or not to use kerberos one of the main sub-problems you should choose first
sasl is essentially an indirection layer to allow for pluggable authentication systems and data security in existing application protocols e.g ldap smtp subversion ... although these protocols need to be aware of this extension smtp auth

11385678
comparator	comparable
you implemented comparator not comparable
you should implement comparable instead of comparator

11386657
ssl	https
this is because the browser will attempt to validate the ssl certificate by checking that the host name being used in the https url matches the host name contained inside the ssl certificate
updated to remove reference to localhost i originally thought that locally hosted web site meant on the same server as the browser which with android is obviously not the case you can avoid this validate error by changing your local host table to include the fully qualified host name contained in the ssl certificate and associating that name with the specific ip address you want to use

11390363
prepare	execute
and finally prepare bulk insert
it uses testng as the runner and uses some custom code legacy like the runwithconnection method - ensures that the connection is closed or put back to the connection pool after the callback is execute but the code below uses not reliable strategy of the statement closing - even without try finally to reduce the code

11391582
macports	homebrew
macports has a more formal process of inclusion but the main con is that it s not nearly as updated
homebrew formulas are for the most part community maintained

11392102
vim	textmate	vim	sublimetext	emacs	textmate	emacs	sublimetext
basically you can use any text editor since you do not need to compile anything even emacs or vim will work if you like
the most popular rails text editors at the moment are textmate and sublimetext 2

11392396
google-chrome	firefox
for me it only works in google-chrome
firefox opera and ie9 all do not raise the click event with middle mouse click

11392871
recvfrom	datagram
now blocking on recvfrom means one context switch to the kernel and one context switch back when something was received
it won t go any faster by having several overlapped reads in flight either because only one datagram can arrive on the wire at the same time which is by far the most limiting factor cpu time is not the bottleneck

11392871
udp	tcp
a lot of applications with rather harsh realtime requirements voip video streaming you name it nowadays use udp and while they cope well with a lost packet or two they do not at all like significant recurring packet loss
still they demonstrably work fine on networks that have a lot of tcp traffic

11392871
udp	tcp
from that everyday observation one can tell for certain that udp is definitively not dropped in favour of tcp
if anything qos might favour udp over tcp but it most certainly doesn t penaltize it

11396661
profiling	debugging
this is not supported by the eclipse debugger nativly what you want is a profiling visualvm yourkit and many more
you can then start the debugging in eclipse and connect the profiling program remotely to your running jvm instance

11398479
voip	sip
if you re looking to build a soft-phone application for voip then you should familiarize yourself with some of the established protocols for voip
this includes but is not limited to the sip protocol the rtp protocol you should also get familiar with the state of the art in what concerns voip technology today and a good place to start is to get yourself a copy of asterisk and start playing with it

11400888
haskell	scheme
for other platforms or floating-point implementations wikipedia shows the formula to compute it as in haskell
assuming you re using ieee-754 floating-point which may not be the case in scheme i don t know then the machine epsilon is well known for double-precision arithmetic it s 1.11e-16

11401213
helpers	actioncontroller
what you should do instead is scope loading of devise test helpers to your controller specs something like this class actioncontroller testcase include devise testhelpers end and use the warden helpers for capybara specs as suggested in this guide for a more detailed discussion look at this github issue page
the devise test helpers are only meant to be used in controller specs not integration specs

11401811
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you need a map that iterates in a sorted order you should use a treemap . depending on how you are doing the sort the ordering of the map may be different if you re using a linkedhashmap since the jdks may sort it slightly differently
a linkedhashmap is not a sorted map rather it just maintains insertion order

11406002
hazelcast	terracotta
in short if you re looking for a distrubuted data cache grid hazelcast or ehcache would be the tools to look at - if you re looking for task distribution using a library and not concerned about existing data grid caches jgroups would work for you
jgroups is more about task distribution and cluster management while hazelcast terracotta are more distributed caches data grids - there is certainly overlap between them when you compare all the functionality - you need to figure out what functionality is more important and perhaps easier to implement

11406247
jar	war
i build nutch from the command line and it doesn t build a war file it builds a jar file called nutch-n.n.job oh on further investigation ie
10 seconds with google i discovered that you build a war file with the command ant war

11408214
equals	gethashcode
i would recommend the following pattern if you want to override equals object o and if you want things that are not employees never to be equals to things that are employees
note that whenever you override the semantics of equals you almost certainly want to override gethashcode as well

11408500
mp4	webm	h.264	webm
it does not support mp4 h.264 video
firefox supports ogg theora and webm video

11412229
jlist	jtable
you also need an editor which is not part of the jlist api
as an alternative use a jtable with a custom renderer and editor

11413066
udp	tcp
iocp works fine with udp and integrates nicely with any tcp connections that you might also be handling we have tcp websocket or udp client connections in and tcp connections between server nodes and being able to plug all of these into the same thread pool if we want is handy
if absolute latency and udp packet processing speed is most important and it s unlikely it really is then a using the new server 2012 rio api might be worth it but i m not convinced yet see here for some preliminary performance tests and some example servers

11413527
udp	tcp
regarding your comments on udp versus tcp speed udp will always be faster
tcp offers ordering and delivery guarantees this means possible retries and holding other packets back until a lost packet finally arrives at its destination while udp only promises to send it once not caring what happens with it afterwards

11413527
udp	tcp
tcp offers ordering and delivery guarantees this means possible retries and holding other packets back until a lost packet finally arrives at its destination while udp only promises to send it once not caring what happens with it afterwards
udp will only send it s packet once and you need to figure out whether it got lost

11413527
udp	tcp
in general udp will be great for packets where missing a few usually do not matter and where only the latest packet really matters
a game may typically use a tcp stream where ordering and guaranteed delivery matters the important stuff and udp streams for object movements etc where only the latest position really matters and if one update got lost it does not matter as long as each package contain the full position instead of a delta where all packets matter

11413527
udp	tcp
a game may typically use a tcp stream where ordering and guaranteed delivery matters the important stuff and udp streams for object movements etc where only the latest position really matters and if one update got lost it does not matter as long as each package contain the full position instead of a delta where all packets matter
for your own game i suggest implementing it on tcp first and then when you have some more experience you can try move the time critical stuff where order and lost packets matter less into separate udp streams

11414134
.htaccess	httpd.conf
note you can not do something like this with .htaccess
when setting up the subdomain in httpd.conf or inside the .htaccess itself you can specify conditions like rewritecond for example

11415175
spaces	delimiter
i have chosen a spaces as a delimiter
if your filenames include spaces you should choose another delimiter which is a character that s not in your filenames

11415718
lisp	scheme
lisp it actually doesn t matter which afaik this applies to cl scheme and all the mongrels uses lower-case-snake-case-with-dashes and not lowercamelcase for variable and function names
common lisp convention is to end a predicate with p or -p rather than begin them with is-

11416230
bash	zsh
however i ve found this to be less portable to bash siblings and offspring
for example it doesn t work in my favourite shell zsh

client-side	server-side
php involves code that is ran on the server-side and does not deal with dom elements or client-side components such as the hover text tool-tip you are wishing to load
javascript is parsed by the browsers after the server-side code is crunched out and will handle additional changes to your pages after the immediate load

11417136
jar	war
if you are trying to run one of the application s classes from the command line and it is located in web-inf classes then you need to add this to the classpath for example java -classpath c software apache-tomcat-7 apache-tomcat-7.0.28 wtpwebapps seleniumebdriverproject web-inf classes org.thepackage.mainclass bear in mind that any jar files this class uses will also need to be added to the classpath
if as your comment to chin boon suggested you are looking for the java source files then these may not have been shipped within the war file - if so they won t be available you ll need to download them elsewhere

11420742
aggregate-functions	sum
check out the mysql aggregate-functions page
you need the sum aggregate function select ip page concat min date - max date as date_range sum page_views as total_page_views from stats_tracker group by page order by total_page_views desc the basic reasoning is that mysql doesn t know how you want to combine values when you group

11420742
aggregate-functions	sum
you need the sum aggregate-functions select ip page concat min date - max date as date_range sum page_views as total_page_views from stats_tracker group by page order by total_page_views desc the basic reasoning is that mysql doesn t know how you want to combine values when you group
sometimes you want to count sometimes sum and even averaging is available

11420866
shadowing	named
class you could also access class data from the instance as long as you re not shadowing variables
inspect.stack 1 3 is the function named of the current function

11421344
lapack	openblas
however all these blas implementations provide a fortran interface such that it can be linked against lapack lapack gains all its performance from blas
optimized compilers play a minor role in this respect and for gotoblas openblas the compiler does not matter at all

11421751
cpython	pypy
c extension module pretty standard stuff for cpython - this is how much of the cpython the standard library is put together
some but not all of these work with pypy if you use cpyext

11425065
super	self
clean up resources on super - clean up resources on super s super - etc
- memory reclaimed by runtime - clean up resources on self oops now you are accessing reclaimed memory and trying to interact with it exc_bad_access or worse messing with memory somewhere else on another object and not realizing it

11428336
inline-functions	inlining
compilers nowadays are smart and know without your hints whether and when to inline-functions
and inlining does not necessarily increase your program s performance and it is likely to increase your executable s size

11428530
implements	extends
having said that many browsers do but it is not standardised or universally implements
you might like to read what s wrong with extends the dom

11429933
mdpi	hdpi
evyerthing fits on screens beautifully on hdpi version....but now its resized down to mdpi the smaller proportion in height means i m more stuck for space
so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

11429933
mdpi	hdpi
so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution
for example i have an tablet with 1280x800 resolution and mdpi screens

11430080
inline	inlining
actually inlining a function is a complete implementation detail and many functions cannot be inline
this makes the existence of an inline forcing mechanism impossible

11430583
implements	extends
if it was no one would probably have built the third party libraries that implements the basic functionality although they might extends it
if you do not want to use a third party library then you will have to implements your own or only support android 3.0 onwards which is probably not the best of ideas

11438211
setinterval	settimeout
don t pass a string to setinterval
your function is a local variable which doesn t exist when settimeout eval s the string in the global scope

11438304
stateless	stateful
you shouldn t call a stateful session bean from a stateless session bean
here is some reading jee6 tutorial - session beans stateless beans don t know anything about your session

11441173
dbcontext	objectcontext
support for independent associations in dbcontext api is limited
the full support is only in objectcontext api you can use it from dbcontext api but it will still not solve your problem - independent association cannot be in modified state

11444212
namedtuple	dictionary
yes you could use namedtuple -- up to the point where you said you have to update the information inside the dictionaries. either tuples and namedtuple are not modifiable
so if you want to act on your data refering to it by name ratehr than by index number you should either use a nested dictionary structure - or create a simple class to hold your data

11452484
linefeed	delimiter
each file contains hl7 segments each segment is usually separated by a cr linefeed in the file and is denoted by a three letter mnemonic
each segment s fields are separated by a pipe delimiter | character and if a field has subsegments they are separated by a caret delimiter for patient information you ll look at the pid segment patient identifier pid segment 5 pid.5 will have the patient s lastname firstname middle initial pid segment 7 pid.7 will have the patient s date of birth usually in yyyymmdd format pid segment 8 pid.8 will have the patient sex m or f pid segment 11 pid.11 will have the patient s address add1 add2 city state zip for results you ll have to parse through the obr and obx segments obr is what the doctor ordered from the laboratory obx is the corresponding results for that order sometimes one to one sometimes one to many your focus should be on the obx segments obx segment 2 obx.2 will specify what type of result for this test usually indicated by nm numeric tx text or st string -- keep in mind not all laboratory test results are strictly numeric -- far from it

11453668
equals	compareto
treeset doesn t use hashcode and equals at all
it uses the comparator you pass as argument or the compareto method of the objects if they are comparable and you don t provide a comparator

11456192
floating-point	fractions
if you expect an integer value there a floating-point with .0 fractions part you should probably round the result of pow
because floating-point arithmetic is not perfect and when you do the result of pow is actually something more like 390624.99999 and when you truncate it to int it effectively is flattened down to 390624

11460458
shadowing	named
shadowing the built-in either as collin said you could be shadowing the built-in str one solution would be to change the variable named to str_ or something
a better solution would be to avoid this kind of hungarian naming system -- this isn t java use python s polymorphism to its fullest and use a more descriptive named instead

11462390
persistent	transient
a value object is just a value sort like 1 is a integer value and it doesn t make sense to speak about whether it is persistent or not
persistent means that the object has been saved to the database whereas transient means that it hasn t been saved yet

11464148
antivirus	norton
another thing to try is in the authentication fill in the third field with the domain like if that doesn t work double check that you can log into the account at yet another thing to note is your antivirus solution may be blocking programmatic access to ports 25 and 587 as a anti-spamming solution
norton and mcafee may silently block access to these ports

11464702
dictionary	map
possible error solutions enable -forcedict option or uncomment it jconf file to skip error words in dictionary and force running. or
map the not found triphone to the most close physical triphone in hmmlist file tiedlist . for example b-ey+t v-eh+t the first column is the name of triphone generated from your dictionary and the second column is the name of the hmm actually defined in your am. but this solution can be done if the not found triphones are little not too many

11466415
parsley	cairngorm
but be prepared that learning curve for robotlegs and parsley could be steeper for some
if not cairngorm is not bad the architecture itself is very light and small and there are numerous books and discussions you can mine through

11466456
postgresql	mysql
postgresql the fastest strategy for cleaning databases is deletion with the same empty-checks as for mysql but with relying on currval instead if table is not empty delete table else if currval is not 0 delete table end end for postgresql just deletion is much faster than just truncation even multiple
for postgresql multiple truncate doing empty checks before is slightly faster than just multiple truncate for postgresql deletion with empty checks is slightly faster than just postgresql deletion

11467334
pdfbox	itext
the only truly non-commercial and good answer is apache s pdfbox
even itext is licence-encumbered if you aren t making commercial software

11470410
ember.js	backbone.js
selecting backbone.js or similar mvc js frameworks like ember.js is useful if your application consists mainly of javascript or jquery calls or if you want to do realtime web apps and live page updates
since it is not sure if mvc javascript frameworks are really technically mature yet i would recommend to stick with pure rails if you do not trust that backbone.js can handle all your requirements

11475078
mvp	presenter
im not going to post all the code for this - my response here it is to document how you can make wpf do multi-coloured highlighting in mvp style
i haven t used inotifypropertychanged or collectionchanged here as we didn t need the changes to be multi-cast eg one presenter has multiple views

11475241
g++	gcc
if you omit the header from filea.c and if you compile the code using g++ -c filea.c # g++ instead of gcc g++ -c fileb.cpp g++ -o program fileb.o filea.o then you will get the missing reference because g++ will have created a c++ linkage functiona but will be expecting to call a c linkage functiona
however you should not compile c code with g++

11475712
svg	vml
the third method has a lot of drawbacks including the following but not only you have to check every single target platform to see if your hack works because the generated svg could be different to workaround platform specific issue
it could even be vml or canvas i don t know what does google chart regarding this point but many chart library switch rendering technology depending on the context you may have to rewrite a part of your hack if you upgrade the library because they can change the structure of the generated svg

11476240
cpython	pypy
this is only an implementation detail of cpython and you shouldn t rely on this
for instance pypy implemented the id of integer to return itself so 0-6 is -6 is always true even if they are different objects internally

11476539
sudo	passwd
the preferred method is indeed do shell script sudo killall -term java with administrator privileges as you noted this does not let you memorize the passwd in your keychain
this is deliberate -- the keychain is intended to save you from having to memorize passwd for services and such not to defeat the local security policies which is essentially what you re trying to do

11476709
vsto	add-in
you will also need to install the vsto 3.0 runtime service pack 1 if you are running visual studio 2008 service pack 1
vsto 4.0 runtime is not required in your situation because it is used with add-in created with visual studio 2010

11478984
webkit	gecko
i m not sure how you would use it but i know that media queries implemented in webkit as -webkit-device-pixel-ratio can tell you what ratio is being used
the min and max prefixes as implemented by gecko are named min--moz-device-pixel-ratio and max--moz-device-pixel-ratio

11479780
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
one is avoid gridbaglayout entirely put the jbuttons in a jpanel that uses boxlayout and put that jpanel into another that uses borderlayout at the borderlayout.page_start or north position
another which i ll show has you set the weighty of your buttons to 0 and then add another component such as an empty jlabel or here i use glue from the box class give it a decent weighty a decent height say remainder and see what happens also i believe that what devon_c_miller states that you need to create a new gridbagconstraint if you are changing fields is not true and in fact oracle defies this in its own gridbaglayout api

11480440
ubuntu	linux
for example note that this doesn t seem to handle ubuntu s ecryptfs-mounted home directories well but otherwise gives you trashspec compliance out of the box without having to reinvent the wheel
where trash lives trash on most linux systems lives in

11481615
gridbaglayout	miglayout
in this case i d go for a combination of max pref sizes or use something like the gridbaglayout
i ve not used it but many swear by the miglayout

11481620
queue	fifo
a queue is normally a fifo 1 container while a stack is lifo 2
this means that you cannot just copy the data in sequential order from your queue to your stack since that will make the elements appear in the wrong order following your description

11482403
trie	tree
note since the number of digits 10 only the size of the trie tree would be limited
a ternary search tree tst could also be used in place of the trie tree but here but since there are only 10 digits there would not be much significant advantages of using a tst i guess

11484092
getchar	getline
you can at least on nix-ish systems buffering control used to not work properly on windows i don t know if it now does solve the problem by turning off buffering for stdin so the getchar receives the input without a newline being typed
alternatively instead of using getchar for the option use so there doesn t remain anything in the input buffer to auto-satisfy the following getline

11487739
division	modulo
what you are looking for is called integer division
it is not related to the modulo at all

11488912
setcontentview	findviewbyid
then you can add it to your linear layout like you do above and then setcontentview
what you were doing above to findviewbyid does not make sense because you did not set content view

11489353
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t render the fonts like firefox or any other browser does
this is generally a problem in google-chrome running on windows only

11493872
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome and safari dev tools have a profiling tab where you can profile memory allocation timings etc of your code
this will be a place to start at least for google-chrome and safari i m not certain if ie or firefox offer such tools but i wouldn t be surprised if some third party tools exist for these browsers for testing such things.

11494336
stateless	stateful
if you need to keep an state that will be use only by the current thread request you can add some state to a stateless service using threadlocal variables or more easily using stateful session beans
now finally answering your question stateless session beans are thread safe if and only if you make them thread safe they should not have an state - the only different between a classic web service and a stateless session bean web service if that the first one will have a single instance and the second one will use a pool of instances

11494889
octal	decimal
d decimal 137 o octal 211 printf does not know you defined the numbers in octal
because d prints out the numbers in decimal

11496080
haskell	idris	haskell	agda
haskell doesn t really have the facilities to do that in any easy way there are annoying ways like reflecting all values into the type system and that s why you don t see more precise types
it sounds like you re looking for a dependently typed language like agda idris or coq

11496751
implements	extends
the clojure website says this about protocols and there s more background information and rationale about protocols on that page provide a high-performance dynamic polymorphism construct as an alternative to interfaces support the best parts of interfaces specification only no implementation a single type can implements multiple protocols while avoiding some of the drawbacks which interfaces are implements is a design-time choice of the type author cannot be extended later although interface injection might eventually address this implements an interface creates an isa instanceof type relationship and hierarchy avoid the expression problem by allowing independent extension of the set of types protocols and implementations of protocols on types by different parties do so without wrappers adapters support the 90 case of multimethods single dispatch on type while providing higher-level abstraction organization furthermore you might find solving the expression problem with clojure 1.2 an interesting read clojure expert stuart sierra introduces you to new features in clojure 1.2 that solve the expression problem a classic programming dilemma
protocols let you extends preexisting types to new methods and datatypes let you extends preexisting methods to new types all without changing the existing code

11496997
jboss	glassfish
the idea is that your application does not ship with those libraries jars and instead rely on the ones provided by the application server once you have it working if you wish to learn about different jpa implementations or different application servers then you can try running the same application on jboss which has hibernate as its jpa implementation
that tutorial uses glassfish as the application server

11498556
thin	unicorn
thin will still work but you may want to consider switching over to unicorn
for me the issue was that i added thin to my gemfile in the development section but once i did that heroku wanted to use it for production but doesn t install the gems in the development section

11499596
jms	jta
not so good performance http serialization overhead java message service pros well known standard can participate in a jta transaction can be setup so it guarantees delivery retries if needed multiple implementations to choose from good performance cons requires a separate server if not built in into your appserver requires experience with jms see this for implementations
some options asynchronous web services pros well known standard easy to debug can participate in a jta transaction cons no guarantees on delivery no persistance retry etc

11499642
jms	jta
about your transactions when you have a distributed transaction a transaction that spans multiple transactional resources two databases or a database and a jms broker etc
whether you use jta or not i really advise you to use a framework spring ejbs ... allowing you to demarcate transactions declaratively rather than demarcating them with code

11499871
touchesmoved	touchesended
if you want to update your image at some point do it on touchesended but not for every touchesmoved
rather than updating the image for every touchesmoved i d suggest you don t resave the image every time but rather add each touchesmoved to an array of data points

11500514
client-side	server-side
since the hash part of an url does not get transmitted to the server it s only usable client-side
so redirecting to it server-side is a really bad idea since you know nothing about the client s capabilities f.e

11506579
implements	extends
you are getting the error because number does not implements
you need to add a generic contstraint so that it extends both number and comparable

11506787
ssl	https
hassle - so i did say that it s easier to ssl everything but at the same time you re going to have to make sure every resource is loaded through https or do the quick solution
it can be a bit tedious if you have a bunch of links or even incompatible if you have user-submitted content hosted on a site that doesn t support ssl

11507674
voip	sip
you should always call isvoipsupported to verify that the device supports voip calling and isapisupported to verify that the device supports the sip apis
not all android-powered devices support voip calls using sip

11509564
visualvm	yourkit
visualvm that comes with the jdk itself is good for some cpu and memory profiling though it doesn t integrate well with eclipse
yourkit is a great profiling tool that integrates quite well with eclipse but its not free

11510107
g++	gcc
in windows you should consider using visual studio to compile maya plugins in linux g++ the normal procedure is like this and i am not sure how its in windows
gcc -fmessage-length 0 -os -pthread -wno-deprecated -fno-gnu-keywords --fast-math -fpic -dlinux -d_ user _ user -d_ host _ host -d_ projectname _ project -d_ buildversion _ version -dndebug -drequire_iostream -d_bool -i maya_location include -i home user customincludes -o3 -shared -o tm helloworldcmd.so helloworldcmd.cpp please note d_bool

11514859
innodb	myisam
if you are on version 5.6.4 or later it is built into the full-text search mechanism for both myisam tables and innodb tables
in versions 5.5 through 5.6.3 it is built in for myisam but not innodb tables

11514917
super	implements
if by super type and your comparison to interfaces i m guessing you want to focus on base abstract classes
though you can use non-abstract base classes but generally even an abstract class with no abstract members tends to communicate to the developer that it s intended to be implements inherited and doesn t stand on its own as a type there is no overall best practice when it comes to base abstract classes vs interfaces

11515429
prepare	execute
excerpt from mysql 5.1 reference manual e.1 restrictions on stored programs snip sql prepare statements prepare execute deallocate prepare can be used in stored procedures but not stored functions or triggers
thus stored functions and triggers cannot use dynamic sql where you construct statements as strings and then execute them

11516202
ssl	https
any insert updates to the table need to be made via an ssl connection ie
the page in question needs to start with https you shouldn t need to worry about this if you re using post data from server-side code -- the important thing in that instance is i think to ensure that that data is still being transmitted via ssl although not 100 sure on that as i m working exclusively in the world of client-side javascript

11520091
google-chrome	firefox
sadly not all browsers support these js 1.7 features google-chrome for example executes code marked as js 1.7 but does not yet support this feature
your code will work on firefox as long as you mark it as js 1.7 and with a slight modification but not on google-chrome

11520693
portrait	landscape
you have to do a fair bit more to get this to work than just set the preview to portrait mode
for example you need to choose an appropriate preview size now that it s in portrait not landscape

11521094
viewdidload	viewwillappear
hide the status bar and navigation bar in viewwillappear method and not in the viewdidload method.if your dont want to show status bar or navigation bar put that code in appdelegate class
edited this will hide your navigation bar in your view controller.put it in viewwillappear this hides your status bar

11524701
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the custom font proximanovalight is not loading so the height of the h2 element inside .steps is slightly different to what it is in google-chrome
in google-chrome the h2 has a computed height of 26 pixels whereas in firefox it s 30 pixels

11525640
ssl	https
thanks to manoj awasthi for making me realize that there were ssl methods that i couldn t use
the problem was that i was requiring net http rather than net https

11526060
super	self
i think in most classes if the return value from super init is nil and you check it as recommended by standard practices and then return prematurely if nil basically your app is still not going to work correctly
if you think about it even though that if self

11526520
libsvm	liblinear
edit in practice libsvm becomes painfully slow at 10k samples
in practice the complexity of the smo algorithm that works both for kernel and linear svm as implemented in libsvm is o n 2 or o n 3 whereas liblinear is o n but does not support kernel svms

11527976
bash	subshell
well using the subshell operator is a common way to get the output of a bash command
as it spans a subshell it is not that efficient

11528473
mp3	ogg
you may be able to achieve ogg-like sizes of your mp3 if you use a variable bitrate instead of a constant one
ios and windows phone 7 cannot play ogg audio files on their own unless you are willing to write a decoder yourself which you cannot do on windows phone 7 because you don t have raw access to the audio hardware

11528624
prng	random
instead of uuid s i would strongly suggest to use a well seeded prng such as the java jce sha1prng to create the aes keys - i don t see any strong reason why you should rely on something like an uuid in your scheme
aes keys are supposed to consist of random bits to have enough entropy thinking of them as passwords is leading into a trap you cannot use a string as a secure aes key

11529328
g++	gcc
the g++ code doesn t check for actual dynamic allocation just the presence of pointer members
see what i wrote about this warning in gcc s bugzilla when comparing the guidelines in the first edition with the third edition item 11 define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes with dynamically allocated memory

11531803
vaadin	wicket
frameworks like vaadin and seam abstract too much and take away from you the control you sometimes need over network traffic and resource consumption specially seam
wicket is built around the component abstraction which helps a lot when building complex applications but doesn t hide too much from you letting you fine-tune it to your needs

11531841
debian	centos
the oldest version of gcc i ve definitely found my program compatible with is the 4.4.5 that ships with debian squeeze
here s a complete test case showing my fork of stream compiling and using 4gb of ram with the large model after failing to do so without the option and here s what happens on a version of gcc that doesn t have the large model one running redhat 5 derived software centos 5.8 so on older versions of gcc it should throw that error out not just ignore the option

11533753
mongodb	bson
both of these are implemented by usage conventions and are not really a feature in the server implementation sense the mongodb 2.0 server does not implement any referential or relational lookup features
to be clear on the terms embedding is the nesting of objects and arrays inside a bson document

11536437
spaces	delimiter
since our words contain spaces this too requires set so our words aren t broken up
incidentally expands to a string with elements delimiter with what we ve set for ifs and is exactly what we need

11536897
ubuntu	debian
redmine condendi project pages is saying 100 open source but its not inside of offical debian ubuntu repositories
so either they didn t have packaged it or there are license legal issues with their interpretation of open source to the debian open source style

11537551
bmp	png
it s because the bmp file format doesn t support transparency while the png file format does
if you want transparency you are going to have to use png

11539713
memcpy	strncpy
also memcpy doesn t check for end of the string at all it just copies the number of bytes you have asked it to
you can use either strncpy or memcpy

11540061
keystore	jks
in java 7 pkcs12 was mainly useful as a keystore but less for a truststore see the difference between a keystore and a truststore because you couldn t store certificate entries without a private key
in contrast jks doesn t require each entry to be a private key entry so you can have entries that contain only certificates which is useful for trust stores where you store the list of certificates you trust but you don t have the private key for them

11541271
pbkdf2	md5
use a strong password hashing algorithm pbkdf2 or bcrypt to create a hash of the token
do not use sha1 or md5 for this purpose - they are not designed for hashing passwords

11541352
uilabel	nsstring
you probably don t need to specify copy for nsstring anyway but what we re doing here is making sure you re not accidentally setting a uilabel to one of those properties
if the code doesn t break you didn t fix it but now you know what the problem is trying to assign a uilabel to the wrong property

11543354
profiling	benchmarking
the process of determining costs is construct a benchmarking - with criterion or some other measurement tool profiling - with ghc s profiling support read the core - with ghc-core if the performance causes are not obvious typically you will identify some operation that is too slow
compile with profiling and determine precisely which components are costly and then inspect the code to optimize it by specializing data structures or functions changing algorithms or making other changes

11543946
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
since you are doing the connection to your database manually then you need to manually add paging code in your queries and map that code to the control i think the only data source controls that can help you since you are using oracle as the database are sqldatasource
sadly it does not support server paging out-of-the-box you would need to tweak it objectdatasource

11545310
viewdidload	viewwillappear
add this on viewdidload of your root view controller and make sure to implement the method
for doing stuff when the app becomes active its not safe to rely on viewwillappear or didappear

11546342
google-chrome	safari
did a google search and found this thread on macrumors.com with the same question that explains for links that i want to open within the webapp and not open in safari i use this for links that i want to open in safari i use the standard html link so i did another google search and found how to detect if you re using ios in javascript here s my solution i tested it in google-chrome on a desktop and on ios from safari and via a home screen webapp
here is a link to my working test note that you need to set the link s target to _blank for it to open in a new tab in safari on ios not from a webapp instance if you opened it in the safari app

11547449
client-side	server-side
this is a client-side change that cannot be accomplished using php
php is evaluated on the server-side so once the page is loaded for the user it has no control over what the user sees unless you use client-side code to call php

11548883
realloc	malloc
if you don t care to preserve the content of the old block then you might not need realloc at all
it should also be mentioned that realloc s capabilities also cover malloc s and free s functionality given the appropriate argument values

11549658
oncreate	onstart
your application is not considered as running until the oncreate onstart and onresume methods have completed
if you block in oncreate your application will never start

11550895
persistent	transient
models typically handle all domain objects that are persistent to some sort of long-term storage
they may or may not have transient values in them that have to do with the particular application s use of them

11551454
portrait	landscape
its a terrible ui choice to let the user go back and see the view in landscape while the phone is in portrait mode in any case
i solved a similar problem by not letting he user go back to the other view unless the app was in the proper orientation in this case landscape

11552213
inline	inlining
they could be being inline by the jit compiler and hence you wouldn t see them in the stack trace no matter what pdb s you had
this is actually quite common as propert getters are usually small and simple which makes them ideal candidates for inlining

11554417
serializable	deserialization
as per above exception it seems your session bean is having reference to entitymanagerfactoryimpl object which is not serializable and hence the error
to solve this you can define it as transient than it wont be serialized but only problem will be during deserialization you will have to build the object or assign reference manually

11557538
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
dotnetzip would have the same format but not the same problem
or you can use sharpziplib which supports one other interesting algorithm format as well bzip2

11557826
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
ie7 and below do not seem to support it google-chrome not supported all versions as far as i can tell safari not supported all versions as far as i can tell opera supported tested in 11.5 not sure since which version check this site maybe try some .
google-chrome and safari simply do not support the min-width property on table elements

11559445
vbscript	jscript
as a start i am posting a solution that includes using an external web site to format vbscript code
i know that the starter of the post is probably using jscript but i have not found a jscript formatter yet

11565607
sse	avx
just include the xmmintrin.h file and enable sse code generation in your project options
use sse2 since xmm is better and supported thanks to harold s comment xmm are not related to mm registers must have been mixed my mind with avx sse

11567539
persistent	transient
if we ve modeled our relationships correctly most manytoone relationships will not be automatically persistent and saving an entity with manytoone dependencies will present you with the following error message org.hibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing the introduction of a manytoonedependencysaver helps resolve these transient instances problems let s say we have the following object model and lets say we re using a builder in a test to create an instances of somesimpleentity that we ultimately need to save integration test this is going to fail on this.idobjectrepository.saveorupdate somesimpleentity
as somesimpleentity has a required field of type firstmanytomanyentity and the instances the builder created for firstmanytomanyentity is not yet a persistent entity

11570697
g++	gcc
command-line options are case sensitive option -l lower-case ell gives the name of a library it doesn t specify either the filename or the search path for example -lsdl could match either libsdl.a or libsdl.so anywhere in the search path specified on the command-line or the defaults compiled into gcc gcc manual link options option -l upper-case ell adds a directory to the search path used when finding the libraries requested with -l the full command line g++ sdltest.cpp -o sdltest -l opt local lib -lsdl would allow g++ to find opt local lib libsdl.so if it exists for example gcc manual directory options
you re telling g++ to link libsdl using -lsdl but you don t tell it where to look. add the sdl path to your command line with -l users snarehanger library sdl or whatever

11575125
persistent	transient
if you use hbm.xml simply don t map field and it will not be considered as persistent attribute
make this variable transient

11575158
vsto	add-in
so vsto interaction with excel using this method will always be slow
it is possible to use the xll interface with c# using products such as excel dna free and add-in express not free

11580185
division	modulo
similar caveats apply but now the division could even overflow if y g is more than 255
the code can be much simpler of course modeled after the c++ version does not include pushes and pops and not tested but i would be surprised if it was faster than the c++ version and in fact it ll almost certainly be slower if the base is a power of two - all sane compilers know how to turn a division and or modulo by a power of two into bitshifts and bitwise ands

11580185
division	modulo
the code can be much simpler of course modeled after the c++ version does not include pushes and pops and not tested but i would be surprised if it was faster than the c++ version and in fact it ll almost certainly be slower if the base is a power of two - all sane compilers know how to turn a division and or modulo by a power of two into bit-shift and bitwise ands
here s a version that uses ab 8-bit division

11585586
portrait	landscape
it views upside-down only in landscape mode and not in portrait and in landscape from version 2.2 if i remember correctly
configuration change occurs when it goes from portrait to landscape and vice versa

11587377
icmp	tcp
windows as strange as it seems does not officially support an icmp ping system call
the java se 5 implementation hence tries to open a tcp socket on port 7 the echo service and hopes to get some sort of reply

11591480
decoder	encoder
i got it to run using the base64 encoder decoder of bouncy castle libraries no problem at all
check your input output and use a valid base 64 encoder decoder not a sun internal one with unspecified input output

11592396
vmware	virtualbox
vmware doesn t seem to have the same issue
running on linux virtualbox seems much happier and linux can be very light weight

11592568
implements	extends
in this case i d recommend creating an additional class encapsulating the search button handling code and call that from you activities onsearchrequest of course you can also combine both approches by defining an abstract subclass of all activity subclasses you use and implements the onsearchrequest as in the example above with an external search handler
you could define an not necessarily abstract-class that extends activity implements onsearchrequest there and inherited all other activity classes from that class

11593558
ssl	https
try this should you run into ssl transport not available error message see socket transport ssl in php not enabled if your host is external and perhaps a free webhosting service you are fresh out of luck
best option would be to figure out which webhosts has the ssl transport enabled - otherwise the working with https protocol simply will not comply

11594401
scheme	racket
with respect to simply scheme the functions first and rest are not the standard ones from the scheme standard nor ones that come built-into racket
the simple scheme api is designed as part of the simply scheme curriculum to make it easy to work uniformly on a variety of data

11594521
memcached	apc
after editing a product you only need to hit the flush cache storage in the cache management admin to invalidate all entries in memcached
apc doesn t need any flushing

11595914
bitwise-and	modulo
it turns out that the modulo of powers of two can be alternately achieved using a bitwise-and operation see wikipedia modulo - performance issues x 2 n x 2 n - 1 many optimizing compilers will convert such modulo operations to bitwise-and for you but less advanced compilers for smaller and less popular cpus may not
bitwise-and is a single instruction on every cpu

11596922
multiplying	multiplication
if you would like a more specific answer then please expand your question with more details on how many and what kind of graphics you are multiplying together
webgl s blend modes do not include multiplication of the source and destination either

11597791
move	drag
then move the block to appropriate region
most themes have a footer area that you drag and drop the block s handler to not to the exact region

11598519
dictionary	map
choosing between dictionary and lookup isn t hard from msdn emphasis mine a resembles a the difference is that a maps keys to single values whereas a maps keys to collections of values
you can create an instance of a by calling tolookup on an object that implements since you will only need to map keys to single values a dictionary is the right choice

11600535
union	distinct
some database systems do not support the full outer join functionality directly but they can emulate it through the use of an inner join and union all selects of the single table rows from left and right tables respectively
the same example can appear as follows other-ways you can make a master view witch contains all the distinct keys of all the tables to left join with all the tables

11600642
queue	fifo
if you want something concurrent you choose a blocking queue because it s implemented for you and doesn t have bugs like your code has
if you want fifo which is often what you want you won t choose a treeset

11601338
xslt	xquery
therefore all xslt elements and some attributes are in the namespace and any element with name that hasn t this namespace-uri is not an xslt element
here are more examples xml schema svg xsl-fo xhtml xpath 2.0 and xquery functions xlink mathml therefore by modifying the xslt namespace-uri in your stylesheet to something else you are effectively saying the names prefixed by the associated prefix in your case xsl belong to the namespace not to the xslt namespace -- therefore they are not xslt elements

11601397
implements	extends
but you cannot have something like an internal frame in a desktop pane. i guess you could take the following actions just use multiple stages windows with the drawback that they will float quite uninspiredly on your desktop use swing as a container with jdesktoppane and jinternalframe and integrate javafx here s a nice how-to implements your own framework that emulates mdi behavior find a framework that provides mdi behavior wait for a future release of javafx that hopefully provides mdi support as far as i know there s a change request pending...
first of all for your approach you don t really need to and therefore should not extends connectdb from application as you just use the start method to create new stages

11602795
boxlayout	grouplayout
i think that both the boxlayout as well as the flowlayout will do just fine
so using grouplayout would be not java like or how do i have to understand it grouplayout is to put it simply really hard to hand-code and results mostly in a lot of code

11603395
uicontrol	uibutton
if uicontrol doesn t do what you want you ll need to roll your own event management
uibutton is a subclass of uicontrol

11603873
boost	stl
in particular see the implementation of the boost classes you need
if they don t depend on stl and you re sure that the memory footprint is the same for both compilers and you have provided custom new delete it should not generally be a problem see remarks below

11604886
opera	safari
npn_pluginthreadasynccall has never worked for me with opera
for that matter it doesn t work on safari 5.1 either

11607221
equals	gethashcode
to quote the documentation a hash function must have the following properties if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

11607221
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

11608380
daemons	systemd
whenever is backed by the cron daemons of your systemd so if your systemd has no cron daemons it won t work
rufus-scheduler is running inside of your ruby runtime it s not depending on a cron daemons but if your ruby runtime is going down the schedules will be lost

11609173
implements	extends
yes if you let a implements an interface then all classes that extends that class also implements that interface
not entirely sure what you mean with letting g implements the interface

11609201
implements	extends
if you implements the interface call it i in class a and b c + d extends a then b c and d will implements the i interface as well
this means you will be able to write but also because logically your data model will become a is an i and b is an a so this implies b is an i if class g implements the interface but doesn t inherit a you will have to implements the functionality defined in i in the class g as well

11609233
client-side	server-side
you simply cannot rely on client-side validation
of course you need server-side validation

11609264
comparator	comparable
you save memory by not creating new comparator objects and comparator is useful if you are comparing objects of different types which is not your case
your listdata object should implements comparable not comparator interface

11611104
daemons	systemd
more buses do not mean more instances of the dbus daemons it only means more communication channels
in a systemd you usually have one dbus daemons with one or more buses

11614738
udp	tcp
a socket tcp udp works in the transport layer. a port number comes here in the layer and this is not the ethernet port
you can have a tcp socket bound to say port 88 as well as a udp socket bound to port 88. you may also have raw sockets which can directly use the ip headers. this may require root administrative priviledge. here seems you need to decode the ip packets and get to the specific protocol on top it

11614941
qevent	qobject
actually you might event not call it there you may reimplement qwidget changeevent and intercept any qevent languagechange event
just calls qobject tr for each user visible string in the ui

11615512
spaces	delimiter
this is my current guess based on the following examples but i could have missed something. with y with non-midnight time ditto midnight time midnight time with spaces a vector with one midnight and one non-midnight time so it looks like dirk s answer is the way to go
going partly from the comments it would be nice if you could modify the question accordingly it seems that this is not a case of formatting y vs y or spacing delimiter but of strptime automatically setting the format to skip the hours minutes seconds when a midnight time is specified

11619373
client-side	server-side
what you want is not exactly possible if you want a client-side only solution all you can do is ask a user to authenticate with their account like the example above
but if you want to access one specific table that you share you have to have some kind of server-side code

11619911
nsstring	nsobject
consider this code this will compile without warning but when run will cause an exception - because it assumes the object in the array is nsnumber but in fact it is nsstring terminating app due to uncaught exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - __nscfconstantstring isequaltonumber unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x6cbfc
you have interface viewcontroller nsobject this should probably be interface viewcontroller uiviewcontroller reason so your viewcontroller class is currently inheriting from nsobject which does not implement initwithcoder

11622152
postgresql	mysql
sqlite is for local site and postgresql is very populare but i think it s just a choice
if you want to use mysql it isn t a problem

11625318
implements	extends
you had a correct hunch about implements onpause and onresume now my idea without being able to see all of your code is that you are not dealing with the thread correctly
in your panel class which extends surfaceview you should have something like these two functions ignore the loop part if you are not using a loop in your run method

11625473
zlib	libpng
the problem was not in mini_magick the problem is in delegates options in your imagemagick if you run convert -list configure you should have something like this but in my case key delegates had only xml and zlib values delegates xml zlib the solution was to install imagemagick from source and add params to . configure you can find installations instructions for macos here update for some reasons a system can be without jpeg convert libraries
to fix this you can install imagemagick using apt-get or ppa with all needed dependencies or try to install manualy sudo apt-get install libjpeg62 see more info here update 01 26 2013 to install libpng follow this link and find source code block. copy a link for a latest version 1

11628041
google-chrome	firefox
it seems like a bug in google-chrome not jquery
it works fine in firefox

11628141
emacs	textmate
actually at a personal perspective the only case where i prefer to run textmate rather than emacs is when i want to edit markdown files
yet the path to have the same quality of preview on emacs is not so difficult and probably i should investigate it

11628158
uiview	subviews
it looks as though customimageview is a subclass on uiviewcontroller not uiimageview or uiview
you can t add a uiviewcontroller as a subviews like that

11630454
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton is subclass of uicontrol and here you can see how other events can be handled and what events you can handle
delegation is also common practice but not for uicontrol

11635986
innodb	myisam
anything over 4 gigs . to troubleshoot you could try and add skip-innodb in the my.cnf if you are not using innodb at all
as mentioned myisam shouldn t be using ibdata. what are your innodb settings in your my.cnf or in the mysql shell type show variables like innodb

11635986
innodb	myisam
as mentioned myisam shouldn t be using ibdata. what are your innodb settings in your my.cnf or in the mysql shell type show variables like innodb
innodb_data_home_dir innodb_data_file_path if you are not using innodb at all you should be able to safely remove the ibdata and ib_logfile s and restart mysql

11635986
innodb	myisam
innodb_data_home_dir innodb_data_file_path if you are not using innodb at all you should be able to safely remove the ibdata and ib_logfile s and restart mysql
normally though removing these without dropping the tables first will cause issues. see how to shrink purge ibdata1 file in mysql if you do have a myisam table over 5gigs it s recommended that you use innodb anyway

11639339
innodb	myisam
note that this only works for myisam not innodb
excerpt from myisam notes for myisam tables you can specify auto_increment on a secondary column in a multiple-column index

11640349
dbcontext	objectcontext
so instead of your onsavingchanges event handler you use this method will be called whenever you call arsentities.savechanges and you can perform custom actions before you call the base.savechanges of the base dbcontext arsentities must be derived from dbcontext of course. you also can access the underlying objectcontext from the dbcontext here was a similar question and answer about change auditing with ef 4.1 dbcontext entity framework 4.1 dbcontext override savechanges to audit property change
dbcontext does not have an oncontextcreated event but that s not a problem because you don t need it to achieve the same

11640449
config	ini
this may include such simple problems as php files not being proper utf8 very unlikely on linux servers i d say but usually consists of problems with mysql config server and client database and table default encoding and collation and the correct connection settings
problems may also be caused by incorrect php ini or mbstring configuration settings

11641540
udp	tcp
generally speaking you need to provide your own means of defending against out of order or dropped packets while using udp
there isn t a standard way of dealing with this problem -- other than using tcp instead

11642511
postgresql	mysql
it s a shame postgresql isn t more popular than mysql since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.
the only way you could do this in mysql would be to create one table with a single auto_increment column insert into this table get the last inserted id how exactly you do this depends on which mysql client library you are using and then use this id when inserting the row into one of the other tables

11643682
updatepanel	scriptmanager
when you use updatepanel then you can not call javascript like above
you have to use scriptmanager so change your page.clientscript.registerstartupscript this.gettype mykey javascript

11645666
google-chrome	firefox
the console output tampermonkey will be tampermonkey started script start... calling functionofinterest ... userscript is in the main page. script end tampermonkey started script start... calling functionofinterest ... userscript is in the framed page. the frame s id is iframe2 script end 1 it will also work as a straight-up google-chrome userscript if you remove the unsafewindow line s
unsafewindow doesn t play nice with frames iframes on google-chrome tampermonkey or firefox

11647438
uicontrol	uibutton
by including it you are removing the normal implementation and this will be preventing your buttons from being created properly you will in fact be returning a uicontrol
calling the super implementation in a category does not call uibutton s implementation but the superclass of uibutton - uicontrol

11651296
ubuntu	linux
since my server is on ubuntu i can use iptables firewall iptables -a input -p tcp --dport 8080 -s localhost -j accept iptables -a input -p tcp --dport 8080 -j drop but
on ubuntu i am not sure about other linux oses iptables will disappear after reboot

11654187
serializable	deserialization
so serializable at this instance doesn t make sense
and deserialization would never restore that handle

11654539
jpql	hql
hql the hibernate jpql variant supports it though
the specifications defines the sum expression as the following so no your query isn t valid jpql

11655647
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so in your example you need an extra padding-top for google-chrome -webkit-padding-before
this will apply the padding only to webkit browsers google-chrome safari etc. but not to firefox or ie or opera

11659063
prepare	execute
the principle of a prepare statement is to prepare the execution plan of the query of which the order by clause is a part and to execute the query one or several times after with varying parameters
if the query is not complete the execution plan can t be prepare and reused

11659155
google-chrome	safari
i tried visiting the site in safari for the first time i normally use google-chrome and noticed that it was showing the correct favicon
i tried clearing my cache in google-chrome again twice to no avail but after more searching i found that apparently favicons aren t stored in the cache

11659379
mongodb	bson
as an aside of all the possible ways of versioning a mongodb database i m not sure that keeping the datadir itself in a git repository is the best way to go
alternatives running mongodump will result in a bson -dump of your database or collection while running mongoexport will result in a json or csv

11660343
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have not tested this in safari but it should work because it s working in google-chrome
jquery 1.7 doesn t work with the following one solution which i did get to work in google-chrome firefox and ie is to use selectors which work in ie and selectors which work in google-chrome based on the fact that one way works in ie and the other in google-chrome in ie this returns nodes using the namespace firefox and ie require the namespace and in google-chrome the selector returns nodes based on the non-namespace selector

11661914
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if that line is commented # uncomment it. it should look like loadmodule rewrite_module modules mod_rewrite.so then look for something like you should find a allowoverride none change it to allowoverride all restart your wamp server then set your .htaccess to nickb suggestion if it still doesn t work just do a search in the httpd.conf for allowoverride none and change them all to allowoverride all as there may be a couple
make sure mod_rewrite is enabled in apache config as well as allowoverride all to get it workign in wamp click on wamp icon in systray go to apache then click on httpd.conf search the file for mod_rewrite.so

11663149
memcached	apc
ofcourse you will have to install a memcached on your server
i would say that it s a bad idea because apc caches are not shared between individual php processes php-fpm could be an exception

11666981
namenode	hdfs
i think you should not execute bin hadoop namenode -format because it is used for format the hdfs
in the later version hadoop has move these functions in a separate scripts file which called bin hdfs

11667013
client-side	server-side
if you want to recognize a returning user immediately then you would have to check client-side for this and reload your page once when the appropriate conditions are met js sdk recognized returning user fb.getloginstatus but php did not recognize him yet have your php code set a variable flag that your js can evaluate then reload page via js so that php can read the cookie that was just set by the client-side js
the problem is that the php user check doesn t recognized facebook session well of course it can t because server-side it can only access the cookies set for your domain

11668371
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu this might to be a bug at the moment in the debian ubuntu version
i found the following two bug reports that seem to match your bug to sum the bug reports up there doesn t seem to be a real fix to that yet but for some people starting netbeans with the following command is a workaround unfortunately i don t have a debian bases system here at the moment so i cannot test if it would work for me

11668371
debian	linux
i found the following two bug reports that seem to match your bug to sum the bug reports up there doesn t seem to be a real fix to that yet but for some people starting netbeans with the following command is a workaround unfortunately i don t have a debian bases system here at the moment so i cannot test if it would work for me
gentoo it seems that the same bug also effects gentoo linux

11669553
udp	tcp
you can t possibly know that the next two packets you receive will be a tcp packet followed by a udp packet
obviously you have received a packet that isn t a tcp packet and you are just casting it to tcppacket based more on hope than experience

11671483
ember.js	backbone.js
ember.js is 42k minified+gzip while backbone.js is just 5.6kb
ember.js packs a lot of power in it which the barebones backbone.js doesn t give you

11672180
debian	linux
it s the same as in debian armhf and i think any other linux that uses armhf
just a note to add to the other answers it works fine on the debian install but does not yet work on the raspbian install because of missing compiler support

11677445
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome if you try to do the same you cannot type any more after the 3
it seems that google-chrome works correctly firefox doesn t

11678979
config	ini
this does require that the file you re talking about will get parsed as php otherwise the config value for php won t do anything as php isn t loaded or initialized for the request
you can set a file to be included before any code runs by using the auto_prepend_file ini setting

11679821
draggable	droppable
you noted that the accept function is called multiple times and this is by design as you can see in the jquery ui source code when a draggable is being dragged the accept function will be evaluated for each droppable space on the board
this means that when you start moving a piece each droppable space will calculate whether or not it can accept the piece

11680310
bash	subshell
i d expect a new shell started via bash -c to not have access to your function
i d expect it to only be available to subshell started with or or

11683421
udp	tcp
you are using sock_dgram which indicates a udp socket
udp is not like tcp there is no connection really you just send packages of data and hope they reach the target

11684426
boost	allocator
i obtained a major boost of performance by not re-creating the system of equation from scratch but only by merely updating the system incrementally from the previous system
this avoided allocator memory for the new objects initialising new objects and often the system would be nearly the same so i would have only to modify tiny bits to update it

11684773
portrait	landscape
option one if the layout for portrait vs
landscape is not too different then i recommend staying with one .xib and having a little bit of code in your view controller to adjust layout on rotation

11686053
super	extends	implements	extends
another way of implements those methods is to use the equalsbuilder and hashcodebuilder from the apache commons lang library those builders provide with semantics to add the super invocation
as you already pointed out it means that if you have two classes one extends the other and the subclass doesn t override neither equals or hashcode then when checking for two instances for equality or adding to a hashed structure both will behave as if they were from the same class

11687596
arraylist	treeset
note that using the linkedhashset implementation will also maintain the insertion order like as in an arraylist while a hashset implementation wouldn t maintain the insertion order
if you d prefer automagic sort of entries then use the treeset implementation instead

11691817
udp	tcp
it s not at all the case with udp
once your serversocket has accepted the connection from the client socket the negotiation has been finalized and the tcp stream is dedicated to that communication

11692208
serializable	deserialization
the serialversionuid field is not necessary but strongly recommended as this maintains the binary compatibility between different versions of the class and the serializable representations of its instances
so when you add later a new serializable field to the class then you d need to change the serialversionuid field usually just incrementing it by 1 is sufficient to prevent problems during deserialization of an instance of an older version of the class

11694246
client-side	server-side
client-side js file server-side you need a server-side handler that will listen to get requests on url to load rows
those requests will have up to 3 parameters start - 0-based index of the first item to return count - number of items to return parentid - id of the parent of the children items that are requested. optional not present for 1st call because 1st-level objects have no parents . that handler can be written in your favorite server-side language c# with asp.net mvc ruby etc. the job of your server handler will be to return a json structure containing the following 3 attributes client server communication to build upon my previous example as soon as the grid is started-up client-side it will request something like the server would return the following the grid will display the 2 fruits

11695390
dictionary	map
unless you have a finite number of values to look up a dictionary may not be the best choice
it looks like you re mapping ranges of values to colors to apply to a height map

11699424
selecteditem	selectedindex
the strange thing was that if the list was empty when the page has been loaded nothing happens instead when i removed the last element from the list the application raised the exception selecteditem must always be set to a valid value . now the problem is solved
i ve found the same problem with my app. but i noticed that it happens when i delete all the elements of the list bounded to the listpicker in the viewmodel. so it isn t necessary to bind selectedindex with another property since the problem depends only on the list bounded. here is my code which work fine for me the list in view model the handler for selectionchanged where corsi is the class type of the list

11702007
operands	scalar
the smartmatch operator obviously doesn t take lists as operands
as such it evaluates its operands in scalar context

11703735
portrait	landscape
as you didn t post any real code on how you manage those fragments keep in mind that if you are in the portrait orientation in the b activity showing fragment b and by clicking or whatever you do you replace the fragment with c this will not be carried to activity a if you switch orientation to landscape
i thought of only implementing the listener in activity b and passing to activity a when in landscape orientation but i think it would have been finished before it even got to pass due to the above code

11704224
macports	homebrew
homebrew is generally a bit nicer than macports as it doesn t require lots of sudo action
here s an article that guided me to upgrading my install of bash as for steps install homebrew from the docs on their homepage install git using homebrew optional but nice to have a more up-to-date git brew install git now install bash brew install bash add this install of bash to the allowed shells list echo usr local bin bash | sudo tee -a etc shells

client-side	server-side
you cannot use a client-side variable in your server-side code
you can however use a server-side variable in the client-side code because the server-side code executes first

11706251
sudo	passwd
here are some examples note first sudo is just for caching the passwd at the first time of running this trick doesn t work for quick command lines like ls date as it takes some time untill debugger will attach to the process you have to type your command in two places you can ignore to run the process to the background if it s already doing that after finishing debugging you ll have to manually kill the background process killall -v tail
the easiest way is to use sudo other solution would be to run the debugger first and monitor for new specific processes. e.g

11707360
super	extends
this includes the protected ones from its super-classes but not protected methods of others super classes
the problem here is that main doesn t extends cloned

11707673
trie	tree
trie is the same in terms of printing imo.
this is what i did and this is what i suggest you to do as well take some paper and draw your trie there. now think how would you like to print the trie. i think trie is composed like n-tree not a binary but a tree that has a lot of children

11707993
hive	hdfs
i m not sure if this is a quirk of hive or the serde but you need to do it
then copy the data into hdfs

11709903
client-side	server-side
the code you provided is html which is on the client-side meaning that you wouldn t really process the text user s details there
i m sure that if you tell us what the server-side code is a lot more people will provide input

11710020
uiview	subviews
in ib just drag the label onto the the uiview you are using for the circle image or if you are not using ib just add the label to the circle like this
make the label a subviews of the uiview you are using to present the circle

11710295
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 9 does not dispatch the change event
safari 5 does dispatch the change event

11710464
factors	matrix
you would rather get a scaling animation because 180 rotation equals scaling the coordinate system by factors -1
this is because scaling is a linear transformation and qpropertyanimation interpolates between the start and end value so the middle between start and end is calculated using which is not what you want for rotation matrix

11710658
qfile	qtextstream
you can however have multiple devices qfile for the same underlying file and each of them can then be read using another stream instance
note that a stream qtextstream qdatastream in qt doesn t handle the position in the underlying device

11710798
ienumerable	ilist
update why is it implemented so because it it implemented over ienumerable not ilist
and thus it looks like ienumerable it quacks like ienumerable

11710868
swt	swing
eclipse uses the standard widget toolkit swt not included in jre by default netbeans uses swing included
since recent eclipse versions it includes windowbuilder to create swing or swt via drag n drop

11710905
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i believe your issue is that you are expecting the view in a storyboard or .xib to show up when you create a uiviewcontroller the way you are which will not work
you need to either wire up a push segue in the storyboard which will require a uinavigationcontroller or present the new controller modally which you can also do in the storyboard

11711308
google-chrome	firefox
so far i can only make this work in google-chrome writing c zebra will alert c zebra
firefox doesn t sustain the comments inside the function body when decompiled unfortunately

11712368
serializable	deserialization
item 2 the singleton if serializable must ensure that deserialization doesn t create a new instance is guaranteed by specification of enum serializable
enum constants are serialized differently than ordinary serializable or externalizable objects

11714003
equals	gethashcode
from msdn if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

11714003
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
edit while the msft .net implementation of gethashcode for array.istructuralequatable obeys the principles in the above msdn documentation it appears that the authors did not implement it as intended

11714185
noexcept	throw
c++11 introduces the noexcept operator and function decorator
the throw specification from classic c++ is now deprecated. it also provides for function introspection so that code can be written to handle situations differently depending on whether or not non-throwing operations exist

11715508
ssl	https
but saying that sites should all be on ssl unless there is a particular reason to do otherwise in one case makes sense to me
good examples of case-by-case exceptions where you should still offer ssl but not force a redirect the site is serving large binary downloads music video software distributions so allowing more caching and faster downloads is important show data the clients are archaic ie or embedded clients that just can t do ssl adequately again show it s actually a problem there are very many resources on the site and you want robots to index it over https if you use ssl everywhere you will use a few more machine resources in ways that can be optimized if they become important

11715508
ssl	https
good examples of case-by-case exceptions where you should still offer ssl but not force a redirect the site is serving large binary downloads music video software distributions so allowing more caching and faster downloads is important show data the clients are archaic ie or embedded clients that just can t do ssl adequately again show it s actually a problem there are very many resources on the site and you want robots to index it over https if you use ssl everywhere you will use a few more machine resources in ways that can be optimized if they become important
if you don t use ssl you either spend more developer resources to consider security case-by-case or quite likely you will be more prone to account theft

11717344
queue	fifo
however for 1 the secondary data structure should not be any kind of list or array otherwise it will be no more efficient to scan your secondary index as to scan the original queue itself
there is one very important point you ve not mentioned in your question and that is whether your queue of items is sorted or have some kind of ordering called a priority queue or unsorted called a plain fifo

11717946
concave	convex
additionally this approach might not always work for concave polygons
thus you might want to split concave polygons into a series of convex ones

11718458
implements	extends
i m not hugely familiar with jsf - however i have recently implements a number of rss feed very quickly using spring 3 which internally uses the very useful rome library
i made particular use of spring 3 s org.springframework.web.servlet.view.feedabstractrssfeedview which you can extends to easily allow conversion your domain objects into an rss view with minimal effort

11718750
profiling	debugging
edit in fact it seems only development provisioning profiling are ok for debugging
i had a similar issue when trying to debugging an app with ad-hoc provisioning... check which provisioning you re using it seems ad-hoc provisioning cannot be used for debugging

11720715
implements	extends
the concept of interfaces comes from abstract classes where as abstract classes contains prototypes of method or abstract methods and can have few of its methods defined also while interfaces contains only the prototypes or signature of method or abstract methods whose definition is to be provided by the implements class. so from the above statement it is clear that interfaces are like 100 percent abstract classes where - none of its method is defined. mentioning it again interfaces are like 100 percent abstract classes but not the classes
interfaces are contracts for what a class can do a reason for introducing interface is we can extends only single class but interface brought a new thing implement in java so we can implement thousands of interface.so we can not say that it is a class

11722403
comparator	comparable
treeset is a set implementation that does indeed use comparator as explained in the javadoc - emphasis mine note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

11723027
firefox	safari
for ie only firefox google-chrome and safari because mac does not have nor support the insert key safari will never ever support insert mode
for google-chrome and firefox insert mode is not encouraged for support as mac does not have it

11728065
nginx	lighttpd
in nginx which i use that s done by the proxy_pass command
there is likely such a command not exact but similar in which you can proxy information to in lighttpd

11729796
xslt	xquery
xquery is a separate language from xslt not one that s embedded within xslt
so depending on how you are launching xslt you can look for a parallel method for launching xquery

11729796
xslt	xquery
xquery is not a querying language used within xslt - that s more like xpath
xquery is something you would use instead of xslt or beside it

11730665
uiview	subviews
the problem here is that the uiview doesn t own its uiviewcontroller
in the first block of code you held the uiview around by adding it to a subviews but let the uiviewcontroller go away

11731898
ssl	https
if you have apache httpd performing your ssl termination which is why you would have sslcertificatefile and other directives in there then you don t need any additional setup in tomcat to handle confidential communication
if you want to configure tomcat to accept https communication then your etc apache2 crt ssl file needs to be a java keystore and not a bare certificate file like apache httpd uses

11738041
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is an enterprise quality database and not fit for embedded devices
mysql while smaller will also be a tight fit in an embedded device

11738405
punctuation	words
so my suggestion would be given the input this code generates in order to get rid of the words with commas attached you might want to eliminate the punctuation before counting the words by adding to the code above that yields
first in the current code the worddict gets created anew for each tweet which is probably not what you want. also using the method str.count you run the risk of counting a words that occurs in the tweet as a part of another words as is the case .count as would be 2 rather than 1 since as appears in the words case as substring. i would suggest splitting the tweet by whitespace and than iterating over the unique words in that split instead like and or simply iterating over the words and incrementing the counts in the dictionary for every occurrence of a words i m not sure which is more efficient

11739987
config	ini
it s not uncommon to use either the config framework or a simple settings object that you serialize deserialize
i don t know you requirement but it can enlight us to describe a bit why you want to use ini files

11743007
multiplying	subtract
curiously the value 0a is part of the machine instructions and substituting a different number will cause those instructions to multiplying or divide by other quantities but the instructions are not documented as being general-purpose multiplying divide-by-constant instructions
it s also interesting to note the variety of approaches processors used for adding or subtract packed bcd

11743324
prng	random
it doesn t return an integer it returns a random object with the argument being the seed value for the prng
i think you misunderstand how random works

11744064
profiling	debugging
1 since it is a decimal conversion error and assuming the most common case of precision not enough to support your value you can write a quick script and run it in sql server to see which one is at fault. untested script below 2 you can use sql profiling to see the parameters that have been passed to the sql server during execution
you can also use other debugging information provided by the sql profiling

11744653
spaces	delimiter
the galuano1 answer certainly strips spaces from a value it should not be required in your case
the default token delimiter for for f are space and tab

11744784
boost	eigen
installing the intel mkl is very easy installing boost not much more difficult though it s a long time since i tried and the past always looks rosy
i know nothing about eigen or mtl beyond their existence

11746880
innodb	myisam
it may be that on the first execution of the query the index and or data blocks that had to be accessed were not in the innodb buffer pool or the myisam key cache and had to be retrieved from disk
those blocks will remain in the innodb buffer pool and the myisam key cache wholly independent of the mysql query cache

11746880
innodb	myisam
if you want to start with no blocks in the innodb buffer pool or the myisam key cache then shutdown and restart the mysql server
but even if those blocks are not in the innodb buffer pool or the myisam key cache it s likely those blocks may still be in memory in the os file system cache

11747058
realloc	malloc
however you should make sure that your code survives possible errors in realloc like so also you should say int main void for your main function declaration
finally you shouldn t cast the result of malloc or realloc since a is implicitly convertible to any other object pointer

11750299
equals	compareto
the two jres have a different implementation of collections.sort that results in a different output order when ordering array elements that are reporting they are equals that is the result of the compareto function
because of the above spring bug which reports some handlers as being equals when it shouldn t it means that the ordering of the handlers was non-deterministic across the two jres

11751620
awt	swing
don t mix swing with awt components unless it is necessary
it is not worth even learning how to use awt components at this point in time use swing only for best results and best help

11751859
oursql	mysql-python
roll your own or use oursql instead
mysql-python does not support the context manager protocol

11756005
google-chrome	firefox
it throws the exception not allowed to load local resource google-chrome google-chrome settings
same applies to about urls in firefox

11756364
strcpy	strncpy
you need to use strcpy or a safer version strncpy
note that with strncpy you have to nul-terminate the string yourself in case there was not enough space

11756364
strcpy	strncpy
examples note that in this case we know there is enough space in c so we can use strcpy
if we don t know you can cut the string up to where you can handle it note that in the case of strncpy if there is not enough space the string is not nul-terminated and you have to do it manually

11759623
floating-point	fractions
the reason for this is that binary floating-point represents numbers only with bits that stand for powers of two
which powers of two depends on the exponent of the floating-point value but regardless of the exponent every bit in the fractions portion represents some power of two such as .5 .25 .125 .0625 and so on. since .8 is not an exact multiple of any power of two then when the available bits in the fractions portion are all used the resulting value is only close to .8

11766018
n-gram	words
you can create all n-gram ranging from 1 till 5 as follows more examples and information can be found in scikit-learn s documentation about text feature extraction
update since scikit-learn 0.14 the format has changed to full example which outputs the following note that the words i is removed not because it s a stopword it s not but because of its length this should could be much simpler these days imo

11769306
rpm	yum
finally it is possible that version or rpm does not match the version of python you installed. be careful with centos and version of python you install - later python than 2.4 can break yum
i think for your version yum is built with python 2.4

11773531
isotope	masonry
edit ok my first answer was not useful here - absolute positioning won t work in case of masonry s isotope s relatively positioned container with absolute positioned elemens contained therein
the solution is rather to take the content of a masonry isotope element out of the dom on click and append it temporarily to the body

11774342
octal	decimal
it s done so the js engine doesn t assume that a number should be an octal if it starts with 0 for example
well always when you use decimal use parseint mynumber 10 to be sure that it s parsed as decimal integer

11775600
config	ini
it turns out that stream wrappers are not resolved by the config loader and this does not work
one thing i have not been able to test correctly is the per-directory configuration .user.ini or the ini section

11777250
yslow	pagespeed
use pagespeed google and yslow yahoo browser s extensions with firebug or not for view all good pratices for improve your website faster
for sample this is a list of good practises checked by yslow in your website minimize http requests use a content delivery network avoid empty src or href add an expires or a cache-control header gzip components put stylesheets at the top put scripts at the bottom avoid css expressions make javascript and css external reduce dns lookups minify javascript and css avoid redirects remove duplicate scripts configure etags make ajax cacheable use get for ajax requests reduce the number of dom elements no 404s reduce cookie size use cookie-free domains for components avoid filters do not scale images in html make favicon.ico small and cacheable also there not advantages or disavantages to use subdomain for speed.

11777852
uiview	subviews
im not sure i understand but you can create a viewqueue where subviews can be reused like a uitableview everytime you need a uiview you ask the queue nsmutablearray to get an existing view
if the queue is empty create a new uiview if it already contains views re use an existing uiview stored in the queue

11777852
uiview	subviews
only if the uiview should be visible add it to screen uiview retrieved from queue if its not visible anymore remove it from its superview and add it to the queue
you can then use a uiscrollview to show the subviews

11782378
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie are rendering it correctly
not sure what firefox is doing

11783313
g++	gcc
g++ -dcompile_for_linux ..... for windows if using msvs you can change the preprocessor directives tab in the project properties actually you don t need to since compile_for_linux isn t defined but you can add a compile_for_windows for consistency
it depends on the compiler you re using but for gcc you can specify preprocessor directives from the command line so you ll just need to add compile_for_linux in your makefile

11784899
punctuation	words
for multiple words like a full name first and last simply add a space to the alternation edited to allow apostrophe and hyphen punctuation
if your goal is to have each words have no more than 1 capital letter in a row at a time and assuming it s okay to restrict to ascii letters try something like this in other words the string must be entirely composed of either lowercase letters or uppercase letters not followed by another uppercase letter

11786195
oncreate	onstart
edit i m not quite sure if oncreate is the correct place to show the dialog
try putting ensurecategoryselected in onstart instead of oncreate

11787914
rpm	yum
remedy install the perl-termreadkey package # yum install perl-termreadkey let the package manager tools resolve the rpm dependencies for you
because you installed term readkey from cpan and those files are not registered in the rpm database

11789661
gif	ico
rls en q mac+osx+icobundle ie utf-8 oe utf-8 now if it were only possible to mix-in an animated gif version into that one file it d be a complete icon set sadly not possible and requires a separate file and code snippet
i found an app for mac osx called icobundle that allows you to easily drop a selection of ico files in different sizes onto the icobundle.app prompts you for a folder destination and file name and it creates the multi-icon .ico file

11793662
implements	extends
when a class implements realizes multiple interfaces it is not multiple inheritance
the inheritance extension relationship in fact only holds between constructs of the same kind an interface may extends another interface or a class another class

11794106
inline	inlining
it knows it can never be inline so readily uses edi ebx for storage for the long variable
you got the slow version because the jitter didn t know up front that inlining wouldn t work

11795066
haskell	agda
by convention in agda but sadly not in haskell scope of lambda extends rightwards as far as possible so you can often leave abstractions unbracketed when they re the last argument of a higher-order operator you can see i did that with pi
your agda type becomes

11796285
shadowing	named
the right way to do this is probably in addition you might want to use open_ instead of open as the parameter named just to avoid confusion and temporarily shadowing the built-in function
if you had written your function as you would have gotten a nameerror complaining that the named foo is not defined

11797307
jar	manifest.mf
if your executable jar is not running which means it is not created properly
for better understanding extract the jar file or view using any tool for windows 7-zip is nice one and check the file under meta-inf manifest.mf

11802237
gif	png
gif is not recommended see
change your graphic from gif to png

11804092
implements	extends
note that this does add a requirement to have python and scipy installed on your system but i didn t see many implementations that weren t subscription based and took complex arguments so you might be restricted to other language packages without implements it yourself
edit answer below shown to not extends to complex numbers edit

11804947
namenode	hdfs
the hdfs client such as hadoop fs -put directly communicates with the namenode and other datanode processes without ever having to access the local one
it is actually quite common on large clusters to have a separate query node that has access to hdfs and mapreduce but isn t running any datanode or tasktracker services

11807934
multiplying	division
except multiplying by a value less than 1 bits of the significand can be pushed lower than the limit of the floating-point type causing underflow
for the common ieee 754 double format this does not occur until the value is less than 0x1p-1022. do not use division for scaling or for reversing the effects of prior scaling

11809067
email	dkim
summary of the links on include joining the junk email reporting program to receive updates about your mails that gets spammed joining smart sender service to see how ip-range mails etc are rated viewed by hotmail filters deliverability issue submission third party service to safelist senders
i m not sure about the dkim temperror but take a look at step 3

11809293
hex	binary
integer values are not stored in hex or even in decimal
3 is stored in binary but viewed based on your debugger settings

11809445
setinterval	settimeout
i wouldn t use setinterval to update the content as if the content takes more than 1 second to load you ll have multiple requests in queue
use settimeout after the request is complete this way the second request wouldn t be made before the first one finishes

11809828
udp	mtu
udp is not connection oriented you can never say that two packets belong to each other you can use getsockopt to determine mtu and stay under it preparing packets by hand with proper offsets
udp packet fragmentation for raw sockets has some explanation to it

11810987
spaces	delimiter
i do not simply include spaces as a delimiter in the for f statement because that can throw off the token counting when a value is sometimes blank and sometimes not
the file is comma delimiter so it is probably easier to let for f parse the line into tokens and keep just the ones you want

11812197
google-chrome	firefox
definitely check google-chrome safari as suggested
firefox doesn t support mp4 files through html5 video

11812197
mp4	webm
firefox doesn t support mp4 files through html5 video
you need a webm file or a fallback flash player to support firefox which i m assuming leanback does

11812732
google-chrome	firefox
here s what the css read all of that code works fine in firefox and the other browsers but not in google-chrome
the reason there is problems in google-chrome is the background-size 100 auto

11817224
viewdidload	viewdidappear
try doing this using viewdidappear instead of viewdidload
i m not surprised starting a video in viewdidload is causing unexpected behavior considering you re presenting the video before the main view appears on screen

11822046
prng	random
from then on you call the pseudo-random number generator prng for each and every pseudo-random number that you need
if you are worried about the numbers not being random enough then you should pick a different prng

11824054
gif	png
android 4.1 does not support gif files to be set as background
try to use png files you can convert gif file using paint or other software

11826172
inline	inlining
by outsourcing your inline assembly that does function calls into a static inline __attribute__ naked function you can get around having to specify extensive clobber lists as the compiler will recognize it s a function call and preserve restore as necessary around it even when inlining the code
it s not particularly safe to call anything from gcc inline assembler because there s no way to tell the compiler about it no constraint to gcc inline asm instruction can express this thing contains a function call do all that s necessary to save restore whatever you keep in registers that may change when making a function call

11826246
google-chrome	firefox
creating workers within workers is not available in google-chrome
firefox implemented this with the example

11828310
super	self
i answered this question with reference to self here is the paraphrased important part of the answer super does have meaning in class level contexts but it refers to the superclass itself not an instance this one was throwing me off too
i asked this question and it was concluded calls the super method on the current instance self

11829673
multiplying	multiplication
the tail recursive version starts multiplying right away so it ends up calculating
of course usually we d say that those two are the same because multiplication is associative but that s not true for floating point arithmetic

11829763
vim	gedit
jedit and vim the two editors i use most have such settings and it s lots cleaner to keep those somewhere else than loading up gitignore
unfortunately gedit doesn t have that option

11831516
bmp	png
just to add to previous answers all of the images in the .ico file should be bmp format not png
i ve seen at least two utilities that wanted to use the png format for one or more of the images

11832321
opera	safari	firefox	safari
so this morning i found out that the following changes are working perfectly for gc v21 firefox v14 opera v12 and safari v5.1.7 ...still no luck w ie though css html php may be it s a lousy solution but it s working for me so far hope this helps some one
i was having the same problem all of a sudden w not only gc but also firefox and opera

11838699
onresume	onpause
so you should better look at onresume of the activity to update the button text.if you still want to change the button text while activity is onpause you can use a broadcast receiver on the activity that will change the text.you can also use a handler along with runnable to update button text
another activity is running but it is in onpause and you can t guarantee that activity will not destroy before you going back to there again

11839219
spaces	delimiter
in java.util.properties or white spaces character are key value delimiter when load from property file
below are detailed javadoc of its public void load reader reader the key contains all of the characters in the line starting with the first non-white spaces character and up to but not including the first unescaped or white spaces character other than a line terminator

11844438
innodb	myisam
enable and disable keys does not work for innodb it s myisam only
for innodb use if you are sure your data doesn t contain duplicates don t forget to set them to 1 after the upload is complete

11848625
hash-collision	key
if you mutate that object then the hash code it returns no longer reflects it s current location in that data structure unless you re very very lucky and it just happens to be a hash-collision
on the msdn page for dictionary is says as long as an object is used as a key in the it must not change in any way that affects its hash value

11851131
drawimage	putimagedata
context.drawimage inmemorycanvas x y onto your regular canvas and the translation will be applied to the drawimage call
the problem here is that putimagedata is not affected by the transformation matrix

11852626
serializable	deserialization
i had those serializable problems because the client of the service has a serializable engine that is not compatible with the ones that wcf uses
the request was still standard xml of course soap 1.2 but hey wcf is a microsoft product some workarounds add a messageformater - that implements some deserialization logic at the server side - a good article about that

11852884
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase is horizontally scalable couchdb is not
to get the scalability and speed couchbase offers we ve hat to cut back some of the features people like in couchdb

11853520
division	multiplication
the parenthesis means it will be done first and therefore not be promoted as wo int is involved in the division
you ve got integer division in the following line w will be 0.2 for every iteration change it to the first multiplication will automatically promote t to a double the division should then promote numof iterations to a double

11853706
antialiasing	transparent
if you choose a solid color for the background of the chart the lines will be smooth antialiasing
antialiasing line charts i m happy to have a solution for users of ssrs 2012 not tested with 2008 the edges will get choppy as soon as the chart property | fill | background | color no color transparent

11855216
uiview	calayer
in this kind of realtime application you shall consider using layers instead of drawing into a uiview overloading the drawrect method
maybe you can draw each new piece of waveform into a bitmap using coregraphics functions very fast as they aren t writing into the display and then create a new calayer put the image into it and position it at the end coordinate of your container view

11857539
union	distinct
the answer is yes you can always perform the union operation on graphs just as you can intersection its just like set theory think back to you first principle definitions of graphs all they are are tuples containing sets of vertices and edges
its not that the edge dc some how simultaneously has the weight of 4 and of 7 its that their are two distinct edges running between dc one with a weight of 4 and another with the weight of 7

11858554
uiview	subviews
although uiwindow is a subclass of uiview the gesture recognizer doesn t seem to convert the location to the window s coordinate system correctly
if i add a subviews to self.view and put the gesture recognizer on that subviews it converts the point to self.view s coordinate system correctly

11858588
daemons	systemd
we often need to catch various other signals such as int hup and quit but not so much with daemons
on many systemd ordinary processes don t have much time to clean up during shutdown

11858896
rsa	aes
i cannot find much open source software for executing rsa in gpus though let alone any one that integrates into an ssl stack like openssl
i don t use cuda for acceleration but i don t think aes is the algorithm you should optimize in ssl

11869634
innodb	myisam
there are four 4 methods for handling this method #1 setup automatic myisam repair see my post on how to set this up upon a mysql restart mar 15 2012 method #2 use innodb instead of myisam innodb has crash recovery built into the storage engine s initialization
myisam does not method #3 use aria instead of myisam aria is mariadb s drop-in replacement for myisam

11871200
postgresql	mysql
see the sql-fiddles for sql-server and oracle result sid | name ---------- 4 | dean 5 | eve mysql provides error the target table nonunique of the delete is not updatable postgresql gives error cannot delete from view nonunique if you try this in mysql or this the error is the definition of table nonunique prevents operation delete on table student
in postgresql however the second statement succeeds and deletes the correct rows

11871967
ssl	https
we decided to use https instead of http but after googling i understood that ssl only is not enough
i m not sure what you ve googled but ssl tls when used correctly can protect you against mitm attacks

11872515
aggregate-functions	sum
this is an aggregate-functions select sum amount from sales_orders where date between 2011-03-06 and 2011-04-06 -- not sure what your date is.
based on your comment i think you are referring to sum

11873311
ienumerable	iqueryable
first probably you should switch to ienumerable as you are not using any iqueryable features
next you need to implement a new iterator the event will only be waited on if the caller of the property enumerates the ienumerable

11877256
postgresql	mysql
h2 is not 100 compatible with mysql in the same way that other databases like oracle ms sql server postgresql and so on are also not 100 compatible with mysql
only mysql is 100 compatible with mysql

11878977
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions and null one more remark if you had used the aggregate-functions count - not sum as you had in your question initially - the outcome would be different
count is a special case among the standard aggregate-functions in that it never returns null

11878977
aggregate-functions	sum
this excerpt from the manual on aggregate-functions seems to cover it pretty much it should be noted that except for count these functions return a null value when no rows are selected
in particular sum of no rows returns null not zero as one might expect and array_agg returns null rather than an empty array when there are no input rows

11879630
opencv	emgucv
to understand the sencod format you should read the opencv sources because it s not documented anywere
i have no experience with emgucv actually i have a low esteem for it but i can explain about remap and warpperspective

11879806
comparator	comparable
in the for-loop why is type casting to t needed in sort function based on comparable and why casting is not necessary in for-loop of sort function based on comparator in the first case you have which can only set t and in the second case you have listiterator which can set any object
why raw listiterator is used in sort function based on comparator

11882285
flask	django
specify a custom handler that stores the file at your file path filename.extension and just manipulate the string for the filename just read this in the flask docs
not sure how much it is applicable in django but pasting here for reference if you want to know how the file was named on the client before it was uploaded to your application you can access the filename attribute

11883498
subtraction	addition
second you need to ensure that the result of the subtraction is not negative - it should be put in the range 0-6 using 7
the result in addition in your second version you need to add nth_week-1 weeks like you do in your first version

11886770
innodb	myisam
then the first suspect is that your tables are using the myisam engine instead of the innodb engine
myisam doesn t enforce foreign key constraints but innodb does. the output from show create table table1 show create table table2 will reveal which engine is being used

11887620
decimal	ieee
it s a common issue with ieee floating point representation which store approximations of decimal values
the ieee floating point types store exact base 2 representations. so it s not a failure of a multiplication operation

11888538
jar	war
the jar file should be in the toplevel lib directory of your project or specified as a dependency in a repository not webapp web-inf lib
you can test this by opening the war as a zip file or by running and looking for ojdbc6.jar

11889949
coalesce	isnull
-- 1 another complication is that isnull does not do type promotion in the same way that coalesce does though coalesce has its own problems due to not being a function it is expanded to a case expression sometimes causing unexpected side-effects due to repeat expression evaluation
look select coalesce ltrim null -1

11891853
union	distinct
by default the union operator will only return distinct rows so do not worry about returning duplicates
well you can try using a union

11894419
jqplot	flot
not trying to underestimate jqplot which is a great plug-in for building visually appealing graphs and charts i suggest you also take a look at flot for building graphs with zooming functionality
i have tried both and found flot to be more reliable for this kind of requirement

11895699
atof	strtod
meanwhile atof is not locale-aware
the language specification does not require atof strtod to recognize locale-specific number formats for locales other than c locale

11895944
mvp	presenter
you can search community projects for those that use mvp instead of official gwt mvp which doesn t support nested presenter crucial for larger projects imo you can use other mvp solutions such as gwtp
you have a few choices you can browse official samples such as the expenses sample app which makes use of mvp

11896859
multiplying	multiplication
i am basing my answer on the assumption that if you have more than 1 element in the array you would want to multiplying at least 2 contiguous integers for checking the output in array of -1 15 the output that you want is -15 and not 15
the problem that we need to solve is to look at all possible multiplication combinations and find out the max product out of them

11897624
postgresql	mysql
edit i just noticed you re talking about postgresql for postgresql the same goes it is a built in language feature not something a php library provides
prepared statements are built into mysql

11898580
opera	firefox
i ve modified the code a bit to do some testing here are the results i m seeing with this code for the swf10 runtime internetexplorer 9 chromium 18 and opera 12 both pages local test.html and openlaszlo are displayed within the iframe
firefox remote website openlaszlo.org displays but local test.html is not shown

11904153
trie	tree
here s a python implementation of a radix tree so you wouldn t necessarily have to write it yourself and here s an implementation using that radix tree note new orleans is not in the list of tokens and canada and egypt are not being found by the trie inside search_prefix because is included in the token from the test string
you may find a radix tree to be the most efficient

11907874
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome understands the first version too
it turned out not to be a problem with the rgb2hex function but rather with the jquery s css method in firefox

11908856
factors	matrix
it thought that the v3 and v4 columns were numeric and handled sequential commas as a true missing whereas all the other columns before transposition were seen as factors or character variables and sequential commas got turned into which is not the same as _na_character or the na for factors
there is a transpose method for matrix and dataframes which returns a matrix. resulting in i do notice that there are both a 999 value that is probably a missing value indicator as well as two different values for missing in the factors columns

11909343
postgresql	mysql
most databases have an information_scheme table though a query to determine the information could look like this this works with sqlite mysql msql mariadb and postgresql + probably a lot of others
there is build in mysql functionality for what you seek in short just append if not exists at the end of your table creation query

11909432
uiview	subviews
it wasn t which led me to apple s technical q a on the issue the most relevant point in there was the view controller s uiview property is embedded inside uiwindow but alongside an additional view controller. unfortunately apple in its traditional documentation style doesn t provide an answer merely confirmation of the problem
although my rootviewcontroller was loading the pageviewcontroller i was doing it as a subviews to the main view

11909627
mongodb	bson
there are several issues here 1 please be aware that mongodb stores all documents using the bson format
also note that the bson spec referes to a utf-8 string encoding not a utf-16 encoding

11912032
express	node.js
for example if you would normally do you would instead pass express to h5bp.server which calls createserver on whatever you pass in right off the bat after a bit of setup it checks to see if the server has a function called use the line is if server.use and if so uses it to inject all the middleware it set up into the server
if it doesn t then it assumes you re using a raw node.js http server and sets up the necessary code to pass the request through each of the items in stack manually this is what connect express does for you

11912032
express	node.js
if it doesn t then it assumes you re using a raw node.js http server and sets up the necessary code to pass the request through each of the items in stack manually this is what connect express does for you
it s worth noting that in express 3 currently in release candidate stage the applications created by express no longer inherit from node s http server so you don t call createserver on express

11915559
hex	binary
try using hex instead
it looks like c doesn t support binary literals

11916551
google-chrome	firefox
or just do quick test with google-chrome
if i recall correctly firefox can not open indexeddb from file.html it s a bug or a feature depending of a view point

11920159
listview	gridview
second you shouldn t store an array of views especially within a child of adapterview like gridview listview etc which has a mechanism to recycle its children
third you didn t take in consideration the recycling mechanism of the gridview

11920219
datamapper	activerecord
the best idea would be to implement something like datamapper pattern
which in contrast to activerecord will not violate srp

11921510
innodb	myisam
innodb creates the primary key as a clustered one or the first unique if no primary is defined and this can be used for queries that have order by pk or where pk between low and high because all the values needed are in this clustered key and in consecutive locations the clustered key is the table
myisam tables have only b-tree indices so if the query used this index it would have to read that entire index and it would have the comment_id values in the wanted order that s really good but it would then have to read the table as well not so good to get all the other wanted columns

11922226
content-length	content-type
reference terminate these steps if header is a case-insensitive match for one of the following headers accept-charset accept-encoding access-control-request-headers access-control-request-method connection content-length cookie cookie2 content-transfer-encoding date expect host keep-alive origin referer te trailer transfer-encoding upgrade user-agent via
this isn t strictly a requirement php will just automatically populate when the request specifies content-type of application x-www-form-urlencoded

11923567
haskell	scheme
just writing doesn t work because let in haskell makes recursive definitions mdash
it is actually scheme s letrec

11924322
jboss	glassfish
java doesn t have a standard server which is an equivalent of iis but it has a standard for servers and there are many implementations for simple servlet containers there are tomcat and jetty and for fully-fledged application servers there are jboss glassfish and a variety of commercial products
my personal recommendation would be for jboss as7

11924387
clang	llvm
since clang does not yet support objective-c++ c++ this further widens the gap in compiling times between the two
but update feb 17 2012 as of xcode 4.0 with llvm 3.0 clang has supported objective-c++

11926111
stateless	stateful
for a stateful bean for a stateless bean other important indications can be found in the bean implementation
according to the ejb 2.0 specification section 7.5.3 a stateless session bean must not implement the sessionsynchronization interface

11927389
inline	inlining
another point to consider modern out-of-order cpus most desktop cpus - intel core duo or i7 have a mechanism instruction trace to prefetch branches ahead and inline then at hardware level
so aggressive inlining doesn t always make sense

11928438
postgresql	mysql
you may wish to look into postgresql - i m not certain about it but i think it can handle this type of query
you can t fix it directly it s a limitation of mysql that it can only read from one index to do a query but there is no single index that can handle all three conditions when they are or

11932329
cobertura	jacoco
3 lastly i cannot get coverage report in sonar either running cobertura external to sonar or within sonar
it could be possible due to jacoco being the default code coverage engine

11935069
thin	webrick
run sinatra on thin
keep_open is not supported on webrick

11935172
base	fractions
i do not understand what base conversion you would be doing
if you have an ieee-754 floating-point number in a float then the job of converting to or from your 8-bit format is one of rounding the significand the fractions when going to the narrower format and of adjusting the exponent bias plus handling special cases denormals overflow nans

11937185
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
this is definitely amazon linux centos based not ubuntu
another hint is that the default username in amazon linux is usually ec2-user while in ubuntu it is ubuntu at least if you use the default stock ami

11940604
g++	gcc
you need to link with -lstdc++ using g++ to link instead of gcc or ld does that automaticaly
see compiling c++ programs in the gcc manual however the use of gcc does not add the c++ library

11940609
listview	gridview
hopefully it helps anyone not fully understanding how listview and adapters work which was an obvious problem for me
i already accepted an answer but thought i d add this as it helps explain some stuff about listview and by definition gridview as well that someone learning about it can understand

11943899
jlist	jtextfield
2 but actually it sounds like a jcombobox or a jlist might be what you re really looking for 3 your basic program looks ok hope that helps
1 jtextfield doesn t support multi-line

11944046
xdebug	xhprof
don t use apd because even though it s recommended in this answer it s very outdated and doesn t look like it s being developed anymore last release in 2004 according to its pecl page ps my personal recommendation play with them all if you have the time to do so or just set up xdebug in your dev environment otherwise
use xhprof if you need to profile in production environments

11945184
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
avoid using qgraphicsview with qglwidget
practices for avoiding exit crashes qgraphicsitems that are not part of a qgraphicsscene can cause crash on exit

11948783
awt	swing
if they are the awt components will be drawn on top of swing components
for example when awt components are used with jtabbedpane they do not disappear when the tabs are switched

11949221
namenode	hdfs
i had the same problem and solved it by explicitly specifying the url to the namenode
to list all directories in the root of your hdfs space do the following the documentation says something about a default hdfs point in the configuration but i cannot find it

11954883
client-side	server-side
this means that you can modify your client-side code refresh your browser and it s updated
for the server-side code that doesn t work

11955079
nfa	dfa
converting a nfa to a dfa by subset construction it includes pseudocode on how to do the transformation as well
basically the algorithm is starting with the starting state of the nfa perform closure on the current state set for each input symbol do the goto operation on the closure set. if the state set you get from the goto is not empty do a closure of the state set. if it is a new set of states add a transition between the state sets on the input repeat the entire operation on this new set else add a transition between the state sets on the input do this until there are no more sets or transitions added

11955358
sudo	passwd
this means you can do echo mypassword | sudo -s command to pass the passwd to sudo however the suggestions by others that do not involve passing the passwd as part of a command such as checking if the user is root are probably much better ideas for security reasons
the -s switch makes sudo read the passwd from stdin

11955676
client-side	server-side
server-side use utc client-side use olson reason utc-offsets are not daylight savings-safe new york is est utc - 5 hours part of the year edt utc - 4 hours rest of the year
for client-side time zone determination you have two options 1 have user set zone safer resources web-ready olson tz html dropdown and json 2 auto-detect zone resource jstimezonedetect the rest is just utc local conversion using your server-side datetime libraries

11957548
spaces	delimiter
in direct answer to you question no you cannot specify 2 spaces as a delimiter
you can use set search and replace to change 2 spaces into some unique character but determining a unique character that will never appear in your description or command line is easier said then done

11957810
google-chrome	firefox
had the exact same issue fwiw worked in firefox not ie or google-chrome
i just had the same issue in google-chrome

11957826
clang	llvm
this should get clang to emit assembly code with intel syntax you can use to pass in llvm options from the clang command line
sadly this option doesn t appear to be well documented and thus i only found it by browsing through the llvm mailing lists

11959295
accelerometer	gyroscope
the practice with the magnetic and accelerometer you are able to get the orientation. unfortunately if you submit your phone to any linear acceleration or if there is magnetic disturbances the measures get noisy. the use of a gyroscope dramatically improves response time accuracy since it is a tradeoff but it is not essential for all applications
the theory for you phone to know the orientation including azimuth you need to reference a plane in the real world. that plane is calculated from two non co-linear vectors gravity accelerometer and magnetic fields forces

11959389
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
ok so after a bit more digging around i found that the problem actually isn t with google-chrome safari and opera
what gave it away was that firefox was supporting it and i just couldn t say the other browsers are failing since that s something i d normally accept for ie

11962352
google-chrome	firefox
what s not consistent in google-chrome the default serif font with a font-size of 16px renders with a baseline height of 12px the height of a capital h
in firefox the default serif font with a font-size of 16px renders with a baseline height of 11px

11963812
postgresql	mysql
from database table field and columns names in postgresql are case-independent unless you created them with double-quotes around their name in which case they are case-sensitive
in mysql table names can be case-sensitive or not depending on which operating system you are using

11965746
boost	stl
if you can use boost then a nice option is boost irange
you could use std iota if you have c++11 support or are using the stl or implement your own if not

11968378
implements	extends
you cannot explicitly invoke dealloc or implements or invoke retain release retaincount or autorelease. the prohibition extends to using selector retain selector release and so on
you may implements a dealloc method if you need to manage resources other than releasing instance variables

11969863
client-side	server-side
client-side you can t have that level of secureness because verifying the request is not possible without your app secret but that has got nothing to do in client-side scripts ever
imho doing it server-side

11974015
jquery	scriptaculous
i am not sure that it makes sense to include jquery into admin panel just to use this component
magento already has prototype + scriptaculous available you even do not need to enable them

11974186
clang	llvm
with clang llvm it is quite easy and i recommend do not optimize the clang step use clang to get from c to bytecode the use llvm-link to link all of your bytecode modules into one bytecode module then you can optimize the whole project all source files optimized together the llc adds more optimization as it heads for the target
your best results are to tell clang using the something triple command line option what your ultimate target is

11974942
urllib	httplib
i am not exactly sure how to slot this into your code because i am not sure exactly what you are trying to do but ioerror is not going to handle the exceptions thrown by urllib
couldn t you check the http response code using httplib

11975148
sudo	passwd
try this in terminal sudo xcode-select -switch applications xcode.app and then type your passwd
solution #2 affects only you if you don t want to sudo or you don t have superuser permissions or solution #1 doesn t work override the developer_dir environment variable instead optional you can make this persist between login sessions by editing your .bash_profile file

11979994
orika	dozer
but for me i am switching my project from dozer to orika for performance purpose
although orika is not so mature as dozer not so intelligence and requires me to do a lot additional job to maintain my customized mapping configurations

11979994
orika	dozer
although orika is not so mature as dozer not so intelligence and requires me to do a lot additional job to maintain my customized mapping configurations
if your project not too care about performance i will recommend you dozer it s so easy to use and support so many advanced features

11981350
ubuntu	linux
1. download puttygen.exe and create a .ppk file from your .pem file that you downloaded from amazon. 2. use firessh plug-in for firefox put in your host name use ubuntu minus the quotes for the login leave password blank and enter the location of the .ppk you created from puttygen.exe note oddly enough i was not able to connect using putty.exe but the private key it generates works fine with firessh
i was having the same issue and nothing was working for me to connect to ec2 linux instance from windows 7

11982376
super	extends
note - for super and this when you use in constructors always write them in the first line of your constructor code otherwise compiler will give error
even when you do not extends myclass here compiler will give call to constructor to super object class which is the root class of every class you create

11984844
webkit	gecko
these svg filters only work in gecko so you still need your old code for webkit ie
gecko does not support the filter property

11986668
uialertview	uiwindow
i assume it s because like uialertview it s presented in a new uiwindow so that s windowlevel property guarantees that it s presented over all content
whether or not it s in a new uiwindow as far as view controller containment is concerned you should have no problem using complex parent-child view controller container hierarchies in the view controllers you present in a uipopovercontroller

11986668
uiview	subviews
update i ve checked the hierarchy by logging the classes of the first three levels of the view hierarchy in a sample project and it is as follows when a popover is visible my root view controller had two uibuttons a window _subview class uiview ___subsubview class uiroundedrectbutton _ _subsubsubview class uibuttonlabel ___subsubview class uiroundedrectbutton _ _subsubsubview class uibuttonlabel _subview class uidimmingview ___subsubview class _uipopoverview _ _subsubsubview class _uipopoverstandardchromeview _ _subsubsubview class uiview apple s documentation states that the root view controller s view in a uiwindow should have no sibling views managed by other view controllers because those sibling view controllers will not receive rotation events see here second bullet
so if apple had made uipopovercontroller a uiviewcontroller subclass it would have to add it as a child subviews of the rootviewcontroller s hierarchy

11987015
setcontentview	findviewbyid
setcontentview r.layout.mainmenu
you have not done a setcontentview in oncreate so findviewbyid fails

11988361
ember.js	backbone.js	backbone.js	javascriptmvc
first off there are several mvc like frameworks for javascript besides for backbone.js assuming you consider backbone.js an mvc framework take at look at this so question as well as the official documentation for example ember.js knockout.js javascriptmvc
that said local storage is a feature of html5 and isn t specific to backbone.js so the browser would need to support it here s a so question with some more info on localstorage what the backbone.js localstorage adapter does is saves the backbone.js data to localstorage instead of the server

11991931
union	distinct
the difference between union and union all is that union all will not eliminate duplicate rows instead it just pulls all rows from all tables fitting your query specifics and combines them into a table
a union statement effectively does a select distinct on the results set

11992715
division	subtract
fmod is the remainder of the division not the quotient
that is it s the amount left over after subtract out an integral number of copies of the divisor

11993164
trie	tree
trie is an ordered tree data structure that uses strings as keys
unlike binary tree trie does not store keys associated with the node

11993591
dictionary	map
you can of course make the dictionary using the old standard then with your string you ll get an nsnumber from the dictionary retrieving the nsnumber would be done via objectforkey if you re not using the new subscripting syntax
you d have to create your own dictionary to map from one to the other this is the still-newish clang literal syntax

11995781
ctrlp	fuzzyfinder
not a real answer but you may wanna try ctrlp instead
there is also the good old fuzzyfinder which i haven t tried

11995870
scrollable	panels
you have to add your container to it instead scrollpane.add panels is the wrong thing to do instead use scrollpane.setviewportview panels thirdly you want to take a look at the scrollable interface as scroll panels doesn t just rely on the preferred size of its contents
first of all don t change the layout manager of the scroll panels it s not required for what you want to achieve second scroll panels works though a jviewport
