ssl	https
the mvc framework knows nothing about ssl types
all it can help determine is whether or not a page has to be served over a secure connection https

20005024
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i moved my call to toolbarsetup from viewdidload to viewwillappear
apparently the 2nd vc s viewdidload doesn t fire when the top most vc is popped off the stack

20007332
concave	convex
i also wrote a php class concave hull
i suggest the concave hull because a country shape isn t always convex

20008454
inline	inlining
we can t know the value of json-obj before run-time so there really isn t anything we can do at compile-time except basically inline the function we just wrote
but a that would be unlikely to increase performance by any measurable amount in this case and b that is not what macros are for -- use compiler hints for inlining

20010200
build.gradle	gradlew
project - util - server depends on util - client depends on util if for some reason you cannot change the class structure use this kind of build files settings.gradle include util client server build.gradle you still need directories for subprojects but the sources are in one place as you wanted
when you run gradlew assemble you will have 3 jars with separate set of classes

20010702
client-side	server-side
in either case you don t typically have control over the client environment so you cannot assume the client-side check was performed
malicious users can inject their own client-side code which will permit non-valid inputs to be sent to the server so server-side checking is still strongly required

20010702
client-side	server-side
malicious users can inject their own client-side code which will permit non-valid inputs to be sent to the server so server-side checking is still strongly required
i would recommend that you do client-side checks but i would also recommend that you take the care to ensure that your client-side checks are synchronized with your server-side checks such that your client doesn t start filtering inputs in a different manner than your server would

20012612
margin	text-align
in order to center horizontally set margin 0px auto on the child element
in certain cases where the width of the child isn t defined or is dynamically generated you can also use text-align center assuming it is an inline element

20013386
realloc	malloc
another issue is that inside name2 you are calling realloc
the pointer you pass into realloc however is not a pointer that you got back from malloc or realloc which is what realloc expects

20014732
sudo	passwd
then run sudo docker ps
this shouldn t ask for your passwd and if successful this should output one line of header and return to the prompt

20015284
profiling	debugging
there s more to debugging information than that information about locations and types of variables but it s mostly irrelevant for most profiling and doesn t lead to inaccuracy in measuring the code either
the debugging information maps from locations in the code to locations in the source file that generated that code

20016401
sudo	passwd
if root doesn t have a passwd you can set one with sudo passwd
if root logins are disallowed in the server s configuration you can use sudo hello.pl as the command and disable asking for the passwd in etc sudoers or set the setuid bit on hello.pl

20019930
invokelater	invokeandwait
also your use of invokelater to create your drop down window doesn t change anything because that just places code in the awt event thread where it would have ended up anyway
the methods invokelater and its friend invokeandwait are used to synchronize java s so-called initial threads one of which executes the main method and is therefore called the main thread with the event dispatch thread

20020928
g++	gcc
with g++ you do not have to add this step
for c++ you will want to replace gcc with g++ or add -lstdc++ if you want to use the std c++ library to your gcc command line gcc point.cpp coloredpoint.cpp main.cpp -o main -lstdc++ or g++ point.cpp coloredpoint.cpp main.cpp -o main which links the std c++ library with your compiled code

20021289
union	distinct
union will attempt to do a distinct sort on the result set
as your university s have different names between the two tables there is no need to do a distinct so you might just as well not attempt it

20022477
ssl	https
btw from security perspective if the first page you serve is not over ssl someone could just modify html and inject a malicious https link with valid cert
that is why it is very important to have ssl enabled on your whole website

20024336
ati	nvidia
you might be able to enjoy opencv s gpu processing if your ati video card supports opencl
indeed cuda technology is exclusive to nvidia devices so ati video cards doesn t support it

20024823
google-chrome	safari
when pressing +x it will output 120 true this only seems to work in safari - not google-chrome
i found that you can detect the command key in the latest version of safari 7.0 9537.71 if it is pressed in conjunction with another key

20027226
multiplying	division
multiplying one of the elements by 1.0 to force sql server to not treat everything as integers
your cast isn t working because your are casting it after the division

20029744
daemons	systemd
the write daemons is running by default
if not you can change this in systemd settings - systemd administration - startup and shutdown - service manager

20030091
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbaritem	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
short answer in your mainwindow add a uitabbarcontroller in your uitabbarcontroller add uitabbaritem s for a uinavigationcontroller for each of those uinavigationcontroller s set the rootviewcontroller to be the uiviewcontroller s that you have already edit more detailed steps but not necessarily perfect find out which view is loaded when your app is loaded depending on your xcode this may well be mainwindow.xib or its rootviewcontroller edit the thing from #1 if defined in code edit in code
if designed through xib edit through xib so that it is pointing to a uitabbarcontroller ie in code foreach view controller you want to add add a uinavigationcontroller

20032458
serializable	deserialization
the above post recommends google protocol buffers library for serializable deserialization
named pipes is a low-level transport and it does not define how you should could serialize deserialize your data it just transfers plain data blocks like byte or strings probably what you are looking for is a serializable library which would allow you to serialize an object in c# and deserialize it in c++ and vice versa

20032725
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
as far as i know you cannot achieve this with nsurlconnection
however nsurlsession provides apis to configure a session via a nsulrsessionconfiguration and tlsmaximumsupportedprotocol and tlsminimumsupportedprotocol

20032950
unicorn	webrick
the problem was that unicorn was failing to start
this was because one of our helpers was a class not a module and while thin and webrick allow this unicorn was having kittens

20032950
thin	unicorn	unicorn	webrick
this was because one of our helpers was a class not a module and while thin and webrick allow this unicorn was having kittens
i had a few other trivial things but once i was able to start unicorn things worked fine

20033960
qcheckbox	qtablewidget
you shouldn t be using qlineedit and qcheckbox here
to add a check box to your qtablewidget do the following to add an line edit with this setup the signal will be emitted when an item is changed

20035215
opera	safari
well finally i detect the cna with the user agent. when inside the cna the user agent does not include safari in the ua string. also tested with a dozen of alternative browsers like opera mini dolphin mercury puffin atomic 360 lite .
for example safari ua string is mozilla 5.0 ipad

20035528
ftp	telnet
you should not use ftp
like telnet it is not using secure protocols and passwords are transmitted in clear text

20035875
jar	war
how can i configure maven to output a valid application.xml or glassfish-application.xml copy the dependencies not to ear lib but to ear meta-inf lib if it is really necessary application.xml can be autogenerated by maven-ejb-plugin and for the simple test i would leave it up to plugin for dependencies copying - it depends what you package in your ear can be war jar ... but in general it s a good idea to let maven do it
for the purpose you miss in your pom.xml sections that would refer to modules war jar ... you want to be included in there moreover i don t see a reason for non-standard libs folder you specified with so i d go for config like the sample present here

20036828
division	multiplication
most hardware implementations of division also do the division bit-by-bit it s unavoidable
it is not like multiplication which can be done in parallel.

20037401
bash	zsh
bash does try to expand it - it s just that when it fails to match anything it lets the through to the program you re calling
zsh doesn t at least by default

20038342
vim	geany	vim	emacs
none of you guys suggesting emacs vim geany or other text editor have clearly not worked with enterprise level xml data.
to get a touch with reality please take some averagely complex opendocument open libre office .odt file preferably with some tables and images and try to edit that with your emacs or vim

20038473
multiplying	subtract
usually the add and subtract instructions are type-agnostic the same way the compare instruction is but the multiplying and divide instructions are not except for some forms of multiplying that return partial results
the add and subtract instructions can be type-agnostic because the wrapping that occurs in the arithmetic works for both two s complement and unsigned

20038675
jar	war
here is an excerpt from the specs the root of a persistence unit must be one of the following an ejb-jar file the web-inf classes directory of a war file 80 a jar file in the web-inf lib directory of a war file a jar file in the ear library directory an application client jar file and a persistence unit that is defined at the level of the ear is generally visible to all components in the application
however if a persistence unit of the same name is defined by an ejb-jar war or application jar file within the ear the persistence unit of that name defined at ear level will not be visible to the components defined by that ejb-jar war or application jar file unless the persistence unit reference uses the persistence unit name # syntax to specify a path name to disambiguate the reference

20042025
serializable	deserialization
but if your php application cannot afford downtime or you can t add more columns for some reason you can do below convert the data for your pseudo-columns into a php array and serializable them to a string see serializable and store it in a mysql clob
same as above but use package for serialization and deserialization

20047425
lisp	scheme
it will be a common lisp binary with your code already compiled in
many scheme implementations has compilation to native and clojure can compile to java bytecode though it s not the most common way to do it

20047425
scheme	racket
many scheme implementations has compilation to native and clojure can compile to java bytecode though it s not the most common way to do it
still i have had experience with ikarus sometimes interpreting faster than a compiled executable from racket chicken and gambit so i often do my programming in racket and running it in ikarus in scheme

20051152
isotope	packery
i haven t tested isotope but i wouldn t be surprised if you found it there as well
thanks jennifer i would just add that this problem solution also applies to metafizzy s packery

20051154
spaces	linefeed
this makes spaces different to s which does not include vt for perl compatibility
according to the php docs the spaces characters are ht 9 linefeed 10 vt 11 ff 12 cr 13 and spaces 32

20051944
bash	subshell
the bash built-in time is a special built-in that writes to standard error of the current shell so you cannot simply redirect its output
instead you would need to run it in a subshell whose standard error has already been redirected

20053846
hex	binary
you can also use the following to dump it in hex format dump ihex memory result.bin 0x200000000 0x20000c350 using the dump command is much clearer than using the gdb logging hack which even did not work for me somehow
you could use the dump function of gdb see for your example dump binary memory result.bin 0x200000000 0x20000c350 this will give you a plain binary dump int file result.bin

20056622
junit	testng
junit is creating a new instance of the test class before each test so junit fans like me will never face such problem
testng is not creating a new instance of test class

20056767
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
an easy way to do what you want if the files aren t too large is to read the file contents as a string note the use of -ceq here to do a case-sensitive comparison between strings
-eq does a case-insensitive compare

20058585
swift	objective-c
with the introduction of swift apple has documented the performselector family of methods as inherently unsafe and they are not available to swift
over time we have seen this progression early versions of objective-c allow performselector manual memory management objective-c with arc warns for use of performselector swift does not have access to performselector and documents these methods as inherently unsafe the idea of sending messages based on a named selector is not however an inherently unsafe feature

google-chrome	firefox
you can test this google-chrome extension
updated at oct 06 2015 desktopcapture api in google-chrome or screen capturing api in firefox doesn t provides remote-desktop-access or remote-desktop-control

20064951
postgresql	mysql
with it your query would have been this works in postgresql
sqlfiddle demo sql standard has is distinct from operator which treats null as comparable value but unfortunately mysql does not support it

20066220
mp4	h.264
you are probably on mac and you have the quicktime plug-in installed so the plug-in plays the video if you navigate directly to it but it doesn t work in the video element because mac support for mp4 h.264 aac isn t ready yet
as of november 2013 firefox 26 firefox supports mp4 h.264 aac on vista and newer windows android and firefox os

20067745
g++	gcc
these are the commands that i used to configure gcc that got me a working binary but any program i built with that version of g++ wouldn t run correctly unless i built it with the -wl -rpath prefix lib64 option
it is possible to get g++ to automatically add that option by providing a specs file

20067763
openmpi	mpich
the fault tolerance in openmpi is kind of experimental one of the ompi developers namely jeff squyres visits stack overflow from time to time - he could give a more definitive answer and has to be explicitly enabled at library build time with an option like
by default mpich also cannot handle such situations note that currently mpi does not guarantee that the program state remains consistent when an error is detected after an error is detected the state of mpi is undefined

20071329
ssl	https
this can be done as follows in your settings.py file an intro to django security including ssl https a must read
on apache+django 1.6 this can be done a number of ways but a simple way can be done in the .htaccess or httpd.conf file is here s a link for further info on it to be sure the session and csrf cookies are not leaked by the client over plain http connections you should ensure that they are set as secure cookies and only sent by the client over https

20076370
mayavi	matplotlib
what you are expecting to be able to do from your matplotlib experience is not how mayavi axes work
in matplotlib the visualization is a child of the axes and the axes determines its coordinates

20077013
hive	hdfs
sqoop2 currently do not have integration with hive and can import data only to hdfs
you can load them into hive manually from there though using load data command

20078600
serializable	deserialization
any bean properties which are not serializable will be skipped
during deserialization on another node you will face a notserializableexception on all bean properties which are not serializable

20078600
serializable	deserialization
during deserialization on another node you will face a notserializableexception on all bean properties which are not serializable
marking the property transient will fix that exception but the property will still remain null after deserialization

20081253
hex	binary
for binary files there are hex editors available but they require manual handling and can t be scripted
other binary patch programs are out there as well but might not be packaged in your favorite distribution and compiling things from source is boring

20084973
octal	binary	octal	decimal
the constant you originally attempted to specify was interpreted as a very large octal number
if you are using java 7 or higher you can specify binary constants by prepending 0b to your value if that language feature is not available to you you can use decimal octal or hexadecimal notation however

20088367
google-chrome	firefox
in a browser that does subpixel text shaping and positioning which firefox and ie do and google-chrome does not the width of a string of text is not going to be an integer number of css pixels in general
and even in google-chrome if you have a high-dpi screen so that one css pixel corresponds to two or more device pixels the width of a string of text can end up being a non-integral number of css pixels

20088863
mongodb	bson
this is how mongodb knows that in a 1 b 1 c 1 that the keys are ordered a b c the underlying implementation is ordered as well
internally mongodb doesn t use json is uses bson

20088863
mongodb	bson
internally mongodb doesn t use json is uses bson
while json is technically un-ordered bson per the specification is ordered

20089393
operands	scalar
in scalar context or if the left operands is not enclosed in parentheses it returns a string consisting of the left operands repeated the number of times specified by the right operands
in list context if the left operands is enclosed in parentheses or is a list formed by qw string it repeats the list

20089970
addition	multiplication
to reverse the output n should be printed after making the recursive call the expression performs integer addition not multiplication or string concatenation
i changed it to perform multiplication

20098253
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception never need to be declared here because unsupportedoperationexception derives from the unchecked runtimeexception it does not need to be declared
any checked exception one which does not extend runtimeexception that might escape a method needs to be declared in the method signature

20102572
fileoutputstream	filewriter
use a filewriter at last but not least forget about the fileoutputstream and use a filewriter instead
more information on that class form the filewriter javadoc

20104076
mvp	presenter
for this kind of gui application i suggest you follow mvc or mvp pattern
the class car is the model the windows forms are the views the view doesn t hold an instance of the model and the views are updated through controller or presenter

20104958
direct3d	directx
if you cannot you can provide overloaded new and delete for your direct3d class implemented using _aligned_malloc and _aligned_free
directx xmmatrix contains sse data and is marked with __declspec align 16 because of this and therefore needs to be aligned on 16b boundary otherwise instructions accessing it will cause access violation

20106936
bash	zsh
actually that loop would work in bash 4 as well but as you may have noticed os x still ships with bash 3.2. as a standalone script named foo.zsh or simply
it s not bash but zsh is available in os x so you might try the following i m using for the prompt to indicate when you are in zsh

20114230
hex	binary
if you want to display the encrypted data in a form that s safe to display and copy paste as text you should convert the into a hex string like you re doing for the keys or encode it using base64 instead of passing it directly to the string constructor
your encrypted data is a containing binary data not text but you re using it to construct a string which expects the bytes to represent valid unicode text in some encoding scheme probably utf-8 or utf-16 depending on which os you re using

20114598
gtk	cairo
this is how i solved it 1.a installation of gtk 2.x brew install gtk 1.b installation of gtk 3.x you can install gtk 3.x via home brew too if you need that but the 2.x version is enough for my purposes
the command would be brew install gtk+3 2. but after the installation i had the problem that cairo could not be found

20118154
sudo	passwd
this solution worked for me create the bin directory in usr local bin if it doesn t already exist sudo mkdir usr local bin you have to use sudo and enter your passwd to create the directory because it is inside a system folder
setup subl as a command-line command in the usr local bin sudo ln -s applications sublime text 2.app contents sharedsupport bin subl usr local bin subl the directory usr local bin is already in your by default even if it doesn t exist yet so there is no need to add it to your

20119674
icomparable	gethashcode
this is because the wordcount class does not implement the icomparable interface
implementing the interface means you ll have to override the equals and gethashcode methods and provide your own comparer

20122863
accelerometer	gyroscope
the tilt isn t available as its own discrete gesture but if you re programming in the gdk you can access the accelerometer and use its data to determine head tilt
or you might try the gyroscope

20124529
floating-point	fractions
this method is useful for finding rational approximations to a given floating-point number floating point numbers are limited in precision and cannot represent many numbers exactly
what you see is a rounded representation but the real number is because a floating point number is represented as a sum of binary fractions

20126452
content-length	content-type
the output should be something like content-length 10032219 also the correct mime-type for pdf is content-type application pdf
this outputs in headers this content-length replace by and fix the which is also not correct because it returns null or false

20126553
ember.js	backbone.js
i use ember.js but i m not going to say oh use ember.js it is the best look around try them all cause you will learn something from each one
i would say though that backbone.js angular and ember.js have large communities and many resources for you to utilize

20127607
spaces	delimiter
the arguments are separated by spaces characters
because the expression is quoted each argument but not the spaces delimiter is treated as though it were quoted

20129152
azure	hdinsight
it s probably not a good idea to copy files from azure storage to hdfs in hdinsight
the reason for this is that anything in hdfs on an hdinsight cluster is stored on the transient instances that make up that cluster and is essentially temporary storage

20130779
pthreads	fork
now glibc has a strdup but if you re in an environment that doesn t it s pthreads rather than iso see here
check the arguments eg print them out each enclosed in before you call fork exec there s a good chance they re not what you think

20131573
move	drag
currently when you re dropping the draggable you re creating a clone that doesn t have any functionality behind it - that s why it won t move afterwards
i think what you re trying to do i ve accomplished here - user drag the draggable to container

20132181
google-chrome	firefox
as of nightly 28.0a1 firefox does not have anything equivalent to google-chrome s mediastreamtrack.getsources
so no there is not currently a way to get a list of the local audio and video devices in firefox

20132657
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
simply using runtimeexception by itself doesn t really give that much information
suppose i want to have an unchecked-exception for a specific case in my code-- say when a queue is 75 full

20132938
jhat	jvisualvm
jmap is fairly old and ships with the jdk as early as java 1.4.2. once this command completes you should have a heap.bin file that can be browsed with the jhat tool
they should be viewable with the newer jvisualvm tool but for some reason that tool seems to fail when loading these files. this tool is not as old as jmap jhat started shipping with jdk s around version 1.6 but since we now have a heap file rather than a raw core dump we can use the jhat that is distributed with a newer jdk

20132938
jhat	jvisualvm
they should be viewable with the newer jvisualvm tool but for some reason that tool seems to fail when loading these files. this tool is not as old as jmap jhat started shipping with jdk s around version 1.6 but since we now have a heap file rather than a raw core dump we can use the jhat that is distributed with a newer jdk
since you are on java 6 anyway you will be fine jhat -j-xmx1024m heap.bin again depending on the size of the heap file this command may take a lot of time and memory

20134650
realloc	malloc
so just as an example does not always achieve exactly the same performance as a similar resizable array written using malloc and free because that code could and naturally would use realloc to resize the storage when necessary
realloc doesn t very often save you any time but when it does it saves a chunk

20135283
google-chrome	firefox
webkit browsers google-chrome and safari automatically create these buttons as part of the user interface experience
i would not be surprised if other browsers ie firefox follow suit in the near future

20139739
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
infact that looks pretty this is how you can do it remember ie8 doesn t support element prototype but google-chrome firefox safari does
run it open google-chrome console in this page

20144833
viewmodel	caliburn
imagine you have a projects page and a users involved in a project page and you wanted another page that showed both side by side and allowed you to click a project which would refresh the users pane - this is possible by compositing the viewmodel by creating another viewmodel which contains the two viewmodel as properties and wires up the interaction between the two ultimately you are just modelling the user interaction and the more modular you can make it the easier it will be to make cleaner more maintainable code there are some good mvvm frameworks - my personal fave is caliburn micro as it makes the above very easy it heavily uses conventions by default and is easy to get into
a viewmodel should be a model of the user interaction for a particular area of functionality for instance if you have a project list page and the user can do certain things like delete a project edit a project print information about the project then you should design a viewmodel that contains the data and actions associated with this interface the viewmodel should contain the actual functionality inside these actions may not be contained within the viewmodel the vm may have received injected services such as the print service or the project repository but the responsibility of execution of these actions lies with the vm

20145127
jar	manifest.mf
check jar files mainfest in meta-inf manifest.mf if your program is using external libraries you need to specify them in this file with the correct path
if your program does not have a logging system log4j then most probably the error log is printed on system.out stream which is null nowhere if you run the jar by double click-ing the executable jar

20149450
google-chrome	firefox
i have a page that loads fine in firefox but doesn t work in google-chrome because i have 2 scripts using window .load function and the 2nd seems to execute before the images appear
the first script checks for missing images and substitutes an error image the second function realigns elements on a row in case the window is resized it s a responsive page when i use debug on this in google-chrome the first function is executed but when the 2nd is executed any images that are missing have not been displayed

20150493
jar	manifest.mf
normally osgi bundles are jar files because they need to have a meta-inf manifest.mf
the osgi framework cannot directly read your multi-bundle jar

20150555
knitr	latex
to partially answer my own question i discovered the knitr chunk option which works afaik only with render_latex and the highlight package
thus for a wide output to be set in footnote size i can use also the example i used above with should have been done just with a verbatim latex environment not as as code chunk

20150870
tabcontrol	tabitem
routed event bubble routing is accroding to the logical tree if you put a combobox in a tabitem of a tabcontrol when the combobox.selectionchanged event raised the event will be routed to the tabcontrol
but if the combobox is not in the logical tree of tabcontrol then the event will not be routed to the tabcontrol

20153377
dictionary	map
if you want to be able to call it as a method on the value you need to subclass tuple as well and make your dictionary subclass use the tuple subclass
finally it looks like you want to do this not just with the multidict itself but also with the individual values that the multidict stores in other words you want each key to map to a tuple of objects which themselves are either single objects or tuples of objects

20154609
clang	llvm
for example on my system with xcode 5.0.1 installed i get you can download the sources to the version of clang that apple ships with xcode from however it doesn t look like they ve put up the sources for the 5.0 tools yet
apple s release schedule rarely corresponds with llvm s

20156418
innodb	myisam
you can t do this with the auto-increment mechanism if you use innodb which is mysql s default storage engine
you can do it with the myisam storage engine but you really shouldn t use myisam for many reasons

20156999
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
but exception isn t a runtimeexception
section 11.2 of the jls covers this the unchecked-exception classes 11.1.1 are exempted from compile-time checking

20159961
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
here you find additional info about it opengl-es api with no current context opengl-es 2.0 context in android hope this help
the problem is with glsurfaceview as it does not run on the opengl thread

20163188
mp3	wav
for example the best alternative i could find for you was how do i capture an mp3 stream with python that talks about capturing a stream for local playback
it is because the nssound object in appkit provides a way to play aiff and wav sound files in mac applications and not shoutcast streams

20164594
postorder	inorder
things to note the inorder traversal produces a unique tree the pre-order and postorder don t you can t differentiate between these two 1 1 2 2 i ll just generate the one on the left doing this makes it a lot easier
what we can say right away if the first node is the root not depth 0 we re either doing inorder with an empty left subtree or pre-order

20165384
ubuntu	centos
etc odbc.ini etc odbcinst.ini and etc freetds freetds.conf these locations are valid for ubuntu 12.04 and probably correct for most nixes
you ll need to install unixodbc and freetds not sure what the package names are on centos

20166185
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and internet explorer not firefox though detaching and reattaching the element at mousedown or mouseup will prevent the click event to be triggered
in internet explorer this trick does not catch double-clicks though in google-chrome it does

20167880
build.gradle	gradlew
update build.gradle module app - make sure is the one under gradlew script and it is not build.gradle project yourproject
an example of build.gradle sync gradlew button refresh all gradlew projects also works rebuild project after updating the build.gradle s minsdkversion you have to click on the button to sync gradlew file sync project with gradlew files

20170971
lisp	scheme
you can t do this in every lisp though
e.g. in scheme it s an error to call cdr on something that s not a pair. this means that you can implement even-elements and odd-elements rather easily

20175065
postgresql	mysql
postgresql version not quite the same
mysql version short and elegant select id value avg value as average from scores

20176570
fgets	fread
a raster of height rows ... -- your first fgets reads then discards the magic number line followed by reading the width and height and then discarding the maxval line
it ought to work for ppm images and you could rename this routine load_ppm_image were it not for a single important issue after all that ascii stuff you switch to fread and so here is warning #1

20177101
super	self
what you ve done is effectively this remember that self is just an alias for this and not super
additionally since a is a self type it s not a super type of b so you can t call super.print

20185178
selenium	appium
you can tell in the metadata for the run whether or not it is using appium because the word appium will be in the selenium version field
ios 7 appium is currently broken

20186046
google-chrome	firefox
i have spent a lot of time with yield recently and bobince isn t completely wrong but google-chrome 31 does not interpret javascript version to 1.7 blocks even with the experimental javascript flag turned on google-chrome flags #enable-javascript-harmony
due to implementation differences between google-chrome 31 and firefox tymon sturgeon s method is unable to detect yield in google-chrome 31 with experimental js on although it is very close

20186046
google-chrome	firefox
first i ll quickly cover the yield differences writing it the long way for clarity in firefox in google-chrome 31 with experimental javascript enabled .value is required in google-chrome because it yields an object but more importantly the generator requires a in the function definition
also i could not find a way to create a generator from the capital f function in google-chrome

20186182
client-side	server-side
your server sends json and angular then renders all the pages client-side
it looks likely that the request object is not being passed correctly to your server-side registration function and that is why you cannot access req.body

20188187
google-chrome	firefox
longer answer it also renders in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari at least
this seems to occur because firefox does not interpret image tags the same way as other browsers

20189244
bower	npm
in my opinion since there are tools like bower and webmake out there that help use node modules in the browser there is not anymore a real need for bower or volo unless they offer something else for you a particular module existing only in their registries
both volo and bower are good too but from my point of view if you re already using npm it might be better to stick to it

20189812
google-chrome	firefox
not even in the newest google-chrome
note oriol s comment firefox did implement box-sizing padding-box

20190584
innodb	myisam
one need to change the first table to innodb too for this to work
it may also be the case if you are not specifying the on delete at all but are trying to reference a myisam table from innodb table the above will throw errno 150

20197922
lisp	scheme
the reason for that it is not possible in common lisp to define a function with something other than a function
in scheme you can write let list 42 list 1 2 3 list above needs to be checked at some point and will result in an error since list is 42 which is not a function

20200957
implements	extends
no need to override all of the function and implements them
i am not sure why you are even extends the focustraversalpolicy for your case while default focustraversalpolicy should do the job for you

20202080
persistent	transient
besides you must make sure that your code will never try to persistent such a type otherwise an exception will be thrown
in order to avoid that instances of b get persisted you do not need to annotate it with transient which is used for marking fields properties that are not persistent but rather avoid annotating it with entity or simply do not list is in your persistence.xml file

20202316
implements	extends
in general not necessarily specific to this processor it has to do with sign extension and masking requiring additional instructions to faithfully implements the c source code
a signed 8 bit value in a 16 or 32 or 64 bit processor may involve additional instructions to sign extends

20211626
implements	extends
normally you d either extends thread and then call its own start your #1 or you d implements runnable and then use a thread to run it your #2
but you wouldn t extends thread and then use another thread to run it

20213194
persistent	transient
personally i prefer field annotations as i find them much easier to work with all the persistent mappings are located at the top of your source file
if you have any any other methods in your entity not concerned with jpa mappings then these have to be annotated with transient which just seems wrong

20217227
cdr	cons
you can still access both the lists individually using car and cdr as you normally would i m not sure what your compare-attrs function is supposed to do
your if branch returns a cons cell whereas your else branch returns a boolean

20218730
cdr	cons
and don t print the surrounding parenthesis of the cdr which it would otherwise have since it s a list
now we can explain why the result of cons list1 list2 doesn t look like

20220214
google-chrome	firefox
for the record something i found to work in google-chrome but not firefox this works because google-chrome s initial value for outline-style is pretty straightforward auto and setting just that part to none is enough to disable the default outline
unfortunately firefox appears to use a vastly different method for setting its default focus style

20221272
ienumerable	iqueryable
the problem with returning ienumerable can be that no-one knows what the cost of enumerating it is going to be - which is a down-side to the whole linq concept that doesn t always get fair mention from the people who are encouraging everyone to return ienumerable everywhere
i ve just read that i should return ienumerable or similar interface iqueryable for instance

20221888
stateless	stateful
a stateless protocol does not require the server to retain session information or status about each communications partner for the duration of multiple requests
in contrast a protocol which requires keeping of the internal state on the server is known as a stateful protocol

20222265
ratingbar	imageview
so if you want to use a ratingbar in a live card you have a couple options create the card using direct rendering and draw the views directly onto the surface which lets you use any kind of views that you want or mock up your own ratingbar using imageview widgets instead
the remoteviews class can only inflate a limited subset of widgets in the android platform and ratingbar is not one of those

20224856
rvm	bundler
the main difference is that rubygems invoked with the command gem manages all the gems gemsets if you are using rvm for a single machine whereas bundler bundle manages a gem set for a single application its purpose being to deploy on multiple machines
the ruby version manager rvm only eases the task of managing different gem versions on the same machine but it s not application-related unless you want to name a gemset for a particular application see named gemsets

20227619
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
treeset explains this in its doc note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

20229431
fgets	realloc
your problem is not with fgets
rather it is with this part if you want to support an arbitrary number of records you will need to make this a dynamic allocation and resize it using realloc whenever you hit the current size limit

20233426
viewdidload	viewdidappear
there are two things that you are not doing correctly you are setting the array on a temporary view controller different from the instance activated by your segue and you are logging the array too early viewdidload is called before the segue code manages to put the array into the new view controller
to fix the first problem remove the two lines above the perform segue call and add this method to fix the second problem move the logging code into the viewdidappear

20234616
hex	binary
certain addresses such as those reserved for kernel use typically beginning at 0xc0000000 will not work and the address must be page-aligned the last 3 hex digits must be 0
unless the binary is position-independent pie this is not possible

20234924
spaces	delimiter
the scanner sees the spaces in the book name as a delimiter since you are using the next method
so when you go to read the nextint for the stock amount the scanner index is after the spaces in the book name string and pulls in the remaining string data which doesn t convert to an int

20235385
uicollectionview	uitableview
now the uitableview will give you vertical scrolling with the ability to scroll each rows horizontaly uicollectionview
uicollectionview can scroll either vertical or horizontal not both

20235597
opencart	magento
if you are serious about your ecommerce site than magento is the best solution available but will come at a higher up front cost than opencart
however if you need a lot of advanced customization than it will actually be easier and cheaper to build in magento down the road because advanced customization can become more difficult in opencart because it is not built for enterprise level customization whereas magento is

20238614
ssl	https
omnipay uses guzzle to make the https requests to paypal and guzzle bundles the latest root ssl certificates for you
so you should not see any https warnings

20239209
g++	gcc
for instance i ve just tried it at which seems to have g++ 4.8 and i still cannot move return any fstream - compiler still insists on using nonexistent copy-constructor instead of move ctor
this was a known issue that gcc hadn t implemented movability in the streams part

20245510
g++	gcc
the code you provided is valid c++ but not valid c which is why g++ compiles it and gcc doesn t
in this case gcc produces nothing because your program is not valid c

20246224
nsstring	nsobject
you need to set title as nsstring not nsobject
title should be nsstring value

20253100
rdf	owl
e.g. prop hasyieldstrength rdfs comment yieldstrength of material in pascals en . structured values perhaps using rdf value the other option is to make the range of those properties some sort of entity that specifies both the measurement and the unit so that your data would be like if you re working in owl i m not sure whether it s ok to use rdf value or not but you can certainly use your own vocabulary to do the same thing
if you can use rdf value this is actually one the ways that the the rdf documentation says it can be used 5.4.3 rdf value rdf value is an instance of rdf property that may be used in describing structured values

20258100
implements	extends
then for your generic class and from there you can work with the generic poolobjects and teacher wouldn t directly implements extends the pool
assuming the pool is a data structure for storing objects you probably want to initialize the pool instead if you have a pool where teacher has to extends that anyhow it seems somewhat awkward and unnecessary

20259537
required	placeholder
then the form validation will return true if the rule is only required
you should not set a default value to those inputs but use the placeholder attribute to display a message while the input field dose not have a value

20263628
vim	emacs
edit on going to the end of a sentence so evil uses evil-forward-sentence but yes it doesn t have the same behaviour than in vim see comment
emacs has forward-sentence but it has the same behaviour

20263983
draggable	droppable
for this to work you can t have items in the dropped box draggable again because you wouldn t know if it was trying to sort or drag
here is working code example jsfiddle to get this to work correctly you can t allow the drop handler to accept items that are being sorted to do this we add the accept filter to the droppable handler accept not .ui-sortable-helper this now means that you can drag items from the bottom box to the top and then sort the top box

20267313
arc4random	srand
i recommend you use arc4random instead which works a lot better than rand and which doesn t require that you randomize the seed test
i can reproduce the problem on mac os x 10.9 with xcode 5 - it looks like it might actually be a bug or at least a limitation with rand srand on os x 10.9

20267774
ssl	https
htps is the new https. https is highly vulnerable to ssl stripping mitm man in the middle . to quote adam langley s google blog imperial violet https tends to cause people to give talks mocking certificate security and the ecosystem around it
the problem is that the page isn t served over https

20270885
opera	google-chrome
in my opinion it is a superior debugger and is the only reason remaining why i still use the opera 12 based version there is no v13 v14 version and the v15 webkit based lacks dragonfly still
opera 12 not the latest google-chrome webkit engine based dragonfly has had this for a while and is obviously displayed in the dom structure

20271432
emacs	aquamacs
you can help it by creating an alias like this sudo mkdir library java javavirtualmachines jdk1.7.0_45.jdk contents home classes sudo ln -sfv library java javavirtualmachines jdk1.7.0_45.jdk contents home lib tools.jar library java javavirtualmachines jdk1.7.0_45.jdk contents home classes classes.jar relaunch emacs and completion should work there is a newer jde 2.4.1 that i have not tried
for jdk 1.7 on mavericks aquamacs 2.5 jde 2.4.0.1 jde is looking for classes classes.jar under java_home when it tries to locate the darwin equivalent for lib tools.jar

20271727
strcpy	strncpy
to copy the ith line from nline use strcpy
if the size of tab is different from the size of nline use strncpy to not exceed the size of tab

20271927
printwriter	bufferedwriter
i d also suggest avoiding printwriter as it swallows exceptions - not a good idea imo
my question here is why does the filewriter variable need to be wrapped in a bufferedwriter

20273939
bellman-ford	dijkstra
so you are better off just running bellman-ford for your original graph
you can not apply dijkstra s algorithm directly to a graph with a negative edge as some of the other answers have correctly noted

20276248
udp	tcp
this isn t too hard with udp
with tcp it gets more complicated because of the fact that tcp packets are stored and put back in order before being delivered to the socket. an easier solution is to use your platform s packet filter interface

20288061
dictionary	map
now the problem is a dictionary stores your items in buckets depending on its hash code provided by gethashcode . you d have to make sure that two symbols return the same hashcode
your calculation of a hash should not depend on opc or type properties though the hashcode of an object must remain the same while it s being stored in a hash map dictionary . and because those two properties can change so can a hashcode that depends on them

20288061
dictionary	map
your calculation of a hash should not depend on opc or type properties though the hashcode of an object must remain the same while it s being stored in a hash map dictionary . and because those two properties can change so can a hashcode that depends on them
and that would break the usefulness of a dictionary

20288223
implements	extends
third bundle implements parcelable which is very important for android ipc
map is an interface and does not extends parcelable

20289680
gunicorn	uwsgi
use multiprocess servers or asynchronous where it makes sense which i believe gunicorn is
consider using uwsgi -- it is very powerful although not native

20292311
scheme	racket
the following example is in racket but is trivial to adapt to r6rs scheme hash tables if required just note that hash tables do not respect order so you ll get the same result but the pairs will probably in a different order and even vary from one call to the next
since this appears to be homework you posted no code whatsoever and we know nothing about your constraints and your current knowledge of scheme it s hard to answer

20292338
sudo	passwd
as a security measure you cannot run scripts as a superuser without prepending sudo
if you want it to be passwordless you need to run visudo and allow your or the executing user to run this command as a superuser without passwd confirmation

20292976
client-side	server-side
the basic flaw in the original code was that it was testing client-side for the validity of the e-mail address using the value that the server had generated and so not the actual e-mail that the user had entered which was always ignored
end of update perhaps you could paste the rendered javascript here without the server-side logic

20293954
prepare	execute
use the parameters that prepare statements give you
the reason you re not seeing the data is you prepare the statement but never execute it

20294206
email	dkim
if you try sending email from an ip address not associated with the legitimate owner of an email address your mail will be rejected
domainkeys identified mail dkim a method for confirming that emails claiming to have originated from a particular mail server really did originate from that server

20295484
google-chrome	firefox
i haven t looked into changing ie or google-chrome but here s what i found for firefox firefox doesn t store its settings in the registry but rather it saves it in a prefs.js file within your application data folder
in win7 the folder is c users yourusername appdata roaming mozilla firefox profiles yourprofile to change the information within your about config preferences in this case the homepage you need to modify the prefs.js file

20299245
google-chrome	firefox
apparently google-chrome does not handle 302 moved temporarily status codes efficiently when queried by angularjs in my situation
firefox properly shows there is a response where google-chrome just shows the request as canceled with no response information whatsoever

20304284
erlang	elixir
there isn t a mechanism today for you to inline erlang in elixir
if you think about it even simple list comprehensions would get tricky rather quickly because a variable in elixir follows different casing conventions than erlang

20304755
daemons	systemd
it s also good that casper suggested checking for invalid characters in those variables because you probably did not want to pass those characters along to your daemons
it can be a good idea when interpolating strings into commands to use systemd with separate arguments instead of backticks

20305973
countif	named
if the count if 0 then there s a match and you get x i m assuming that you always want the x s to appear in both boxes.....but in your example you only show the named in one name2 name1 is shown with x but not the other way round - if that s the way it should be then it s a simpler countif like this
you could use this countif formula in b2 copied across and down countif counts when the b1 named is in col a of raw_data and a2 named in col b....or vice versa

20307982
super	extends
this one is meant to be pedagogically useful if not super efficient you can make this process more efficient using functions that detect the leading 1 in a number
these sometimes go by names like clz for count leading zeros or norm for normalize . you can also extends this to signed numbers by recording the sign taking the absolute value of the integer performing the steps above and then putting the sign into bit 31 of the number

20308479
implements	extends
there are many ways to implements it - if using a contentprovider there is no need to extends the cursorloader
if not using a contentprovider and using a sqlitedatabase instead we can extends the cursorloader with our custom-loader and override the loadinbackground method of cursorloader and instead of querying the contentprovider we can query the sqlitedatabase

20310549
prepare	execute
and the prime reason for that looks like the fact that you did not enclose a string value in quotes should be you wont need to worry about these things or sql injection if you move to prepare statements using either mysqli or pdo
your query failed to execute

20311584
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
nsurlsession works at an upper level and is made to be more simple for the developer than using nsurlconnection
i made some tests and i think that there is no possibility to control the runloop and the mode of nsurlsession because they seems to be managed by an external daemon and not by your app i tested only with nsurlsessiondownloadtask

20311584
daemons	systemd
i made some tests and i think that there is no possibility to control the runloop and the mode of nsurlsession because they seems to be managed by an external daemons and not by your app i tested only with nsurlsessiondownloadtask
do this simple test download and execute this github project start a download open the downloads controller to see the state of your download pause the app wait a moment unpause the app you will see that the download has been continued while your app was paused so when you start a nsurlsession the control is passed to the systemd outside your app it means that the main part of the work doesn t take place in an internal runloop

20316818
bash	zsh
if jenkins is starting bin sh you need to test with bin sh -- not bin bash even if bin sh is a symlink to bash
and certainly not zsh

20316978
n-gram	words
a classifier is an algorithm which may or may not use n-gram for the representation of texts
n-gram is not a classifier it is a probabilistic language model modeling sequences of basic units where these basic units can be words phonemes letters etc

20316978
n-gram	words
n-gram is not a classifier it is a probabilistic language model modeling sequences of basic units where these basic units can be words phonemes letters etc
n-gram is basically a probability distribution over sequences of length n and it can be used when building a representation of a text

20317527
ubuntu	linux
so you should check whether ubuntu 13.10 has the haskell platform and it seems it does so i recommend you start from there
the linux source distribution of the haskell platform does not include ghc

20317814
icmp	udp
if you receive data or at least don t receive icmp responses then it can be assumed that the port is open but however if there are just no icmp responses it is not sure that the port is open
you need to send an empty udp frame to the port in question and check for icmp responses

20320295
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
at the time of this writing only webkit and blink google-chrome ium opera safari et all are capable of the css filter sorcery you seek
gecko firefox currently does not support any of those

20320588
rsa	aes
the result of cryptico.encrypt is not simply encrypted by rsa
indeed it was combined of two parts an aes key encrypted by rsa and the cipher of the plain text encrypted with that aes key by aes

20321261
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the answer to the question is no
you can not use the home page to open multiple windows in google-chrome as in firefox firefox can open multiple homepages

20322361
google-chrome	firefox
but you can do a workaround like by just pasting following javascript into the home page pref field under your google-chrome options and it works as expected when clicking the home button
in internet explorer you can do that like below reg add hkcu software microsoft internet explorer main v start page d f in firefox firefox uses a javascript prefs.js in your firefox user profile and not a registry entry

20326299
postgresql	mysql
most django developers that i know of uses postgresql i don t see any reason not to use it
you will never miss anything from mysql

20327154
ienumerable	ilist
in this case the method add isn t part of the ienumerable interface because it s a method of the list class only and you have that exception
you have then to change the type of your property from to more info about ilist here

20330304
ssl	https
it is also possible to use http connect to establish https connection inside the ssl connection to https proxy though not all clients support this
yes of course that s what https proxy is

20332284
trie	tree
the aho-corasick algorithm is an extension of a trie tree not far from the basic idea
aho-corasick algorithm adds a failed pointer to each node on a trie tree

20332890
spaces	delimiter
the body-part which consists of mime headers and the part body-data follows after the boundary but strictly not immediately where is any number of spaces or horizontal tabs that is it may be empty
this all means that we should be able to use the following line as a non-terminating delimiter for the first and any subsequent non-terminating boundary-delimiter plus a crlf then the body-part immediately follows starting with headers then the data these four lines can be used in a loop for each parameter

20335538
namedtuple	dictionary
for more on namedtuple and why they re awesome see pycon 2011 fun with python s newer tools by raymond hettinger
possibly depending on how you use your dictionary namedtuple could also be a solution advantages namedtuple are extremely lightweight nice dotted attribute access obj.attr disadvantages to use the unpacking like i showed on the last line you will always need to unpack all values if you need them or not

20335538
namedtuple	dictionary
of course if namedtuple fit the bill you can skip the intermediate dictionary entirely
background there s something very similar to your toy syntax that almost works getting only the list of values from the dictionary and unpacking it like a regular tuple . the problem with this is that dictionary aren t ordered their key value pairs are in an arbitrary order

20335857
cdr	cons
or a cons cell whose car is the first element of a list and whose cdr is the rest of the list
and to assume since you ve required a list that anything that doesn t match that case is a cons cell on which you can call cdr and cdr

20335857
cdr	cons
similarly car and cdr do the same thing as first and rest but car and cdr signal that you might be treating something as a pair of two things whereas first and rest clearly signal the intent that you re working with a list
your code since it seems to expect a list should probably be the following since for a list if it s not the empty list it must be a cons

20336131
vim	emacs
if you use vim the fugitive plugin makes this really simple
emacs users have magit though i ve not tried it

20336804
sudo	passwd
make sure you have expect and autoexpect installed sudo apt-get install expect sudo apt-get install expect-dev read up on it man expect man autoexpect go to your home directory cd home el user el cannot chown a file to root and must enter a passwd this is the passwd entry we want to automate
restart the terminal to ensure that sudo asks us for the passwd again

20339739
cpython	pypy
however the first thing you might want to try is to just run your code in pypy instead of cpython
some numpy code doesn t work right with pypy numpypy but there s fewer problems with each version so you should definitely try it

20339941
sudo	passwd
using git+https allowed me to run the command as sudo and have github ask me my user passwd
when i was installing from github i was able to use but since i had to run pip as sudo the ssh keys were not working with github anymore git clone failed on permission denied publickey

20340562
clang	llvm
the gcc command in the latest xcode suite is no longer the gcc frontend to llvm based on the very old gcc 4.2.1 but rather a symlink to clang
clang does not yet support openmp

20340633
queue	fifo
seeing how none of it s methods are overridable you cannot do this easily replace the standard thread queue with a priority queue
but as it says in the documentation this class provides an efficient and scalable basis for synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to synchronizers that can rely on int state acquire and release parameters and an internal fifo wait queue

20341846
testdriven.net	xunit.net
testdriven.net cannot find the xunit.tdnet modules either try the vs-based runner which should work as long as it s installed and xunit.dll is getting to your output dir or look at the docs for your version of td.net for detailed troubleshooting notes exec summary is if the .tdnet file was in your out dir or you undo and redo the xunit.installer from the folder containing the packages it should just work esp if you are on latest
you have two problems your fact is broken - if you hover over the please work bit you ll see something like for a fact to be picked up by an xunit.net runner it needs to yield unit void

20341895
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and ie alt-d is processed by the browser to move the focus to the url bar
apparently google-chrome lets the page see the keystroke first and ie does not - this is probably behavior that is not specified in the standards

20342799
uialertview	uiwindow
the internal view hierarchy of uialertview is much more complicated than it appears and starting from ios 7 it is not even added to any uiwindow so it s no big surprise that it doesn t participate to the responder chain as you expect
however you might consider of implementing the motion recognition logic within your controller instead and to have it triggering the uialertview dismissal

20344950
bower	npm
when you run gem install foundation version 1.0.4 you are installing the zurb foundation command line tool not the foundation framework zurb foundation uses bower to manage the updating of foundation
see the documentation for more details. but you need node installed as well to have it work so you would run npm install -g bower grunt-cli which installs the node packages bower and grunt on your machine then run gem install foundation and finally you re ready to create a new app with foundation new your_app and you re good to go

serializable	deserialization
the instances depends on the serializable form the non- transient field of the class while the symbolic reference represented by an instances of java.lang.class does not depend on it
the compatibility between the class present when writing a stream and the class present when deserializing it is determined by the serialversionuid if it doesn t match deserialization will always fail with an exception

20350940
google-chrome	firefox
my understanding is that extensions do not use sessions or cookies although i m guessing there is a way to store local data i do code and function reviews for addons.mozilla.org so are more knowledgable about the firefox side of things but in google-chrome it should be pretty much the equivalent well some add-ons make use of cookies and other web technologies but mostly when it comes to extensions of this kind the authors opt for something like this create a server endpoint that is easily consumable by code via xmlhttprequest-style ajax usually a rest api endpoint of some sort
extensions usually have access to some api that is either xmlhttprequest itself or resembled it firefox add-on sdk google-chrome upon user interaction the extension will issue xhr ajax calls to perform whatever action is needed query information register accounts log a user in submit new data etc

20352280
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
1 - i think dataoutputstream has buffering under the covers but for this use-case buffering does not help performance
in use-cases where you are performing multiple small writes instead of on big one there is a significant performance advantage in using a bufferedwriter or a bufferedoutputstream instead of an unbuffered writer or stream

20353371
jmeter	blazemeter
jmeter s graphing capabilities aren t very good so a jmeter as a service solution like blazemeter can provide nice latency graphs
you probably want to use a mixture of a front end load testing tool like jmeter together with a back end application performance monitoring tool like new relic

20353704
vbscript	jscript
a close solution in a single line and without using a user defined function pure vbscript btw you can use jscript in classic asp if ternary opertor is so important to you
vbscript does not have any ternary operator

20354648
serializable	deserialization
it also has a lot of features you can use like generating the serializable deserialization code
make sure you turn on the generatexmlattributes if you are generating serializable though otherwise you ll get exceptions for ordering if not defined on all elements

20356770
realloc	malloc	memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc
you can mimic the behavior of realloc manually using new delete and memcpy
by the way you should always use the same family of methods either malloc realloc free or new delete and not mix realloc with new delete

20356845
memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc
so a good idea would be to create a new buffer with extra memory memcpy and delete the old buffer. then point to this new buffer
it is not a good idea to use malloc realloc with new

20359168
punctuation	words
but that s really quite a lot of work to get around the fact that your initial output has a lot of useless data in it. and here a last example without spacing and punctuation input zrdljzexgpkyfekfslzcurtrvjritzgyviuvtipgkvizknfibjreuuvtipgkjkyvrcivrupvetipgkvunfiuyfnvmvizkjyfnjrcczkj silkvwfitvuvtipgkzferkkvdgkjwfivordgcvyvccfvetipgkvunzkyrbvpfw3zjbyffi output iamusingpythontobuildacaesarcipherdecrypteritworksanddecryptsthealreadyencryptedwordhoweveritshowsallits bruteforcedecryptionattemptsforexamplehelloencryptedwithakeyof3iskhoor
this yields found hello found me found axe if this is about seeing if the key for decyphering a text is the correct one if the result might be english words i wouldn t look for words but try to find clusters inside the result which do not comply with the english syllable apartus

20361729
prepare	execute
and you d run into a nasty edge case at the end when the total number of things being inserted isn t a multiple of the number of values lists you have in your prepare statement
if you use the approach i outline you could do the same thing use a prepare statement with multiple values lists and then when you get to that edge case at the end it s a little easier to deal with because you can build and execute one last statement with exactly the right number of values lists

20362011
inline	inlining
to achieve what you want i think you need to turn inline parameters on in the optimization pane see documentation and then click on the configure... button to define which parameters you do not want inline pconstant and pgain see the bit in the doc about inlining parameters
the structure construction you have in your code is normally used when inline parameters is turned off

20362829
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
when getview method is called you are filling adapter with data from collection but how i mentioned collection don t know about runtime changes you did if you won t update collection i tried to preserve your origin solution with onclicklistener but now i think it s not correct solution
so let s make working solution solution at first you need to use onitemclicklistener instead of current listener - it s directly designated for adapterview subclasses

20364037
clang	llvm
it seems that you have the clang headers installed but not the llvm headers which clang relies upon
when you are compiling your code you need to pass the path of llvm headers with -i to your compiler as usual

20371831
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval will fire off the next ajax call even if the previous one hasn t completed yet. use settimeout to schedule the first call and then when it completes to schedule the next etc. note that i m using complete not success to schedule the next call so that an interruption temporary drop in your net connection whatever doesn t kill the process
you can do this with a repeated series of settimeout calls

20373588
persistent	transient
depending on whether the domain is known to libvirt previously defined with that uuid it may result in two things if it is already defined the known domain is marked as started it is persistent domain but it is started with the settings supplied and not those it was defined with
in case it is not defined the domain started is now a transient domain it disappears when it is destroyed shuts down etc.

20374515
ireport	subreports
suppose we have the following enviroments our eclipse install dir c eclipse our eclipse report workspace c workspace our report project under c workspace report-project our reports under c workspace report-project src reports a master report c workspace report-project src reports masterrep.jrxml some subreports c workspace report-project src reports subrep1.jrxml another subreports c workspace report-project src reports somesubdir subrep2.jrxml the base_dir explained in next section in our workspace master report is set to c workspace report-project src reports our jasper report server gui repo id-path of our master report will be x y z which is not to-be-confused with the visual named-path which could be financial reports expenses current year in general jasper studio jasperserver and other jasper runtime environments like custom java jasper package usage it seems a good practice to declare a report parameter prefix which can vary depending on your jasper runtime environment named base_dir important here is that it seems best to assume the suffixed may be included 1 because there are cases where you may have want to use it in a way where it should be an empty or unslashed path expression which should resolve to repo subrep1.jrxml see here for more details look for subreport_dir 1 which i personally find a bad practice in general not looking at jasper reports in this respect when dealing with directory-like structures jasperstudio designer eclipse plugin the official ireport successor with loads of more functionality if you do not use the preview functionality this may be uninteresting to you unfortunately i found no practical way to fully support normal team-development with subreports and likely other relative resources as well meaning here the currently to me unknown inexistent possiblity to separate local paths and .jrxml files - if you have a version control system in place and work in different environments different local paths to repos and or different developers the master report has to contain a local path to your subreports in some way i tried different approaches that failed relative path expressions in base_dir do not work since the working directory is the eclipse dir c eclipse my.base.dir it is not available in the preview mode via new java.io.file system.getproperty my.base.dir .getcanonicalpath + for our base_dir expression these props may be only used by the designer itself but not set in preview runs just in case you may stumble upon as i did is something unrelated not useful here dealing with the storage of the report result caching of course i could write an ant task to replace these local pattern based on a regexp filter copy on every usage checkout but that seems not a good way to handle this if you solely want to work with files as i do 3 you have to reference some subrep1.jrxml like this 3 i don t need the files explicitely and do not see why i want to deal with them
btw the jasperserver webgui only seems to support the upload of files jasperserver web gui provided by some tomcat application server and storing its data in some postgres database scenario 1 reference attached subreports resource s if you do not want to reuse your report in general it seems fine to add your supreport to your master report so it is not visible in the gui repo tree - see below subitem how you could reference it outside of your master anyways if you attach your subreports it should in general have its file name as its resource id our subrep1.jrxml from above is uploaded with a resource id of subrep1.jrxml thus making the handling of local design references and server references less complicated taking the example reports from above we have to set our base_dir to repo in the to-be-uploaded master report thus the subreports expressions and should work on the server as well not recommended

20375280
laravel	codeigniter
it is not working - because laravel is not designed to have index.php in your route
i m guessing you are coming from the old codeigniter days when some sites still have index.php in their route - but this is a different routing system

20376765
setcontentview	findviewbyid
also you setcontentview more than once in the same activity which is not a good design
also findviewbyid looks for a view with the id in the current inflated layout

20379038
serializable	deserialization
the purpose of this attribute is to do not serializable itemelementname property
to restore itemelementname after deserialization based on serialized value of item

20381625
firefox	safari
you re catching the error properly but as you ve identified firefox simply isn t throwing an error
this is because fiefox doesn t choke on jsonification of dom objects where other browsers do json.stringify document.getelementbyid header in chrome and safari this line results in an error because in webkit blink cyclic dom objects like siblings exist directly on each dom object while in firefox with harmlessly produces the string

20381625
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is because fiefox doesn t choke on jsonification of dom objects where other browsers do json.stringify document.getelementbyid header in google-chrome and safari this line results in an error because in webkit blink cyclic dom objects like siblings exist directly on each dom object while in firefox with harmlessly produces the string
this is because firefox s dom objects do not have any of their own enumerable properties in webkit blink browsers this line provides an array of property names as strings because dom object have their own properties

20385982
ubuntu	debian
i realize this is not exactly what you are asking for but ubuntu was originally based on debian and will provide many familiar features such as the apt package manager
i used the debian distro discussed here i found it to be very stripped down and extremely useful

20387837
mvp	presenter
in mvp view owns presenter not the other way around. presenter is about the presentation logic not about which view and how should be opened
therefore you cannot should not instantiate and open views in presenter

20389434
clang	llvm
it looks like clang has a hierarchy of static analyzer checkers and you can disable them individually or by group
as an example the deadstore checker is deadcode.deadstores so you can disable it like this -xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -xanalyzer deadcode.deadstores alternatively you can disable all deadcode related checkers by specifying just deadcode like this -xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -xanalyzer deadcode you can get a list of all the checkers with this command clang -cc1 -analyzer-checker-help it currently outputs the following the long command line i provided above in my answer disables all 9 top level checkers alpha core cplusplus deadcode debug llvm osx security and unix plus insecureapi based on the comments below as it seems disabling security doesn t also disable security.insecureapi

20395492
aggregate-functions	sum
try it this way in case you wondered you can t chain aggregate-functions
and even if you could it wouldn t make sense because you group by userid but trying to get max of sum from all users

20396139
apache	nginx
the more proper way is to serve docs with apache nginx and make it handle the auth itself
unfortunately i made a quick google search but did not find a way to use django s user model to handle http_auth in apache or other

20399933
implements	extends
something like your service will then be the simplest possible thing on earth no need to extends implements anything rf-related if you mispell sum or you do not implements a method declared in your requestcontext you will get an error
to instantiate requestcontext s you need to extends the requestfactory interface with a public factory method for com.myapp.shared.additionservice

20400413
decoder	encoder
ffmpeg provides a h.264 decoder in the default build but not the encoder
additionally when ffmpeg is built with the h.264 encoder the default build links the encoder statically so that other applications can t use it

20403229
equals	gethashcode
note be careful when overriding equals method
you will have to also override gethashcode because the default implementation of the gethashcode method returns an integer based on the object s reference and is not based on the values of instance and class variables of the object

20403962
hex	binary
here s how they correspond hex binary 0 0000 1 0001 2 0010 3 0011 4 0100 5 0101 6 0110 7 0111 8 1000 9 1001 a 1010 b 1011 c 1100 d 1101 e 1110 f 1111 if you re not familiar with how numbers are represented in binary then that might look strange
there should be plenty of tutorials and explanations online though if you want to learn more about the details. when you see a hex number such as 0x31 you can firstly ignore the 0x prefix -- that just indicates that the number is in hexadecimal

20409667
jar	war
when eclipse builds the war file which will be deployed on the tomcat server it could be the reason that eclipse doesn t export the other project to jar automatically
you have to export the other project manually by right-click on project name export java jar file and copy the generated jar file to in my case tomcat project webcontent web-inf lib the sources that folder contains will be included in the war file

20410115
opera	firefox
supported in internet explorer 5+ netscape 6.x netscape 7.x mozilla 1.x firefox 1.x opera 6+ ... window functionality features ... dialog menusystemcommands.pngthe dialog feature removes all icons restore minimize maximize from the window s titlebar leaving only the close button
mozilla 1.2+ and netscape 7.1 will render the other menu system commands in firefox 1.0 and in ns 7.0x the command system menu is not identified with the firefox ns 7.0x icon on the left end of the titlebar that s probably a bug

20411839
spaces	linefeed
the characters character tabulation u+0009 linefeed u+000a line tabulation u+000b form feed u+000c carriage return u+000d next line u+0085 and no-break spaces u+00a0
use enumerable.takewhile char.iswhitespace and enumerable.count note that not only is a white-space but white spaces characters are the following unicode characters members of the spaceseparator category which includes the characters spaces u+0020 ogham spaces mark u+1680 mongolian vowel separator u+180e en quad u+2000 em quad u+2001 en spaces u+2002 em spaces u+2003 three-per-em spaces u+2004 four-per-em spaces u+2005 six-per-em spaces u+2006 figure spaces u+2007 punctuation spaces u+2008 thin spaces u+2009 hair spaces u+200a narrow no-break spaces u+202f medium mathematical spaces u+205f and ideographic spaces u+3000

20412113
client-side	server-side
i think the example given on the angular page actually shows an example of client-side paging
if you look at the data load that is being called by the sample script you ll see that its not actually doing any server-side paging.

20412855
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome it works for me if i add the required attribute
musically_ut s plnkr in the comments works for firefox the input element gets class ng-invalid for string abc but not for google-chrome

20412983
addition	multiplication
also your program hard to read because of lots of parentheses why not to write in addition this is equivalent to do your simplifications on paper it will make your program more readable and errors easier to spot
you forgot multiplication sign here this is a quite common error and when you see .

20415294
daemons	systemd
assuming the program will keep running when the screensaver begins it should however if it does not look into creating a daemons or service that will run in the background even when the computer is asleep there is a way to do this
my solution requires that the systemd is a windows systemd which in all likelihood it is though i would be more able to help if you had specified

20418453
jar	manifest.mf
so simplest solution in your case might be to add a similar jboss-deployment-structure.xml to the meta-inf folder of the stuff2 jar or earapp if also stuff1 needs io files and make sure it has a reference to
adds a dependencies attribute to manifest.mf or stuff2.jar or earapp to org.apache.io and thus you d not need the jboss-deployment-structure.xml-file

20418797
sse	avx
since i knew that most of the time the values of a were not prime this gave me a boost of about 3x out of max 4x with sse
i did something similar to this to find prime numbers finding lists of prime numbers with simd - sse avx this is only going to be useful with sse if the result of the comparison is false most of the time

20419408
ubuntu	freebsd
your compiler is probably treating it as an implicit declaration of a function and then erroring out when it can t resolve entries since it s a struct member and not say a variable. for example using clang if i modify your program such that instead of referencing list_foreach_safe i reference the non-existent list_foreach_safe_bogus i get a similar error the ubuntu 12.04 man page for their version of queue.h does not mention either foreach or foreach_safe for any of the data structures involved
it s unclear to me if you re using the system queue.h or explicitly using the freebsd version but either way i recommend you do a quick grep through queue.h to make sure it includes a list_foreach_safe macro

20419442
union	distinct
and a multiset except distinct b is empty is the equivalent of the and statements i ve wrapped the code in a function for ease of testing sql fiddle oracle 11g r2 schema setup query 1 with inputs as select 1 as a 2 as b 3 as c 4 as d 5 as e 6 as f 7 as g 8 as h from dual union all select 6 7 6 7 6 7 6 7 from dual union all select 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 from dual select a b c d e f g h test_multiple_values a b c d e f g h from inputs results | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | test_multiple_values a b c d e f g h | |---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|---------------------------------------| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 1 | | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7 | 2 | | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 3 |
create a collection nested table type to hold the values and the test conditions then you can use multiset operations to compare them a multiset intersect distinct b is not empty is the equivalent of the or statements

20422651
backtracking	greedy
doesn t match newline with the s modifier it does. the last backtracking control verbs backtracking control verbs are an experimental feature herited from the perl regex engine the state is experimental in perl too but if nobody use it it will not change
if i try to match aaaaab with a+ab the regex engine since + is a greedy quantifier will catch all the a five a but after it stay only a b that does not match the subpattern ab

20423730
treemap	linkedhashmap
there is also the option of treemap and treeset which do not retain the order in which elements were inserted but instead keeps them in a specified order either their natural ordering or as specified by a comparator
for set there is linkedhashset and for map there is linkedhashmap - both retain the order in which items were inserted although there is a very small performance impact

20424081
prepare	execute
you can do prepare statement with statement prepare
you can execute this prepare statement by statement execute it is similar like but you can use it for different parameters and you can save a some cpu time because parsing and planning are not necessary

20424081
prepare	execute
you can execute this prepare statement by statement execute it is similar like but you can use it for different parameters and you can save a some cpu time because parsing and planning are not necessary
so pg_execute is function for execution any prepare statement - you have to prepare prepare statement before

20425363
rspec	capybara
feature and scenario are part of rspec
this is not loaded by default when using capybara

20426122
implements	extends
you have to implements getpassengercapacity method in your car class or mark your car class as abstract
you cannot extends an abstract class and leave a method without implementing the body

20428353
jar	war
not sure about this particular jar plugin but as far as i know here is how eclipse handles web applications eclipse automatically compiles all of the sources in the class path then it creates a configuration file which tells application server to look for webapp on your project folder and does some mapping based on your project setup
this will not create a war file

20428814
nodevalue	innerhtml
let us say that you use an xml structure similar to this in javascript then you will decode by loading the xml jquery for example into a variable like xmldoc below and then getting the nodevalue for the 2nd occurence item 1 of the content tag or both notations are equivalent
if you use cdata then you must decode it correctly textcontent value and innerhtml are methods that will not return the proper data

20431484
coalesce	isnull
you wouldn t have encountered this problem if the dba had used coalesce instead of isnull which would have been my personal choice as coalesce is defined to return a type similar to that of case
coalesce returns the data type of expression with the highest data type precedence

20432022
implements	extends
a thread implements runnable since it s able to execute its own run method but runnable in general doesn t have anything related to threading itself
the default run of thread doesn t do anything that s why you usually extends it and define the specific behavior of your thread

20432487
layoutparams	viewgroup
i ve been in your situation and even though it shouldn t fail it does sometimes if we don t call it from the right place i ve proven that it s much better when creating a custom view in code to set the layoutparams programatically as well
from the documentation you can deduce that the parent viewgroup is mainly used to get the layout parameters. for that reason after you inflate with false you can build your own framelayout.layoutparams provide the inflated view with them and then adding the view to the parent. you may wanna try also instead of removing the view directly from your custom layout calling view.getparent casting it to your custom framelayout and then calling removeview ... from the casted result

20433751
move	drag
also you should move your to the constructor or form_load or just set the property to true at design time
you are making the drag drop event check if the type of data is system.string and perform no action if it isn t yet you are doing a drag drop for system.color

20435010
gson	jackson
to be sure that you are handling match for episodes episode_number 1 test if value of group 2 isn t null like but in real world you shouldn t parse json with regex but with proper parser like gson jackson
here is example of how you can do it with gson

20435040
hash-collision	key
because of hash-collision reinserting the same key does not guarantee that it ll end up in the same slot again
this is easily demonstrated in cpython 2.7 using integer key in cpython for versions before 3.3 a small dictionary starts with just a few slots in the hash table as a dictionary grows more space is created dynamically and 1 and 7 happen to hash to the same slot

20435040
hash-collision	key
python 3.3 introduced a randomized hash seed making hash-collision unpredictable
but of course it is perfectly possible to end up with a key that ll be inserted and removed over and over again if only because it is the last key in the dictionary you just cannot easily predict this will happen

20440953
aggregate-functions	sum
the first method - loose index scan - cannot be used for your query because this condition is not meet the only aggregate-functions used in the select list if any are min and max ..
your query contains sum therefore mysql cannot use the above optimalization method

20441231
vsto	add-in
since these sheets aren t hard-coded into your solution vsto has no way of recognizing them unless your code looks for such things and re-connects them at run-time
this is explained in the vsto documentation but i believe you require an add-in in order to do this for sheets

20446129
implements	extends
there is some similarity but loose coupling doesn t mean that you should implements an interface vs
extends an abstract class

20446270
content-length	content-type
as far as i know there is no way to check if the size of received content matches the value of the content-length header when using multipart form-data as content-type because you cannot get hold of the raw content
1 if you can change content-type to application x-www-form-urlencoded for example you can read php input which will contain the raw content of the request

20446474
hlsl	glsl
unlike hlsl which is compiled into a standard bytcode format by microsoft s compiler and later translated into a gpu s native instruction set by the driver opengl has no such format
you cannot use pre-compiled binaries for anything more than caching compiled glsl shaders on a single machine to speed-up load time and even then there is no guarantee that the compiled binary will work if the driver version changes.

20446940
super	extends
right now it is looking for the paintcomponent method in the default super class which is object and there is no paintcomponent method there
this is most likely because you are not extends the correct class

20446959
boost	allocator
the idea that the authors implementation is particularly short or simple or that it requires less maintenance than the boost statecharts digital camera depends on your use case and personal taste but can not be said catagorically
notice that switching states requires an allocator

20448058
vim	emacs
emacs is not based on keystrokes as vim is but keystrokes are just a means to execute functions
so pressing k in normal mode does not execute the function k as in vim but self-insert-char

20451426
jlist	jlabel
if you want to display something else then use a listcellrenderer as explained in the swing tutorial about jlist
edit your renderer has a bug it doesn t set the text of the returned component which is a jlabel

20454912
azure	hdinsight
because hdinsight cluster uses azure blob storage for data storage deleting a cluster will not impact the data
hostname hdinsight cluster name username hdinsight cluster username password hdinsight cluster password i don t think you can recover the password

20455838
uiview	subviews
last i checked the info window had to be a static uiview as it is rendered to an image
same as markers are not uiviews but only static images the way i do it return an empty transparent view to the gmsmapview and then roll your own that you add as a subviews yourself

20457338
rsa	aes
you cannot use encrypt using just aes if you ve been given an rsa public key
you need to use hybrid encryption generate a random aes key of 16 24 or 32 bytes then encrypt

20458373
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu running the following command should solve your problem sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-1.0-0
unknown mozilla path mozilla_five_home not set is hinting at the fact that the webkit library is missing on your linux system

20461555
comparator	comparable
if comparator returns 0 then the objects are considered equals and order does not matter
your homework is asking you to implement comparable and override the comparator method in order to sort objects of the bike class by their price

20461779
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
both error and runtimeexception are unchecked-exception meaning that it indicate a flaw with the program and usually should not be caught
nullpointerexception indexoutofboundsexception etc. i think the main difference between the two is that runtimeexception indicate there is a error with the program and an error is something that is fatal but out of the program s control

20462269
rspec	capybara
tag all the example groups in which you want to use capybara with describe users type feature do ... end add the following line to the spec_helper.rb require capybara rspec and add the dsl to the rspec.config block rspec.configure do |config| block ... config.include capybara dsl
these worked form me using ruby2 rails4 rspec3.0.0.beta and capybara2.2.0.beta ruby 2.0.0p353 2013-11-22 revision 43784 x86_64-linux gemfile put capybara specs in spec features not spec requests

20465975
uiview	subviews
sounds to me that the uiview which the uitableview is a subviews of is blocking the touch events
you need to make sure that the uiview subclass is not capturing any of the touch events

20466659
udp	tcp
currently the syslog udp unix-dgram drivers support multi-line messages
other drivers for example the tcp driver does not

20466867
powerpc	i386
essentially they fit into broad categories such as powerpc 32-bit powerpc powerpc 64-bit ppc64 intel 32-bit i386 intel 64-bit x86_64 arm 32-bit arm 64-bit powerpc architectures aren t supported anymore
you can add them to the architectures list as powerpc and ppc64 but xcode will just ignore them. macs nowadays have intel processors

20469759
clang	llvm
the llvm core itself does not contain any front-ends but there are many front-ends written that target it most famously clang - a c c++ and objective-c front-end for llvm
so if by generate bitcode for structure you mean generate bitcode for c structure then the code responsible for it will be in clang

20470871
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
probably works in earlier versions of opera google-chrome and firefox too not quite sure how far back though
here s an example works in opera 18 google-chrome 33 firefox nightly 28 and ie9

20471347
equals	gethashcode
here is the gethashcode definition two objects that are equals return hash codes that are equals
however the reverse is not true equals hash codes do not imply object equality

20471347
equals	gethashcode
one of the main rule is if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two objects do not have to return different values

20471347
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two objects do not have to return different values
so if your items compare as equals when having the same libellemodule property then their hash code should be identical

20472902
rdf	owl
it s not a property of owl but of the underlying rdf
from resource description framework rdf concepts and abstract syntax 3.4 literals literals are used to identify values such as numbers and dates by means of a lexical representation

20475912
moq	justmock
based on my assumption that you re using moq then you re somewhat out of luck since moq doesn t do a great job of this
the reason being that moq can t mock extension methods actually it can but you don t shouldn t want to do it - if you re using another mocking framework like justmock then your mileage may vary

20477433
allocator	stl
keep in mind that the stl will use new or custom allocator so it is not required that heapalloc will be called on windows platforms
that being said the stl documentation cannot guaranteed any run-time consistency with lower-level api calls it just defines what is implemented within its own walls

20478897
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t seem to like the multiple transitions not sure why you d have them in the first place so i kept removed all the ones that wouldn t do anything aka all the ones with 0s duration
firefox seems to ignore these other transition values updated jsfiddle in addition you need to play around with transform-origin and the webkit prefixed version in order to get the effect you desire

20480078
icomparable	gethashcode
again obviously it needs icomparable
for distinct equals and gethashcode suffice - sorting is not needed to determine a set of unique elements

20483370
rtp	rtsp
that said i put up on git an old android rtp rtsp sdp project using libs from netty and efflux
i think that this project was trying to retrieve and play just the audio track within the container vid track ignored and not pulled via network from youtube videos all of which were encoded for rtsp at the time

20483702
g++	gcc
so one idea you can try is to do something like this initial testing shows that this seems to work g++ -wall -pedantic -o2 -masm intel -s example.cpp
from the gcc onlinedocs under function attributes used this attribute attached to a function means that code must be emitted for the function even if it appears that the function is not referenced

20484300
spaces	delimiter
linktrackevents is a comma delimiter list of any events you want to track note you should not have spaces between the commas
linktrackvars is a comma delimiter list of variables you want to track

20485771
viewdidload	viewdidappear
don t present it in viewdidload instead you can load it in viewdidappear method
just for extra context you shouldn t call presentviewcontroller in viewdidload because the controller isn t visible yet possibly not even in the controller hierarchy but i m not sure and thus is not able to present another controller

20491395
cloudant	couchdb	cloudant	couchbase
edit official couchbase link above isn t valid anymore however the following official article from couchbase lists the other databases that are compatible couchdb pouchdb cloudant
according to the documents it is 100 compatible with both couchdb and couchbase

20493106
udp	tcp
thus maximum throughput possible as compared to udp based transmission is already halved
the tcp doesn t support multicasting or the new emerging standard of multicasting amt

20493356
equals	compareto
if you don t explicitly override equals they will be compared based solely off of their references despite not having a equals every object inherits one from object
if you only want b to be compared based off of sample then simply do the following additionally you should then override hashcode and compareto to maintain the contract between equals and hashcode

20494264
base	fractions
this isn t a problem with floating point numbers but with the conversion from base 10 to base 2
there are fractions in base 10 that cannot be expressed exactly

20496475
client-side	server-side
but i think better way - use client-side storage such as localstorage for setting some data before server-side validating
on high-load project server-side storage for such type of data is not good

20497216
sudo	passwd
in practice one typically types sudo make install to gain root access for that installation step only
if however this is a special case then you can add that sudo to your makefile as well target sources sudo sbin mkfs.vfat this would lead to being asked for the passwd when running the makefile. and last not least you can use that mkfs to create a file containing the newly created file system

20497366
mp4	h.264
i had the same problem and couldn t solve it with any of the proposed solutions either above or in other threads updating google chrome s version or disabling chrome s hardware acceleration didn t work either. in the end what has solved it for me has been converting the video file to a different mp4 format
it turned out that i had converted the original mp4 with an mp4 video encoder when i should have done so with an h.264 normal encoder

20497810
persistent	transient
in persistent state the managed entities of persistent context synchronize with database
in persistent context the fields of entities annotated with transient behave as ordinary variable behavior depends upon application and jpa did not allow this property state to behave like mapped object property in transaction perform with entities within the persistent context

20498290
super	implements
your selection sort method means that if you invoke it with an array of type t than you must also provide a comparator of type t or a super type of t
for example if you have the following classes than this will work because truckcomparator implements and a truck is equal to the array s type truck vehiclecomparator implements and a vehicle is a super type of the array s type truck this will not work selectionsort trucks new bigtruckcomparator

20500914
client-side	server-side
then you can use it like this you could also leverage the jquery validate plugin to perform the same conditional validation client-side
modelstate.addmodelerror is server-side validation so the error message will not go away until you post to the server

20505149
flac	ogg
flac and opus may be options but once again you d need to find an application or library that can write the ogg container format for you as i m not aware of any fully managed ogg writers
to answer your first question to create mp3 or ogg you need an encoder

20508167
shadowing	named
the main issue here isn t shadowing its coffeescript conflating variable initialization and variable reassignment and not allowing the programmer to specify their intent exactly when the coffee-script compiler sees it has no idea whether you meant i want a new variable but i forgot i m already using that named in an upper scope or i want to reassign a value to a variable i originally created at the top of my file this is not how you forbid shadowing in a language
this is how you make a language that punishes users who accidentally reuse a variable named with subtle and hard to detect bugs

20510776
union	distinct
you shouldn t need a union for this and generally when you have two queries that can t possibly intersect you should use union all which avoids a unique sort or similar operation
also distinct cannot apply to a single column as your current query seems to imply

20514150
rdf	owl
furthermore literals whose datatype is rdf plainliteral can be abbreviated in functional-style syntax ontology documents as plain rdf literals rdf concepts
these abbreviations are purely syntactic shortcuts and are thus not reflected in the structural specification of owl 2

20514150
rdf	owl
rdf literals are defined as joshua said
now the treatment of literals in owl 2 ontologies does not apply to owl 2 full ontologies that is rdf graphs and therefore owl 2 full ontologies can have true non-typed literals and only these can have a language tag

20517333
noexcept	throw
some implementations want to throw an exception there which they are allowed to since it s undefined behavior they can do anything but a standard-mandated noexcept on those functions makes this impossible
the standard s policy on noexcept is to only mark functions that cannot or must not fail but not those that simply are specified not to throw exceptions

20517333
noexcept	throw
the standard s policy on noexcept is to only mark functions that cannot or must not fail but not those that simply are specified not to throw exceptions
in other words all functions that have a limited domain pass the wrong arguments and you get undefined behavior are not noexcept even when they are not specified to throw

20517874
interpolation	splines
here are some hints splines cubics splines is not interpolation but approximation to use them you do not need any derivation
if you have ten points p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p8 p9 then cubic splines starts ends with triple point

20518286
memcpy	memmove
in theory memcpy can be faster if only because it doesn t check for overlapping memory buffers
you should use memmove when there s a chance that the source and destination buffers overlap - it is specified to work in that case whereas memcpy isn t

20521414
noexcept	throw
std vector will use move when it needs to increase or decrease the capacity as long as the move operation is noexcept
suppose an exception throw during the move the previous trunk is not the same as before move happens resources are stolen leaving the vector in an broken state

20521669
google-chrome	firefox
turns out i was wrong - user downloaded the file via google-chrome which also sets this flag
firefox doesn t set it i checked on the latest versions to date

20523862
fgets	getline
use fgets to read entire line into a buffer make sure your buffer is big enough
example updated with inputs from chux - and instrumented with some additional code to aid in debugging the n 1 problem note there are other more robust methods of reading lines to make sure you have everything my favorite is getline but it is not available for all compilers

20524312
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
nullpointerexception is a subclass of runtimeexception
a runtimeexception is an unchecked-exception meaning that you do not need to catch it

20524504
express	node.js
if you learn owin it would be much easier to learn other web development frameworks like express for node.js or rack for ruby because the practices they use are similar
if i have to define owin for myself that would be the best ideas from the ruby and node.js web dev communities coming to .net but this would not help any asp.net developer

20524607
fixed-point	fractions
a major drawback compared to the fixed-point solution is that the fractions term gets rounded off between iterations if you are using the function to continually walk towards a moving target at differing step lengths
oh and for the record your original code does not seem to be properly accumulating the fractions when stepping a 1 100 increment will always be truncated to 0 in the addition no matter how many times the step is taken

20527200
innodb	myisam
still optimizing innodb does optimize the data by flattening out the b-tree nodes and freeing up unused deleted keys which improves sequential reads table scans and secondary indexes are similar to indexes in myisam so they get rebuilt to flatten them out
conclusion i m not trying to make a case to stick with myisam

20527595
entity-relationship	diagram
also for your diagram i m just guessing this is for a class you might want to look into software such as visio or visual paradigm to create your entity-relationship diagram
while most people will be able to understand your current diagram that s not correct modeling

20529298
portrait	landscape
about ios and when the viewport has defined i ve always been bothered by how the page jumps when going to from portrait landscape on ios making me lose my place
when only is defined then the page doesn t jump on portrait to landscape rotation and i get a larger zoomed-in view

20529631
inline	inlining
note that inlining small functions often results in smaller and faster code basically because the otherwise necessary calling sequence often requires more instructions than what is inline and the optimizer gets a better chance to further reduce the code by a more holistic view of what s going on
where template code isn t inline duplicate instantiations in different translation units need to be merged into just one instantiation

20530013
ciimage	uiimage
it only sets a flag somewhere in the file that tells which orientation it should be displayed in the exif.image.orientation to be precise flag that the uiimageview respects but that is lost when you convert to cgimage and then ciimage
you can know whether or not to flip x and y values by looking at the original uiimage s imageorientation property

20533036
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
from the pypi page pgmagick is a yet another boost.python based wrapper for graphicsmagick it s not imagemagick but you should get equivilent functionality from the looks of it
try pip install pgmagick see this seems to be a python wrapper around graphcsmagick imagemagick

20533801
implements	extends
this technique is illustrated in wwdc 2013 video implements engaging ui on ios
the issue isn t that it s not blurring all of the image but rather that the blur is extends the boundary of the image making the image larger and it s not lining up properly as a result

20534063
aggregate-functions	sum
as blorgbear and matt welch said you need to include all columns that are not in an aggregate-functions in the group by
the reason for this is that you are trying to tell it to sum one value but not what to put in the other columns

20538955
matplotlib	colormap
this can be done like im not aware of very fancy methods in matplotlib
there is a brand new python module trollimage which has a really nice implementation of working with colormap

20539710
hive	hdfs
yet until recently these features have not been considered a part of hive s feature set
this is because hive was built to operate over hdfs data using mapreduce where full-table scans are the norm and a table update is achieved by transforming the data into a new table

20542319
nfa	dfa
it is hard to make this work with back-references because then the state of the nfa cannot be described by just saying whether a state is live or not
you can compile a regular expression to a nfa or a dfa although the dfa calculated from an nfa may be impractically large

20542954
clang	llvm
if you want to see the list clang applies check this related stackoverflow question about how to see the list
although in general clang attempts to copy the command-line options from gcc there are different optimization passes in gcc and llvm so specific optimization flags are not shared

20543231
onclick	onchange
do not use the onclick event
use onchange onclick works well with buttons but any kind of input reacts better on change

20548067
setinterval	settimeout
you can use setinterval to achieve the functionality you requrie
all your settimeout calls are made immediately after each other in the loop and do not wait for each other to complete

20553640
freebsd	linux
for example a wyse terminal ancient terminal from the antediluvian era has absolutely different control sequences as a linux or a freebsd console
only copying the library isn t enough you need to copy etc terminfo l linux as well

20553944
jar	manifest.mf
a valid runnable executable jar has the next structure myjar main-directory |-meta-inf mandatory |-manifest.mf mandatory main-class com.mainclass |-com |-mainclass.class must to implement the main method mandatory |-properties files optional |-etc optional if you jar complies with these rules it will work doesn t matter if you biuld it manually by using a zip tool and then you changed the extention back to .jar once you re done try execute it on the command line using java -jar myjar.jar when you use a zip tool to unpack change files and zip again normally the jar structure changes to this structure which is incorrect since another directory level is added on the top of the file system making it a corrupted file as is shown below
this regularly occurs when you change the extension on the jar for zip extract the zip content and make some modifications on files such as changing the manifest.mf file which is a very common case many times eclipse doesn t generate the manifest file as we want or maybe we would like to modify the class-path or the main-class values of it

20554673
uicollectionview	uitableview
uicollectionview doesn t have the same beginupdates and endupdates that uitableview has to let it work easily with nsfetchedresultscontroller so you have to queue them or you get internal consistency runtime exceptions
combining a fetched results controller with a collection view is a bit tricky. the problem is explained in if you re looking for how to get around the nsinternalinconsistencyexception runtime exception with uicollectionview i have an example on github detailing how to queue updates from the nsfetchedresultscontrollerdelegate

20558559
uilabel	uitextview
the proper way to get a uilabel to vertically align is to not use a uilabel
use a uitextview multiline uitextfield and observe the content property like so basically what s happening here is we set the class we re in as the observer looking at the contentsize property with an option of nskeyvalueobservingoptionnew so every time the content changes - void observevalueforkeypath ofobject change context will get called and then you can calculate an offset size to align the text appropriately

20560318
google-chrome	safari
can not test on safari but a similar bug happened time ago in google-chrome
the solution in that case would have been to move the back 1px in z this happened in google-chrome because while animating the spatial order was calculated i mean the position of elements in 3d space and it overrides other factors

20561973
erlang	elixir
if you search the erlang questions mailing list you can find plenty of discussion on the topic
note that protocols in elixir are not implemented like that though

20564925
translation	localization
however it s not very desirable to create a clone of the storyboard s to do translation it s just not very maintainable in the long run
the magic happens using the base localization feature

20566688
bash	zsh
example script doit.sh example command line after chmod a+rx doit.sh echo -v | xargs doit.sh compare with echo | xargs doit.sh edit 1 responding further to kdb s comment answer below running into situations where exporting functions does not work at all export of shell functions is not posix compatible - it only works with bash and presumably other shells such as zsh ksh etc
that is in dash and standard posix shells not providing export -f we cannot export functions and if we export a function say in bash then run a script which starts with the sh-bang #

20567347
hex	binary
if the php code assumes one encoding which usually isn t utf-8 because php can t handle multibyte strings by default so it just takes a character for every byte while the database uses another for example utf-8 the utf-8 scheme can use mutiple bytes to encode a code point to a character as can be seen on the wikipage codepoints below 127 are stored in a single byte using the following scheme 0xxx xxxx where x is the bits of the code point. if a codepoint is above 127 ie more than 7 bits it uses two bytes 110x xxxx 10xx xxxx the has a codepoint of 27 hex or 10 0111 binary
normaly this is stored in a single byte 0 010 0111 in hex still 27 a malicious attacker could choose to store this in two bytes padded with 0 s 110 0 0000 10 10 0111 and in hex c0 a7 now php processes this and assumes these two bytes are two separate characters because it just uses ascii

20570066
super	self
you cannot use super myclass self within a decorated class in this way
myclass is looked up as a global and the global myclass is rebound to decorator so you are telling python to look in the class mro for __init__ starting from decorator which is myclass which calls super myclass self .__init__ looking up myclass as a global which is bound to decorator etc

20570066
super	self
myclass is looked up as a global and the global myclass is rebound to decorator so you are telling python to look in the class mro for __init__ starting from decorator which is myclass which calls super myclass self .__init__ looking up myclass as a global which is bound to decorator etc
the easiest work-around is to not use super here this is one of the reasons why in python 3 the argument-less version of super was introduced giving methods a __class__ cell instead

20570122
mp4	webm
windows only xmedia recode the info behind it all html5 - mp4 video does not play in ie9 stslavik s answer from as of this writing this is the landscape of html5 video mozilla firefox 3.5 and later supports theora video and vorbis audio in an ogg container
firefox 4 also supports webm

20570122
mp4	webm	h.264	webm
internet explorer 9 supports all profiles of h.264 video and either aac or mp3 audio in an mp4 container
it will also play webm video if you install a third-party codec which is not installed by default on any version of windows

20572108
rsa	aes
either way you cannot encrypt more than a few hundred bytes directly with rsa
thus you will have to securely generate a random symmetric key doing that properly in javascript is not easy encrypt the data with it using a secure symmetric cipher aes in a secure block cipher mode then encrypt the symmetric key with rsa

20574673
jar	war
if it is a web project than just put in the configurations which are necessary for this web-project and deploy it as a war file not as a jar or ear
has your ejb client jar the ejbs with in it or the configuration files or does it contain just the interface classes. seems that you client server also tries to initialize your beans which indeed is not necessary

20577291
ssl	https
record_too_long often usually means you sent non-ssl-data to a client expecting ssl
try to visit your site and port via http not https

20580241
lwjgl	jogl
for example the jogl backend is gone from recent version of libgdx so you don t need to worry about switching to the lwjgl backend
also the current lwjgl bundled into libgdx is 2.9.0 hopefully that doesn t change too much though

20580243
daemons	systemd
on the adb shell you can open dev input uevent device to write mouse events include relative movement click action absolute position you might want this however you cannot do it as a normal application unless you do it on a rooted device or you can use adb shell to start a daemons service in the background to perform the event writing for your application
mouse event is managed by the systemd framework

20581950
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found out this problem via another so question this problem is also addressed at here which caused some developers to leave google-chrome and migrate to firefox
it seems google-chrome can not store cookies with domain localhost

20583559
persistent	transient
hibernate doesn t know how you want to persistent it in the database
to solve the problem you have a few options 1 you can explicitly tell your persistence provider to ignore certain fields using the transient annotation

20584460
n-gram	words
edit in response to comment i always thought n-gram referred first to individual characters but wikipedia says they are order sets of any items
you can readily handle words with the above schema just by introducing a separator that is not an allowed character in any words say the | delimiter

20586771
multiplication	modulo
modular multiplication allows you to find a b mod c as a mod c b mod c mod c
we can rewrite the entire algorithm in a way that only limits n and x to the precision of the machine integers and not 2 sup n sup the cast to unsigned long long above allows modulo to be as large as 2 32 - 1 assuming unsigned int is 32 bits without the computation overflowing

20586941
gruntjs	package.json
so you need to have gruntjs as a local dependency in your package.json file just like any other module wheres you would not list grunt-cli in there
you have installed grunt-cli as a global package but you also need to install gruntjs locally

20587653
clang	llvm
take a look here it appears that a temporary workaround is to correct the symlink for the 3.5 llvm toolchain it seems that the symlink usr lib clang 3.5 include erroneously points to .. .. llvm-3.4 lib clang 3.5 include but should instead point to .. .. llvm-3.5 lib clang 3.5 include the workaround of course is to manually correct the symlink
for the 3.4 toolchain the usr lib clang 3.4 include doesn t exist at all

20587653
clang	llvm
for the 3.4 toolchain the usr lib clang 3.4 include doesn t exist at all
i have not tried llvm 3.4 on ubuntu so i don t know if createing a symlink to .. .. llvm-3.4 lib clang 3.4 include will fix the problem but it does seem likely

20588022
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	fixed-point	fixed-point	fractions
as you know the double-precision format looks like this the key to understanding denormalized numbers is that they are not actually floating-point numbers but instead use a fixed-point micro-format using the representations that are not used in the normal format
normal floating-point numbers are of the form where e is found by subtracting the bias from the exponent field above and m is a number between 1 and 2 where the bits after the binary point are given by the fractions above

20591370
dns	spf
the most common one i run into is the lack of a ptr aka reverse dns record on a part of the sending machine
or perhaps the spf sender policy framework record for your domain not validating your ip address

20593802
google-chrome	firefox
if you re not interested in any of the tab update events described above and only in dom node changes just stick to content scripts and have almost the same code in your google-chrome extension and firefox add-on
google-chrome s content script are declared in the manifest file whereas firefox content scripts are declared in main.js

20595252
invokelater	invokeandwait
you do not need invokelater from within any event callback which includes the one submitted to the swing timer because they are already guaranteed to be called on the event dispatch thread
actions triggered by the swing timer as well as runnables submitted to invokelater are all executed sequentially on the event dispatch thread and as long as you don t involve invokeandwait no other thread is waiting for an action to complete

20595376
namedtuple	dictionary
you can construct a namedtuple using keyword arguments but it doesn t ignore spurious ones
so you ll still need to filter them manually - but you can now do this with a dictionary comprehension rather than a different namedtuple the trick is getting the dictreader set up in the first place

20598639
g++	gcc
in other versions such as g++ mingw the c runtime is an older version which doesn t call quite as directly to heapalloc but at the base of it it still goes to heapalloc - to find something different we need to go back to windows pre-95 which did have a globalalloc and localalloc set of functions - but i don t think people use 16-bit compilers these days - at least not for windows programming
the duplicate in qwr s comment has an answer that shows a snippet from visual c++ not mingw but it s still relevant if you re on windows as you can see it s very similar to the gcc snippet

20598970
google-chrome	firefox
the effect is less today as the engines has become smarter especially v8 in google-chrome which seem to be able to predict cache this better internally while in firefox it seem to still have a some impact not to cache these variables in code
for short operations very little but drawing 16 500 bunnies onto canvas is demanding and do gain a benefit from doing this in firefox so any micro-optimization do actually count in situations such as this

20602890
implements	extends
additionally you could implements a getdetail method which would be displayed when the widget detail uri was hit
the methods you have in your sample code do not appear to fit this approach so i m guessing that class is not an actual controller class therefore you do not need to extends basecontroller

20603577
google-chrome	firefox
insertbronreturn is a mozilla specific cmd google-chrome doesn t support that
you can test that with document.querycommandsupported insertbronreturn jsfiddle here it alert true in firefox but false in google-chrome

20606058
implements	extends
i also successfully implements this method in a prime number finder finding lists of prime numbers with simd - sse avx agner fog implements 32-bit but not 64-bit division in his vector class using the method described in that paper
that would be a good place to start if you want some code but you will have to extends it to 64-bit

20606617
uiview	calayer
instruments is saying that your uiview are leaking or not deallocated to be precise
each push will create a new destinationcontroller and the destinationcontroller s view will be backed by a calayer and calayer kills memory

20608661
vsto	add-in
that would mean not using vsto in your run time component
for docx you could have a look at my presentation for an overview of approaches for xlsx see i know about vsto but it seems it is purposed generally for extending office with add-in

20608676
persistent	transient
instead of in oncreate restore your variable in onrestoreinstancestate the docs also say note because onsaveinstancestate is not guaranteed to be called you should use it only to record the transient state of the activity the state of the ui you should never use it to store persistent data
instead you should use onpause to store persistent data such as data that should be saved to a database when the user leaves the activity

20609580
rspec	capybara
has_selector or its alias have_selector is the method of capybara not rspec
you are using plain rspec here so these methods are not possible

20609949
strtol	strncpy
instead you might want to use strtol instead
also note that strncpy might not terminate the string in some cases

20612698
ansible	puppet
for orchestration see tools like mcollective capistrano ansible .
in a distributed puppet setup the apply order isn t guaranteed

20612750
equals	gethashcode
keep in mind that two objects returning the same value from gethashcode does not imply equality - it only implies that two objects might be equals
the flip however is that two equals objects must return the same hash code

20613080
accelerometer	gyroscope
in this video i am not using the accelerometer at all
there are two points that could help you get better results 1 unless your sensor remains totally horizontal you cannot get the z-axis rotation using this formula to explain why imagine this if your gyroscope turned 90 degrees around the x axis then 90 degrees around the z axis you would not obtain the same result as if it only turned 90 degrees around the z axis

20616637
noexcept	throw
the standard does not require this signature to be noexcept
the standard does allow vendors to add noexcept if the function will never throw

20616751
express	node.js
if you want to install the package for all node.js instances you ll need to run npm -g install express or depending on your server s security model sudo npm -g install express sometimes you ll need to link the package if the linking failed you ll get a cannot find module x error via sudo npm link express if you want to read more about it this blog post is a good read
npm install express ...will install express only into the current folder path that you have in your terminal

20617999
d3.js	protovis
let us not forget that d3.js is based off protovis
however ccc uses protovis detailed info on the pentaho forum google pentaho protovis d3.js or the like

google-chrome	firefox
i created a separate print.css and added the following works fine with google-chrome but the negative margins kills ie
firefox doesn t seem to need it

20621908
hex	binary
in this case you ve got a string of 10 hex characters representing your 4-byte number like this 0x55667788 in python 2.x you would be allowed to write this incorrect data to a binary file it would show up as the 10 bytes 30 78 35 35 36 36 37 37 38 38 rather than the four bytes you want 55 66 77 88
python 3.x is smarter and only allows you to write bytes or bytearray or similar to a binary file not str

20622651
implements	extends
i would simply declare an abstract method shutdown in controller class which will be implements by greenhousecontrols
i don t know the details of your architecture however it may be good to have an abstract class controller which cannot be instantiated if more than one other classes extends it

20623535
spaces	delimiter
i hope that your original files do not use spaces
if they have just use some other delimiter to separate the filename and its checksum

20623723
trie	tree
the other answers re trie are good
but as a close approximation just for quick understanding vector internally uses a tree - not a binary tree but a 32-ary tree each 32-way node uses array 32 and can store either 0-32 references to child nodes or 0-32 pieces of data the tree is structured to be balanced in a certain way - it is n levels deep but levels 1 to n-1 are index-only levels 100 child references

20624755
sudo	passwd
i was able to resolve this issue by launching the actual webstorm application from the command line using the sudo command as follows sudo applications webstorm.app contents macos webide once webstorm phpstorm are launched this way you can run a script with root access without supplying root credentials
i too faced the same issue but i work with sensitive data on my development machine and removing the passwd requirement for sudoers just isn t an option

20625504
implements	extends
also use override annotation also remove this also remove this implements onclicklistener
this does not refer to activity context coz networksactivity extends fragment

20628892
client-side	server-side
most of that functionality will not work - could not work - if you add meta tags through client-side script
you should add the meta tags server-side

20629461
profiling	instrumentation
run profiling on device not on simulator
run time profiling then select tab instrumentation and in context menu choose simulate background fetch

20632590
ansible	puppet
take a look a tools like ansible capistrano .
currently we a have a per feature branch flow i ve setup jenkins with several jobs my_project-ci one that poll the git server and do continuous integrations on all branch starting with then we a have a build pipeline my_project launch test once the something is merged in master it then archive the workspace and trigger the following job my_project-staging this one deploy automatically to the stating servers my_project-production this one is triggered manual the cycle looks like local clone - git branch -b feature super-feature - commit - local build - git push jenkins jenkins cron for origin feature local other dev review the feature via pull request local fix - commit - local build - push local other dev merge the pullrequest in master jenkins jenkins cron origin master jenkins trigger my_project-staging local validate deployment and trigger manually the my_project-production jenkins deploy to production i m not a big fan of using puppet for deployment it works great for provisionning but it handles badly orchestration of deployments eg run db migration in a cluster remove one member from load balancer deploy re-add to balancer

20638659
floating-point	fractions
modulo as euclidean division candidate modulo code note about floating point double fmod double x double y even though called fmod it is not the same as euclidean division mod but similar to c int remainder the fmod functions compute the floating-point remainder of x y
c11dr 7.12.10.1 2 disambiguation c also has a similar named function which breaks the argument value into integral and fractions parts each of which has the same type and sign as the argument

20639019
mongoid	mongomapper
the latest versions of devise seem to only have orm support for mongoid and active record
there are some gems around which might help but they are out of date and probably will not work with the latest devise mongomapper

20639719
rspec	capybara
you need to either make it a request spec and configure rspec to include capybara dsl for request specs leave it a feature spec and stop using methods like get which aren t intended for use with feature specs here s some interesting background on introducing feature specs as distinct from request specs
as of capybara 2.0 the capybara methods visit are only available by default for feature specs not request specs or controller specs

20640924
pandas	pytables
pandas issue pytables issue
you cannot supply a large list to be selected through and not have the entire pandas object loaded into memory

20641615
google-chrome	safari
conclusion when you are using google-chrome on ios you are using safari and that s why it doesn t appear in the caniuse table
according to this link that s is because google-chrome for ios is not google-chrome

20641615
google-chrome	safari
the user agent that google-chrome for ios is using is the safari one with one addition crios google-chrome for ios i guess
there is no google-chrome word inside the user agent so if you are doing something special for google-chrome you are safe and it s not going to be executed on google-chrome on ios

20643910
shadowing	named
in my foobar example the shadowing was done explicitly but with this the shadowing always happens because each function gets a new local-scope this
you can access the outer this by aliasing it a new named done here by formal argument if you don t alias the outer this to a new named you will not have access to it because it will be shadowed by local this

20646320
istream	getline
replace std getline by creating a wrapper around std istream getline if you want to avoid excessive temporary memory allocations you could use a loop which grows the allocation as needed probably doubling in size on each pass
don t forget that exceptions might or might not be enabled on the istream object

20646662
build.gradle	gradlew
i have read this page and have determined the following a build script build.gradle is not required in the root if it is a multi module project
however a settings.gradle file must be located in the root to inform gradlew w what projects will be participating in the build

20647328
entity-relationship	diagram
identifying relationship gives out one to many optional relationship when we have to define parent to child relationship.in addition it gives one to only one relationship from child to parent flow.since parent entity primary key will be the part of primary key of child entity child entity instance will identify the parent entity instance.it is represented by solid line in entity-relationship diagram
where as non identifying relationship will many to many relationship.for the existence of child entity instance there should have parent entity instance but each entity instance in child entity may be related to many entity instance of parent entity.this is the reason why primary key of parent entity well be the foreign key of child entity but child entity will not take parent entity primary key as its primary key.it will have its own primary key. many to many relation doesn t exist in real world entity-relationship diagram

20649485
rvm	bundler
loadmodule passenger_module usr local rvm gems ruby-2.0.0-p353 global gems passenger-4.0.29 buildout apache2 mod_passenger.so passengerroot usr local rvm gems ruby-2.0.0-p353 global gems passenger-4.0.29 passengerdefaultruby usr local rvm wrappers ruby-2.0.0-p353 global ruby i just added it to the top really does not matter where you add it everything works
after you have done that make a new ruby on rails application with these steps rvm use rvm ruby-2.0.0-p353 test --create gem install rails gem install bundler rails new tester cd tester after which you need to create a new sites-avaliable.mine looks like this

20649646
awt	swing
java mouse listeners are only meant for swing awt components and that too from the same running process
if you want to listen for mouse keyboard events from other apps use the jnativehook library.you can install a global keyboard hook and listen for keypress or a mousehook for mouse events.you do not need to use swing or other gui classes

20650087
equals	gethashcode
on the other hand being able to know that one object isn t equals to 999 990 others without looking at them is apt to be a lot faster than looking at the no matter how fast the equality comparison would otherwise be
the essential aspect of gethashcode is that an observation that two objects hashcodes differ constitutes not only an observation that the objects are different but an observation of something much more powerful if the hashcodes of all the items in one set have a property lacked by those of all the objects in another then the sets have no items in common

20651363
primes	palindrome
also you should only check for numbers with odd number of digits since if a number has even number of digits and it is a palindrome then it will always be divisible by 11 and cannot be primes
once you get the first palindrome number that has odd number of digits and that is just higher than the current number test it for primality and find the next palindrome number higher than this one

20652232
realloc	malloc
keep track of your buffer-size when you reallocate update buffsize first then use that as the argument to realloc of course also update your condition and when you re- malloc reset i and buffsize though re- malloc ing is not very wise since if an allocation fails there are usually bigger problems unless memory is very restricted
and especially since you don t check the result of that malloc possibly problematic since that malloc may fail as well

20652526
calloc	malloc
comparing the signatures of the functions we have basically the argument to malloc is the product of the arguments to calloc
you can convert by just setting one of them to 1 since the nmemb number of members to calloc doesn t affect the actual structure of the memory in any way this is safe

20657371
scheme	racket
first off doesn t exist in scheme r5rs r6rs r7rs
remove does exist in r6rs and does what you want in the scheme dialect racket you have both remove and and it seems you are using racket since it does work in the way you are describing

20658431
prepare	execute
note regarding dll compilation visual studio has at least three compilation targets available dependant on what you have installed etc x86 - x64 - anycpu how these interact and co-habit can be a pain if not done correctly and they behave differently dependant on the bit-count of the os you are utilising therefore i have prepended a small quick guide to how the bitness for lack of a better term causes interplay between different setups lets take 3 dll files all with the same code in them which we in true blue peter fashion prepare earlier anycpu.dll -- compiled anycpu x86.dll -- compiled x86 x64.dll -- compiled x64 and 3 executable files all doing the same calling a console output of bitness interplay from a dll
anycpu.exe -- compiled anycpu x86.exe -- compiled x86 x64.exe -- compiled x64 the code is identical in all cases however the compilation target has changed and they work refuse to work in 32 64bit os variants as follows 32-bit os anycpu.exe -- execute as 32-bit process dll usage can load anycpu.dll and x86.dll causes badimageformatexception if it tries to load x64.dll x86.exe -- execute as 32-bit process dll usage can load anycpu.dll and x86.dll causes badimageformatexception if it tries to load x64.dll x64.exe -- execute as badimageformatexception when it tries to run 64bit os anycpu.exe -- execute as 64bit process dll usage can load anycpu.dll and x64.dll causes badimageformatexception if it tries to load x86.dll x86.exe -- execute as 32-bit process dll usage can load anycpu.dll and x86.dll causes badimageformatexception if it tries to load x64.dll x64.exe -- execute as 64bit process dll usage can load anycpu.dll and x64.dll causes badimageformatexception if it tries to load x86.dll so unless you truly need a certain bitness bitlyness there is no nice word for it

20658705
pbkdf2	md5	scrypt	md5
other reasonable choices if using argon2 is not available are scrypt bcrypt and pbkdf2
wikipedia has pages for these functions md5 sha1 and sha256 are message digests not password-hashing functions

20664947
jar	war
however if a persistence unit of the same name is defined by an ejb-jar war or application jar file within the ear the persistence unit of that name defined at ear level will not be visible to the components defined by that ejb-jar war or application jar file unless the persistence unit reference uses the persistence unit name # syntax to specify a path name to disambiguate the reference.
according to jpa specification 8.2 persistence unit packaging within java ee environments an ejb-jar war ear or application client jar can define a persis- tence unit

20665121
ssl	https
if you plan to use ssl in production in general public application not company-distribution app you need to ensure your certificate has one of the following root authorities ssl root certificates for windows phone os 7.1
when we had same issue we purchased ssl certificate from one of those providers and after installing it on server we were able to make https requests to our services with no problem

20666794
factors	mean
the meaning of best is pretty fuzzy deciding which route is best involves balancing competing factors distance travel time number of turns and many more
we boil all these factors down to a cost associated with each candidate route and display the route with the lowest cost. biking directions seem to adjust for elevation in picking the route though that does not mean the distance is adjusted for it

20666962
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
this works in node.js google-chrome and firefox
it is not yet supported in safari or ie

20667588
multiplying	subtract	multiplying	multiplication
i m not sure you can multiplying against a time field in sql
adding and subtract is fairly easy but multiplication would get a bit more complicated

20668417
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	iqueryable
in fact iqueryable inherits from ienumerable
furthermore when debugging if you try to see what s going on the ide might materialize it to show it in the nice vs floating guis debugging tools in my experience jumping back and forth from asenumerable to asqueryable doesn t materialize it until i invoke an toarray tolist or any other that inherits from icollection but keep in mind that iqueryable keeps calculation in-memory similar to a graph

20668487
factors	matrix
to be more explicit and if you data might include factors then you may wish to convert yourself via data.matrix eg solve t data.matrix nfl_data but either way there is no need to strip out by hand each row-vector from the data frame bind these row-wise and then transpose
the informative bit when you do str a is this in other words a is a list not a matrix

20671375
actionscript	mxml
when we need to skin textinput and textarea in mobile we need to subclass the default spark.skins.mobile.mobileskin or mobiletextinputskin since mobile skin using actionscript is light-weight skin comparing to the default mxml skin
if you skin textinput and textarea using mxml on some devices like samsung s phone and tablet which do not use the default google android keyboard you will get the problem that the softkeyboard will not appear when the input is focused

20672279
antialiasing	transparent
you might like to take a look at lcd text antialiasing on the fringe which is an interesting read but i m not sure it will help much.
this will have to do with how swing awt deals with the different requirements between an opaque and transparent window and changes being made internally to the anti aliasing

20673101
setinterval	settimeout
...in other words you shouldn t be repeatedly calling setinterval
what you want is settimeout which waits the specified amount of time and then calls the specified method once

20673571
draggable	droppable
by default jqueryui droppable are set to only accept draggable when at least 50 of its width is over the droppable area
because you have not set a width on your draggable they are much wider than double your droppable width

20673571
draggable	droppable
because you have not set a width on your draggable they are much wider than double your droppable width
you can remedy this by setting tolerance touch on your droppable which will make it accept any element dropped when touching it as in this example or tolerance pointer which will cause your droppable to accept any draggable element that is dropped while the mouse pointer is over the droppable as in this example

20682368
implements	extends
but since you expect the proxy to have the same type as the proxied bean you ll have to use inheritance or demand interfaces which you then could implements but this would not be an approach where every pojo could be a bean for cdi
that is they internally extends from the class you want to inject generate some proxy code around that and give you that sub class

20684849
vb.net	vb6
even if you could get all of the error messages i would say it s not the best way to judge the amount of time it will take you to port from vb6 to vb.net
they are very different environments vb6 being essentially an sta com environment while vb.net is just another clr language and these differences can manifest in unexpected ways

20685615
translation	localization
here are three great ones resxcrunch zeta resource editor resourcestudio not yet released zeta is the most polished and allows for active translation of resource strings
i am developing resourcestudio that will be an all singing and dancing localization tool that will eventually cover all platforms - this won

20686802
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
as with any inline-functions this doesn t guarantee machine code inlining
with respect to machine code inlining inline is just a hint it s guaranteed effect is about permitting a definition in each translation unit and requiring such a definition in each translation unit where it s used

20688205
profiling	debugging
but if you like me are using maven you have to check in pom.xml too let me show an example you can ave a production profiling and in that profiling you can have the maven compiler plugin with debugging setting to false see the false setting if you have a similar setting on your pom.xml local variable on debugging are not show
in my nb 7.4 there is a generate debugging info flag on project propertyes - build - compile

20688427
implements	extends
but the method s arguments are selected by only checking reference not by class of actual object passed as argument. here by forcing dynamic dispatch twice by making two methods for same purpose the library developers have indirectly implements double dispatch
in future you might want to extends both drawable and renderwindow

20689685
octal	decimal
edited as per rici s advice read comment below.. because ddd is character octal representation
061 is octal not decimal ascii code of 1 and whether you write 61 it s not decimal or 061 is one and same thing

20690043
serializable	deserialization
since you ve chosen to not serializable __parentkey which you can t anyways because dictionaries are not serializable when the instance of wsexeccommand is deserialized on the other end of the wire then __parentkey is null which then results in an empty list the first time you try to access the property
edit it is possible that the setter is being called on deserialization like you d expect

20690490
firefox	safari
if your browser don t support this function ie before version 9 or firefox before version 1.5 consider using the filter polyfill from mozilla
removing item ecma-262 edition 5 code aka oldstyle js removing item es2015 code important es2015 arrow function syntax is not supported in ie at all chrome before 45 version firefox before 22 version safari before 10 version

20693719
accelerometer	gyroscope
almost all or even all phone will have an accelerometer
but not all of them have a gyroscope

20698371
super	extends
it does not really matter whether the super class is abstract or not when extends it
what matters is the following if your super class is abstract and contains abstract methods and your sub class is not abstract then your sub class must provide implementations for the abstract methods

20698436
nsstring	nsobject
nsstring is a subclass of nsobject and all nsobject and its subclass should have pointer sign associated with them
while nsrange is a struct not in the inherited chain with nsobject hence no pointer sign is required however under some situations you can make pointers to nsrange too

20700613
persistent	transient
in some cases you may want to avoid persistent some of these private instances variables or attributes of an object transient allows you to do that
transient is used to specify which properties of an object will not be saved or serialised

20701988
icmp	udp	arp	udp
it has not to be a complete stack just tcp ip and possibly icmp and arp
udp is not needed

20701988
udp	tcp
udp is not needed
if using the de2-115 board is a personal option and it s not imposed you may want to look for a microcontroller with a ready made tcp ip stack and support for ethernet

20706768
firefox	safari
from an article in 2011 html5 accessibility chops aria landmark support nvda and jaws when using internet explorer 9 or firefox 3+
voiceover when using safari on ios 4+ orca linux screen reader using firefox 3+ supports landmarks not tested

20707914
super	extends
see the following example which will throw a classcastexception but compiles just fine the code compiles perfectly somemethod returns a class of type super
suba extends super so the method definition isn t violated subb extends super so it can cast an object of type super to subb yet when you execute this you ll try to cast an object of type suba to subb which isn t possible

20708835
jar	war
then tinker with your eclipse configuration to make sure the jar gets added
it looks like eclipse is not packaging the jar that contains pagediscoveryworkunit into the war

20714491
uiview	subviews
it should also be noted that uialertview and uiactionsheet are intended by apple to be used as is and should not be subclassed whereas you can subclass uiview all you want to get whatever look you desire
on iphone the only way to accomplish this outside of uialertview and uiactionsheet is by presenting a uiview as a subviews on the uiviewcontroller that will serve as the background view

20716035
dictionary	map
the efcontextprovider does not update every property of the modified entities but rather only those properties mentioned in the entityinfo.originalvaluesmap a dictionary of the property names and original values of just the properties that have changed
if you want to save a property that is only set on the server just add it to the original values map now breeze knows to save these properties as well and their new values will be returned to the client

20717852
implements	extends
so in your case if you just want to have checkboxes for your boolean fields i wouldn t implements an own tablefieldfactory
here s an example if you really need to have your own tablefieldfactory then vaadin recommends you could just implements the tablefieldfactory interface but we recommend that you extends the defaultfieldfactory according to your needs

20718710
gtk	cairo
gtk uses the graphics card obviously otherwise you would not be able to display anything
gtk uses cairo which will use fast paths for 2d rendering

20718710
gtk	cairo
gtk uses cairo which will use fast paths for 2d rendering
what cairo and thus gtk does not use is hardware acceleration for blending and compositing of surfaces

20718710
gtk	cairo
what cairo and thus gtk does not use is hardware acceleration for blending and compositing of surfaces
if you need hardware acceleration and you wish to use a portable api for that you can use opengl.integrating opengl with gtk is not entirely trivial though

20718710
gtk	clutter
if you need hardware acceleration and you wish to use a portable api for that you can use opengl.integrating opengl with gtk is not entirely trivial though
if all you re using are 2d surfaces you could use the clutter scene graph

20719909
implements	extends
in this case both overlap but this is merely a matter of convenience - the interface is what you need to implements and the abstract class is there to make implements the interface easier - there is no requirement whatsoever to use that base class to be able to offer the interface it s just there to make it less work to do so
you are in no way limited in extends the base class for your own ends not caring about the interface contract or in implements a custom class implements the same interface

20719931
margin	text-align
center s the div not the content....what i mean to say is that if your div is 60px wide and content is only 30px wide then the div will align to center but the content will still align to one-side of the div not in the center giving a view that div is not centered.....my suggestion is to use text-align property too with margin see this demo and notice the border to understand that the div is centerd....but content is not css
margin 0 auto

20721419
crossover	mutation
in this scheme crossover isn t used but mutation is effective enough to compare with original de algorithm
if you don t use crossover may be your algorithm just explore the problem search space and doesn t exploit it

20723097
rsa	dsa
to convert it you can likely do this please note that this will only work for unencrypted rsa private keys
if you have a dsa or ec or pkcs8 formatted key you ll need to change the command a bit but you did not provide enough detail for me to narrow it down for you

20725976
uiview	calayer
on ios uiview is a fairly shallow wrapper around a calayer so it generally makes sense to create subviews instead of directly making sublayers which is why you aren t so familiar with this usage
on os x a layer-backed nsview is a big and complicated wrapper around a calayer so it makes a lot more sense to make whole hierarchies of layers within a single view

20726041
bash	subshell	bash	zsh	zsh	subshell
portability mklement0 reports that the following works as is with bash dash and zsh but not ksh
modern bash if you are running bash v4 or better the pid of the subshell is available in

20726285
portrait	landscape
when changing from portrait to landscape
yo don t see the issue when orientation changes occur on phone devices. it makes me think that the video quality might not be of good enough quality to be played in landscape mode

20726875
updatepanel	scriptmanager
updatepanel control if you are performing something trivial where ultra-fast performance isn t a concern simply wrap your button and any other .net controls that you would like updated in an updatepanel control
you will also need to drop a scriptmanager control into your base layout near the top inside the element

20727192
realloc	fgetc
basically means which is just error checking the return value of realloc
the reason we make ch an int is because the function fgetc returns an int that is how we can have eof be returned yet eof isn t a legal char value

20730016
cvs	svn
while cvs could help not many developers will recommend using it for new projects
it has largely been replaced with subversion svn but even that is falling out of favour

20730485
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort in its standard implementations does not use additional memory except for the memory for recursive calls with good implementation that stack-memory is o logn so it should not be a great problem
you may also consider using heapsort being in-place o nlogn never quadratic if you do not mind your algorithm being unstable may exchange elements with the same value - note that quickosort is usually not-stable as well. heapsort may also need some stack-memory for recursive calls but usually not as much as quicksort does

20734179
operands	scalar
in order to do that perl needs to convert the 2nd operands array into a scalar type as well
the convention in perl for array to scalar conversion is not concatenation of all array s element but the number of elements so that you could also print something like 5 + array

20734350
oncreate	setcontentview
third please do not call setcontentview twice in oncreate
you do not need the second one setcontentview layout

20736329
viewdidload	viewwillappear
using viewdidload should be fine for common storyboard use because the storyboard does not reuse view controller
anyway for the completeness of my view controller usage scenario i tend to use this pattern start loading remote data asynchronously in viewwillappear stop loading remote data in viewwilldisappear this make sure that your data will be always updated to the current userid because the id might be changed after viewdidload in case of view controller reuse or accessing .view property before setting userid

20737676
firefox	safari
i also included the linq.js solution but it performs pretty bad in firefox for me
it works comparably in safari chrome an ie but not faster than mine except in ie

20739311
shadowing	named
you can use shadowing
if you explicitly declare the variable inside the function and not initialize it the function will use this variable instead of a variable of the same named from an outer scope

20740052
build.gradle	gradlew
this is how i resolved it step 1 modify build.gradle open the build.gradle in your module not the top-level build.gradle file change the following or something similar classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.7.+ to classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.6.+ save
step 2 restart android studio step 3 fix build.gradle android studio will nag you about gradlew version

20741194
factors	mean
now you need only check prime factors up to sqrt n
note that this does not mean that the largest prime factor is less than sqrt n but that if there is a prime factor greater than sqrt n there is only one such prime factor

20743691
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
css-only solution using flexbox demo i ve tested this solution and it works correctly in ie10 ie11 google-chrome 31 opera 18 and firefox 29 nightly
note firefox 27 does not support flexbox with more than one row column it does not support flex-wrap wrap

20753719
glfw	sdl
in this regard glfw is a subset of the functionality of sdl which attempts to do the same thing but with a larger focus allowing access to audio output and and game device inputs as well
whether or not you have to use a loading library such as glew with either sdl or glfw is mostly dictated by the platform you re trying to target and the opengl functionality you want to use

20753730
boost	stl
note that msvc 2013 has some issues with some of boost versions
these binaries are not guaranteed to work because your compiler or stl can be customized in various ways

20755336
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
under freebsd 5.2.1 and mac os x 10.3 setjmp and longjmp save and restore the signal mask
linux 2.4.22 and solaris 9 however do not do this

20757239
hmac	md5
this doesn t answer the actual question but note that with sha3 you don t really need hmac hash
unlike sha1 and sha2 and md5 sha3 is not vulnerable to length-extension attacks

ubuntu	linux
you can try all those packages through cygwin on windows but i have not tried that rather i switched to ubuntu 13.04 so that i can also explore linux environment...
one thing i like to mention here if your target is just to use the compiled c++ code of libvlc in your project through java then you can do this on windows os using libvlc.so file but if you need to change the libvlc code and recompile it then you will need to run compile.sh which requires linux or mac

20764861
mapr	cloudera
however other hadoop distributions include impala mapr s distribution includes cloudera impala and amazon announced support for impala on elastic mapreduce and they have both tested that it works with their distributions
i assume you re not using mapr either but my point is just that it is possible

20765679
division	addition
so you should convert to double or single first to get the expected result real-number division
in addition to what has been stated in other answers there is a more urgent reason in matlab many operations are not defined 1 or behave differently 2 on integer types not defined try for example this gamma correction uint16 100 2.2 you will get an error integers can only be raised to positive integral powers

20767977
implements	extends
when implements sub-classes of some abstract classes you are not restricted only to the methods and fields of your parent class
at 1 abstract methods are a way to suggest to a programmer that extends your code that there should be a method like this implemented in your code

20768487
mathml	mathjax
this will enable your epub + math to work on many more readers since mathml is not well supported either inside or outside the browsers
some epub readers have incorporated the mathjax javascript library into their implementations

20773023
bower	npm
bower is different in that sometimes it can make use of a cache
i think bower is a little smarter about handling packages than npm most times it will use a cached copy of a plugin so if you have jquery version x installed in one project and then use that same version in another then bower doesn t need to connect to the internet in order to resolve that dependency it will just pull from cache instead

20773483
backgrounding	multitasking
when the user returns to your app by pressing the back button or by selecting it from the task switcher your app is resumed.if the device needs to free up memory to make sure that the foreground app is responsive suspended apps are terminated and info about the state of the terminated apps are saved if you need to do multitasking then choose the appropriate backgrounding agent for you scenario
only one app runs at a time on windows phone but backgrounding agents provide a way for your app to perform tasks even while it s not running in the foreground

20775962
realloc	malloc
incorrect use of realloc if the realloc fails this code has overwritten the only reference to the previously allocated space with null so not only have you failed to allocate new space but you also cannot release the old space because you ve lost the pointer to it
for the fastidious the fact that the original malloc might have failed is not critical

20776649
dictionary	map
phoneme recognition requires a bit of a specialized set-up compared to word recognition and most engines don t support it directly a dictionary of monophonic words doesn t usually result in good accuracy
a big reason for that is that phoneme recognition is much less accurate than word recognition since word recognition is more constrained it filters out all phone combinations which don t map to real words which is most of them

20777414
ftp	telnet
nevertheless telnet is still sometimes used in debugging network services such as smtp irc http ftp or pop3 servers to issue commands to a server and examine the responses but of all these protocols only ftp really uses telnet data format
another difference of telnet from a raw tcp session is that telnet is not 8-bit clean by default

20782685
fgets	getchar
change this to fgets input 20 stdin
and to output rest of the characters try this can it not be a solution that i output all the character from input area by getchar

20783160
google-chrome	firefox
nb without the image-load check it didn t work well on google-chrome for me either.
it seems the text fades in correctly it s just the background-image that suddenly pops up because it s not cached and firefox started before it was loaded

20783956
coldfusion	railo
i just changed it to use that font and everything worked ok via coldfusion 10
it still didn t work in railo but i assume that s a railo problem not a pdf font problem

20788199
build.gradle	gradlew
and all your gradlew tasks in build.gradle as well
caution i m not an expert in gradlew

20793570
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
using runtimeexception is for most cases not a great idea
since these are unchecked-exception one does not need to catch them explicitly as part of the contract - this can lead to situations where a loose coding practice can bring the system service down because one did not plan for an exception that got thrown from within the runtimeexception block

20797984
ubuntu	linux
for example if you are on ubuntu linux 64-bit operating system download 64-bit oracle java binaries
important information 64-bit oracle java binaries do not work on 32-bit ubuntu linux operating systems you will receive multiple system error messages if you attempt to install 64-bit oracle java on 32-bit ubuntu linux

20798531
build.gradle	gradlew
see build.gradle example below
if you already mastered gradlew then maybe wizards is not needed at all

20801140
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
you can set like so you can even prefetch pre-resolve dns queries or prerender a web page a-la google instant google-chrome google-chrome also does the same things as firefox and ie in this regard
safari i have not been able to find solid proof of whether safari supports these things

20806767
division	subtract
since starttime and endtime are both integers you can use simple modulo and division to separate minutes and hours
the following expression will give you starttime in minutes you can do the same for endtime and subtract endtime from starttime to get an expression for the time difference in minutes finally convert it to hours note the division by 60.0 which is a float instead of 60 which is an integer so that the final result will be float and not integer

20807099
prepare	execute
though many prepare statements examples show this approach of basically directly inserting input data into a prepare statement which is what you are doing just with extra step of assigning data to new variable names i personally would never even begin the task of preparing a statement on the database if i did not previously validate all of the required input
for example your code will execute even if no post data was passed to the script

20807685
apache	nginx
eg # etc nginx sites-enabled site-name include var www site1 site.conf include var www site2 site.conf # etc basically my advice if you really need this functionality install apache and maybe just use nginx to server assets and proxy to apache
the whole .htaccess concept is not implemented in nginx which one of the reasons why nginx is faster because if we have a file inside var www site folder1 folder2 file.php for example the server needs to look for .htaccess inside folder2 and folder1 and site and each will override the one above it an overhead for each request

20808893
multiplying	modulo	division	modulo
multiplying a big number by 31 leads to integer overflow which cannot be reversed using division by 31
but hold on though arithmetic using int in java is equivalent to arithmetic modulo 2 32

20810361
arp	icmp
the arp table is not a distributed list of hosts that are online. it s a local-only list of hosts that we ve seen on this network. once you realize this you ll note that there s no way of removing entries when someone disconnects other than trying to connect to them
just have a continuous loop in the background connecting to each host and sending a single icmp packet kinda hard to pull off from java but android does come with a ping command-line tool

20810472
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
mongodb as at 2.4 is not able to efficiently use an index for case-insensitive regex standard indexes are case-sensitive and matching anywhere within each field will be a costly comparison for large strings
the clauses are executed independently so you will ideally want to have an index on each field to avoid a full collection scan and the case-insensitive comparison is still going to be a full index scan

20810521
google-chrome	firefox
because google-chrome is multi-process and actually implements security in depth the actual gl calls are issued in another process from your javascript so even if google-chrome did call gl.finish it would happen in another process and from the pov of javascript would not be accurate for timing in any way shape or form
firefox is apparently in the process of doing something similar for similar reasons

20811065
webclient	httpwebrequest
you have two options you can derive your own class from webclient override the getwebresponse method and read the cookies at that point or you can just use lower level classes like httpwebrequest directly
webclient is a high level abstraction that doesn t expose cookies to the consumer

20811630
quicksort	mergesort
more generally you could supply your own compare method via an explicit ordering in which case you might as well create the tuples in their final form and write the method to deal with that obviating that final map to put the data in its final form if there are a lot of entries and this code is critical to performance you should probably use sorting.quicksort to do a fast in-place sort on the array this is better for large datasets for two reasons the quicksort algorithm is faster than mergesort which is what sorted will get you when called on a sequence of objects via java.util.arrays.sort
note however that quicksort is not a stable sort

20813895
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am on a pc right now and left-clicking the youtube popup link works perfectly on safari but not in google-chrome firefox ie or opera
however i get this type of script error in inspector about 15-20 times when viewing the site in google-chrome

20816265
multiplying	multiplication
this may be because of a bad implementation of the karatsuba multiplication algorithm since preventing it from being used fixes the problem forcing it to use the standard way of multiplying bigints which is less efficient for such large inputs but does not have the bug
the problem was a bug in std.bigint which caused a crash when multiplying excessively large bigint values

20817495
html5lib	elementtree
the problem you ve run into applies to etree.fromstring as much as it does html5lib
the python documentation for xml.etree.elementtree doesn t mention the namespaces argument it seems to be an undocumented feature of elementtree objects but not element objects

20817589
multiplying	subtract
since subtract dates returns a difference in days you can simply multiplying by 24 to get the difference in hours edit an even better solution would probably be to save clock_in and clock_out as date fields to begin with and avoid the hassle of converting in the query but i m not sure this is possible for the op
you could just convert the data to date s using the to_date function and then subtract the two values

20819717
google-chrome	firefox
but you can block drag and drop by returning false from dragstart handler if the active element is an input maybe you also need to check for links or textareas there s also another issue onsliderchange calls event.preventdefault so when you release the mouse button the slider continues to move in google-chrome and reverts to the previous position in firefox
looks like a browser bug the slider doesn t even receive dragstart event in firefox

20819986
google-chrome	firefox
because it looks like the data is not modified on the client-side your options are using the application cache as mentioned in the comment serving the data with cache forever http headers like 10 years have unique urls for new resource versions and let the browser re-download the data when it goes out of the cache recommended deploy your html5 application as a web app downloads available from google-chrome store and firefox marketplace
localstorage is limited to 5 mb i think this was on google-chrome and you can request more space for every new 5 mb through dialog boxes

20826931
prng	random
the solution is to remember the previous value that the prng generated and start from that rather than time null
you must not repeatedly seed a prng while you generate a sequence of random values

20827276
jruby	mri
if you really wanted to you could also write a second application in jruby that your first application made remote calls to
no jruby is an alternate ruby interpreter so you cannot switch to it in the middle of running mri the standard ruby interpreter written in c

20827276
jruby	mri
no jruby is an alternate ruby interpreter so you cannot switch to it in the middle of running mri the standard ruby interpreter written in c
you can create threads in mri but many people use a background job queue to handle this type of problem

20830063
translation	localization
after i split translation into default.po my custom messages and core.po core cakephp messages it all started to work flawlessly as expected
cake book mentions this however it was not clear to me right from the start cakephp will look for your po files in the following location the default domain is default therefore your locale folder should look something like this sample valid for french localization app locale fra lc_messages core.po app locale fra lc_messages default.po i am posting this answer to hopefully help fellow programmers out there

20830164
realloc	malloc
then your code can go about looking like this since you are doing a malloc in adding and returning the pointer to the malloc ed space you do not need realloc
from the looks of it the problem seems to be with these blocks of code and you are telling malloc to allocate to students the amount of space equal to the size of struct mystruct but that s probably not what you want because it seems you want students to be an array of pointers to struct mystruct objects

20830300
firefox	safari
on my mac this does not work when pasting from firefox where for 웃 firefox s apple sd gothic neo is converted into applemyungjo on pasting but works well for safari and google-chrome
nowadays google-chrome and firefox have built-in tools for that but safari needs you to copy some text and investigate that

20830502
arp	icmp
therefore ping can in some cases be used to populate the arp table in order to check it for network presence even if icmp is being actively blocked
but if this is not accurate enough or feels too crude network presence can be mapped directly using the arp protocol and without involving protocols higher up in the stack which stand a higher risk of being blocked

20831337
fgets	fread
however some functions like fgets which are supposed to read lines from a file take the n at the end of the line as a terminator
the problem with your code is that fread ready binary data and doesn t try to interpret that data as a string which means it won t put the 0 at the end

20831337
fread	strcpy
the problem with your code is that fread ready binary data and doesn t try to interpret that data as a string which means it won t put the 0 at the end
but string functions like strcpy need this 0 byte to recognize the end of the string

20836097
3des	aes
128 bit 3des is not accepted by nist which handles us government standardization of cryptography anymore
you should try and switch to aes if possible

20836477
implements	extends
the solution is as follows implements basic versions of the to-be-tested classes so that the tests would compile and run without any submitted jars
this could more likely should be done by leveraging polymorphism but is not planned at the moment this means that the user should most likely extends the basic version of the class himself locally before sending the class to be tested

20838044
prepare	execute
just try from php documentation about pdo which should be valid also here for those wondering why adding quotes to around a placeholder is wrong and why you can t use placeholders for table or column names there is a common misconception about how the placeholders in prepare statements work they are not simply substituted in as escaped strings and the resulting sql execute
instead a dbms asked to prepare a statement comes up with a complete query plan for how it would execute that query including which tables and indexes it would use which will be the same regardless of how you fill in the placeholders

20838462
bufferedreader	ioexception
and as per your question for reading a text file you should use bufferedreader because scanner hides ioexception while bufferedreader throws it immediately
bufferedreader is synchronized and scanner is not

20840320
lisp	scheme
in other words the code you write should theoretically run on any common lisp implementation
clojure scheme etc are other dialects of lisp that have their own standards when applicable the word standards has various levels of strictness depending on your meaning and are not the same as common lisp

20840320
lisp	scheme
clojure scheme etc are other dialects of lisp that have their own standards when applicable the word standards has various levels of strictness depending on your meaning and are not the same as common lisp
that is to say they certainly do not adhere to the common lisp standard

20843011
strcpy	strncpy
but these days to prevent buffer overflows people seem to agree on not using strcpy at all
instead always use strncpy and explicitly state the length of the receiving string

20844251
google-chrome	firefox
browsers auto-sort json properties when they are strigify numbers for example this will have the same behavior in google-chrome and firexfox in case of your sample json google-chrome while firefox it is actually retaining the original state this occurs because the firefox sorting algorithm will work only when the first 3 characters are not exactly the same
for instance google-chrome firefox will retain the original order this is actually a known issue by firefox team

20844406
ubuntu	linux
you can probably find the correct header by using the following shell command if you system doesn t use usr include substitute the correct path. edit remove extra zero from ubuntu version.
i don t have a copy of fedora handy but under ubuntu 12.04 tcp_quickack is defined in netinet tcp.h and in linux tcp.h

20845722
info.plist	ipa
in short unzip app.ipa usr libexec plistbuddy -c set cfbundleidentifier newidentifier payload myapp.app info.plist zip -qr resignedapp.ipa payload if you need to resign your app follow the instructions on the aforementioned site
user478681 s answer did not work for me because of the missing step to unzip and zip the ipa file

20848152
uu-parsinglib	parsec
using your benchmark i get the following results uu-parsinglib ptest - 1.98s uu-parsinglib ptest - 1.11s parsec ptest - 0.59s parsec ptest - 0.67s
the behavior you re describing using plist_ng does apply to other parsers such as the simple list-of-successes method described in for example jeroen fokker s functional parsers combinators but not to uu-parsinglib

20848152
uu-parsinglib	parsec
at any point uu-parsinglib only needs to keep alternatives in memory that have not yet failed and the breadth-first strategy ensures that all alternatives are evaluated in lockstep so there is no need to hang on to the first a and b until the end of the string is reached and it does not match the whole string first before backtracking
edit from what i gather about parsec this is indeed less efficient because parsec does not consider pa until ptest finishes

20848152
uu-parsinglib	parsec
raw speed is not a primary goal and i once saw a presentation of some benchmarks where uu-parsinglib also did not come out on top but overall it performed reasonably well
or look for more comprehensive benchmarks first. there are clearly significant differences between the two libraries so i m not surprised to see that parsec is faster in some cases although the difference in this case is indeed pretty big

20848152
uu-parsinglib	parsec
maybe there is a way to tweak the uu-parsinglib version further without changing internals as hinted at by that section about greedy parsing in the paper but it s not obvious to me anyway
well one thing you could do is rewrite the grammar for parsec that would the following i think but this seems to make it slower this helps but not enough to beat the parsec version

20848618
glut	glfw
glut is not the only opengl windowing framework around
if you want to implement your own event loop have a look at glfw or sdl-2 or sfml

20849311
google-chrome	firefox
why this nearness to that number given for the ie browser for google-chrome s failure i do not know but it is interesting
conclusion there is no exact magic number but given the above experiments it does seem that there is some smaller character limit based on number of selectors to a selector size for google-chrome as opposed to firefox or ie10

20851810
cloudant	couchdb
cloudant will have cors support from january 2014
iris couch also supports cors just not via a ui - you have to modify the configuration via the couchdb api

20854847
persistent	transient
variables may be marked transient to indicate that they are not part of the persistent state of an object
here actionlistener instance is a suitable candidate for marking as transient

20857246
intersect	contains
in other words you can define class battleship that class would hold ship position size and another properties and it also can contains method to check if it intersect with some another ship
then you can create instances and add them to collection only if the instance doesn t intersect with any instance present in collection

20857438
punctuation	words
punctuation in the sentence could also ruin your day so depending on your requirements you might need to do more than just split
using the pairwise recipe from itertools your question doesn t consider the possibility that a words appears in the sentence more than once

20858473
implements	extends
when you use the override keyword you re essentially saying for this class call this method instead of the base method. this obviously doesn t apply when there is no such base method when you are directly implements an interface
the override modifiers is defined thus the override modifiers is required to extends or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method property indexer or event

20859422
kerberos	ntlm
if credentials need to be delegated from the web server to another server like a sql server i ve found that you may run into problems for client using ntlm basic or negotiate kerberos often delegates easier
i ve been told if my servers were configured for constrained delegation ntlm would work but that s not been my experience

20859557
super	self	super	extends	super	implements
you get the warning about the super constructor as you still extends from object instead of event and object don t have a constructor with two arguments
you may want to extends from your event class instead of implements it implements mean that your class implements the interface of the class but not inherits its members you need to implements them by your self

20860192
concave	convex
this may not be relevant but your defined shape is concave
the docs say it must be convex

20862012
ftp	telnet
ftp operates on port 21 by default not on port 23
you have to tell telnet which port to connect to eg o ftp.myftp.com 21 when sending a pasv command the response code on success is always 227 but the actual text verbage that specifies the server s listening ip port is unfortunately not standardized and thus differs between different ftp server vendors

20863946
comparator	comparable
it seem like your resort method doesn t declare a comparator method
this method typically belongs to the comparable interface

20865977
sse	avx
at one time intel indeed recommended spilling from general purpose to sse registers in their optimization manual
that s not avx exactly but it is the same idea. i haven t looked at the very latest manuals so that advice may or may not be out of date

20868510
spaces	delimiter
strings in sscanf are really words and may not contain white spaces
the underscore however would be part of a string so in order not to eat up the underscore of the first delimiter you have to use the notation which means any sequence of chars that do not contain the given chars

20868825
qthread	qobject
if you just want to always get the last signal processed and don t mind if few extra signals get processed as long as it does not make things slow then you could try a very simple approach like this using the regular qthread exec event loop
put these slot methods into a qobject subclass which you then move to a thread the publicreceiverslotforqueuedsignals goes through very fast qdebug in else is probably the most time consuming part for rapid calls so it doesn t really matter how many signals are queued

20870215
g++	gcc
if g++ does not implement it probably means that 80-bit computations are randomly rounded to the precision of the type when the compiler happened to have to spill some floating-point registers to memory leading the program below to print foo in some circumstances outside the programmer s control because the code in the ellipsis caused x that was held in an 80-bit floating-point register to be spilt to a 64-bit slot on the stack
the c99 standard defines flt_eval_method a compiler-set macro that defines how excess precision should happen in a c program many c compilers still behave in a way that does not exactly conform to the most reasonable interpretation of the value of fp_eval_method that they define older gcc versions generating 387 code clang when generating 387 code

20876889
rspec	capybara
alex lynham s answer describes a rails rspec controller test not a capybara integration test and if you want something lower level that does not exercise the entire stack a controller test like the one suggested in that answer is a good way to go
capybara is intended to be used for full-stack integration tests so the recommended approach would be to avoid hardcoding urls and instead drive capybara to navigate through your app as a user would

20879182
realloc	malloc
7.22.3.5 from the c standard if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

20879428
ssl	https
but you could use something like stunnel to tunnel a normal tcp connection inside ssl if your local pg_client library is not ssl-aware you could create an stunnel on localhost which then forwards the data via ssl to the remote postgresql server
postgresql does neither use http nor https for its connection but has its own protocol

20879612
hmac	md5
first in python you can simply use the hmac module second your c# code does not implement the hmac algorithm but simply returns a md5 hash
the python equivalent would be simply you can find an implemention of the hmac algorithm in c# at codeplex

20881036
client-side	server-side
ajax the reason you need ajax is because js is client-side only runs in the browser and rails is server-side works with the database
rails cannot be used directly with javascript because it only comes to life when you send an http request which is why you d need ajax as mentioned in the comments if you wanted to do a calculation on the client-side you d be able to use js entirely

20885276
implements	extends
this is because signinview has not implements all of the members of abstractview
the same situation as your question here dart inheritance and super constructor you are not extends abstractview but implementing it

20885276
super	implements	implements	extends
the same situation as your question here dart inheritance and super constructor you are not extends abstractview but implements it
this means that you must implements a getter setter for an abstractpresenter presenter

20886501
ssl	https
the only reason i find for not using ssl https is performance if you want to have responses within say 300ms
the ssl hanshake could take a few rount-trip-time s that could add from very few ms in the same region say client and server both in us east up to 600 ms or more sometimes

20888998
mdpi	hdpi
for example if the value of window.devicepixelratio is 1.0 then the device is considered a medium density mdpi device and default scaling is not applied to the web page
if the value is 1.5 then the device is considered a high density device hdpi and the page content is scaled 1.5x

20891067
client-side	server-side
if not there are plenty of free and commercial programs available for this and they will be your best method for this task rather than writing a video encoding script in flash yourself which i assure you won t be easy if your files are hosted on the web a client-side language javascript will be of no use to you
you will need a server-side language php for instance to collect all of the file locations and display them for the client

20892309
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
also from the sound of it you re using a uitabbarcontroller inside of a uinavigationcontroller
apple says that you re not supposed to place a uitabbarcontroller inside another view controller

20894005
innodb	myisam
it turns out the table i was testing was using myisam and not innodb as the storage engine
myisam does not support transactions

20894158
prng	random
any prng such as the mersenne twister hence the mt in the function name is not truly random
but it is random enough for most purposes

20894905
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
you are not setting your contentview and the activity crashes with a null pointer exception in the oncreate method you must set a contentview before being able to try to findviewbyid something like this setcontentview r.layout.activity_layout
now that you have an actual view in your activity you can go for notice that the crash do not happen when trying to find the view it happens when you tried to set the adapter because the reference returned in findviewbyid is null

20895196
accelerometer	gyroscope
an accelerometer simply records the total acceleration acting on the device which is the sum of all accelerations
it is not trivial to isolate the gravity vector but the methods i have seen mainly involve using the gyroscope as the magnetometer is simply too inaccurate and contains too much latency

20897053
ssl	https
https https provide transport level security along with message level security. normally it creates a secure session between client and server and transfer request and response message through it in an encrypted format. https uses ssl secure socket layer certificates to provide security between client and server communication. in simple language using certificates means your client knows on which server it s sending data and server knows from which client data is being received
so that it cannot be tampered in between by any third person. https always required client side authentication at least

20897053
ssl	https
only client needs to know where it s sending data by exporting server certificate or by using self-signed certificate if server certificate is not available. it ensures only transport level security https with client authentication in this approach you need to exchange ssl certificates between client and server
without authentication between both communication is not possible and you will get certification or ssl error at sender application. these certificates are generated and provided by some authentic vendors

20900110
portrait	landscape
edit this is sample splash image in portrait dimension but designed in landscape view all the best
if at all you still want to view the splash screen in landscape mode you have to design the image in such a way as we cannot change the behavior of the splash screen

20900324
octal	decimal
if you have an arbitrary bitmask you can easily tell with one glance which bits are set if you use either hex or octal which is not so easy with decimal numbers
the octal value 0377 represents 255 in decimal which would be the range of a single byte

20900880
serializable	deserialization
as the serializable object does not contain the class definition so there is no way to extract the object out of the stream without having the .class file
deserialization will require the .class file to create the object from the serializable stream

20903209
decimal	ieee
decimal arithmetic is not an automatic solution to the problem of performing accurate calculations
in 1985 ieee published the floating-point standard ieee 754 and this was very successful

20908981
uiview	subviews
when i go to debug into the delegate method of uisearchdisplaycontroller at the end search state the searchbar becomes a subviews of an uiview not the uitableview
please see below code my solution is remove the searchbar away from current super view then add it as subviews again to the tableview

20909463
vbo	vao
vaos store vertex array pointers which may be directly or indirectly see gl_arb_vertex_attrib_binding bound to a vbo but the vao does not care at all about what vbo is currently bound to gl_array_buffer
it is different for the element array buffer as i mentioned vaos do track the currently bound element array buffer so that a call to gldrawelements ... will have consistent behavior merely by binding a vao

20910201
inline	constexpr
i am not sure whether gcc will correctly see argument to inline function as constant but i fear you d have to use it from a macro might be of use
note that i am testing both s and for constexpr because pointer to static buffer is a compile time constant while it s length is not

20910208
bash	subshell
when you use a pipeline in bash all the commands within the pipeline are executed in subshell
that means variables cannot survive when the subshell exits

20911191
jar	war
based on the stacktrace an intuit class com.intuit.ipp.aggcat.util.saml2assertiongenerator needs a saml jar on the classpath
a saml class org.opensaml.xml.xmlconfigurator needs on it s turn log4j which is inside the war but cannot find it

20914599
serializable	deserialization
it will be generated dynamically during serializable process
in deserialization you do not need it because jackson cares about types

20915214
client-side	server-side
you re trying to combine server-side code with client-side code in a very strange way
sometimes it s necessary to do that use server-side vbscript to write client-side javascript but if i m understanding your intent correctly it s not needed here

20915362
google-chrome	firefox
to make matters worse google-chrome s network tab did not relay the 404 response just the access-control-allow-origin error
it wasn t until i inspected the server response firefox that i was able to determine and resolve the issue

20918408
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
first off apple hls is not supported by the major desktop browsers namely google-chrome firefox and ie i dont know about opera but i doubt it
safari on osx supports it safari on windows does not chromium and firefox teams both have open tickets on implementing support for hls through the html5 video tag but i don t think this is going to happen soonish firefox has this ticket open since 3 years now

20920139
noexcept	throw
unlike throw noexcept will not call std unexpected and may or may not unwind the stack which potentially allows the compiler to implement noexcept without the runtime overhead of throw
the throw exception specification is deprecated in c++11 and replaced by noexcept

20922577
strdup	malloc
strdup is such an example
if you don t use malloc for obtaining a pointer you should not free it as this will cause undefined behaviour. in order to not create memory leaks you should free what you malloc ed

20924223
implements	extends
i am not sure why you are reluctant to extends those classes but if you do it you get all of the rest of your specification possible to fulfil you can implements your own paintcomponent method in the extends classes you can have both extension of jpanel and extension of jframe in one class
jpanel and jframe are both java classes and not interfaces so you basically can t implements your own methods inside them according to the solid rules open closed principle they are open for extension but closed for modification

20924223
implements	extends
jpanel and jframe are both java classes and not interfaces so you basically can t implements your own methods inside them according to the solid rules open closed principle they are open for extension but closed for modification
to implements your own paintcomponent you must extends your jpanel and this is how it is usually done

20925995
subtraction	addition
this propagates two carry bits internally e and f and produces two external carry bits ce and cf unfortunately it doesn t state anything about subtraction but i assume when you can encode negative numbers you can use addition for that
in this document under #6 there is an algorithm for serial gray code addition copied directly

20926231
build.gradle	gradlew
then check for the dependencies in build.gradle of your myapplication module for support library
if not added add the mentioned dependency. after adding the line sync project with gradlew files using the option available in toolbar

20930001
super	extends
you need to write the type like this my issue is that i need to call the super constructor of node since node isn t a class it doesn t have a super constructor
the problem is that node name is just a method call and so can t be in extends

20930273
implements	extends
for me composition is heirarchy of composer classes which do not implements the interface
such as which is then composed by an abstract class abstract classes never extends other abstract classes they only use internal composers and actually implements the interface

20931112
udp	tcp
thats why udp is used for video streaming
real time application for tcp email reason suppose if some packet words statement is missing we cannot understand the content.it should be reliable

20934513
tabcontrol	tabitem
note each tab in the tabcontrol is actually a model object not a tabitem control
there are datatemplates defined to allow the tabcontrol to correctly insert the required usercontrol for each model in the content of the tabitem

20936188
des	aes
as single des as it is known uses only 8 byte keys 64 bit 56 effective bit size with parity bits
aes keys should be either 128 192 and 256 bit and should not include parity bits

20937525
freebsd	linux
major linux distributions do not provide llvm libc++ because unlike apple and freebsd the gpl+3 is not an issue so no need to implement another stack here
linux components have been developed around gnu libstd++ for ages

20938281
jsdom	cheerio
you could use jsdom with a full-featured jquery
this allows you to use more complex selectors that cheerio doesn t support including selectors like first

20938614
realloc	malloc
further because str is now a pointer to a hard-coded static string you cannot realloc it
it was never malloc d to begin with

20939130
vbscript	vba
note reference to ms vbscript regular expressions x.x is needed
simple regular expression tutorial for excel vba 2 using userproperites of mailitem object recommended if mailitem doesn t contains your propert y ies than there is nothing to do

20941637
interpolation	splines
the interpolation positions and velocities depend linearly on the originals so the result is the same either way and doesn t depend on how you choose your coordinate axes
since you know both the position and the velocity of the object at each time point the natural choice would be to use cubic splines interpolation

20941786
client-side	server-side
in my opinion a server-side only solution is better for this particular requirement because it s easy to do it keeps the client-side stuff simple and obviously will work even in browsers where the end user has disabled javascript not that many users do that but it does happen
as requested my original comments formed up into an answer. although this can be handled client-side with js i m not familiar with express.js or jade so i don t know how to integrate a js solution with your existing code

20941786
client-side	server-side
as requested my original comments formed up into an answer. although this can be handled client-side with js i m not familiar with express.js or jade so i don t know how to integrate a js solution with your existing code
however if both buttons are submit buttons you can test server-side which one was pressed and redirect as appropriate thus avoiding the need for any client-side js

20941945
namenode	hdfs
if you re sure the operation was not successful although it seems succeed you could check out the log files of namenode to see what s wrong
first of all hdfs copy with wildcards is supported

20942527
aggregate-functions	sum
the solution is to do one of the following remove the wildcard from your select add the field reviews.id to your group clause select reviews.id explicitly and apply an aggregate-functions to it sum reviews.id replace the wildcard with the table-specific wildcard the second and third option do not make much sense in your scenario though. based on your comment i added option four
you are not allowed to select reviews.id selected implicitly through the wildcard without adding it to the group by clause or applying an aggregate-functions like avg

20943029
setcontentview	findviewbyid
please move the setcontentview to the first line otherwise findviewbyid is not able to find anything and thats why you get the nullpointer
you are doing before you do setcontentview r.layout.activity_recipients

20950754
prepare	execute
what kombajn zbożowy suggested is the best way to track plsql execution at runtime - if you prepare for that and set up the calls in your script
if you got stuck with code that s not using dbms_application_info has several helpful columns will give you the current running sql statement - even when execute in a plsql block

20952994
serializable	deserialization
the format used by binaryformatter is fairly specific to .net and relies on .net type information which is not available for easy serializable in unrealscript
however json parsing is available in the udk i believe although you will probably have to do most of the actual deserialization manually

20954342
google-chrome	firefox
however without an explicit setting the firefox browser has the utf-8 clause and the google-chrome browser does not
when i explictly set a contenttype using utf-8 in the .ajax call i see the same behavior for both browsers the firefox behavior from before

20956892
octal	decimal
any integer literal beginning 0 is an octal integer literal
to stick to decimal literals do not use leading zeroes

20960779
client-side	server-side
in particular the oft-mentioned 2 500 requests per ip per day limit applies only to server-side geocoding not client-side
so the short answer is there is no documented query limit specifically for client-side geocoding

20960880
express	node.js
you don t have to use node.js with express or mongodb
they are three distinct technologies and just because you use node.js doesn t mean you have to use mongodb or express

20967944
stringbuilder	stringtokenizer
stringbuilder is not immutable and string s can be appended to it without the overhead of creating new objects every time
stringtokenizer worth noting -as rgraham said in the comments- that this class is deprecated

20968675
implements	extends
furthermore once this bound has been established there is no need to specify it again in the implements clause
a is a generic interface remember it s an interface i.e not a class b extends means inheritance from a class or an interface

20971077
equals	compareto
returns an int 0 if this date is less than the specified date 0 if they are equals and an int 0 if this date is greater
if user select future date then update datepicker to current date today you can use following code to check selected is future date or not you can also use compareto method datepickerdate.compareto new date

20972591
decoder	encoder
there is not basically a validity check for this data other than feeding data to a decoder and testing against availability of output and decoding errors
-858993460 are also known as 0xсссссссс and indicate that values were not initialized by the encoder

20973062
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you only show a uinavigationcontroller on some special not directly connected scenes you can use the same but you shouldn t
for example if you have a main menu an options screen and a address book screen as single scenes you should create a navigationcontroller for every scene - when needed - and destroy it when going back to the main menu. it can however be more efficient to reuse the same navigationcontroller if you need one in every scene of some connected scenes best example i know of is that there is a navigationcontroller in an uitabbarcontroller

20978006
uiview	subviews
now you have two subviews in this newly created uiview and they would be separate views that you can interact with without it affecting the other what you were doing before was adding the uibutton to the uipvc which is not what you want as explained in the opening paragraph
instead of adding the uibutton to the uipageviewcontroller which as you stated would move along with page swipes do this create a uiview add the uipvc to the newly created view as a subviews also add the uibutton to that newly created view as a subviews too

20980841
uicollectionview	uitableview
every uicollectionview has a layout object a uicollectionviewlayout subclass that describes where each cell should go in the collection view s scroll view and which cells are visible in a given cgrect
uitableview doesn t have this so it would be much harder to do anything that manipulates the position of its cells

20986377
super	extends
you would be fine if you remove the super call altogether
your class extends only the object class and it doesn t have a method or constructor called openfile

20986385
super	extends
you could store a reader as a field in your buffin class or you might extends a super class that accepts one in the constructor
at the moment your class buffin does not specify a super class

20986598
udp	tcp
so you have to check the capabilities of your proxifier tool to see if it supports udp or not
any kind of proxy whether it is for tcp or udp needs to be told where to forward outgoing packets to

20986598
udp	tcp
socks v4 does not support udp or ipv6 but socks v5 does
however it requires the requesting app to establish a tcp connection to the socks proxy and ask it to forward udp packets on the app s behalf until that tcp connection is closed

20986598
udp	tcp
every outbound udp packet would have to be intercepted then the proxifier would have to check if it already has its own socks v5 tcp connection associated with the packet s local remote tuple and if not then create a new one and send the necessary udp forwarding handshake then encapsulate every outbound udp packet for that tuple and send it to the proxy s outbound ip port and receive every matching inbound udp packet for that tuple from the proxy so it can be de-encapsulated and forwarded to the app s local ip port that sent out the original outbound udp packet
and because udp is connection-less the proxifier would have to also implement a timeout mechanism on its socks v5 tcp connection to the proxy so it can eventually be closed after a period of udp traffic being idle

20990906
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
yes because both are runtimeexception s and must not be caught
read the java tutorial about exceptions and unchecked-exception

20993362
vmware	virtualbox
just make sure that when you add the vmdk into vmware don t click upgrade format when prompted keep the current one in case virtualbox doesn t accept it
you can use vmware player to resize a vmdk

21001501
tabcontrol	tabitem
as zarat mentioned the default style for tabitem in windows 8 has triggers that fire after the remove and then look for the now missing tabcontrol
i found as a workaround that it is possible to remove the template of the tabitem that looks ok in my scenario because i will not use the tabitem any more

21003068
client-side	server-side
to do so capture the pdoexception log the error details send json data informing that there was an error tweak your client-side code to handle any kind of error in the ajax response including proper json with status error and lack of proper json
as this is an ajax request it dumps into the console browser of course php like other server-side languages is executed in another computer and does not have access to your browser s console

21003284
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is not a supported browser for ssrs report builder
only ie firefox and safari are officially supported

21003845
awt	swing
they were designed for the old awt graphical library and not really suited to swing
the keyevent variable is defined as e note use key bindings instead for handing key interaction in swing

21004677
kerberos	ldap
ldap over ssl is apparently the best way to go and was the method that we had been using and it appears clarifications welcome that once our self-signed ssl certificate had expired it skipped kerberos and fell back to netusersetinfo which failed because it was not using the credentials we provided
or it just failed on kerberos as the poster said he had never seen the credentials passed in for kerberos so after creating a new self-signed certificate for computer.domain.local the problem was resolved

21005101
lxml	libxml2
assuming you already have pip installed just do this sudo pip install lxml
looking at the libxml2-python package it s pretty clearly the stock python bindings for libxml2 not the third-party lxml bindings

21006613
jar	war
module with packaging type pom cant generate artifacts like jar war or ear
maven by example - the simple parent project the parent project doesn t create a jar or a war like our previous projects

21006706
freebsd	linux
it s not going to work for loading linux shared libraries from freebsd executables
longer version your problem is that when you load application from a freebsd binary it s freebsd s dynamic linker that does the job and it will attempt to resolve the symbols using freebsd s libraries which it not what you want to happen

21006706
freebsd	linux
longer version your problem is that when you load application from a freebsd binary it s freebsd s dynamic linker that does the job and it will attempt to resolve the symbols using freebsd s libraries which it not what you want to happen
for comparison when you launch linux binaries on freebsd kernel figures out that it s a linux binary brandelf helps here and then does two things -- replacess process syscall table with the one that will handle linux syscalls and redirects filesystem root to compat linux

21008013
division	exponent
you can also use from __future__ import division at the top of your script to switch to proper true division for the operator where it always returns a float result
next you are not using proper exponent in your formula

21009217
ng-view	ng-app
the scope of the app is defined in the ng-app element and not it s siblings another option would be to put the ng-view div inside the ng-app div if so desired
looks like you just need to move the ng-app tag up to the body element

21009348
gruntjs	package.json
you can do this by making sure gruntjs is part of your package.json and run npm install going to your project folder and just npm install gruntjs after this you shouldn t have any trouble running gruntjs
first you should have the grunt-cli package installed globally npm install -g grunt-cli next make sure you have gruntjs installed in your project folder

21009442
pandas	pytables
pytable solution since functionality provided by pandas is not needed and the processing is much slower see notebook below the best approach is using pytables or h5py directly
i ve tried only the pytables approach so far

21009585
move	drag
something like this not sure of the constraints you want like just lvs and only move
lv drag over tlp drag over tlp dragdrop something along those lines

21011034
cpython	pypy
in cpython the garbage collection is based on reference counting and will work pretty promptly for this case
for other versions of python such as jython or pypy the garbage collection is much less predictable. i m not a numpy expert but my understanding is that views including slices of array instances should take up very little memory

21011706
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
type of self.window.rootviewcontroller is uiviewcontroller not uinavigationcontroller
and uinavigationcontroller inherits uiviewcontroller

21012594
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you do not have setcontentview r.layout.mylayout also if you inflate a layout you need to set it to the activity
flcontainer is not initialized will give you nullpointerexception coz findviewbyid will look for a view in the current inflated layout

21013922
flask	django
you can use any server based web frameworks like flask pyramid or even node.js for this
it seems you have tagged this post as django but have not used django yet

21015029
lodash	underscore.js
what you need is a way to force the underscore.js lodash _.defer to call its callback promises so your promise in the factory gets resolved immediately
if you were using you could call in the test but as far as i know underscore.js lodash doesn t have anything like this

21016034
equals	compareto
so you need to change your equals method to compare the amount of money or just use the name in your compareto method
if you read the doc note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface

21016808
serializable	deserialization
if you do not explicitly declare a serialversionuid jvm will do it for you automatically based on various aspects of your serializable class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details and may vary from different jvm implementation and result in an unexpected invalidclassexceptions during the deserialization process

21017461
viewdidload	viewwillappear
as i said in the original post i first wrote it in viewdidload and moved it over to viewwillappear after i read kkocabiyik s answer
i m not sure then why my original code wasn t working - maybe because i slightly modified my code during me getting lots of helps from mani and rashad but kept the above code within viewwillappear at the same time

21017461
viewdidload	viewwillappear
for those who would be caught in the same trap and come to this question in the future i ve been able to fix the issue from this settings write within viewdidload connect uiscrollview from storyboard to myscrollview as iboutlet property not using autolayout set x 0 y 0 width 320 height 568 to scrollview from within storyboard and also note that using autolayout doesn t work
also using autolayout and setting contentsize within viewwillappear doesn t work either

21018643
actionscript	mxml
edit the question was about actionscript and not mxml but i leave this answer just for reference
i was able to use an icon in my button with the following code the file play.png is in the same folder of the mxml file

21019604
shadowing	named
the idea with new scopes that inherits from others is if parent has a primitive like named the child will inherit it but if you do something like you are not modifying the parent named you are shadowing it aka creating a new named that will hide the parent named
this means that the parent will never know if the child modified the named

21021188
mayavi	matplotlib
you might wanna use real 3d plotting libraries like mayavi if you need more features
matplotlib does not support such features since it is essentially a 2d plotting library

21023417
mp3	wav
that way you have more control over preloading and caching the sound files and treating streaming audio mp3 differently from short-lived sound effects usually caf or wav
for very short sound files say shorter than 5 seconds mp3 isn t ideal

21023417
mp3	wav
for very short sound files say shorter than 5 seconds mp3 isn t ideal
you should try caf wav instead

21024787
equals	compareto
do not compare string s with use equalsignorecase instead or just equals if the casing matters second
consider giving your event a compareto and while you are at it an equals and a hashcode

21027191
udp	tcp
firstly udp is a connectionless unreliable protocol you won t find anything like handshake for negotiating connection i.e no session management
but to transport rtp packets it s not a good idea to use tcp it lacks realtime feature so you have to stick with udp

21028409
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
i want to make a menu item that sends me to another gui when i press it but i don t know how. i m not sure how the drag and drop works with gui builder for jpopupmenu
i tried to to drap and drop it but it won t show the display so i couldn t just drag and drop jmenuitem to it

21028915
uialertview	uiwindow
and it s above uialertview in uiwindow layer
make sure you don t add anything on uiwindow as it is not a good practice

21029033
serializable	deserialization
networkx has several serializable method
in your case i would choose graphml serializable it s quite simple to use import networkx as nx nx.write_graphml path to file to load it in neo4j provided you have neo4j 2.0 you could use tinkerpop gremlin to load your graphml dump in neo4j g.loadgraphml path to file the tinkerpop are quite useful - not only for serializable deserialization

21030089
onclick	onchange
an answer with js only not jquery onclick event in option tag is just recognized by firefox
if you need a solution that works on all browsers such as ie or chrome you can use onchange event on your select element

21031834
super	extends
general reference 1 - override oncreateoption and inflate the menu note doesn t matter if you return true or call super 2 - add the namespace to the menu.xml file
3 - set the showasaction to always or ifroom 4 - if you are using appcompat make sure that you activity extends actionbaractivity you don t have to change any value of the actionbar to be able to see you menuoption in the bar

21031892
rspec	capybara
i think this is not a capybara question so much as it is an rspec question
i ve used cucumber more than rspec but so far as i know in my limited experience each describe is an independent test case

21033125
haskell	ocaml
fusion is not as easy to implement in ocaml as it is in haskell due to side-effects
if you were to go ahead and fuse functions in ocaml in the same way that ghc fuses them then you would get very unpredictable results and side-effects happening in a different order than how you wrote the program

21034962
comparator	comparable
emphasis mine so you don t need to override equals it will not cause a problem within the standard sort methods since they use only comparator nor does it violate the contract of comparable but it certainly wouldn t hurt
from comparable the natural ordering for a class c is said to be consistent with equals if and only if has the same boolean value as e1.equals e2 for every e1 and e2 of class c

21036316
octal	decimal
the decimal number 18 can therefore also be represented as 022 in octal and 0x12 in hexadecimal
we don t put a special symbol on the front of decimal numbers so any number that doesn t start with 0 or 0x is assumed to be decimal

21036412
trie	tree
let s try a definition of what a trie is a trie is an efficient data structure used to implement a dictionary in which keys are sequences lexicographically
the implementation uses an n-ary tree where the branching factor is the range of valid values for each element in the key sequence 1 and each node may or not hold a value but always holds a subsequence of the key being stored 2

21039531
xslt	xquery
you could call a single-document query repeatedly from ant xproc or xmlsh or of course from java or you could write the code in xslt instead
the capability to produce multiple output files from a single query is not present in the xquery language only in xslt and the capability to process a batch of input files is not present in saxon s xquery command line only in the xslt command line

21043311
trie	tree
a trie is usually used to represent a collection of sequences such as strings
a particular key is stored not in a single node like in a binary search tree but rather split up across many levels of the tree

21044335
email	dkim
i would wait a while and check if email gets there
i would also check the mail queue and see what the status of the email is make sure that you have the appropriate dns records _ dkim _ spf _ dmarc make sure that reverse dns is setup and that the ip is not in a blocked pool also make sure you are not on any block list

21046533
memcpy	strdup
after you allocate the memory remembering to add more to argc if you want to add extra parameters you should just be able to memcpy
your new_argv will point to the same strings as your original argv so you will need to strdup before you change it or not if you want to set it to some other string

21046939
strcpy	memmove
your code is not valid you cannot use strcpy when source and destination buffers overlap
you must use memmove for cases like those

21055594
textview	imageview
in your case the line has to stretch the rest of the screen length and as such it is not something that can be done with a textview with compound drawable
this kind of lint warning is more of a suggestion rather than something that must be done and is detected by just checking for a linear layout with only a textview and an imageview rather than checking what would need to go in the image view

21060966
bash	tcsh
for instance to see all commits on all branches plus commits on not actually tested but simple and should work assuming sh or bash shells
for csh or tcsh put everything on one line or use backslash before newlines

21062539
splinter	selenium
however a seemingly undocumented feature is that you re able to access the underlying selenium webdriver instance of a splinter webdriver instance through its .driver property this allows us to use any selenium features that don t have wrappers in the splinter api like resizing the browser with the set_window_size method
just do this browser.driver.set_window_size 640 480 the splinter api doesn t seem to directly support this - or at least not yet

21062874
icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
you must use socket_create since ping uses icmp and fsockopen is only for tcp and udp
icmp echo packets do not specify any port

21064588
textmate	sublimetext
in case of further .tmlanguage -related emergencies take note of the textmate manual s language grammars section
their examples are in json a format infinitely more readable than plist but not a thing that sublimetext can properly utilize

21065122
awt	swing
panel and component is awt jpanel and jcomponent is swing
awt does not use paintcomponent but paint

21065122
awt	swing
awt does not use paintcomponent but paint
switch the awt classes to the swing ones or paintcomponent to paint and it might work

21068249
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
accoring to iso c if ptr is a null pointer realloc shall be equivalent to malloc for the specified size
if ptr does not match a pointer returned earlier by calloc malloc or realloc or if the space has previously been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined

21068549
build.gradle	gradlew
updated make sure your project structure should look like this your library can be inside some directory like libraries androidbootstraplibrary no problem in that case only you have to change path in settings.gradle and build.gradle ----your_project ---androidbootstraplibrary --res --src -- ..... -- build.gradle must contain apply plugin android-library if not that menas not library project you have added something wrong ---your_module --res --src --build.gradle no a ----settings.gradle build.gradle no
a file settings.gradle include your_module include androidbootstraplibrary do sync project with gradlew after all you forgot to add namespace for the custom view in library

xdebug	xhprof
php process runs out of memory php process throws the error to report that memory has run out while preparing the error report the process hits some other memory limit apache system etc i would check your apache and system error logs first and then profile the process with xhprof it doesn t slow down your script nearly as much as xdebug so you ll get the added benefit of knowing approximately how long your process ran for
xhprof or xdebug might help you understand what s happening to your script

prepare	execute
no need for separate prepare statements and tedious maintenance of query handles in code
ado.net works like this but it seems like java still uses prepare execute by handle not sure

21070412
super	self
i m not up on the specifics of django involved here but this method def _onsuccess self controller # shortened to demonstrate even simple call to super # causes a different behaviour super confirmcontrollerex self ._onsuccess controller is not equivalent to the _onsuccess of the parent class
it calls the parent implementation through super but it ignores whatever that call returns and just returns none implicitly by execution reaching the end of the method definition

octal	decimal
this non-normative annex presents uniform syntax and semantics for octal literals and octal escape sequences for compatibility with some older ecmascript programs
and it s explicitly disallowed in strict mode b.1.1 numeric literals the syntax and semantics of 7.8.3 can be extended as follows except that this extension is not allowed for strict mode code given that 379 is not an octal escape sequence since the negative lookahead of decimal digit bars both 3 and 37 from being treated as octal escape sequences

21072949
build.gradle	gradlew
you can simply copy the andengine module inside your project directory and then configure your build.gradle and settings.gradle to include it in to dependencies like ----your_project ---andengine --res --src -- ..... -- build.gradle ---your_module --res --src --build.gradle no a ----settings.gradle build.gradle no
a file settings.gradle include your_module include andengine as observed andengine is not moved to gradlew yet in that case download create jar using ant or eclipse

21073089
build.gradle	gradlew
as of now make sure all your build.gradle files in the project using gradlew 1.9 as dependency update gradlew 1.10 is now supported in android studio after release 0.4.3 so going forward you can start using 1.10 plugin by using 0.8.+ in your classpath like this classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.8.+
gradlew 1.10 is not yet supported in as android tools developer team is working on it and probably will be available in next release

super	implements
polling bus-locked variables as a cheap and easy replacement for proper synchronization objects what the super cool mr wait-free might call brewing your own homemade spinlocks in 3 easy steps you will only manage to turn whatever cutting edge hardware your code runs on into a circa 1995 pentium i emulator
marketting and cool factor aside it does not make a twopenny toss of a difference whether the magic c++ syntactic brown sugar ends up implements a direct bus lock or a mutex which might rely on bus locks but as a commentator noted takes advantage of os internals to do it in a more efficient way or nothing at all if you are unlucky enough to run on a single-procesor architecture

factors	matrix
i suspect that it would but the constant factors might not be very good
i quite like the sparse matrix solution but you could use a version of

21074728
punctuation	words
if you are looking to match every full phrase sentence before those three punctuation marks you could try a regular expression like this this would give you the test phrase is something like this to test whether everything
you might try this instead this will produce the following result for your test sentence phrase something this everything you have an initial words boundary b but you do not complete the words before looking for a

21074728
punctuation	words
these punctuation marks will not match within a given words
further will by default just match any one of those three punctuation marks so you don t need an or |

google-chrome	firefox
the one that bugs me the most is a google-chrome issue where your nodes are garbage collected while they are still in use
firefox also has problems with the splitternode where not all the channels work

des	aes
plain des is usually considered not secure these days
also see why aes is more secure than des

21084081
implements	extends
i think the best way to get what you want is to implements it
looking at this post you cannot extends map and its subclass

21084309
google-chrome	firefox
webkit google-chrome safari does not support transitions on pseudo elements
it should work in firefox

21084856

google-chrome firefox working version here
in firefox window.event is not set when key pressed

21085209
awt	swing
that is old code used in awt and is not the way custom painting is done in swing
in swing you simply override the paintcomponent method of the jpanel and don t forget to invoke super.paintcomponent

21085789
email	dkim
if too short or too repetitive it can be flag as spam check your email headers x-return-path and so on check that your ip address is not blacklisted spamhaus and ice check that your ptr is properly set mail.your.domain.com should match the ip of your mx and vice versa your ip address should target the same machine try adding dkim or equivalent you can also choose to encrypt your mail using a third party ssl or equivalent
there are few things to check in order to make sure your email is less going to be taken as a spam check your subject

21086732
build.gradle	gradlew
1.your build.gradle should be like 2.file project structure modules dependency tab there should not be any red mark in dialog showing error if they are fix them
3.check your module_name.iml file it should have this entry in last section if its there with no entry close you studio delete .iml file and open studio again wait for gradlew sync to be complete.you .iml file will be created again check for entry

21088537
shadowing	named
edit as user2864740 mentioned error is because variable datetime is shadowing datetime type and compiler thinks that op is calling property now on string variable datetime
change to you cannot use datetime as variable named

21089180
ssms	sqlcmd
however if you don t want to use osql and or third party tool s there is a solution for this in the very ssms
it s called sqlcmd mode and it enables you to run a sql file by referencing it and not really opening it in editor

21097915
google-chrome	firefox
this solution works in google-chrome
it does not work work in firefox however.

21098467
boost	allocator
you will need to explicitly wrap the bind parameter that is to be passed by reference in a boost ref or boost cref regardless of how the method is declared
example now the following binding will actually make a copy of the classa object which i understand it is a temporary allocator and the called method should not keep a reference to it since this is not the reference of the actual object but to a copy of the object

21102535
portrait	landscape
but as you have restricted interface of your app to be in portrait orientation its not changing its orientation
so this is what you can do uncheck landscape orientation support for your app check if problem persists

21102822
build.gradle	gradlew
to include another module as a dependency use this compile project libraries facebook if you go through the project structure dialog instead of editing the build.gradle files by hand it can do it properly for you though it won t fix the incorrect statement that uses include
use v0.7.+ of the gradlew plugin as you ve already done and you want to make sure you re using v1.9 of gradlew not 1.10 which is incompatible

21103045
vbscript	vba
see similar question too find and start a vpn connection in vb .net vbscript vpn ppp adapter ip address vbs script using wmi objects to get ip address of vpn pptp connection
i don t know exact answer and i couldn t find useful solution in vba but this vb code might help you

21104357
udp	tcp
there are some rare times when they re too heavy and you use udp but this is not one
xmpp authentication is far more expensive than tcp setup teardown

21108592
build.gradle	gradlew
the minimum supported version is 0.7.0. please update the version of the dependency com.android.tools.build gradlew in your build.gradle files
you are using gradlew version 1.8 which is not supported

21110018
google-chrome	firefox
but that doesn t mean that you cannot use google-chrome workers
long version firefox used to allow accessing xpcom from other threads via chromeworker

21112170
innodb	myisam
however i would recommend converting your tables to innodb instead
myisam does not support foreign keys . to convert to myisam you would need to drop drop all foreign key contraints first

21114414
nunit	mstest
there is no command line option to turn this off see it may be possible to turn off the failonerror flag and add a build step to parse for errors but if you wish to turn off a test for maintenance it would be better to use an attribute like this unlike nunit you can t add a reason for the ignore so best leave a comment
mstest reports inconclusive as separate from failure but returns a execution result of 1 if any tests are inconclusive unlike nunit which does not

21115064
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i would try to add the code in viewdidappear
in both viewwillappear and viewdidload the viewcontroller s view has not been loaded in the window hierarchy yet

21116990
clang	llvm
this repository tries to keep up to date with top-of-tree llvm clang and has branches for earlier released versions
building programs that link with clang can be tricky especially if you want to do it out of source - in your own source tree not as part of clang s

21117861
domcontentloaded	onload
for a better visualization of the browser s navigationtiming timeline refer to the image below is fired essentially after domcontentloaded prior to domcomplete and clearly before loadeventstart and loadeventend the window s onload event has fired
note you should not just change your code to run during the window onload event as loadeventend will still be 0 during the onload event

21120697
implements	extends
of course you should probably implements it as a function that can be used with slash so that you can still write things like format t hexadecimal 1 16 it s actually not too hard to do this so here s one way but i won t guarantee that there are no bugs in this
it wouldn t be too hard to extends this to work with a user-provided base and to make it a bit more like the other floating point printers to add a + for positive numbers if is provided and to add support for widths etc.

21122669
floating-point	fractions
to compare floating-point quantities calculate the absolute value of their difference by using the abs method of the math class in the system namespace. determine an acceptable maximum difference such that you can consider the two quantities to be equal for practical purposes if their difference is no larger. compare the absolute value of the difference to the acceptable difference. alternatively double will return a number with greater precision
the trouble is you re using single which is a floating-pont data type which doesn t work well with fractions that aren t binary fractions

21122669
floating-point	fractions
floating-point expressions do not compare as equal when you work with floating-point numbers single data type visual basic and double data type visual basic remember that they are stored as binary fractions
this means they cannot hold an exact representation of any quantity that is not a binary fractions of the form k 2 n where k and n are integers

21127114
firefox	safari
there are a few caveats however - while firefox has supported this since v12 and ie even since 5.5 there is officially no support in webkit
it is however working fine in chrome 32-beta with certain flags enabled while it s not working in chrome 31-stable or current ios safari builds for example

21127356
lxml	elementtree
the following should work alternatively lxml has a wrapper around elementtree and has good support for namespaces without having to worry about string formatting
you aren t referencing the namespaces that exist in the xml document so elementtree can t find the elements in that xpath

21127751
stateless	stateful
note that you can call the raw c-style pointers with stateless lambdas as stateless lambdas implicitly convert to function pointers
also note that this example is strictly weaker than the other ones it does not accept stateful functions

21129370
fgets	fgetc
see fgets for a bare outline example of a read loop using fgets see fgets - get a string from a stream however if you can t be sure of allocating a buffer long enough to hold a line it is often better to use fgetc to read each character one at a time -- not to worry the file i o is still buffered not read a character at a time -- and assemble the text into tokens as you go along rather than dealing with lines longer than whatever buffer you provide which may then require you to handle tokens split between one filled buffer and the next
each call to fgets returns a new line until eof end of file

21129734
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this is a uiviewcontroller object
since i am assuming there is a uinavigationcontroller connecting your model you will need to typecast this uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationviewcontroller i would place the link i cannot at my current reputation level

21131498
punctuation	words
your approach by splitting words by a space is as you already noticed not working for punctuation
so a better way is to recognize words one by one with paying attention to punctuation

21131604
google-chrome	firefox
in some browsers like firefox event apperas only after successfully loading all elements images for example but in google-chrome and fired in same time
using have potential issue in firefox maybe in another browsers too if at least one image on the page is loaded with error then event not occure

21132845
client-side	server-side
unfortunately javascript the way you are experiencing it is a client-side language and cannot do what you want by itself
you will have to ask a server-side language to do that for you note that javascript has a framework built on top of it that runs server-side thanks cuberto basically you can do the scheduling in two ways 1 perform a countdown in the client browser and when the timer hits 0 initiate a mail-sending request towards the server very impractical and sometimes outright impossible as in your 3-day example

21138569
mvp	presenter
in passive view mvp it goes the other way - the presenter points to the view populating its data and listening to its events
it does not need to be a tight coupling though - you can couple the presenter to an abstraction of a view which can be embodied by a mock in a test context

21139016
clang	llvm
c++ cli on the other hand is a microsoft-proprietary thing and you will not be able to use it on a mac no matter what and neither gcc nor clang support it
there is no llvm 5.0

21139102
rdf	owl
since the x is arbitrary then anytime we have x p _ we also have x rdf type d but that s exactly what it means to have p rdfs domain d
this means that if you re trying to retrieve all properties that have foaf person as a domain then you ll need to use an owl reasoner not just sparql queries if you want all the results

21139328
client-side	server-side
and of course that s not to mention just having username and password for your mysql in your client-side code for anyone to access and the fact that your mysql connection would need to accept logins form everywhere not just localhost or a specific server domain would leave you far too susceptible
so the dart io library is to be run server-side like a ruby on rails or sinatra etc script or like php or like node.js

21139393
qthread	qobject
i fully agree with marek r s recommendation not to use pthreads when you have qthread available
generally speaking it s an error to call any of qobject or derived classes methods from a thread other than - unless they are designed and documented to be thread-safe

21140167
accelerometer	gyroscope
the accelerometer measures linear acceleration not angular rotation
it sounds to me like you want gyroscope data yaw pitch and roll not accelerometer data

21141068
fossil	git
and another lesser-visible system using real database fossil doesn t have stellar performance pdf either
git started as a minimal set of tools implementing a versioned file system and its author linus torvalds originally envisioned that a full-blown vcs will be a tool based on git

21142339
google-chrome	firefox
there are 3 different browsers being tested 1 firefox 2 google-chrome 3 internet explorer 1 firefox v 26.0 i still have the movetoelement problem using the actions class
instead i perform a try catch handler so that in case the actions do not work then the exception would run a javascript method to get the tool tip as presented below 2 google-chrome v 32.017 actions class for hover over works fine as is with the latest chromedriver

21142802
profiling	benchmarking
diagnosis i ran the magento profiling see first enable the profiling via system - configuration - developer - profiling yes
this enables the profiling but does not fill in any of the benchmarking times

21142802
profiling	benchmarking
this enables the profiling but does not fill in any of the benchmarking times
find the commented out line in index.php around line 71 uncomment this line to enable profiling

21143108
ubuntu	linux
so you ll have to compile mono from source the general instructions are here first compile the whole mono stuff you do not need to install it if you want to keep your current mono setup copy the mono.data.sqlite.dll library of course you can cross-compile i ve built mono on ubuntu server and used the dll in a windows .net project
then ensure you have the native sqlite library sqlite3.dll for windows and sqlite3.so for linux in your library path for windows i simply copied the sqlite3.dll next to the mono.data.sqlite.dll assembly for linux it should work out of the box

21144134
prepare	execute
if you re using rails 4.1 or above the monkey patch is apparently not necessary however i guess there s a bug in rails 3.2 that doesn t parse pgbouncer s change to the database url in such a way that prepare statements are actually disabled
i just deployed pgbouncer to our production webapp using these steps for a rails 3.2 app running on ruby 2.0 create .buildpacks file in root directory app that contains the text i created a file called disable_prepared_statements_monkey_patch.rb in config initializers that contained the code posted by cwninja in this thread modified my procfile to add bin start-pgbouncer-stunnel before bundle execute unicorn -p port -c . config unicorn.rb execute heroku config set pgbouncer_prepared_statements false --app yourapp heroku config add buildpack_url --app yourapp deployed the new .buildpacks and procfile changes to production it worked as advertised after that point

21146303
google-chrome	firefox
oh so it turns out in google-chrome hitting enter in the url window results in same behavior as pushing the refresh button
in firefox hitting enter in the url does not result in hitting the refresh button

21146849
profiling	instrumentation
suppose you re profiling the performance of an opengl game and you want to use both the time profiling and the opengl driver instrumentation
you ll notice apple does not provide a template that combines both of these instrumentation

21148166
operands	scalar
101-102 if the fundamental types in the operands do not match then the conversions from section 4.1.10 implicit conversions are applied to create matching types
... after conversion the following cases are valid ... one operand is a scalar and the other is a vector or matrix

21148186
multiplication	exponent
julia does not check integer multiplication for overflow and thus the multiplication for 64 bit integers is performed mod 2 63
see this faq entry when you write out the multiplication for factorial you get this can also be written as prime factors if you look at the exponent of 2 you get 97

21151774
strncpy	malloc
strncpy however is not recommended . other approaches are possible
for example you can dynamically allocate memory space using malloc and reallocate it replacing your array by a larger or smaller one using realloc

21151787
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
some browsers use text plain some use text html as well this code should pull any text or image source url on the latest google-chrome firefox on mac and pc
safari doesn t seem to give the url so if someone knows how to get it let me know

21153139
comparator	comparable
that is exactly why you either have to provide a comparator or make sure that your objects support the comparator method and implement comparable
the exception reveals it all java tries to cast the given object to comparable if you do not provide a comparator

21154964
ssl	https
it is not related to the application code.please refer the documentation of your application server to enable ssl.for example this link provides information about how to configure ssl in tomcat 7
making your http connection over ssl https you need to enable ssl in your application server by providing a certificate either self-signed or ca provided

21155863
swift	objective-c
objective-c swift func navigationcontroller navigationcontroller uinavigationcontroller willshowviewcontroller viewcontroller uiviewcontroller animated bool so the implementation would look something like this
objective-c swift the callback will fire when the user lifts her finger and the objec-c swift context.iscancelled will return yes true if the animation was reversed the view controller was not popped else no false

21158339
move	drag
svn move will not delete any history
in tortoise svn you can just drag and drop and can achieve this

21159916
google-chrome	safari
sample code below tested on google-chrome 31.0.1650.57 linux safari 6.0.4 osx note whether or not to show the flushed output is up to the browser usually depending on the amount of data in the response
for example safari 6.0.4 wants 512 bytes of data before outputting data to the browser

21164495
bash	subshell
the latter is not portable but works in bash which may be adequate. however in this particular case it is probably better to do something like
the pipe runs in a subshell

21166185
mp3	wav
here s the approach i d recommend which does involve re-encoding use audiofilereader to get your mp3 as floating point samples directly in the read method find an open source noise gate algorithm port it to c# and use that to detect silence when noise gate is closed you have silence
you ll want to tweak threshold and attack release times create a derived isampleprovider that uses the noise gate and in its read method does not return samples that are in silence either pass the output into wavefilewriter to create a wav file and and encode the wav file to mp3 or use naudio.lame to encode directly without a wav step

21166872
coalesce	isnull
you could use coalesce instead if you want which can also take multiple parameters not just two as with isnull
a simple isnull on the b table s name should suffice

21168075
imperative	declarative
the idea is not bad but driven by an imperative thought pattern
xslt is not an imperative language and most of the time it s better to follow declarative patterns

21168404
jar	manifest.mf
if feasible i would take the approach of calling the other jar s main method immediately. this is not isolated but you may set the system.out to capture all text
to find the main class here otherjarsmain open the jar with 7zip winzip or so and look in meta-inf manifest.mf

21169130
pdfbox	itext
the question specifically identifies the pdfbox library in the subject
you do not need itext the xfa manipulation can be done using the pdxfa object available in pdfbox 1.8

21169130
pdfbox	itext
you do not need itext the xfa manipulation can be done using the pdxfa object available in pdfbox 1.8
many thanks to maruan sahyoun for his great work on pdfbox + xfa

21169358
ffmpeg	libav
to compile x264 with lavf you need to have ffmpeg libav libraries installed and be in gcc search path or you will need to provide path for them in configure by using something like this also you may need to compile ffmpeg libav yourself because x264 need new enough libraries and may refuse to use one from prebuild repos
x264 is written to use versions from master branch of ffmpeg libav and may not work with stable branches that don t have needed new apis

21170654
setinterval	settimeout
this in combination with using setinterval which is not able to synchronize with monitor screen refreshes worsens the problem
to elaborate on the latter using setinterval settimeout can cause tearing which happens when the draw is in the middle of its operation not fully completed and a screen refresh occur

21170654
setinterval	settimeout
to elaborate on the latter using setinterval settimeout can cause tearing which happens when the draw is in the middle of its operation not fully completed and a screen refresh occur
setinterval can only take integer values and you would need for 16.67 ms to synchronize frame-wise 60hz

21171131
dbcontext	objectcontext
in entity framework the context used inherits from dbcontext
this is an iobjectcontextadapter but does not contain easy access to the objectcontext methods

21172906
client-side	server-side
i couldn t figure out why the server-side of my app1 could not see the shared collections in app3...even though the client-side of app1 was seeing them
then it hit me that the server-side of my app1 was acting like a client of app3 so needed to subscribe to the publication too

21172969
.htaccess	httpd.conf
to enable .htaccess your httpd.conf file will need this line allowoverride all
it appears that your .htaccess is not enabled

21176231
awt	swing
also you re better off creating swing gui s rather than awt gui s unless you absolutely must create awt applets for a class
you seem to be trying to create a swing jframe inside of an awt applet which really doesn t make sense

21176231
awt	swing
you seem to be trying to create a swing jframe inside of an awt applet which really doesn t make sense
if your intent is to create a swing gui then don t have your class extend applet and don t have a paint method

21177216
scheme	racket
if on the other hand you want the ability to reflect on names in your current scheme environment this is not supported by standard scheme
some implementations like guile or racket do have this capability

21178073
sudo	passwd
so i typed sudo cp my-default.cnf etc my.cnf went back to the workbench and it finally said testing host machine settings is done
i figured it out went to my terminal and typed passwd old passwd was blank i created a new passwd it was that simple i created a etc directory i checked the files under usr local mysql support-files and saw my cnf file was actually named my-default.cnf and not my-huge.cnf like the developer at the mysql site

21180036
awt	swing
that is for historical reasons due to awt upon which swing is heavily based
the content pane returned for swing components is typically a swing based jpanel to which we can set a border but there is not contractual guarantee of that so we need to check instanceof and then cast it to one

21181280
super	extends
by this way java.lang.object is also super interface this is not exact technical term for all interfaces
by default any class even if we don t extends any super class extends java.lang.object class

21182380
build.gradle	gradlew
- since android studio 0.4.+ the folder name should be libs and not libraries create a folder libs at the root of your project same place where you find the settings.gradle copy the facebook folder from the facebook sdk in the libs folder in your settings.gradle add include libs facebook before the include of your main app in your build.gradle of your main app add this line in your dependencies compile project libs facebook be sure that android support v4 is also one of your dependencies i.e compile com.android.support support-v4 18.0.0 also here is the build.gradle of my facebook libs now sync gradlew and everything should works fine i m on android studio 0.4.2 + facebook sdk 3.6.0
to add to the other answer add the line include libraries facebook to your settings.gradle and you ll get a new error gradlew android project refresh failed configuration with name default not found. but hey this is what we call progress

21182868
vim	notepad++
there is a bunch of vim plugins like this one allowing you to lint your code after buffer save placing warnings to quickfix window
not sure about notepad++ alternative

21185995
allocator	stl
this usually leads to something like com since you have to ensure that all allocator and matching deallocations happen in the same module and that no details of the actual object layout are exposed to the user
actually this is not only true for stl containers but applies to pretty much any c++ type in particular also all other standard library types

21186035
build.gradle	gradlew
please do the following change and sync project with gradlew try to use minsdkvesion 8 in all your build.gradle files as well as androidmanifest.xml files ans sync
if it doesn t solves the problem go through your gradlew console to and make required changes as per the error shown

21188351
implements	extends
the videocapture api has been extended of public videocapture string filename method. the question remains why this feature has been implements so late
if using of recent version of opencv isn t acceptable for you for some reason you have several options rebuild opencv by yourself with this method marked as public hacky one make your copy of videocapture class or extends original one and play with reflection with public videocapture string constructor

21189680
haskell	agda
in haskell it s incredibly painful and often cannot
for instance it s possible to define a weaken notion in agda s fin type where we provide a very interesting first value a proof that which allows us to embed a value less than n into the set of values less than m

21192219
queue	fifo
keep in mind that queue is not thread safe hence you should synchronize the access
lock does t guarantee fifo access

21193789
innodb	myisam
innodb is now the default storage engine as of mysql 5.5 circa 2010 and it will continue to be the focus of future development
note that with innodb you cannot simply delete files to achieve dropping a table like you could with myisam

21193996
multiplying	multiplication
when multiplying two unit quaternions the mathematical result is another unit quaternion
however the floating point implementation of unit quaternions multiplication may result in a quaternion with a norm close to 1 but not equal 1

21194841
mathml	mathjax
html5 extended the definition to allow html tags within token elements in mathml like for example
mathjax however was developed before html5 was complete and it follows the mathml3.0 specification so html tags are not allowed in general

udp	tcp
anything much for example game data video data etc would probably require udp which is much faster but a lot more unreliable which is what skype uses
tcp doesn t allow data loss well it does but guarantees all your data will be delivered as you sent it and udp is used when your allowed to lose some data packets a video feed may look blurry because data packets are being lost via udp

21195527
udp	tcp
tcp doesn t allow data loss well it does but guarantees all your data will be delivered as you sent it and udp is used when your allowed to lose some data packets a video feed may look blurry because data packets are being lost via udp
client - client has a lot of implications and i would recommend you focus on the following in summary xml you can pick this up as you develop android apps java not hard to pick up if you re already into basic programming etc establishing tcp server connections in java

21196524
google-chrome	firefox
there is a live example on this webrtc-link is new and should work on google-chrome mobile link is from this answer - which is discussing mediadevices.enumeratedevices new vs mediastreamtrack.getsources deprecated in depth
you can find further information slightly outdated now but usefull to get the big picture about this on scroll down and skip feature detection gaining access to an input device setting media constraints until selecting a media source for reference my former live example broken they are using mediastreamtrack.getsources deprecated this is not working on google-chrome 45 and firefox 39 anymore

21196743
nginx	lighttpd
you could do something like configure a reverse proxy for certain paths in lighttpd to go to a different port which nginx owns but this will still push all the data through lighttpd and just use more resources than having lighttpd serve it directly
you could also just run nginx on a different port and change all your static content urls to have that port but i m not sure how that might affect things like javascript domain restrictions etc

21197206
prepare	execute
it includes time spent to prepare the query via activerecord send the query over the wire to the database server execute the query receive the response over the wire from the database server and parse the response back into a set of ruby objects in activerecord
usually the time taken to actually execute the query on the database server will dominate this measurement but not always

21197701
imperative	declarative
1.4 at the end i would add a check constraint on dbo.timecardexp thus 2 imperative solution i would create a trigger on dbo.timecardexp if dbo.project.enddate could be updated then i would create another trigger on dbo.project note if you have questions then feel free to ask
1 a declarative solution 1.1 i would denormalize db by adding the expensedate column dbo.project to dbo.timecardexp table alter table dbo.timecardexp add projectenddate date not null

21203296
implements	extends
just to correct a minor detail abstract classes can be partially abstract or fully abstract depending on whether they are partially implements in which case we commonly call them abstract classes or not implements at all and have no member variable in which case we commonly call them interfaces
they are many uses for abstract classes most of them implying the ability to extends behaviour of code without modifying this code

21204478
mathml	mathjax
the resulting mathml for your expression would be this this can be displayed in browsers either natively firefox at least or using mathjax which is a javascript math rendered
why not use mathml

21211422
super	self
super is commonly used when overriding the method with the same name from parent class
for this case specifically super foo self .who_knows is not a good thing at all

21213131
sudo	passwd
the idea you have there will never work as sudo 1 does not read passwd from standard input unless it s a terminal
hardcoding passwd into a script is also very bad idea as pointed out repeatedly in comments

21213131
sudo	passwd
if you really want to make this happen i recommend against it you should do edit etc sudoers in your target machine to let you run sudo 1 without it asking a passwd for things you need to be done without a passwd
for that you should not let yourself run any chmod command lines without a passwd but instead create a script in target machine for example usr local bin do-my-promiscuous-chmod then tell sudo to let you run just that script without asking a passwd

21215282
awt	swing
and yourclassname is an instance to handle the button event i also agree with andrew thompson that awt is not a preferred way to handle your tasks
if your teacher has suggested you to use awt then please use swing

21215859
spaces	linefeed
---------- --------- -------- ------- ------ ----- and so on. the hashes are printed like this ------# -----## ----### ---#### --##### -###### since hash printing loop at second stage needs to print equal no of hashes more to complete the pyramid it can be solved by two methods one by copying and pasting hash loop twice or by making the loop run twice next time by following modification the logic to build such loops is simple the outermost loop prints one linefeed to seperate loops the inner loops are responsible for each lines contents. the spaces loop puts spaces and hash loop appends hash at end of spaces. my answer can be redundant because i did not read other answers so much carefully they were long result # ### ##### ####### ######### ###########
the simplest answer to why that is happening is because one loop prints spaces like this represented by -

21216486
libstdc++	libc++
clang will quite happily link libstdc++
the foremost problem is why the linker cannot find libc++ if you want to link a dynamic library say libfoo.so with the -l flag you use the option -lfoo not -llibfoo

21216569
aggregate-functions	sum
create table othertable ids int graduate int class varchar 100 insert into othertable values 3 2 others your modified statement thanks giles i changed the count aggregate-functions to sum
you cannot use count an aggregate-functions with a unrelated table there must be some relation between the table sometable and someothertable

21217690
boost	stl
using boost s multi_index_container
you can t use an stl container set which doesn t technically even need to me a bst as far as i know as it doesn t provide you with access to the underlying structure

21220918
implements	extends
edit in this particular instance the difference would be that if you later reassigned l to contain an object that implements list but does not derive from abstractlist your code will throw an exception
not all classes that implement list also extends abstractlist

21221479
profiling	debugging
i wrote a very simple and naive provider which you can use for profiling
this will not pick up any of the steps that servicestack already adds by default but it might still be useful for your own debugging

21222418
udp	tcp
udp is message based unlike tcp which is stream based
recv from cannot receive partial udp data reads are all-or-nothing

21222576
haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
remember that in ocaml or other hindley milner derived languages sml haskell parenthesis are not needed to apply functions and serve a different purpose as opposed to c like languages
the ocaml compiler considers that you are applying x-1 to y in x-1 y

21224574
realloc	malloc
one problem is that the code doesn t initialize res in main so you attempt to realloc an indeterminate value
either null or a value previously returned by malloc or realloc or calloc would be ok but since you pass an indeterminate value you are invoking undefined behaviour and a crash is a valid response to doing that

21231772
swt	swing
here s a tutorial for embedding swing into swt
with swt disable items it is not possible for a combobox you can remove them

21231772
swt	swing
with swt disable items it is not possible for a combobox you can remove them
you could use jcombobox from swing to disable items

21233218
aggregate-functions	sum
this reminds the certain known message column column_name is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate-functions or the group by clause. it doesn t make sense to display the columns that don t have a summary operation and to hide them we need to call a method i know it s a big big name
the resulting grid can be seen below summary operations gridviewhelper has three built-in summary operations sum average and row count

21233983
ssl	https
if you have enabled ssl all actions annotated with nophttpsrequirement will redirect to https
the setting securitysettings.forcesslforallpages just enforces that all pages even those not annotated should redirect to ssl

21233983
ssl	https
the setting securitysettings.forcesslforallpages just enforces that all pages even those not annotated should redirect to ssl
the problem is that you are trying to run http and https on the same port

21235114
listview	gridview
so then the simplest solution i found was to simply disable focusable property on the listview gridview with listview.setfocusable false
that way when you first enter the activity focus will default and not rely on listview gridview

21240904
multiplying	multiplication
change your code to the reason is that k is a col-vector or a 4x1 matrix so you cannot simply multiplying it by
for matrix multiplication the size of left and right must follow n m and m p

21240999
setinterval	settimeout
you shouldn t use a for-loop just a recursive settimeout read about the recursive settimeout pattern when saying about 500ms i assume it doesn t have to be so accurate setinterval is harmful and most developers are probably not aware of it
setinterval does not fit for so many things if an error occurs you cannot stop the train

21242752
build.gradle	gradlew
inside you main module s build.gradle file you can have multiple build types along with your debug one
you can specify zipalign characteristic inside any of your buildtype by using note older versions use zipalign instead of zipalignenabled default gradlew tasks always created for debug and release buildtypes whether you define or not

21242947
multiplying	multiplication
the reason for that is that the combination of two rotations is not performed by adding the quaternions but by multiplying them
if we convert quaternions to a logarithmic space we can use a simple linear blend because multiplication will become additions

21244675
namedtuple	dictionary
note that however that namedtuple s are immutable you cannot modify them
you want to use dictionary s note however that this does not preserve the order

21246962
uiview	subviews
since it s a subviews of uiview that should work just fine
you could always create an instance of mkpinannotationview and add it as a subviews and not an annotation to your map view

21248384
mp4	webm
pretty sure i would say that just using sd hd mp4 files is the way to go
levels is not a valid variable for jw6 - i would think this should work as a set up however you really only need webm now for firefox for mac and older windows machines as firefox supports mp4 in now in most cases

21249022
implements	extends
apparently tess-two does not implements all the tessbaseapi as it does not include support for the native gethocrtext method
you may have to extends the wrapper yourself to access the functions you need

21249933
client-side	server-side
angularjs provides lots of validation tools on client-side use as much as possible so that when it is submitted to server it is as valid as possible
however a bad user can submit your form without using your client-side code so when it is submitted validate user input on server-side assuming input is not always correct

21251225
spaces	linefeed
this first part of the search expression matches horizontal whitespace characters at end of a line like horizontal tabs normal spaces no-break-spaces and some other not often used spaces
the usage of s is not good as this character class matches any whitespace character including the vertical whitespace characters carriage return and linefeed

21251375
super	implements
then in a subclass of nsattributedstrings override the drawing methods such as drawinrect and implements similar custom drawing logic per the first suggestion for your custom attribute otherwise rely on super
i m not aware of this being implements in the sdk even if you can restrict to ios 7

21262066
trie	tree
glenn s answer doesn t take into account the prefix storing nature of a trie or prefix tree to give it another name
if all you want is a dictionary then a hashtable is a better choice but if you want to do some auto-complete style things then the trie is ideal

21262787
ssl	https
if we use curl to retrieve a https site that is not using a ca-signed certificate the following problem occurs curl curl 60 ssl certificate problem verify that the ca cert is ok
details error 14090086 ssl routines ssl3_get_server_certificate certificate verify failed more details here while we can simply overcome this using the -k option there s a safer and lasting solution step 1 identify which directory your openssl installation uses

21263413
build.gradle	gradlew
but it is possible to eventually get rid of these compile errors as long as your build.gradle doesn t create any extra sourcesets that as doesn t understand
try not to deviate too much from the android gradlew plugin examples

21263428
armadillo	lapack
go ahead and run this will get everything ready and generate everything cmake will need for creating our shared armadillo library
the way i proceeded here is not how i think you are supposed to but as i am no wizard with makefiles in general i thought it would be helpful to show what i did to get it to cross-compile. i modified the generated cmakecache.txt lines with the following i know there is somewhere in that cmakecache.txt file where you can specify the path to the location of our blas and lapack but i struggled to figure it out

21264630
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
from the javadoc of runtimeexception runtimeexception is the superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown during the normal operation of the java virtual machine. runtimeexception and its subclassing are unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception do not need to be declared in a method or constructor s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary

21269198
jar	war
here is an example you can refer to exclude files with maven assembly does not work 2 use maven jar plugin check this answer as an example maven-jar-plugin exclusions failing
first read this article about dependency exclusions optional dependencies and dependency exclusions if you are building a .war file from modulebase you can make not a dependency but an overlay for moduletypea from modulebase and similarly moduletypeb war as overlay of modulebase

21270470
equals	gethashcode
but you have fixed equals object obj only
gethashcode method does not check if uniqueid.equals default idtype

21272389
floating-point	fractions
i d also recommend that you don t perform direct equality checks against floating-point values
instead of using you should really check for something like this is because floating-point values are not exact representations of fractions numbers

21272511
client-side	server-side
the wcf receivetimeout does not apply to client-side configuration
for server-side config the receivetimeout is used by serviceframework layer to initialize the session-idle timeout to be honest i don t really know what that is this msdn discussion may be helpful as a final note having really big timeout values isn t a good idea unless you definitely have long running requests

21272562
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
but it all boils down to twos complement vs unsigned and for addition and subtraction they are computed differently
for multiplication and division this is not the case a signed multiplier and unsigned multiplier are different use the wrong one you can get the wrong answer likewise if those have overflow flags then you need to compare them to the operation

21275812
cpython	pypy
not much fun one last thing i get the same results with a cpython 3.4 dev build correct results when used internally everything charged to the first line of code when used externally
but pypy 2.2 2.7.3 and pypy3 2.1b1 3.2.3 both seem to give me correct results with -m cprofile

21277637
ssl	https
the pictures can be served via https with a valid ssl certificate
examples all these urls are actually redirects but the target url seems to support https although it s not mentioned in the official documentation

21286498
google-chrome	firefox
when you reset on firefox the input field becomes invalid but on google-chrome it does not
on google-chrome if you select a file and then bring up the select screen again then cancel it the field becomes invalid

21287165
bash	zsh
when i looked in etc bashrc there was one line that seems like it might be related # make bash check its window size after a process completes shopt -s checkwinsize i m not sure if this is related or not but when i run that command in zsh i get zsh command not found shopt perhaps someone more familiar with bash zsh osx can make more sense of this
so i also have this problem and i don t have a solution but here s one thing i have noticed. it s that this isn t a problem when using bash as your default shell

21290376
voip	sip
then the server can send a message via sip to the handset as if it were instigating a voip session
you app is awoken gets the messages - ideally from the sip message if possible - and then just doesn t start the session

21291174
realloc	fgetc
the trouble does not come from realloc
if you read a file and read characters in it you should check a few facts as shown here the file is successfully opened test the result of fopen the end of the file has not been reached test the result of fgetc your code failed because is always true i don t know why

21294661
comm	grep
the -1 -3 switches tell comm to not print out those columns
grep sort uniq grep -f -v -file bfile afile | sort | uniq or just grep -f -v -file bfile afile | sort -u if your sort handles the -u option

21302356
oncreate	onstart
as you can see system will not call oncreate for a again
for example you should unregister listeners for gps sensors etc in onstop and register again in onstart

21304029
profiling	instrumentation
instead go to profiling choose memory leaks and use that
if you are using arc and cannot find any leaks you can use mark heap button in allocations instrumentation to find memory build ups like this repeat the page a page b cycle and every time you are in page a press mark heap button

21304304
ocaml	scheme
t mypackage then you have to create a type but this is not ocaml type which is more precisely look at the position of the quantifier
ocaml s type scheme are left most quantified and it cannot have higher rank types like but we can mimic it with its record polymorphic fields with this type the existential type can be implemented as if you do not like the type variable y is exposed you can hide it again with the record polymorphic field the package implementations can be packed into this interface as follows since these packed versions have the same type we can put them into a list this is usually what we want to do with the existentials

21304957
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you are referring to the desktop versions of firefox google-chrome and safari is ignored in most if not all desktop browsers
note the viewport meta tag is ignored on desktop versions of firefox

21310868
implements	extends
create service factories prefer concrete factory classes classes implements zend servicemanager factoryinterface as apposed to closures otherwise you will quickly find that the number of factories you need will bloat your module.php and these cannot be cached like the configuration - meaning a performance hit viewplugins controller plugins abuse the flexibility of controller and view plugins
these are extremely powerful ways to encapsulate and inject additional view controller logic without having to extends existing classes

21311190
rvm	bundler
which by the way is probably occuring because of the same problem you probably have a path gems bootstrap-sass-c0e12a90ba3e in your system ruby but not on your local rvm
when you run sudo bundle install you re probably using a different instance of bundler either you have another instance of rvm installed globally for your system or you re just using the default system ruby as a result it will install the gems for that system ruby

21311190
rvm	bundler
when you run sudo bundle install you re probably using a different instance of bundler either you have another instance of rvm installed globally for your system or you re just using the default system ruby as a result it will install the gems for that system ruby
if you later open the server without using sudo it will look for the gems in your local rvm which does not have the installing with just bundle install is the correct way

21313098
vim	textmate	vim	sublimetext
so it may seem odd if you re not used to it but it is actually perfectly logical if you think of it in the vim way
1 i ve tested this in both textmate and sublimetext and it works as-is but some editors use 1 instead of

21314899
consistency	acid
the succinct way i would explain cap theorem is in a distributed data store at the time of network partition you have to chose either consistency or availability and cannot get both
newer nosql systems are trying to focus on availability while traditional acid databases had a higher focus on consistency

21315083
imperative	declarative
last but not least it allows for a declarative approach as opposed to the traditional imperative one
you simply define your data then you write your business logic as usual in an imperative form then define the ui and it s relations to the data via databinding

21316615
oncreate	setcontentview
in onresume but the tvpuzcontent variable is instantiated in oncreate so it refers to the text view from the original call to setcontentview in oncreate
basically by the end of oncreate you have assigned all your variables but then onresume is called by the system and you call setcontentview again which throws away your original layout so all your variables are pointing at old views that are not on screen

21318083
implements	extends
in objective-c we might have you would call this from somewhere like this here s how i would implements this in java and to call it if you think of the category methods as methods that automatically send the self variable as the first method argument albeit invisible then this makes even more sense
for your example if i would not extends the specific object i might do something like update a commenter asked for limitations

21323113
lxml	libxml2
to install lxml on ubuntu run sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev libxml2 in virtualenv pip install --upgrade lxml pip install cssselect
it looks like lxml has not been successfully installed

21323411
super	extends
is the only way for a reference type to inherit from a super class you can inherit with parent.apply this arguments
in child but it makes extends parent functions more complicated and doesn t make childinstance instanceof parent true

21325848
hex	binary
in mysql hexdump of a string is obtained by hex function application select hex one from test in posix shell hexdump is generated using od -t x1 temp test.csv if you do not want to be that hardcore for common whitespace it is enough to convert it to c escape sequences r for carriage return using od -c temp test.csv maybe even simpler but generally harder to explain approach to identifying eol type is just using the text editor of your choice and letting it tell you
csv is a plain text format in contrast to binary format

21329903
n-gram	words
if you try to make this match with n-gram alone your index may become quite large
since you maybe required to index all permutations of the words to not miss the place where numbers words start or end

21332663
super	extends
inside b you can choose which method is called by doing either method or super.method to specify whether to call the super implementation or not
java inheritance lets the extends test over-ride or hide methods from the class it extends

21335464
namenode	hdfs
the concern is overhead of managing them as well as - if you have truly many of them- namenode utilization from hadoop - the definitive guide small files do not take up any more disk space than is required to store the raw contents of the file
for example a 1 mb file stored with a block size of 128 mb uses 1 mb of disk space not 128 mb. hadoop archives or har files are a file archiving facility that packs files into hdfs blocks more efficiently thereby reducing namenode memory usage while still allowing transparent access to files

21336042
union	distinct
msdn when the object returned by this method is enumerated union enumerates first and second in that order and yields each element that has not already been yielded
here is the implementation of union ilspy .net 4 the first collection is enumerated first the same applies to intersect and other similar methods in linq-to-objects as well when the object returned by this method is enumerated intersect enumerates first collecting all distinct elements of that sequence. it then enumerates second marking those elements that occur in both sequences

21338131
bash	subshell
i originally claimed that not all bash subshell run in their own child process but that turns out not to be true
as kojiro states in his answer some shells - other than bash - do sometimes avoid creation of child processes for subshell so generally speaking in the world of shells one should not assume that a subshell implies a child process

21338131
bash	subshell
as kojiro states in his answer some shells - other than bash - do sometimes avoid creation of child processes for subshell so generally speaking in the world of shells one should not assume that a subshell implies a child process
as for the op s cases in bash assumes that instances are simple commands it looks like using command substitution always adds an extra subshell in bash - as does enclosing any command in ...

21338131
bash	subshell
by design commands in a pipeline are launched simultaneously - sequencing only happens through their connected stdin stdout pipes. bash 4.2+ has shell option lastpipe off by default which causes the last pipeline segment not to run in a subshell
for command substitution for process substitution typically creates 2 subshell

21343085
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
message i kept getting it happened because the repo s initial commit was done from macbook that is formatted case-sensitive and the error was appearing on my imac that was formatted case-insensitive
on the case-sensitive machine you could see two files which isn t valid on the second machine so git had to do something about it

21343610
umask	sudo
at a guess its probably umask -- you probably have 077 while root s default is something like 022
so with sudo created files are not world readable but with su they are

21343706
direct3d	direct2d
be careful with some deadlock situations details below. you probably need to use id2d1multithread to lock while drawing using direct3d
i have not yet got a reliably working multithreaded set of direct2d functions even following this so this is all i know so far - i don t yet know about the other caveats etc that are sure to exist

21344379
ssl	https
the only way to avoid this is to use ssl all the time - this gives websocket the best chance of working
this is almost certainly due to not using https ssl

21344926
build.gradle	gradlew
as for whether you can put it in the top-level build.gradle file to have it apply to all modules i m not certain
i tried putting it in the allprojects block but gradlew told me that the default dependency handler didn t know what to do with it

21345127
ng-include	ng-controller
personally i am not a big fan of using multiple routes and instead simply use ng-include if i want to separate portions of a single view into their own files
if you do this then you only need to define your parent and child state .state app.wh url wh abstract true controller ... note that if you want separate controllers for left and right you can use ng-controller in your views

21345584
spaces	delimiter
to search for a spaces followed by a plus sign followed by a spaces then fix it so it doesn t multiplying when they ask to add two numbers ok you did that. note if you eventually want to let your users do something besides addition you probably won t be able to use split without a fairly complex regular expression
that s because split won t return the delimiter

21346775
bash	subshell
you can verify this fairly trivially in bash 4 which has the and environment variables expands to the process id of the shell
in a subshell it expands to the process id of the current shell not the subshell

21346775
bash	subshell
bashpid expands to the process id of the current bash process
this differs from under certain circumstances such as subshell that do not require bash to be re-initialized in practice about the only case where the shell can elide an extra subshell is when you pipe to an explicit subshell here the subshell implied by the pipe is explicitly applied but not duplicated

21348714
build.gradle	gradlew
edit all your build.gradle if you are using root level build.gradle to define android gradlew plugin version check in that only must point to 0.8 version latest as of now of android gradlew plugin updated mapping is | android gradlew plugin | gradlew version | 0.7.+ 1.9 0.8.+ 1.10
go to file settings gradlew you will end up with this screen for setting up your gradlew also make sure you have google repository in your android sdk directory which will be located at if not do install it from sdk manager extras google repository first

21350449
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it few seconds ago with google-chrome 32 for mac and it loaded immediately. when i try to load it with firefox it doesn t load
i got some very long loading times with firefox

21350918
jsf	seam
the page scope is indistinguishable from the ui component tree. therefore the page context is destroyed when jsf removes the ui component tree also called the view from the session
however when this happens seam does not receive a callback and therefore the destroy method on a page-scoped component never gets called

21351202
build.gradle	gradlew
why not just common-deps.gradle and then in sub-project build.gradle apply from rootproject.file common-deps.gradle lastly i think you mean apply plugin maven apply plugin java in sub-project build.gradle
first why your approach does not work apply from applies a gradlew script to a project object

21352494
decoder	encoder
about equally important it means you ll structure your code to have a place to call the coder to encode the data before you send it and decoder data after you receive it
if you ever decide to enhance the code you end up choosing a different encoder decoder not trying to add one where none existed before in which case you re a lot more likely to need a complete rewrite

21354858
google-chrome	firefox
technically its not the fastest on firefox but crazy speed difference imho on google-chrome makes up for it
also interesting observation is how much faster google-chrome is with these array functions than firefox

21357198
build.gradle	gradlew
you ll have to edit the classpath in your build.gradle to classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.8.+ gradlew 1.10
you ll have to edit the distributionurl in your gradlew wrapper gradle-wrapper.properties to download the 19.0.1 android sdk build tools in the sdk manager and instuct the build to use them with this in your build.gradle buildtoolsversion 19.0.1 there s a bug that was fixed in android studio 0.4.3 that i think is the cause of it not seeing the classes in your actionbarpulltorefresh library

21357198
build.gradle	gradlew
you ll have to edit the distributionurl in your gradlew wrapper gradle-wrapper.properties to download the 19.0.1 android sdk build tools in the sdk manager and instuct the build to use them with this in your build.gradle buildtoolsversion 19.0.1 there s a bug that was fixed in android studio 0.4.3 that i think is the cause of it not seeing the classes in your actionbarpulltorefresh library
the new version of the plugin and gradlew will be necessary for your project to work in 0.4.3

21358484
realloc	malloc
malloc often gives you more memory that you ask and stores the actual value in a special location that realloc can access at a later time
if you realloc down or realloc within the bounds the value returned by realloc does not change

21359592
strdup	malloc
this does that aside from your typo concerning the addresses you can also use strdup instead of malloc and strcpy if you know the systems this code will run on support it
to do this manually replace the strcopy call with some notes about the code you posted don t cast the return value of malloc -- it isn t needed and it can hide bugs namely if the header that declares malloc isn t included

21360510
crossover	mutation
i am not particularly familiar with the specifics of the de algorithm but in general the point of crossover is that if you have two very different individuals with high fitness it will produce an offspring that is intermediate between them without being particularly similar to either
mutation only explores the local neighbourhood of each individual without taking the rest of the population into account

21361166
serializable	deserialization
now deserialization need not invoke the constructor as it already has the state of the serializable object and that is what it has to provide us
however if in the hierarchy of serializable class there is some non-serializable class then it s constructor would be invoked to initialize the state in that class as it has not been serializable

21362569
firefox	safari
a bug has been filed with both google-chrome and safari again see the link but until then firefox sadly is the only browser that allows you to read form it
there are two things at work here you should wait for rasterizehtml.drawhtml to finish before expecting anything from the canvas safari webkit cannot read back from the canvas once html actually a svg has been drawn there

21362862
config	ini
if parsing that config is not your central task please consider using a module from cpan
config ini or config simple instead of reinventing that particular wheel

21363133
google-chrome	firefox
mdn previously claimed that google-chrome 32 supported this but as far as i can tell that was simply wrong
my version of google-chrome 36 does not support it and mdn now claims that only firefox supports this function

21365600
daemons	systemd
install the network time protocol this also happened to me when running make on a samba smb cifs share on a server. a durable solution consists in installing the ntp daemons on both the server and the client. please note that this problem is not solved by running ntpdate
this would resolve the time difference only temporarily but not in the future. for ubuntu and debian-derived systemd simply type the following line at the command line moreover one will still need to issue the command once and only once in the affected directory to correct the file modification times once and for all

21369209
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome in the article on mdn does not refer to google-chrome but to extension code that runs with google-chrome privileges look here for other meanings of google-chrome in firefox
in google-chrome chromium content scripts run in a different environment than the web page that means that window in the content script is different from window in the web page

21369989
base	fractions
and the answer to that question is because this is a binary computer and it uses base 2 not base 10 there are conversion problems with 0.001 when going to base 2 you cannot exactly represent that fractions in an ieee floating point number
in base 10 we know that if we have a fractions with a factor of 3 in the denominator and lacking one in the numerator to cancel it out we end up with an infinitely repeated pattern basically we cannot accurately represent that number with a finite set of digits

21369993
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
then trying library rjava worked for root but not for me as a user this problem required to add the environment variables java_home and ld_library_path to .login following instructions found at trouble in setting java environment path on ubuntu libjvm.so cannot open shared object file no such file or directory so you would have to have a system administrator install rjava for you then set your environment variables and of course set your own .libpaths in r such as to find rjava
i ran into the same problem trying to install.packages rjava in r version 3.0.2 as long as i tried to install as ordinary user linux debian

21372046
vbscript	jscript
jscript language is similar to vbscript but have an advantage in this case the jscript code can be placed inside the batch file itself via a very simple trick
this way it is not necessary to create a separated file with the jscript code in this case the original vbscript code is so simple that the jscript translation is immediate

21372046
vbscript	jscript
this way it is not necessary to create a separated file with the jscript code in this case the original vbscript code is so simple that the jscript translation is immediate
just note that the uppercase letters are needed in jscript

21373799
textview	imageview
i m not sure how android chooses the drawable size when part of the textview so i m not sure if that will work
imageview imagebutton are the only views i am familiar with that give you scaling control

21375307
implements	extends
at the moment scala 2.11.0-m8 macro paradise 2.0.0-m3 macro annotations implements in macro pardise is the only macro flavor that doesn t typecheck macro arguments prior to expansion
there is also an experimental dsl-paradise proposal to extends scala with scope injection that would allow def macros to be not quite typed in a controlled manner but it s currently in the early implementation phase so it s not usable just yet

21376285
xsl-fo	xslt
split your enterprise of generating pdf in two parts transform your xml input to xsl-fo in a first step using an xslt stylesheet and in a second step render the result with an fo processor
pdf is not one of the standard output formats of xslt

21378307
super	implements
inside mainrequest string key string name constructor no need to use super constructor
you did not use default constructor mainrequest so it s jre s responsibility to provide super inside the parameterized constructor. you used serializable interface it has no abstruct method so while implements this interface no headache to define the abstruct methods of that interface

21383669
octal	decimal
here is an octal 0
in your second example the 0 is decimal not octal not that both are not equal

21385213
neo4j	titan
as i understand it neo4j does not support vertex-centric indices
you see this concept currently in titan orientdb and tinkergraph and rdf stores sort in this manner as well -- via spog pairings

21385884
prepare	execute
if you can create put index on user_id it seems you don t have any other parameter in where clause then the retrieval will be faster and then you can do if you have access to create procedures then you need not to manually write these query you can create dynamic sql string say final_sql and can run it prepare stmt from final_sql
execute stmt

21391556
client-side	server-side
you can kind of mix the two but need to keep in mind that the server-side components are just there to emit strings which will be part of the client-side output
so for example if you have a property on your model called model.someproperty then you can t use it directly in javascript like this alert model.someproperty or alert someproperty that s not using the razor view syntax to tell the view engine that there s server-side code here

21391556
client-side	server-side
this is syntactically client-side code and there is no model client-side
so you need to indicate that there s server-side pre-processing to do alert model.someproperty additionally if someproperty is a string then keep in mind that it s output isn t going to include quotes

21392480
super	self
your super invocation is wrong self should not be supplied again it s already injected by super
this way because you pass self as an extra argument to the exception constructor

21398843
jar	manifest.mf
if thats not enough for your needs there are several solutions which provide better usability executable jar files
basically by stating your main class in a manifest.mf entry the file becomes executable by double clicking on some platforms windows definitely the rest im not certain

21413233
aggregate-functions	sum
your aggregate-functions is computed just once along with any other aggregate-functions in a single pass
the sql engine doesn t compute sum weight twice just once

21413367
libstdc++	libc++
luckily cuda 5.5 supports clang and not only gcc apparently cuda 5.5 supports only the older libstdc++ library and not the more modern libc++ so update cuda_nvcc_flags to tell mvcc to pass tell the nativa compilar to use this older library
add -xcompiler -stdlib libstdc++

21413407

21413890
listview	gridview
while it s not clear from the question what the cursorloader and the resulting cursor are used for i assume the cursor is used in a cursoradapter for a listview or a similar widget. the widget registers its own contentobserver to the cursor and updates the views accordingly
so even if no new cursor is loaded a listview a gridview or any other widget attached to the cursor would still update android would call the newview bindview methods in a cursoradapter

21414229
interpolation	splines
if this still is not smooth enough for you will have to look into cubic splines interpolation or similar
mooseboys already posted a component-wise linear interpolation

21416808
ubuntu	linux
packaged in the repositories of ubuntu is version 1.4.3 of gpsbabel which might not read the file correctly
on the project page you will only find sources as download for linux

21419290
ftp	telnet
the ftp protocol is actually built on top of telnet if i remember correctly
if the application uses telnet for command and control then conceptually it does not not really belong in the data access layer

21420114
profiler	gprof
if you re looking for a profiler you want one that samples the entire call stack on wall-clock time not cpu time and reports the percent of time each line of code appears on those stacks. one such profiler is zoom . btw don t fall for the line that you need high-frequency samples to get accuracy . if you get 1000 samples that s way more than enough to see what s taking time. when i m tuning performance i use this method
quick point there as so many questions on so like this. first gprof is a cpu profiler . that means during io or any other blocking syscall it is shut off . your program could run for 100 seconds spending 99 seconds on io and gprof will act as though it only spent 1 second

21427699
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome on ios doesn t support speech recognition at the moment
google have to use ios uiwebview that mean there is no special web interpretation feature that are not supported on safari

21428041
spaces	delimiter
if you run the following code to see what exactly is stored in vars vars_l macros you see the following in the log in r the equvialent would be the following the second vars_l macro assignment is just adding lag_ to the begining of each spaces delimiter value in vars macro variable
since the first value does not begin with a spaces if you omit the lag_ at the begining of you will get the following stored in vars_l date lag_id lag_sales lag_units from the code i can see there are no variables created just yet but you should find a data step later on which does that

21432511
division	exponent
even without those tricks newton raphson division is still not bad with the linear approximation it takes only 4 refinements for double-precision floats but it also takes some annoying exponent adjustments to get in the right range first in hardware that wouldn t be half as annoying
goldschmidt division is afaik roughly equivalent in performance and might have a slightly less complex implementation

21436055
spaces	linefeed
this might not be the cause but do not split by spaces
you may have tabs or linefeed characters and or leading and trailing spaces

21436607
profiling	debugging
after the issue is fixed the provision profiling for debugging is reset to none again not sure why xcode would do that though
based on my current search the error failed to get the task for process at xcode 5 could happen for multiple reasons one is that we are debugging an application which is signed with distribution ad-hoc provision profiling

21436607
profiling	debugging
based on my current search the error failed to get the task for process at xcode 5 could happen for multiple reasons one is that we are debugging an application which is signed with distribution ad-hoc provision profiling
another reason is that somehow xcode5 could not find the correct development provision profiling although the coding signing identity has the developer signing identity there

21437523
realloc	malloc
realloc attempts to extend your available memory range if sufficient memory is available behind it on the heap
if not then it is equivalent to malloc a block of the new size memcpy your contents there free the old block

21441333
ssms	sqlcmd
you need to make sure bcp has the same database context as ssms
for most queries you can do this simply by saying you may also need to ensure the correct database context by passing in the -d argument as you need to do when using for xml with sqlcmd as you discovered in this answer though i couldn t reproduce that either with the 2012 tools bcp your query with db prefixes queryout file -c -t -sserver -t -ddatabase see the full syntax and argument list in the documentation . you also need to make sure you are using the right copy of bcp

21445118
awt	swing
you immediate problem is you are mixing heavy weight awt components with light weight swing components.
button is a native component meaning that it s painting is out side the control of swing and therefore is not affected by it

21449325
email	dkim
domains that want to reliably send email should have dkim and spf set in their dns configuration
this is needed to that you email does not get marked as spam

21452931
jar	manifest.mf
when passing on the executable project make sure you include the jar and the sub-folder
the error means that one of the jar files on the classpath contains a manifest.mf with an entry for com microsoft sqlserver jdbc sqlserverexception.class and the sha1 checksum in there doesn t match

21454690
apache	nginx
now i m also unsure of your second regex why not using or so there s maybe something i do not see even in your apache rewrites
usually rewrites are better managed in nginx using nginx way of thinking

21459573
uinavigationbar	uitabbaritem
the solution is to use uibarbuttonitem method initwithcustomview but that only works for a uinavigationbar because it takes uibarbuttonitem
uitabbar on the other hand only takes uitabbaritem which doesn t comply with the initwithcustomview

21460181
prepare	execute
however you could use a prepare statement for efficiency reasons
this way the statement is parsed only once and not every time it s execute

21460724
implements	extends
my suggestion since listactivity only makes it slightly easier to work with lists not that much easier you can just skip it and implements the code related to the list on your own and that way you can just extends mainactivity
in java you can t extends multiple classes and for a good reason

21460969
udp	tcp
the decision of udp vs tcp depends on your messages whether or not they need to be reliably delivered etc
for pure tcp each peer would have a tcp socket on which each process accepts connections from other peers and each accept would result in a new socket

21461915
listview	gridview
since you say listviewitem i will assume this is for a listview
if however you intended to mean gridview then what you are asking is not possible in a practical sense

21462092
g++	gcc
g++ appears to be not installed
find how to install gcc in your os

21463538
noexcept	throw
yes in order to get whatever the assumed optimizations are of noexcept
let s assume that noexcept does make meaningful code-generation optimizations possible ok assuming such functions are actually inlined this would seem to require that compilers generate the equivalent of a try block around the code resulting from the inline function at the call site because if an exception arises in that region not necessarily because it might be that the compiler can look at the function body and see that it cannot possibly throw anything

21463565
tabcontrol	tabitem
styles are of type tabcontrol so it can be applied on tabcontrol and not on tabitem
apply the style on tabcontrol using staticresource markup extension if you want to apply tabitem style which is present in searchresultstab resource section you need to move that style to resourcedictionary

21472927
uilabel	uibutton
why don t you use uibutton instead of uilabel
uibutton has property to align the text vertically while uilabel doesn t

21472927
uilabel	uibutton
uibutton has property to align the text vertically while uilabel doesn t
use uibutton with

21473405
udp	tcp
ospf does not use a tcp ip transport protocol udp tcp but is encapsulated directly in ip datagrams with protocol number 89
you need to check the protocol type in the packet and if it is tcp or udp then use the dport

21474463
firefox	safari
update this method may helps but it only works in firefox
chrome safari ie are not supported

21477166
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
afhttprequestoperationmanager uses the old nsurlconnection so that doesn t facilitate background downloading
afurlsessionmanager uses nsurlsession under the hood so that does

21482798
.htaccess	httpd.conf
first make sure you enabled mod_rewrite in httpd.conf to do so add make sure it exsits this line loadmodule rewrite_module modules mod_rewrite.so then create .htaccess in your codeigniter root folder next to index.php file not application folder
.htaccess codeigniter take care of all routings for you

21482798
laravel	codeigniter
so for u can access it by its not like laravel you need to specifically add route
codeigniter automatically fitch controller for you

21483641
portrait	landscape
many android devices if the device is held in portrait when a picture is taken do not rotate the image to be portrait
rather they store the image in landscape and put an exif header in the image to tell any image viewer hey

21484932
mdpi	hdpi
on mdpi hdpi devices the vm in which your app run will only have a smaller amount of heap memory available and you might run into out of memory exceptions much more frequently if you only load high quality images
the quality of the image might not be as good on mdpi hdpi devices because of the resizing

21484994
stateless	stateful
i think it has to do with the fact that the sessionscoped annotation is meant to be used only in a web context otherwise like in your your second case it doesn t make sense and you should assume that it will be ignored and your stateful ejb will behave like an old regular stateful ejb and in general you shouldn t inject stateful resources into stateless ones because usually the results are unpredictable and dependent on the container implementation
having said that servlets are stateless components and the container is not required by the spec to create one instance per request or session from the servlet 3.0 spec sec

21485830
client-side	server-side
note that the client-side vs
server-side argument may not apply here

21490687
rdf	owl
this arises from the fact that rdf at least in the current versions
i ve heard that there s talk of changing this though i don t know how whether the change would ripple out to owl does not allow literal values as the subjects of triples

21491182
profiling	debugging
right-click on the project and in the build section remove flag from define debugging constant . this flag should be removed only for the release built profiling and set for the debugging built profiling
when you choose start without debugging you are not telling to built for release but just to not attach the debugger to the process

21496904
move	drag
2 after attaching the eventhandler the scrollbar will not move any more because the event handler consuming the scrollevent
the scrollbar will not move by mouse wheel but it will scroll by mouse drag on it

21496996
cvs	svn
cvs is based on rcs files of versions control while svn is a relational database berkleydb
cvs supports rollback commit feature while svn not you need to commit a second time and overwrite your previous commit manual rollback

21496996
cvs	svn
cvs supports rollback commit feature while svn not you need to commit a second time and overwrite your previous commit manual rollback
cvs only tracks modification file by file while svn tracks a whole commit as a new revision which means that it is easier to follow the history of your project

21497267
openmpi	mpich
but the next error message -------------------------------------------------------------------------- mpirun noticed that the job aborted but has no info as to the process that caused that situation. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- is in the error format used by the openrte framework of openmpi
therefore mpirun comes from openmpi and not from mpich

21497267
openmpi	mpich
therefore mpirun comes from openmpi and not from mpich
this could happen if you have installed a development package for mpich so that it provides mpicc mpif90 and so on but then you ve installed a run-time package for openmpi

21497841
des	aes
indirectly you should not use des anymore
instead look into password based encryption aes cbc and key wrapping

21499145
super	self	super	implements
for any custom methods super class self .other_method will most likely fail because object simply doesn t implements that method
using super a self .__init__ is just fine

21499145
super	self
and for most methods other than __init__ super in a class derived directly from object may also not work because object does not have the specific method you are trying to call
thus using super class self .__init__ with anything other than an empty argument list requires more intimate knowledge of your class hierarchy where any classes deriving directly from object should take care not to pass on arguments

21503719
build.gradle	gradlew
not in the ide make sure your minsdkversion targetsdkversion compilesdkversion buildtoolsversion are the same in build.gradle in your project directory and in your library directory
make sure that in your androidmanifest.xml in your project and library directory has the same minsdkversion and targetsdkversion like above in your main project directory open settings.gradle then type your library directory name include actionbarsherlock if you put it in libs folder then it will be include libs actionbarsherlock build clean project build make project then run your project if you imported a library project with a sample project and it doesn t work do the same steps and also open gradlew wrapper gradle-wrapper.properties and change distributionurl to the latest gradlew version

21504010
oncreate	findviewbyid
in oncreate method you could see if you are using multi pane layout or not. if your secod pane in bigger layout is for example r.id.right_panel
you just make findviewbyid r.id.right_panel and if this is null you know that you are not running multi pane

21505077
octal	binary	octal	decimal
because putting a 0 before a number turns it into an octal representation not binary
so for example 011 is octal for decimal 9 which is what s printed

21511604
laravel	codeigniter
tutorial wise i can point you at this list of nettuts tutorials as long as you stick with ones that cover laravel 4 you should be fine and the official documentation which is extremely good
it looks like codeigniter 2.0 was released in january 2011 nearly a year afterwards so it may not work

21512201
bash	subshell
when you execute a script as bash . file.bash or else . file1.bash running a shell script like this launches a new process a subshell
all the variables created in a subshell are not visible outside the block of code in the subshell

21515536
inline	inlining
if you compile in release mode inspect the assembly s il and find that s not the case then you can add the inline keyword to the function definitions to force them to be inline
best not to do force inlining unless you benchmark and are certain it offers a real performance gain. one tip unrelated to your question about the optional arguments -- consider re-defining at least some of your types as structs rather than f# records

21517160
express	node.js
there are common modules for common tasks such as express connect but in the end it s up to you
require is part of the node.js api and doesn t work in a browser

21524391
viewdidload	viewdidappear
first of all i m not clear why you are creating another view controller within viewdidload of a controller and adding the subview to that
instead of try this if presenting the controller in viewdidload gives some problem then do it in viewdidappear

21529737
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can use the allow from directive in conjunction with your http authentication directives in your httpd.conf file or .htaccess to specify a range of ip addreses for which http authentication will not be required
see .htaccess .htpasswd bypass if at a certain ip address for more info

21530830
backgrounding	multitasking
see executing a finite-length task in the backgrounding discussion in the app states and multitasking section of the ios app programming guide
this isn t quite as robust as the new backgrounding nsurlsession functionality which is more clever about applying discretionary logic so your app doesn t significantly adversely affect foreground apps controlling whether it s permissible to do the upload over cell connection allowing longer-length requests working even if your app was terminated for example due to memory pressure etc.

21532000
hex	binary
for example with mysql i suggest you a prepared statement another solution could be to encode your encrypted binary data in hex or base64
if you are working with binary data you must not use str functions but mem functions like memcpy 3 in your case

21533098
ssl	https
arr01 - ssl certificate - arr02 - ssl certificate -- visitors will see this ssl certificate in their browser |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| content01 - wildcard ssl certificate - content02 - wildcard ssl certificate -- this certificate remains hidden and thus can be a shared single wildcard cert
some applications are programmed to detect whether or not you are using https and since the actual web server is handling an http request with your offloading enabled it will think the request is not secure and often end up in a redirect loop

21533223
mdpi	hdpi
as you can see it is 160 dpi corresponds to mdpi not hdpi 240 dpi
and mdpi is considered normal so the scale is 1.0

21534802
strcpy	strncpy
in this case you should just do a strcpy
a strncpy doesn t really do anything for you if you re giving it the length of the source string unless you re intentionally trying to avoid copying the null terminator

21537861
super	implements
if you do implements dealloc do not call super as you do when not using arc
in arc you do not need to implements dealloc other than to release resources managed outside of arc retained properties are managed by arc

21539857
set	bag
the advantage to this is that set s are quickly accessible and will only allow unique values so your list of unique values will not grow at the same rate as your values in the column unless all the values are unique
i personally would store a bag set in java of the column s values

21539904
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome beats firefox hands-down in the performance department
furthermore it s really easy to write slow javascript code so if you run into problems it s important to use the profiler the one included with google-chrome is great to pinpoint exactly where the app is spending most of its time it may not be cesium

21540454
afnetworking	sdwebimage
sdwebimage offers disk and memory caching and gives you much more control over the details than afnetworking s uiimageview+afnetworking
afnetworking s image cache uses nscache which clears on system-wide memory pressure but not an individual app s memory warning

21540637
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition
for instance for 10000 elements i get sequential multiplying 23192.236 ns sequential lookup 12701.695 ns random order multiplying 24459.697 ns random order lookup 31595.523 ns so array lookup is not faster than multiplication unless the access pattern is nearly sequential and the lookup array small
in any case my measurements indicate that a multiplication and addition takes merely 4 processor cycles 2.3 ns per loop iteration on a 2ghz cpu

21542034
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller
at best you can create your own custom uinavigationbar subclass and set it to your uinavigationcontroller via interface builder storyboard as described here external website ios dev notes
hacking together a combined uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller by dragging in a uinavigationbar and uitabbar into a uiviewcontroller doesn t work in ios 7 since ios 7 uses overlapping translucent ui elements whose overlaps can t be set well programmatically the extension of the navigation bar behind the status bar

21542034
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller
hacking together a combined uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller by dragging in a uinavigationbar and uitabbar into a uiviewcontroller doesn t work in ios 7 since ios 7 uses overlapping translucent ui elements whose overlaps can t be set well programmatically the extension of the navigation bar behind the status bar
embedding a uitabbarcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller works but is explicitly discouraged forbidden by apple s documentation

21554947
daemons	systemd
stop your daemons from forking
daemons do not need to and should not fork to run in a child process be they running under daemontools daemontools-encore runit s6 perp or even systemd

21556168
strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	memmove
since your code does not send the null at the end of the null-terminated string the receiving code does not get a null so you cannot use strcpy reliably on the received data
use memmove or memcpy or perhaps strncpy and then null terminate

21557089
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
it works great on mac systems using firefox or google-chrome
safari doesn t support webrtc yet

21558737
ssms	sqlcmd
c program files microsoft sql server 110 dts binn isdeploymentwizard.exe silent sourcepath c dropbox presentations ssisdb lifecycle lifecycle lifecycle bin development lifecycle.ispac destinationserver localhost dev2012 destinationpath ssisdb folder lifecycle tsql you can deploy an ispac to sql server through sql server management studio ssms or through the command line sqlcmd.exe
while sqlcmd is not strictly required it simplifies the script

21561746
implements	extends
they behave exactly the way abstract-class do with the exceptions that you reference them differently implements rather than extends and that you re allowed to inherit as many interfaces as you like but can only have one superclass abstract or not
as with other inheritance if all you know about an object is that it implements an interface then you can only access it through that interface

21562603
serializable	deserialization
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

21563301
persistent	transient
use the right configuration name when adding the persistent store and new objects will go to the appropriate store
if the data that shouldn t sync is really transient consider using nsinmemorystoretype when setting up the non-syncing persistent store

21564994
profiler	gprof
in the first place gprof is a cpu profiler . that means during io mutex paging or any other blocking system calls it is shut off and doesn t count that time. you say you re doing nothing of the sort but it could be happening deep inside some library function. if it were gprof masks it. on the other hand a single stack sample will show what it is waiting for with probability equal to the fraction of time it is waiting
second as keshlam said it s important to understand about self time . if it s high that means the program counter was found in that routine a good percent of the cpu time. however if it s low that does not mean the function isn t guilty. the function could be spending lots of time but doing it by calling subfunctions. to see that you need the gprof total column but as a percent of total time not as an absolute time per call which is what it is giving you. if you take a stack sample then any routine will appear on it with probability equal to the fraction of time it is spending. what s more you will know exactly why that time is being spent because the sample will show you the precise line numbers where the calls occur

21566021
single-quotes	double-quotes
you put the variable inside single-quotes so it will use the literal string text not the value of a variable text
you could use double-quotes to ensure the variable is expanded or else just don t put it in quotes at all for this case

21566272
udp	tcp
this should be fairly small and is likely outside of your control network delays - this is where you can help probably a lot depending on your network configuration you can t change the physics of the situation when it comes to the distance between two peers but there are a lot of network characteristics that can change the actual latency direct path - if for any reason you are using a relay server then your latency will suffer potentially a lot because every packet doesn t travel directly it takes a detour via the relay server size of pipe - trying to cram high resolution video down a small pipe can work but getting big intra-frames down a tiny pipe can add some extra delays tcp - if udp is disabled falling back to tcp can have a pretty dire impact on latency mainly due to a special exposure to packet loss which requires retransmissions and causes subsequent packets to be delayed until the retransmission completes this is called head of line blocking
this can also happen in certain perverse nat scenarios even if udp is enabled in theory though most likely this will result in a relay server being used larger network issues - maybe your peers are on different isps and those isps have poor peering arrangements so that packets take a suboptimal route between peers

21566682
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
all you need do is to read the documentation the behavior is undefined if ptr does not match a pointer returned earlier by malloc calloc or realloc
also the behavior is undefined if the memory area referred to by ptr has already been deallocated that is free or realloc has already been called with ptr as the argument and no calls to malloc calloc or realloc resulted in a pointer equal to ptr afterwards

21568349
dictionary	map
a more straightforward way to do this is create an empty dictionary hash map keyed by word
the value is the count. for each file while not end of file read word if word in dictionary update count else if dictionary full sort dictionary by word output dictionary to temporary file clear dictionary add word to dictionary with count 1 end end if dictionary not empty sort dictionary by word output dictionary to temporary file you now have some number of temporary files each sorted by word and containing one word count pair per line

21568682
client-side	server-side
they may have done this so they can reference the cache of the page without the query string since the campaign variables are read client-side not server-side by analytics provider
therefore ignoring these variables server-side would ostensibly have no effect and it would improve performance for sites making heavy use of inbound google analytics tracking

21570895
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable always returns all data it just doesn t force the provider of the data to hold it all in memory
you have to use iqueryable if you want to provider to return pieces of data

21572011
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and safari the height of non flex children are not recognized in percentages
however firefox and ie recognize and scale the children based on percentage heights

21572400
subtract	addition
so here comes the twist these numbers can be instructions or data. your processor reads these numbers and interprets them as instructions example the start address is 0 in 0 is a instruction like read value from address 120 into the alu math-unit then it steps to address 1 read value from address 121 into alu then it steps to address 2 subtract numbers in alu then it steps to address 3 if alu-value is smaller than zero go to address 10 it is not smaller than zero so it steps to address 4 go to address 20 you see that this is a basic if a b you can write these instructions as numbers and they can be run by your processor but because nobody wants to do this work that was what they did with punchcards in the 60s assembler was invented... that looks like add 10 11 20 load var from address 10 and 11
run addition and store into address 20 in conclusion assembler processor instructions can be called binary because it s stored in plain numbers but everything else can be a binary file too

21573332
unixodbc	iodbc
how do you know you are looking at the right odbc ini files - run odbcinst -j to check the locations unixodbc is using
i know where that odbc data sources section comes from iodbc but it not at all necessary for unixodbc - just delete the first 2 lines of your odbc.ini file

21575256
matlab	simulink
if it turns out that it s not reliable enough you could either try doing the data acquisition in another faster way in c maybe in a separate process then calling that from matlab via mex perhaps with some sort of buffering to smooth things out
turning to some the other mathworks products simulink simulink coder some of the system toolboxes that are designed for developing properly real time systems

21575595
client-side	server-side
the problem is you re commenting out the client-side javascript which is going to be run on the browser
but the server-side javascript code within # javascript which needs to run on the server is not commented out

21577687
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
although format does not limit it and host names are case-insensitive it is recommended that url should be case-sensitive
for example the w3 states urls in general are case-sensitive with the exception of machine names

21580228
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in opera it works on table elements but doesn t seem to hide a if it is adjacent to a visible
according to the mozilla developer network it has the following browser support google-chrome firefox internet explorer opera safari 1.0 1.0 4.0 4.0 1.0 with the following exceptions for tables support for visibility collapse on table elements varies

21584504
consistency	acid
it does not guarantee isolation consistency or durability
acid atomicity consistency isolation durability properties are used to describe such behaviour in databases

21590261
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is subtracting the 4em padding from the height automatically which is redundant when you set the height to 100 - 4em
firefox on the other hand doesn t do this

21591199
implements	extends
you can see some examples of this implements in the moodle mobile app user dev if these satisfy your requirements then yes web services should be sufficient as they are
if they do not then you can extends the web services as a local plugin to provide richer functionality which would be limited by your development capacity rather than the system itself

21593052
stateless	stateful
properly designed cloud applications need to be essentially stateless
introducing any local stateful storage a designated place to hold the truth that is not distributed and discrete is a scary prospect from an architecture standpoint

21595149
hash-collision	key
most likely because another entry has the same hash hash-collision
if the slot is occupied cpython and even pypy compares the hash and the key by compare i mean comparison not the is comparison of the entry in the slot against the key of the current entry to be inserted dictobject.c 337 344-345

21596254
multiplying	multiplication
your problem has nothing to do with generics but with basic c# casting priority you do not multiplying int but t - and t being a generic type you can only use methods that are ddefined in your generics contraint which you have none so no multiplying on it
basically in your code you deal with t in the multiplication here i deal with int32

21596694
uicollectionview	uitableview
try using an uicollectionview instead
you cannot use a uitableview for creating columns

21599663
noexcept	throw
on the other hand noexcept marks the method as a method that doesn t throw exceptions
any throw exception will call std terminate see except.terminate 2 in c++ standard

21599663
noexcept	throw
next example terminates with terminate called after throw an instance of int aborted core dumped to conclude the behavior is quite different when you use -fno-exceptions and when you mark the function as noexcept
when you use that option the functions are not automatically marked as noexcept

21599738
d3.js	leaflet
whilst this is not as customisable as d3.js you could always edit the leaflet src code to alter the transition duration
leaflet geojson vector layers l.geojson will not need to be updated on a leaflet map event in update as they are already added to the map as svg and handled by leaflet

21600600
portrait	landscape
when it s the first item the app launch in portrait mode and find the image
after having tried several solutions found here i suspected that the iphone was trying to launch in landscape orientation and thus not finding any corresponding launch image

21602371
nfa	dfa
however since the standard doesn t mandate such implementation as long as the result is correct match the left-most longest string the implementation can exhaustively search for all strings that matches the regex on an nfa backtracking engine
however at least gnu egrep seems to implements posix ere with dfa based on the file name dfa.c

21603707
build.gradle	gradlew
ie given the following build.gradle then running gradlew sometask sometask gives the output
not sure if it s what you want but you can get the tasknames that were used when gradlew was called by accessing the project.gradle object

21604088
octal	hex
the differences being decimal no prefix hexadecimal prefix 0x and octal prefix 0
thus is really just oh and the fact that ff is also on hex form doesn t matter at all it s just a method parameter and might as well be called steven .

21604190
octal	binary
for a computer it doesn t matter how numbers are presented to you be it decimal base 10 as we re naturally familiar with hexadecimal base 16 octal base 8 binary base 2 you name it though in java only octal decimal and hexadecimal are possible out of the box
internally they are all stored as binary numbers that s a series of zeros and ones

21604268
super	implements
if the two types are not same then the common super type is inferred
also from the comments from marko if suppose your classes also implements serializable then the type parameter would have been inferred as and then again that will fail as is not super type of where t2 has above two bounds

21606250
mongodb	bson
using bson instead json will unlikely help with mongodb because it already uses bson everywhere
mongodb is not tied to human readable json

21606250
mongodb	bson
mongodb is not tied to human readable json
see documents section in documentation document format mongodb stores documents on disk in the bson serialization format

21609757
build.gradle	gradlew
it s not the presence of the build.gradle file that makes it gradle-based but it s how the project was set up in the first place
you ll need to re-import your project to finish the conversion to gradlew

21613883
ssl	https
it may be that your libcurl is not built against an ssl library or if it is that the ssl library is not installed
finally on this page you will note that is a simple https example second one down

21615168
comparator	comparable
you need to call the comparator method which will indicate the result of the comparison by returning an integer less than greater than or equals to 0
comparable doesn t let you use or to compare just like list and map don t let you use for item access

21622269
vim	sublimetext
if you only want an usable and powerful text editor right now don t bother with vim and use sublimetext
spf13 is not a full vim distribution it s a collection of plugins and settings designed to make you feel comfortable and prevent you from actually learning to use vim

21622319
inline	inlining
and even though islatin1 is declared inline it seems that these methods are compiled with call statements rather than the code inline
perhaps that s because they calls occur in the same unit or the same type and the inline engine is not capable of inlining

21627883
bmp	tga
it will not be the same as a bmp format so for each case you have read a documentation for that file
for example for a tga file format you can find some info here

21628442
rsa	aes
if you still want to use asymmetric encryption then encrypt aes tripple-des key which is shorter than 128 bytes with rsa at the end of the process
rsa cannot encrypt data longer than modulus of rsa key

21629338
realloc	malloc
however you cannot use realloc on something you created with new
it must have been allocated with malloc and friends

21630455
libstdc++	libc++
if that is not an option use 0.8.1 version of cedar i believe it uses libstdc++
it is probably because your app is now linked with libc++ whereas your internal library is linked with libstdc++

21630861
octal	binary
due to the leading 0 that s read as a very large octal literal which is probably not what you want
amazingly c doesn t have binary literals

21633735
thin	unicorn	unicorn	webrick
so unicorn is ok but thin and webrick are not mmmm
my guess is that the working directory used by the daemon process for thin and webrick is not rails.root

21634253
tortoisegit	svn
see here for some screenshots of tortoisegit
creating the git repo in the same place as the svn is not a good idea

21634803
firefox	safari
i m not seeing the transform on firefox at all so i can t tell if it is an issue on that browser as well
i m not seeing it on the most recent versions of chrome or safari or firefox

21636089
flask	web2py
web2py does not work the same as flask so you re probably going to have to look through the web2py documentation to understand how to use it
web2py doesn t have an exact analog to flask s app.config

21636089
flask	web2py
web2py doesn t have an exact analog to flask s app.config
as for the redirect function note that routing works differently in web2py

21636815
libstdc++	libc++
libstdc++ doesn t implement the template specializations yet even though it supports char16_t and char32_t as real types
the most complete implementation i know of is libc++ with a suitable compiler gcc or clang but even that is still missing the header

21638584
s-function	simulink
instead of your dll you will use c++ s-function as the interface between simulink and your exe
i am not addressing the dll error but your original problem of running the exe from simulink

21639124
ansible	puppet
yeah that s one of the shortcomings of ansible to say compared to puppet
puppet is declarative and doesn t error out like ansible or chef for that matter

21639124
ansible	puppet
puppet is declarative and doesn t error out like ansible or chef for that matter
it has its positives and negatives for example puppet takes a little bit of time before it starts running because it needs to compile its catalog

21641086
bottle	flask
there are definitely ways to accomplish your goal of having bottle use ssl + ad on windows
ssl with bottle bottle on cherrypy server + ssl python with ad as well as information on windows specifically authenticating against active directory using python + ldap if you wanted to use session management for authentication you could pair the ad with bottle middleware such as beaker bottle hooks with beaker session middleware and checking logins bottle itself does not have built in abilities to deal with ssl that i know of like flask

21641337
ioexception	filewriter
checking the documentation you can find out that who throws ioexception is actually the filewriter constructor
throws ioexception - if the named file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file does not exist but cannot be created or cannot be opened for any other reason so this is probably your problem

21641337
ioexception	filewriter
throws ioexception - if the named file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file does not exist but cannot be created or cannot be opened for any other reason so this is probably your problem
if not you can simply try to create it like this you don t need the filewriter part i ve tested both ways in my computer and it works

21642150
bash	zsh
what likely happened was that he she tried to run the above zsh -specific code using a different shell resulting in the bad substitution error - bash would give that error for instance
when run with zsh the above code does work - it uses zsh s string-splitting flag to break the contents of into individual words - but it doesn t generalize well if the search strings had embedded spaces for instance the solution would break

21642315
hex	binary
you could search for a specific group by use the escaped prefixed with and in hex byte string but that isn t what the question asks
however binary filters don t support wildcard. an alternative is to request all groups and then unpack the objectsid for each group and then group by the rid after post processing however depending on the number of groups in your domain this may be too slow

21643391
addition	multiplication
it uses |0 after addition and math.imul for multiplication the output is 1921968083 identical to java
the |0 trick works well for most operations in javascript to simulate 32-bit ints but not for multiplication

21644068
express	node.js
i did not had any web.config for my express application and this is what i used
see windows azure websites is overriding my 404 and 500 error pages in my node.js app and both worked for me

21644141
ssl	https
if port numbers eg 443 for ssl are not reliable for your purpose you will have to examine the tcp payload to figure out if the packet uses ssl or tls
you will have to keep state and if you can see ssl tls handshake messages then you d know it is an https connection attempt

21645598
profiling	debugging
if you are running the vb profiling you will not see the save dump as menu item
to add this menu item select tools - customize select the commands tab select debugging from the menu bar dropdown click add command.

21648521
portrait	landscape
the above doesn t always work when switching portrait vs
landscape

21650620
innodb	myisam
2 be sure that you are using innodb or any other database engine that support transactions
for example myisam doesn t support transactions

21651782
queue	fifo
make sure you implement it like you would a bf search using a fifo queue
this means you will insert a node into the queue every time the distance to it is updated and only if it isn t already in the queue

21653102
daemons	systemd
-p tldr the solution is to combine systemd with on-the-fly iptables commands like this taken from dnschain here we accomplish the following the daemons listens on 5333 but connections are successfully accepted on 53 thanks to iptables we can include the commands in the unit file itself and thus we save people headaches
systemd cleans up the firewall rules for us making sure to remove them when the daemons isn t running

21653102
daemons	systemd
systemd cleans up the firewall rules for us making sure to remove them when the daemons isn t running
we never run as root and we make privilege escalation impossible at least systemd claims to supposedly even if the daemons is compromised and sets

21654179
multiplication	exponent
when performing the multiplication there s only a single rounding and it happens to give you the result you wanted
when performing the repeated addition there are 9 roundings taking place the first result a+a is always exactly representable but after that further additions are inexact since the base-2 exponent of the addends are not equal

21654334
realloc	strdup	realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
as pointed in comments this is also a bad approach because realloc is not guaranteed to return the same pointer value that is why the function will return the new pointer value and the original one will no longer be valid after its execution
it is not correct but may be corrected as follows all this is assuming that the str pointer is to already allocated memory with malloc calloc strdup

21657492
inline	inlining
the inline keyword itself is only a hint it does not obligate the compiler to do anything
the compiler performs its own optimization calculations on whether or not to inline a particular function that includes inlining functions not marked inline

21657492
inline	inlining
the compiler performs its own optimization calculations on whether or not to inline a particular function that includes inlining functions not marked inline
that typically means a sufficiently high optimization level -o3 and that the body of the inline function is visible in that particular compilation unit

21658001
n-gram	words
yet if you have a limited set of texts you need to work with word-level n-gram may not require so much storage
as for the issue of errors a sufficiently large words n-gram corpus will also include and represent them

21658651
ati	nvidia
after amd bought them it is much much better but the need of .net is silly but still no math to nvidia on opengl had seen something similar in past here on so ati shader had problems when camera was too close to cube it was shader and minecraft like cube world rendering i think try to change color rgb to rgba 4 values instead of 3 try use quads instead of triangles ati had problems with odd parameter size also sometimes help use uint instead of float sometimes help to use indices sometimes indices do problems instead try different driver version try non ati gfx for core 400 is nvidia the only option intel stops at 330 i think and all other vendors even before try to render with fixed pipeline no shaders if the problem is also there but your shaders are very basic so if the problem is there it is most likely a driver issue 2.make sure you do not have any memory leaks in your even unrelated code ati drivers are extremly sensitive to memory leaks even minor ones have not a clue why usually solving memory leaks get rid of very many issues
do not see anything wrong at first look 1.may be some ati driver related issue ati has many bugs inside their drivers since ever.

21658665
knitr	latex
i would probably just tell knitr to issue numbers wrapped inside a macro and then do the conversion with this macro untested and requires the package siunitx
here s essentially the same as mark s answer but quite a bit more concise although if you re using knitr with latex this is arguably a task for latex not for r r provides the raw data latex is in charge of formatting

21659020
comparator	comparable
you have really made a big flaw with your comparator method used to implement natural ordering.let me paste the code and then point out its flaws - violations in our comparable s comparator method - 1 the implementor must ensure sgn x.compareto y -sgn y.compareto x for all x and y
this implies that x.compareto y must throw an exception iff y.compareto x throws an exception. your above code will allow multiple null values as it returns 1 instead of throwing npe 2 treeset is self balancing tree.what that means is that what you consider objects as equals may not be used by treeset for comparing as it keeps on adding objects.treeset will traverse the tree in a specific order as defined by comparable or comparator and keep traversing between the nodes according to the value returned by comparator -1 0 1 .hence it is highly possible that your equal objects are not even encountered for comparison while adding an element.note treeset is not a ordinary sequential traversal like a list or an array but a tree traversal

21660919
factors	matrix
a data.frame is a more appropriate structure to hold your data if each column is a different type of data numeric character factors and so on
however converting a matrix to a data.frame does not take care of the conversion of columns for you automatically

21661547
debian	linux
others.cu main.cpp this particular answer shows that compiling with an officially supported gcc version as robert crovella stated correctly should work out at least for c++11 code in the main.cpp file tested on debian 8 with nvcc 5.5 and gcc 4.7.3
to answer your underlying question i am not aware that one can use c++11 in .cu files with cuda 5.5 in linux and i was not aware the shown example with host-side c++11 gets properly de-cluttered under msvc

21661920
postgresql	mysql
current versions of mysql has not good planner as postgresql has there is progress - so complex queries are usually much better on postgresql - and really simple queries are better on mysql
complexity of postgresql configuration is myth

21662298
google-chrome	firefox
actually i tested it on google-chrome 32 it worked fine and firefox 26 no luck
i tried enabling geolocation on firefox but still doesn t work

21665130
onclick	onchange
depending on what version of jquery you are using the onclick event will fire and process before the value of the checkbox has actually changed
i would suggest using an onchange event instead of onclick as this will ensure that the event will not run until after the checkbox has checked or unchecked

21665855
floating-point	fixed-point
you should try a format like rgba 10 10 10 2 fixed-point or rgb 11 11 10 floating-point to store your normals if rgba8 is actually inadequate and then with the space you saved you could afford a 32-bit floating-point depth buffer
as it stands right now you are not actually using a floating-point depth buffer in the first place

21665855
floating-point	fixed-point
right off the bat by using a floating-point format to store your depth you lose 1-bit of precision because it has to store a rather meaningless sign bit fixed-point depth buffers do not
also since depth values are already in the range 0-1 generally the enhanced range of a floating-point number really does not apply

21667265
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort is very often implemented with a randomized pivot so it s not always deterministic
merge sort and heapsort are the archetypal o nlogn examples and are deterministic

21668212
implements	extends
an abstract-class may not implements methods but they can and if you extends from an abstract-class you must implements all methods of superclass otherwise the new class must be abstract as well i think you ve misread
an abstract-class does implements methods you just don t get to use those methods until you extends the abstract-class into a concrete class

21669864
google-chrome	firefox
simple webkit browser google-chrome on windows specific solution the following solution is webkit specific here is the fiddle for it
warning this will not work on browsers who have a rendering engine other than webkit firefox or internet explorer or obsolete versions of opera that had blink presto

21669864
opera	safari	firefox	safari
warning this will not work on browsers who have a rendering engine other than webkit firefox or internet explorer or obsolete versions of opera that had blink presto
this may not work with implementations of webkit browsers in operating systems other than windows safari on macos

21671858
cpython	pypy
the _bitarray module looks like a cpython extension which is written directly in c . cpython extension modules does not work directly in pypy without any changes
you either need to install pypy compatible version of the module or do the required changes manually

21673087
floating-point	fractions
to avoid the problem use the constructor bigdecimal string val instead as timb points out if you already have a double value you can also use also here is the mandatory reference to what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic
most finite decimal fractions cannot be exactly represented by floating-point so that is the approximation you get when you create the floating-point literal 0.0077

21673118
realloc	malloc
any bytes in the new object beyond the size of the old object have indeterminate values. 3 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

21673333
super	extends
it actually doesn t have one also you must call super as the first line of your constructor and by convention you should name your classes with an uppercase character
but because the class you are extends is object you actually don t need to call super

21674536
uilabel	uibutton
to show answer use uilabel over uiview for uipangesturerecognizer tutorial final code
download code i guess you can use uipangesturerecognizer but try it with the uiview not with uibutton so that you use core graphics for filling draw out the color according to the movement of the finger

21675335
google-chrome	firefox
i know that google-chrome and ie11 support opening websocket connections from dedicated web workers
firefox does not currently

21681883
innodb	myisam
your remote table is a myisam table while your local table is innodb
the myisam table engine does not support transactions

21682486
hex	binary
it can be represented as hex but that s not part of the value
100 decimal is the same thing as 64 in hex and 1100100 in binary

21683179
prepare	execute
this needs that your prepare statements instead of running them directly change your where clause then bind the value to your statement and execute it or you can execute it directly with an array of values otherwise i m not very sure what your code should be doing so i can t really tell if it will but if your sql worked before using pdo it should work now too
for your code to be prone to sql injection one of the values in your query must have a way to come from user-input and it must be passed as-is to pdo s prepare

21683536
cdr	cons
for instance and note that we re not quoting the pair anymore because modifying literal data is undefined behavior let x cons 1 2 setf cdr x cons cdr x nil x that could also be let x cons 1 2 setf cdr x list cdr x x you could also use rplacd let x cons 1 2 rplacd x list cdr x x
a cons cell is a structure that has two parts called its car and its cdr

21684399
onresume	onpause
there are two somewhat independent things going on application oncreate onresume onpause surface created changed destroyed when the activity starts you get callbacks in this order oncreate onresume surfacecreated surfacechanged if you hit back you get onpause surfacedestroyed called just before the surface goes away if you rotate the screen the activity is torn down and recreate so you get the full cycle
you can tell it s a quick restart by checking isfinishing . it might be possible to start stop an activity so quickly that surfacecreated might happen after onpause but i m not sure about that

exponent	modulo
the public key is not just the modulo and the private key is not the exponent
the public key is comprised of the modulo and the public exponent the exponent property of the rsaparameters type and the private key is the modulo and the private exponent the d property of the rsaparameters type

21689422
spaces	delimiter
a comma is not a white spaces and 2 is not a valid double
the explanation is in the second sentence of the scanner javadoc a scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern which by default matches whitespace

21691233
shadowing	named
anyway the declaration of the local variable is shadowing the global snake constructor reference and snake is undefined when you try to call it
use a different variable named - usually instance named are lowercased use a local variable var i .length is indeed not a function it is a plain numeric property

opera	google-chrome
the setting is at opera flags #activation-order-tab-cycling needs restarting the browser
all ctrl-tab mru options i have seen on google-chrome feel like hacks do not work reliably

21701294
qlineedit	qlabel
according to the qt documentation qlineedit text function doesn t accept any argument but returns a value
in the same way qlabel settext does not accept integer as an argument but qstring

21703771
equals	gethashcode
in vb properties without the key modifier are mutable and are not used in the equals gethashcode implementations
from the anonymous type definition documentation if an anonymous type declaration contains at least one key property the type definition overrides three members inherited from object equals gethashcode and tostring

21704371
backtracking	greedy
since the regex is written so that there is no needs for backtracking all quantifiers are made possessive
since pattern class implements possessive quantifier with a loop instead of recursion as the case with greedy lazy quantifiers stackoverflowerror will not occur

21706900
implements	extends
so say your interface i has a method m now aclazz implements i and concreteclazz extends aclazz
that means that concreteclazz also implements i whether or not you say so explicitly in the class declaration of concreteclazz

21707183
gridbaglayout	miglayout
miglayout is another nice layout and it s easier to pick up than gridbaglayout but it also is not perfect or at least it wasn t a couple years ago when i last used it
when i ve used it to lay out more complex panels by hand it was at least as verbose as gridbaglayout

21707450
mdpi	hdpi
now your mdpi graphics should really be saved at 160 dpi not 72 dpi
and ldpi at 120 dpi and hdpi at 240 dpi.

21708748
d3.js	protovis
see this color palettes in d3.js built-in color palettes can be accessed through scales
well even in protovis they had been ordinal scales all along only not called this way. there are 4 built-in color palette in protovis d3.scale.category10 d3.scale.category20 d3.scale.category20b and d3.scale.category20c

21712256
junit	testng
try not an answer to any question you asked but hopefully of interest to some people who ve read this far plus i wrote this before some of your question edits to mark a junit test as being in a group that the surefire plugin will exclude you have to annotate them as being in a category
the junit equivalent of the above testng code is you can read more in this dzone article

21712667
cocos2d-x	libgdx
a popular cross-platform game development framework in c++ is cocos2d-x
if you want to stick with java have a look at libgdx which allows you to develop games for ios android windows not windows phone though not sure whether you meant that bb via quick android porting

21716181
google-chrome	firefox
this is a google-chrome bug
it doesn t happen in firefox

21718187
google-chrome	firefox
case2 you re using rtcweb-capable browser google-chrome and trying to call a sip client which may not be implementing some mandatory features like ice srtp
google-chrome uses srtp-sdes and firefox uses srtp-dtls

21718702
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
internet explorer 10-11 support it using prefix mstoblob but returns only png safari has an issue with status resolved won t fix opera blink has no support method not present on canvas element opera old has no support method not present on canvas element none support toblobhd at this time as with most of the hd suffixed methods
updated feb 02 2017 canvas.toblob is supported in google-chrome since 50 as well as in opera blink

21719959
octal	decimal
012 is octal number not decimal which decimal value is 10
is equals - for reference numeric starts with 0 is octal number

21722203
bash	subshell
it has been said that it s not necessary to export in bash when spawning subshell while others said the exact opposite
it is important to note the difference between subshell those that are created by or loops and subprocesses processes that are invoked by name for example a literal bash appearing in your script

21723553
bower	npm
it s a bug in bower 1.2.7 and up related to an upgraded zip library
a workaround is reinstall bower as it will force an upgrade for the zip library bower cache clean npm uninstall -g bower npm install -g bower for more information see note that the above is not sufficient with an older version of node i tried 0.9.9

21728088
queue	fifo
now for a bit more technical details by the way a linkedlist normally would do things i mentioned above i mean a linkedlist is always a linked-list even if you assign it to a queue - it doesn t suddenly start using an array as the underlying implementation as an arraydeque would which also implements queue or something else
queue doesn t actually need to be fifo see the docs if it needed to be a linkedlist would also need to be so linkedlist would have quite a bit of freedom in this regard so let s continue this explanation using deque - it has methods to support addition and removal from either the front or the back

21728413
profiling	instrumentation
in my case after each run i had the following error tracelog profiling failed in initialization due to a lack of instrumentation methods process vstest.executionengine.x86.exe i ve found the answer here
in case the link is no longer available i m pasting the content in here if you find yourself with a an empty .coverage file and see errors similar to the below in your event logs you most probably have a corrupt install info .net runtime version 4.0.30319.17929 - the profiling has requested that the clr instance not load the profiling into this process

21728655
jar	war
i never got a war working as jar so i always go for one of the two solutions
however when using a war its not hard to setup a embedded jetty server that works in your ide

21728849
mvp	presenter
because you are asking in the context of thread-safety i d suggest keeping the mvvm and mvp patterns in mind
if your structure lives in view presenter or viewmodel it doesn t need thread safety

21733663
rspec	capybara
capybara comes with a built in dsl for writing descriptive acceptance tests with rspec feature scenario but you may also use traditional rspec dsl describe it
capybara supports several drivers and its default driver racktest doesn t support javascript

21734216
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist really likes sorted items makes adding o 1
this should not surprise you it is well documented in the msdn article for sortedlist sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o logn as opposed to o n for sortedlist

21734216
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
this should not surprise you it is well documented in the msdn article for sortedlist sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o logn as opposed to o n for sortedlist
sorteddictionary uses a red-black tree pointers sortedlist is an array

21735526
memcpy	strcpy
memcpy base_ tbase.c_str tbase.length
length doesn t count the terminating 0 so you probably want strcpy base_ tbase.c_str

21736504
hive	hdfs
and you are loading the data directly from a given hdfs location not as a hive table
if you intend to use pig to load store data from into a hive table you should use hcatalog

21739595
aggregate-functions	sum
unfortunately mysql does not have this capability however we can use an aggregate-functions with a case statement to get a similar result
demo basically we supplied a case line for each month year that we want to get the sum for

21742078
spaces	delimiter
this is caused by pdfbox not following the pdf reference to the letter tokens in a pdf token stream may be delimiter by white spaces as usual for most programming language but also implicitly because the next character is a delimiter of its own since it introduces a special function
therefore it s totally valid -- and certainly not unusual -- to encounter constructions such as which is entirely equivalent to the slightly longer from iso pdf 32000-1 2008 7.2.2 character set the pdf character set is divided into three classes called regular delimiter and white-space characters

21742185
implements	extends
however if you can t really see the point in creating your own provider just to undo the assumptions that laravel makes then just implements those methods as above in your user model unique identifier for getauthidentifier and blank string or no return value for getauthpassword and use your own means to retrieve a user from the database and then use directly to bypass any checking of a password in the traditional sense
i d say the correct way to solve this would be to implements your own auth provider that extends userproviderinterface that doesn t care about a password

21742240
libstdc++	libc++
the old arm only libary seems to indicate which has all the hallmarks of being compiled with libstdc++
the new universal library indicates this has all the hallmarks of being compiled with libc++ your link error indicates that there is a problem finding this would be the case if the code linking to the library was compiled using libstdc++ and because your new universal library is compiled using libc++ the code will not link

21742240
libstdc++	libc++
the new universal library indicates this has all the hallmarks of being compiled with libc++ your link error indicates that there is a problem finding this would be the case if the code linking to the library was compiled using libstdc++ and because your new universal library is compiled using libc++ the code will not link
you have to compile everything with the same libc++ libstdc++ support you cannot mix and match as they will refuse to link

21743166
g++	gcc
so rather than g++ -o webpagecrawler -lawesomium-1-7 -wall webpagecrawler.cc try g++ -wall webpagecrawler.cc -lawesomium-1-7 -o webpagecrawler that specific order isn t mandatory but it should work
the command to compile c++ code is g++ not gcc

21743166
g++	gcc
the command to compile c++ code is g++ not gcc
they re both part of the same collection but the g++ command adds some extra options

21744457
lisp	scheme
scheme is not even remotely c-like it is lisp
try setting lisp and autoindent instead of cindent

21745505
passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin
but unlike unicorn phusion passenger dynamically scales the number of worker processes based on current traffic thus freeing up resources when they re not necessary
memory optimizations - phusion passenger uses less memory than thin and unicorn

21745505
passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin
this concept first introduced by unicorn has been improved upon phusion passenger ensures that only one request at the same time is running out-of-band garbage collection thus eliminating all the problems unicorn s out-of-band garbage collection has
jruby support - unicorn s a better choice than thin but it doesn t support jruby

21745574
clang	llvm
in the end the final command turned out to be clang++ llvm-config --ldflags main.o -lclangfrontendtool -lclangfrontend -lclangdriver -lclangserialization -lclangcodegen -lclangparse -lclangsema -lclangstaticanalyzerfrontend -lclangstaticanalyzercheckers -lclangstaticanalyzercore -lclanganalysis -lclangarcmigrate -lclangrewritefrontend -lclangrewritecore -lclangedit -lclangast -lclanglex -lclangbasic llvm-config --libs if compiling any clang tool or example make sure you check the makefiles under clang tools folder
the answer to this problem is as anton korobeynik suggested i was missing the clang libraries which are not part of the llvm build as i was expecting from the command llvm-config --libs

21756768
noexcept	throw
each library function having a wide contract that the lwg agree cannot throw should be marked as unconditionally noexcept
if a library swap function move-constructor or move-assignment operator is conditionally-wide can be proven to not throw by applying the noexcept operator then it should be marked as conditionally noexcept

21756768
noexcept	throw
if a library swap function move-constructor or move-assignment operator is conditionally-wide can be proven to not throw by applying the noexcept operator then it should be marked as conditionally noexcept
no other function should use a conditional noexcept specification

21757010
n-gram	words
n-gram
more complex unsupervised solution could be building a language model from each document and calculate their jensen-shannon divergence to judge if they are similar or not based on the language models. a simple language model is usually we use some smoothing techniques to make sure no words has probability 0

21759702
sum	coalesce
if you don t want nulls in your next_5row_value column the same for the 6row you can use the coalesce function supported in postgresql too that returns the first not null expression. something like this select v coalesce sum v over order by yourorderingfield rows between 1 following and 5 following 0 as next_5row_value coalesce sum v over order by yourorderingfield rows between 1 following and 6 following 0 as next_6row_value from yourtable
you can try something like this select v sum v over order by yourorderingfield rows between 1 following and 5 following as next_5row_value sum v over order by yourorderingfield rows between 1 following and 6 following as next_6row_value from yourtable

21760800
portrait	landscape
unfortunately it is like that when your ipad is on portrait mode you have a popover of your master it is not the master in another shape
what means that you are presenting a modal using this popover as presentingviewcontroller so when you move from portrait to landscape the method splitviewcontroller willshowviewcontroller will make your popover nil as you can see so i understand that is acceptable that your modal is going with it

21764381
libstdc++	libc++
in particular gcc does not behave this way but fortunately libstdc++ doesn t use inline namespaces
if you don t want to rely on this extension then for clang libc++ you can write but obviously then you ll need implementations for other libraries you use

21766989
spaces	linefeed
example the character class is strange because it contains a spaces and the character class s that contains the spaces too
imo to check a username or a password you only need the spaces and why not the tab but not the carriage return or the linefeed character

21766989
spaces	linefeed
imo to check a username or a password you only need the spaces and why not the tab but not the carriage return or the linefeed character
you can remove s and let the spaces or you can use the h character class that matches all horizontal white spaces

21767779
requestfactory	gwt
if using requestfactory by some reason is not an alternative then consider using dozer to map domain objects to dtos this is frequently used with gwt
use the gwt requestfactory for automating the creation of dtos

21768935
portrait	landscape
following snippet is not tested and i haven t played with accelerometer so far just to give an idea to start references angle calculation wp7 detect the screen orientation change when supportedorientations portrait using accelerometer using the accelerometer in silverlight for windows phone
calculate angle using accelerometer maybe then you can decide whether phone is in landscape or potrait mode from angle value

21769417
profiling	benchmarking
if you profiling the code you will see the following line 256 31.8 31.8 keyedloadic a keyed load ic from the snapshot and dumping native code counters would show this actual number depends on the number of iterations you repeat the benchmarking | c v8.keyedloadgenericlookupcache | 41999967 | which illustrates that cache is indeed being hit
now v8 does not actually use the same cache for either x.hasownproperty k or k in x in fact it does not use any cache and always end up calling runtime in the profiling for hasownproperty case you will see a lot of c++ methods and the main problem here is not even that these are c++ methods and not handwritten assembly like keyedloadic stub but that these methods are performing the same lookup again and again without caching the outcome

21771310
uiview	subviews
to implement the mixed approach you will have to instantiate the content view uiview in code and not set its translatesautoresizingmaskintoconstraints property to no
by extension you ll probably need to create your constraints for all those subviews in code as well i don t know of any way around this

21772008
google-chrome	safari
you can download your command line tools from daw.apple.com but try it from safari instead of google-chrome
i tried it with google-chrome for a few hours and apple would not recognize my id password it is the same as your appleid

21772298
implements	extends
i d guess they at least implements dom 3 if not a more current version - however those don t define a getelementsbyname either
it is actually specified in html5 whatwg w3 on the document partial interface the dom specification defines a document interface which this html5 specification extends significantly and at i found the note because the htmldocument interface is now obtained using binding-specific casting methods instead of simply being the primary interface of the document object it is no longer defined as inheriting from document

21772879
verilog	vhdl
it applies to verilog also even through tagged vhdl
a pure verilog solution is not stable so dedicated fpga resources must be used

21779715
onclick	onchange
example in practice you would probably not want to use onclick but onchange
but the question specifically mentions onclick . there are problems though

21781421
moq	moles
using moq most mocking frameworks have this feature
if you can t mock your method because is not an interface you can try using microsoft fakes moles to do the work

21782213
hex	binary
judging by the file size and hex dump this is not a script anymore
it s been compiled into binary form by a tool such as this one possibly encrypted and probably bundled with all the binaries it depends on

21784952
single-quotes	double-quotes
you probably want the outer quotes to be single-quotes so that the embedded s are not expanded before getting sent to the remote server
the problem may be the nested double-quotes

21787292
implements	extends
you may implements a jsondeserializer and use it while parsing your json value to a java instance
i ll try to show it with a code which is going to give you the idea 1 define your custom jsondeserializer class which creates different instance of classes by incoming json value s id property 2 define a base class for your different instance of java objects 3 define your different instance of java objects classes which extends your base class 4 use these classes while parsing your json value to a bean i can not test it right now but i hope you get the idea

21788211
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome the application could not keep the session because it s id changed almost at each request made
meanwhile firefox didn t have it

21790633
portrait	landscape
in your code will always return size in portrait orientation even though it s landscape on the device emulator it s happen because you put it on viewdidload
if you want to get the size of current orientation landscape place the code in viewdidlayoutsubviews not in viewdidload

21791441
ng-view	ng-include
because of how ngroute was designed you can only have one ng-view per ng-app instance
however it looks like you are looking for ng-include since the routes do not seem to come into play

21791671
n-gram	words
n-gram indexing as in approach 1 then throwing out the n-gram not in the wikipedia dictionary i think would get you there faster as you look at each n-gram once o n wikipedia-dictionary-lookup performance if i understand the problem correctly
i think you want to use approach 1 as approach 2 looks like you have to look up the wikipedia dictionary for each words then each 2 words then each 3 words .

21792229
vim	notepad++
notepad++ handles it quite well whereas vi vim do not display the whole string in red
vi vim only knows how to highlight a string on the same line where the opening-quote is placed

21796659
persistent	transient
i do not think this has anything to do with the kind of persistent store
the trick is to create an appropriate attribute in the managed object model and mark it as transient

21800223
strcpy	strncpy
that s why it is not recomended to use strcat and strcpy functions
better to use strncat and strncpy

21801000
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
webkit with this code i am currently able to make the color of the button red on webkit-based browsers stylesheet.css only tested on google-chrome but as it is a webkit feature should also work on safari and opera as these are also both webkit-based
firefox firefox doesn t support the css equivalents of the svg filters yet but you can get hue-rotate to work by linking to an .svg filter

21801961
shadowing	named
you re shadowing the function here more precisely you iterate over the property named including the ones of the prototype chain and you set new values to your object
when you set a value with the named of a property of the prototype you don t change the prototype but the value that will be found with article.shortdescr will be the one of the object not the one of the prototype

21803357
uiview	subviews
edit sorry in my first answer i did not look at how the tabbarmutablearray is created. in your appdelegate the tabbaritemsmutablearray which is the return value of your -tabbarmutablearray method is created like this hence there are no uiview objects contained in that array but nsstring objects the descriptions of all the subviews
that is why the following line in your viewcontroller.m is incorrect and won t work as desired the right hand side of that line is a nsstring the left hand side is a uiview

21805380
oncreate	setcontentview
add an alertdialog and call its show from oncreate when calling it from any other activity foreground or background ones no matter use the following flag with these steps you can create a dialog that is seemingly separated from the main application and displayed on its own
based on your answers and some searching i get this result may not comply with google ui guidelines create an activity that represents the alert public class dialogmessageactivity extends activity set its theme to theme.translucent in androidmanifest.xml remove its setcontentview function in oncreate super.oncreate savedinstancestate

21805380
oncreate	setcontentview
based on your answers and some searching i get this result may not comply with google ui guidelines create an activity that represents the alert public class dialogmessageactivity extends activity set its theme to theme.translucent in androidmanifest.xml remove its setcontentview function in oncreate super.oncreate savedinstancestate
setcontentview r.layout.dialog_message

21805854
vaadin	jsf
the way how you think the app could be something like ui - boundary - control - entity from the technology view is something like vaadin mvc p - ejb s - cdi objects - jpa entities
the main advantages with this approach are your ui could be anything you like jsf gwt vaadin... and is not tied to the service layer

21806242
comparator	comparable
a reasonable approach to doing this for the comparable interface would be approximately as follows alternatively you can sensibly make a sorting class which can be used for any type of class at all with the provision of a comparator for that class of course bubble sort isn t a good sort and there are better sorts built into java libraries already but this is a good learning exercise
i m trying to make a sorting class which could be used for any type of class as long as it implements comparator

21808454
cassini	iis
step 6 switch the debug web server to iis express ahhhh it appears that cassini the build in vs debugger doesn t work with sessionauthenticationmanager
however iis express does

21810091
icmp	tcp
windows doesn t support icmp properly and linux unix supports it but requires root privileges
in both cases isreachable fallbacks to making a tcp call on port 7 which is likely to fail because this port is often closed

21811422
implements	extends
if you create a set of pairs to your types you pretty much have your functionallity implements and rules about mutabillity and constness preset ok maybe the settings aren t what you want but tweaks can be made
so here is the code example usage note all this is a rough code sketching of what a full implementation would be and even after polishing and extends the code i m not implying that this would be an alternative to boost bimap but merely a homemade way of having an associative container searchable by both the value and the key

21815700
google-chrome	safari
the error message is pretty clear error unsupported browser google-chrome for ios does not support this feature
please use safari and try again google-chrome is unsupported

21815898
implements	extends
futuretask implements interfaces runnablefuture runnable and future
any object can not be casted to any class or interface except classes interfaces it extends implements

21816258
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can see that the linq is actually an iqueryable and not ienumerable
when working on the iqueryable sitecore must know how to translate it to the search expression

21816481
google-chrome	firefox
adblock plus in firefox only not google-chrome was generating random class names for images i have embedded in my nav bar for social media links
now i have to either find a way to get around that or anyone using abp in firefox will see a weird looking nav bar due to this issue

21819116
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome incognito mode browse in private safari safari 5.1 os x lion browse privately that s about as much info is available on the private browsing for these browsers
firefox seems to be the most comprehensive in listing what private browsing does not save

21819603
spaces	delimiter
i added the usebackq option to the intial for f loop just in case a user passes a quoted file name that contains spaces
the causes problems because it is not quoted and the batch parser treats as a token delimiter

21820642
clang	llvm
colored diagnostics if you want colored error messages from clang be sure to install the ncurses development package libncurses-devel with cygwin setup beforehand
without it clang will fallback to its colorless mode because llvm wouldn t be able to detect whether the terminal supports colors

21825370
treemap	linkedhashmap
you can pass a comparator to the treemap for a different order
edit it also work on jackson with a linkedhashmap even if this is not a sortedmap

21826320
vim	sublimetext
so if this is not a problem you may try implementing my script above by making a global function in bash sudo vim usr bin srcsublime and paste the following and your vimperator editor command should simply be srcsublime or when used outside of your vimperator as a shell command srcsublime must have curl or try substituting curl with wget
indeed sublimetext does not allow opening remote files so the only way to view the file is to save it first

21834239
comparator	comparable
the fact that your class currently have a comparator method doesn t mean it implements this interface you have to declare this
your student class must implement the comparable interface in order to use arrays#sort passing array

21835848
exponent	modulo
you do not strictly need all the parameters just providing the modulo exponent and d value should be enough
note that exponent in above is just the public exponent and d is the private exponent

21836915
apache	nginx
but your question how can i set up nginx to run both apache lamp and node.js on same server doesn t really make sense since nginx doesn t run apache or node.js
nginx apache and node.js are all their own separate servers

21838393
uilabel	uitextview
uilabel isn t built with textkit on ios7 at least not in a way that is accessible to developers
you d need to use uitextview to get access to textkit

21840809
rsa	aes
the 4096 bit rsa key and its associated certificate provides authentication during the setup of the connection and key agreement allowing the client to verify that they are indeed connected to your server and not a man-in-the-middle claiming to be your server
however the rsa algorithm is orders of magnitude slower than symmetric algorithms like aes with similar security properties as well as being limited in the amount of data it can encrypt

21842134
strdup	malloc
get rid of the outer strdup so all you have is g_strdup p1
at that point you would just need to g_free both the keys and values which isn t hard to do you just pass g_free to both the key_destroy_func and value_destroy_func arguments however since your values are integers you can actually avoid the malloc by using gint_to_pointer and gpointer_to_int

21843543
inline	inlining
objective c methods cannot ever be inline unfortunately
there are lots of things which can affect which method will be invoked when a message is sent and it can change at runtime so inlining just isn t possible

21846606
aggregate-functions	sum
in order to have sums you want to use the sum aggregate-functions and group by the remaining selected columns select data || ||to_char d.dtime_day mm dd yyyy || ||sum nvl g.pos 0 || ||sum nvl g.office 0 || ||sum nvl u.pos 0 || ||sum nvl u.office 0 from owner_dwh.dc_date d group by to_char d.dtime_day mm dd yyyy nvl u.pos 0 nvl u.office 0 i suspect that there is more to your question but without further information this is how far we can help
also it should be noted that sum doesn t require nvl if null is to be replaced by 0

21847066
profiling	debugging
that makes me worry about whether one change would affect other maven project in other eclipses firstly this shouldn t happen unless and until you have different settings and profiling set-up in your settings.xml
so prior to configuring multiple mavens first debugging why the maven settings get distubred in the other projects

21847495
namedtuple	dictionary
therefore if tuple is not the data structure for your task there is no meaning for using namedtuple
i would use a list of dictionary

client-side	server-side
fb itself also strongly discourages this note that because this request uses your app secret it must never be made in client-side code or in an app binary that could be decompiled. it is important that your app secret is never shared with anyone. therefore this api call should only be made using server-side code
you shouldn t use your app access token in a client-side sdk because it can be easily extracted from there

profiling	debugging
systemtap provides excellent facility to profiling debugging user space as well as kernel codes
systemtap script for finding context switches in arm user space profiling is not yet available because of uprobes

21851731
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
to implement this stuff is not that easy if you have to use udp to transfer a largish chunk of data then design a small application-level protocol that would handle possible packet loss and re-ordering that s part of what tcp does for you
i would go with something like this datagrams less then mtu plus ip and udp headers in size say 1024 bytes to avoid ip fragmentation. fixed-length header for each datagram that includes data length and a sequence number so you can stitch data back together and detect missed duplicate and re-ordered parts. acknowledgements from the receiving side of what has been successfully received and put together. timeout and retransmission on the sending side when these acks don t come within appropriate time

21853482
spaces	delimiter
if you change that scalar to an array you will capture all matches when you interpolate the array it will insert spaces the value of between the elements
if you do not want that you can change the value of to an acceptable delimiter

21854993
google-chrome	safari
or support for the same is dirty for more information on the property you can refer mdn from mdn body element backgrounds are not printed currently neither google-chrome nor safari print backgrounds of the body element
if this property is set to exact for the body element it will apply only to its descendants. google-chrome clipped image bug when background images are clipped for example when using background-image sprites due to chromium bug 131054 they will appear distorted when printed from the google-chrome browser with -webkit-print-color-adjust exact

21855227
lodash	underscore.js
so i can now use the lodash .clone with the expected behaviour
edit 2018 the underscore.js build doesn t seem to exist anymore

21855761
imagick	gmagick
i think the applicable trio are those extensions gd 6 vulnerabilities imagick 44 vulnerabilities gmagick 12 vulnerabilities from the comparison i think gd suits best because it has smallest number of security issues and they are quite old
three of them are critical but imagmagick and gmagick do not perform any better.

21855875
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the uinavigationcontroller allows you to initialise an instance with custom uinavigationbar and uitoolbar classes using initwithnavigationbarclass toolbarclass .
this means that you could init any views that you are not presenting modally with a different uinavigationbar subclass to views that are being modally presented

21860673

21861822
sudo	passwd
it usually boils down to these three things #1 respect the privacy of others. #2 think before you type. #3 with great power comes great responsibility. and since sudo was not provided a passwd the -s argument it prompts for the passwd by outputting passwd i think you intended to do where i believe you intended to use alpine as the passwd which would then be echo alpine | sudo -s chmod 666 system library textinput textinput_zh.bundle keyboard-zh.plist see man 8 sudo for additional information on sudo
your sudo command is malformed sudo -s alpine | chmod 666 system library textinput textinput_zh.bundle keyboard-zh.plist which is interpreted as this is attempting to run the alpine command with sudo and piping its output to chmod which doesn t make sense

21862137
prepare	execute
if you use a prepare statement you can save yourself the trouble of escaping if you want non-procedural style aka oop this would look like the following
you need to execute the query not just write it

21863328
textmate	sublimetext
they were developed for textmate so that color schemes could have a small number of scopes and still highlight everything appropriately
sublimetext is not textmate and there are no hard and fast rules for what scopes should apply to what type of syntax element

21863534
sudo	passwd
however now that you are aware of the risks it is possible to use sudo -ks to have sudo read the passwd from stdin
doing this kind of stuff is not safe or standard practice in fact many consider it disasterous it is really not a good idea to put a passwd in a script

21863614
required	placeholder
used required false if left blank it should default to a given value
for better user experience i did not set the default value on the input field but rather used the html attribute placeholder since it is less obtrusive

21866535
firefox	safari
that s because the -webkit- prefix you ve added refers to webkit browsers of which firefox is not one
note that as of version 26 chrome is no longer a webkit browser either however safari still is and you should keep the prefixed version for that reason + old chrome version compatibility

21871292
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if that doesn t work the mail.log setting is a php_ini_perdir setting meaning that entry can be set in php.ini .htaccess httpd.conf or .user.ini since php 5.3 obviously you can t access the system s php.ini httpd.conf but if a .user.ini is provided to you or you re allowed to change settings in .htaccess then that would be a way to solve this
see .user.ini files set php.ini values using .htaccess alternatively you could consider using swift mailer or phpmailer which don t need the mail function

21872498
factors	matrix
lee determinant approximations arxiv 1105.0437 arnold reusken approximation of the determinant of large sparse symmetric positive definite matrix arxiv hep-lat 0008007 quoting from the shogun notes the usual technique for computing the log-determinant term in the likelihood expression relies on cholesky factorization of the matrix σ llt l is the lower triangular cholesky factors and then using the diagonal entries of the factors to compute log det σ 2 ni 1log lii
however for sparse matrix as covariance matrix usually are the cholesky factors often suffer from fill-in phenomena - they turn out to be not so sparse themselves

21875119
rdf	owl
in plain rdf you can simply do this my relation a my symmetricrelation . this expresses that the relation my relation is of type my symmetricrelation
however if you also want a reasoner such as an owl reasoner to do clever things with the fact that your relation is symmetric then plain rdf is not really enough and you ll need to switch to owl and model your relation as an owl symmetricproperty

21876634
getdate	datepart
i d always rather spell it out in full hour versus hh because i find it more readable it s usually not much more than a few characters more and i can never remember which ones are for months vs minutes references dateadd datepart getdate
do date maths first then extract the hour datepart hour dateadd hour -1 getdate also i hate the short forms of the date components

21878096
stateless	stateful
a stateless protocol does not require the server to retain session information or status about each communications partner for the duration of multiple requests
in contrast a protocol which requires the keeping of internal state is known as a stateful protocol

21878966
google-chrome	firefox
all drivers google-chrome driver ie driver etc. are built based on the special js engine used by each browser
selenium offers inbuilt driver for firefox but not for other browsers

21879564
wildfly	glassfish
the same happens with glassfish 4 with the latest mojarra-2.2.5 as well as wildfly 8 final
i have seen multiple bug reports on this manfried riem says it was determined this is an el issue and the el implementation has been fixed to fix this but not sure if that means updating mojarra fixes it because it does not in glassfish 4

21881426
client-side	server-side
example microtemplating engines for the client-side javascript dom tree based javascript template engines
one good way to pass data and content from the server-side python to javascript are json embeds in html separate ajax calls which serve json objects as application json mime for the embed approach i would do somethibng along the lines to export data to the page template as json then in the page template pass this to javascript global variables and then in javascript keep preferably in a separate static .js file also i would not generate html for just passing it to javascript in the first place

21882317
prepare	execute
the main benefit of prepare statements in c# is that the workload in the database is done while creating the command
not when you execute it with executenonquery - which execute the command only if you don t have a transaction object created

21884202
cdr	cons
the resulting changes in your original would be defun f3 a cond null a and numberp car a oddp car a append list car a f3 cdr a t f3 cdr a but you wouldn t normally use append to prepend a single element to a list
it would more naturally be done using cons

21885022
matlab	simulink
scopes are matlab figure windows use matlab code in the background and hence do not support code generation
assuming you are only interested in desktop simulation not real-time code generation then what you can do is write a matlab gui that calls a simulink coder rsim target generated exe to run a simulation and store the results in .mat file then deploy the matlab gui using the matlab compiler

21887203
carrierwave	paperclip
it may be worth looking into this add-on gem for carrierwave if you are not set on paperclip it might save you some time
look at this paperclip recipe on asynchronous upload to s3

21888993
allocator	stl
surely the project details are important since dynamic memory allocator may not be an issue for many available boards today and type of projects
on our embedded scanner project we were developing a board with arm7 cpu and stl didn t bring any issue

21889432
ienumerable	ilist
ps - i have suggested ilist over ienumerable because as per your usage of this property - itemssource.removeat i
you need indexing over and remove methods which are available for ilist and not on ienumerable

21889432
ienumerable	ilist
you need indexing over and remove methods which are available for ilist and not on ienumerable
otherwise you manually have to typecast to ilist explicitly like this itemssource as ilist .removeat i

21889522
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you can fix it by moving your code to the viewdidappear method
in viewwillappear the current view controller is not yet visible hence why it says it will appear not did appear

21890213
istanbul	lcov
eta - personally i d switch to istanbul instead as blanket seems to be sparsely updated if at all right now
istanbul has more complete coverage stats not just lines - branches etc and can export to lcov for tools like code climate

21893093

on windows you can use the free fiddler
on mac and linux you can use charles proxy but it s not free

21893807
bower	npm
therefore it is accessible for other developers at this path node_modules bower bin bower
npm did actually install bower but not globally

21895854
imperative	declarative
one way to think of the difference between imperative and functional paradigms is that with imperative you have to explicitly code the order of your operations i m using very loose language here to make it simple for you
in contrast with functional programming you are not defining the sequence but rather you are declaring what you are trying to model this is why it is sometimes referred to as declarative style of programming

21896128
base	fractions
this isn t a full answer mhlester already covered a lot of good ground i won t duplicate but i would like to stress how much the representation of a number depends on the base you are working in
consider the fractions 2 3 in good-ol base 10 we typically write it out as something like 0.666.

21897095
floating-point	fractions
on the other hand floating-point numbers can have a fractions part 0 1 -32.1 42.7 and 123.456788 are all valid floating-point numbers
when converting between integers int and floating-point float numbers you can do this but you can t do this the reason the first conversion is possible is that converting the integer number int to a floating-point number float does not change the number

21904924
pascal	delphi
i even tried an optimized 32-bit assembler version of my routine that ended up looking almost identical to the one that delphi provided from the pascal source but with a few tweaks and that one came out a few ms faster most of the time but in some cases very much slower than the other ones - again implying that the timing will be much dependent on what other things your pc is doing
as ken noted it was bad form to assume that it was faster - from the looks of the pascal code it certainly would appear that it should be faster only one expensive operation but like david said one shouldn t always take things for granted

21908294
comparator	comparable
edit example of a comparator
your sectorinfo class does not implement comparable and you don t provide a comparator when creating your treemap

21912094
spaces	delimiter
just use also no need to rtrim as trailing spaces aren t significant in a comparison and if itemnumber is numeric you should use a numeric datatype not a string
there is no need to concatenate all of them into a comma delimiter string

21914610
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you re trying to push from a uiviewcontroller not being embed in a uinavigationcontroller
what you need to do is go to your storyboard select the uiviewcontroller you re trying to push from go to the editor menu select embed in and navigation controller

21915536
jsf	seam
a few remarks about your questions using jstl loop in jsf is not recommended since it s not managed in jsf lifecycle
using facelets ui repeat is the good practice seam 3 is deprecated you should avoid using it as you won t have any support if the problem comes from here

21916219
super	self
class mybutton qpushbutton def text self # this will override qpushbutton s text method. print inside mybutton.text return qpushbutton.text self note you have to use the old-style of calling parent class methods. super fails with a typeerror because self is actually a qpushbutton and not a mybutton when the method is injected
or if you wanted to take more of a mixin approach let s define mybuttonoverrides class mybuttonoverrides object def text self # this will override qpushbutton s text method. print inside mybuttonoverrides.text return self.__class__.text self note you can call the qpushbutton.text directly through self.__class__ because you won t be using mybuttonoverrides directly

21917518
google-chrome	firefox
and for me this trick only worked in firefox and not google-chrome
however if in google-chrome you do shift+ctrl+n new incogneto window then go to your editor you ll see that it is working

21918751
ssl	https
if this is the case then yes you need ssl
https is not such a burden on server resources as it once was

21921245
ssl	https
you can t in iis7 - each https binding requires a unique ip port combination because the host header cannot be used to differentiate sites using ssl
this is because the host header is not visible during the ssl handshake

21924278
rtp	rtsp
the problem i am having is that the first method will save everything i need but for some reason it will add extra data more than just the rtp payload and rtsp interleaved frame contents in strange places the first method tshark -r my.pcap -r -t fields -e rtp.payload -w rtp.out should print an error as the -r flag specifies a read filter and the read filter must come after the -r flag and must not begin with a - if what follows -r begins with a - it is interpreted as another flag so that command does not specify a read filter
if you meant for example tshark -r my.pcap -r rtp -t fields -e rtp.payload -w rtp.out that command uses the -w flag which specifies that a binary file containing the raw packet data from my.pcap possibly as filtered by the read filter should be written to the file whose name is the argument to the -w flag so that command means write to the file named rtp.out all the rtp packets in my.pcap and also write the rtp.payload field of each packet to the standard output

21928877
inline	inlining
more commentary on this can be seen at a these two blog posts i found some time ago in the second blog post he comments on how if memory view slices are inline they can provide speeds similar to that of pointer arithmetic. i have noticed in some of my own tests that explicitly inlining functions that use memory view slices isn t always necessary. as an example of this i ll compute the inner product of every combination of two rows of an array
timing these we see the results were as fast with explicit inlining as they were without it. in both cases the typed memory views were comparable to a version of the function that was written without slicing

21929773
strncpy	malloc
here s what you can do with strncpy also you can change ns from int to ssize_t which is the return type of recv
if you want to use strndup you don t need to explicitly use malloc however if your data contains null bytes it will not copy beyond that point and if it doesn t it will add a null byte in the duplicated string which might not be what you want

lodash	underscore.js
asgoth pointed out that lodash and backbone are amd-compliant so you should not have a shim for underscore.js or backbone
you use lodash for underscore.js

21935411
lodash	underscore.js
you use lodash for underscore.js
lodash has not needed a shim in a while maybe ever

21936384
serializable	deserialization
also you will not be able to use xml serializable with static data
thus your element names in xml match members of your classes then deserialization will be really simple

rpm	yum
in order to install the epel repository for 64bit systems run the following as root cd tmp wget rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm if you re using a 32bit system use the following in step 2 wget
the centos repository does not contain pyside. you can add the epel repository to your os then use yum install -y python-pyside and it will be installed on your system

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox safari so on i have tested in the same way as boltclock found that nor the htc nor the js was loaded when i was not on an ie6-9 browser as expected
i tested on ie8 ie9 google-chrome 32 ie11 firefox 27 see screenshots below

21942178
udp	tcp
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse
websockets are a protocol upgrade within an http connection tcp with its own framing - which means that it is a layer on top of tcp and due to its own framing it has even more overhead than tcp alone

21946025
rpm	yum
if you use rpm -q to check if a package exists then the output would look like this for a package that exists # rpm -q httpd httpd-2.2.15-15.el6.centos.1.x86_64 and like this if the package doesn t exist # rpm -q httpdfoo package httpdfoo is not installed so your ansible tasks would look something like this the rpm command will also exit with a 0 if the package exists or a 1 if the package isn t found so another possibility is to use
i don t think the yum module would help in this case

21946512
client-side	server-side
in order to resolve it you need either client-side data storing cookies html5 local storage.
server-side data storing sessions not really server-side only you need at least to associate sessions to the respective clients usually storing session ids into cookies for these reasons the web apps data management is not trivial

21947268
realloc	malloc
for one thing the people who are saying that realloc doesn t work with a null pointer aren t speaking the truth
the behavior is documented here for c++ and here for c it just works like malloc in the case of a null pointer passed

21949550
scipy	sympy
i would only recommend using mpmath when you need the arbitrary precision arithmetic it provides. if ordinary floating point arithmetic is good enough mpmath will be much slower than many of your other options. if you still need to use mpmath i would recommend installing gmpy to speed things up. that will help but it will still be much faster to use scipy
use the odeint function included in scipy.integrate . the following code snippets are equivalent. this is the version using mpmath included as part of sympy this is the version using numpy and scipy depending on which points you want to plot it may be easier to use numpy s linspace function that lets you take equispaced points between two values. as it is you are just plotting notice that i did have to swap the order of the arguments. be aware that the second version uses numpy arrays and not python lists. if you want to learn more about numpy and scipy good places to start are the scipy lecture notes and the scipy wiki s numpy tutorial

21953779
ubuntu	linux
you have a file on your ubuntu server with that c nppdf32log debuglog.txt name
yes -- it s on ubuntu and yes -- it s actually a file name and not full path linux allows and characters in file names

21958681
scheme	racket
the right syntax for your snippet in scheme would be define f x + 5 5
racket is not an ide for common lisp

21958681
lisp	scheme	lisp	racket
racket is not an ide for common lisp
it s an ide for scheme which is a lisp dialect but different from common lisp

21959354
elasticsearch	kibana
also from a google groups post kibana is a web interface which stay in front of elasticsearch to understand the query syntax you have to know something more about apache lucene which is the text search engine used by elasticsearch
here s a small tutorial about the query styles you can use with lucene and by inheritance with your kibana web interface this link is dead i m not sure but this might be an adequate replacement

21960007
strcpy	strncpy
the function strcpy does not check for the bounds of the buffer it writes into and hence can overflow if the string to be copied is too big for the buffer causing undefined behaviour and even program crash
you should use the safer alternative strncpy

21962999
slug	permalinks
every time you made changes into taxonomies or post types slug you will need to flush rules and save permalinks if not you will recive a 404 error
this way you will have mywebsite.com tutorials this will use the archive or taxonomy template ej taxonomy-tutorials.php mywebsite.com tutorial post-name notice what i describe about single slug template in use single-tutorial.php mywebsite.com tutorials photoshop this will use the archive or taxonomy template as well and also you could have a particular template only for that term note as i said single post type slug same as taxonomy archives slug can t be the same will be a trouble to wp to recognize slug for single and taxonomy archives at same time so the best i found is to use this method where you have a singular slug for single posts and the plural version for tax archives

21964169
onclick	onsubmit
try changing the onclick to onsubmit like this fiddle note you will probably need to cancel the actual form submit since you aren t sending any data anywhere
your problem is that you are binding an onclick method to the submit

21965986
strcpy	malloc
strlen doesn t count the null byte in a string so you have to allocate one extra byte for it to be copied by strcpy from the source string
you should check the result of malloc for null

21967275
junit	mockito
note that using a spring context in a junit test is like crafting an integration test
mockito is not spring aware

21969072
comparator	comparable
while implementing comparable interface you need to implement int comparator t o
no you cannot change the method signature of an abstract method in comparable interface

21974158
union	distinct
each part coming from a different table this strikes me as a classic example of a union not a join of two sets select name as albums_name null as musics_name releasedate from albums union all select null as albums_name name as musics_name releasedate from musics where album_id is null order by releasedate asc
there are two very distinct parts that your output appears to consist of albums and their release dates

21974263
strncpy	malloc
second yes you have to set string 9 to null because according to the standard strncpy does not ensure the string is null terminated if the source string is longer than count
two things first malloc 10 reserves 10 bytes addresses the eleventh byte so that is illegal

21974594
bower	npm
just running npm install bower installs the given package into the current folder under

a declarative language specifies what you want but not how to do it

21979654
factors	matrix
the input rgb values are going to be zero for black so they don t factors in at this point
if your colour2 the value you want to use for black in your monochrome image is r2 g2 b2 then that s what your constant factors have to be of course the above matrix will turn any input colour into that output colour because it doesn t factors in anything from the input rgba values

21980920
bash	subshell
it tells bash to run the job in the background returning an interactive terminal to the user see also here
you can get the job back to the foreground by entering fg if you want to run multiple commands in the background from a single command line statement you need to encapsulate them in parentheses if you would like to execute multiple commands together as one background process you can group them using braces please note that the braces need to be followed by a whitespace and that the list of commands inside braces must be terminated by a semicolon regular parentheses do not have these limitations but they create an additional subshell

21980969
rsa	aes
if what you mean by rsa is asymmetric cryptography the answer is that is not the standard usage
generally the data is encrypted with symmetric cryptography such as aes and the key is encrypted with asymmetric cryptography

21981740
apache	nginx
at peak load it uses about 15mb ram and 10 cpu on my particular configuration freebsd 6 . under the same kind of load apache falls over after using 1000 or so processes and god knows how much ram pound falls over too many threads and using 400mb+ of ram for all the thread stacks and lighty leaks more than 20mb per hour and uses more cpu but not significantly more .
from apache is a process-based server while nginx is an event-based web server

21981740
apache	nginx
pulling numbers from thin air for illustrative purposes serving 10 000 simultaneous connections would probably only cause nginx to use a few megabytes of ram whereas apache would probably consume hundreds of megabytes if it could do it at all
nginx is faster at serving static files and consumes much less memory for concurrent requests because nginx is event-based it doesn t need to spawn new processes or threads for each request so its memory usage is very low

the reason it doesn t work is because you are trying to use two different qgraphicsscene s for your qgraphicsview
qgraphicsview can only have one scene

21992290
setinterval	settimeout
you should use setinterval instead of settimeout
additionally you need to reference the function not call the function setinterval will cause the stepcode function to run every milliseconds until you call clearinterval timeout

21992290
setinterval	settimeout
additionally you need to reference the function not call the function setinterval will cause the stepcode function to run every milliseconds until you call clearinterval timeout
settimeout will only queue it up once

21992827
haskell	scheme
it s in scheme not haskell but the languages are sufficiently similar at least at this conceptual level that each can serve as a decent model for the other
to answer your second question first you can bind to a variable and unpack it simultaneously using note also that if you re not going to be using variables that you unpack it s haskell convention to bind them to _ this helps readers focus on what s actually important

21992859
queue	fifo
it is good in 1-to-1 communications otherwise it requires locks pipe may transmit pickable python objects or raw bytes the buffer size cannot be specified queue is similar to a unidirectional pipe but may work in many-to-many scenarios queue is unidirectional fifo queue is concurrency safe multiple processes may use the same end of the queue
so it is good when there are multiple producers or multiple consumers queue may transmit only pickable python objects the maximum size of the queue may be specified whenever you use a queue you need to make sure that all items which have been put on the queue will eventually be removed before the process is joined. queue is implemented using a pipe and some locks semaphores

21998983
punctuation	words
note that you may wish to improve the punctuation removal as i only added full-stops and commas for the purposes of this answer
this is not necessarily a very efficient way of achieving the result you are looking for but this will output a list of words that have a count of 2 or more in the specified summary effectively split the summary text by each space and then remove punctuation from the resulting words
