implements	extends
the implements class can override default methods so the class is still in complete control of its implementation
the ability of a class to extends multiple interfaces is closely related to another difference between interfaces and abstract classes namely that interfaces cannot contain state

30000838
erlang	elixir
in erlang you cannot write this instead you must write this as you can see this is very inconvenient mainly for code refactoring
if you want to insert a new line after the first line you would have to renumber all the v or write something like v1a ... so in elixir you can rebind variables change the meaning of the label mainly for your convenience summary in imperative languages variables are like named suitcases you have a suitcase named v

30003500
division	addition
as your predicate is on natural numbers it must implement integral division as you wrote in the question
your predicate divide 3 assumes wrongly that the following equation holds when x and y are numbers x-1 y-1 x y a counter-example is 16-1 4-1 5 is different from 16 4 4 it seems you are trying to base your predicate on the well-know addition predicate add 0 y y . add s x y s z - add x y z . but division is a multiplicative not an additive operation

a possible way of solving your problem is to think of division as an iterated subtraction as multiplication is an iterated addition

geany	gedit
i would suggest using geany which is available by sudo apt-get install geany it comes with the facilities for many different languages including one click compile one click build one click run configurable formatting and many other very useful programming features
per the gedit help contents use sudo apt-get install gedit-plugins however i did not see any facility to enforce c code formatting

30009353
seaborn	matplotlib
seaborn s boxplot code ignores your flierprops argument and overwrites it with its own before passing arguments to matplotlib s
matplotlib s boxplot also returns all the flier objects as part of its return value so you could modify this after running boxplot but seaborn doesn t return this

30013433
super	extends
the use of super emphasizes that dst is being used in a write-only sense and the use of extends emphasizes that src is being used in a read-only sense
similarly in fill the super while not needed emphasizes that the list is being written to but not read

30013433
super	extends
similarly in fill the super while not needed emphasizes that the list is being written to but not read
in max the extends emphasizes that the list is being read but not written to

30021190
shadowing	named
you shouldn t give your instance field the same named as the class because that causes variable shadowing - wikipedia says in part variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope decision block method or inner class has the same named as a variable declared in an outer scope
at the level of identifiers named rather than variables this is known as named masking

30023214
multiplying	multiplication
let s just experiment with a simple array start with 3 arrays i took these from another sparse matrix but that isn t important these arrays have been assigned to 3 attributes of the new matrix now try multiplying the .data attribute low and behold we have multiplied the whole array of course we can also multiplying the matrix directly
that is multiplication by a constant is defined for csr sparse matrices out of curiousity lets look at the source array

30024762
google-chrome	firefox
a quick test in google-chrome shows that an alert on the very next line does execute and wait for user input before it finishes loading the next location but this is undocumented behavior and is not safe to count on
in firefox the alert briefly flashes on screen but does not wait for user input and the new page is loaded

30025522
serializable	deserialization
jquery ajax will do it automatically for you in regards to 1 you can setup the web api serializable to convert server side pascalcase to client side camelcase and viceversa but you still need to take this into account when converting the property names between client and server side
there are several problems in your code the deserialization is case sensitive so the properties on js side must have the same case that the properties on the server side you need to pass the person object as parameter directly not included as the person property of an object although it generally doesn t hurt you do t need to stringify the object

30029404
octal	binary
although you re only using 1 s and 0 s this doesn t make the numbers you re typing in binary numbers they re decimal or octal if you start with 0
if you want to use binary numbers prefix them with 0b assuming python 2.6 at least

30030176
implements	extends
i m not aware if dbcontext supports indexed properties but if it does you may manage to do something like this if you re sure that all your entities are inamed then you can achieve it all in one line please note that the latter approach will rise or throw an exception if the retrieved entity is not implements inamed
all your entities should extends a base class or implement an interface that defines a name property

30031080
rpm	yum
rpm -q --whatrequires r-core might tell you
if it doesn t it might be a library or binary dependency and so you ll need to run yum whatrequires on the various libraries binaries listed in the output from rpm -q --provides r-core and or rpm -ql r-core

30031080
rpm	yum
if it doesn t it might be a library or binary dependency and so you ll need to run yum whatrequires on the various libraries binaries listed in the output from rpm -q --provides r-core and or rpm -ql r-core
that being said the fact that you built r yourself isn t going to help you in this case as rpm doesn t know anything about that nor is it likely to be installed in a location that official fedora packages can use

30031299
translation	localization
just to make sure translation work which can be extensive doesn t get deleted
if you find such an marked entry in a localization file you will also find other occurences in other localization files for that key as well - if there are any further translations

30031904
bash	zsh
or for that matter single-quote any string literal you want to preserve as is . however in a default zsh environment this would not be a problem because is not a valid brace expression and is therefore simply printed as is equally applies to bash dash and ksh
verify with kudos to chepner for suspecting that the brace_cll zsh option may be set which indeed does produce the symptom as chepner states brace_ccl causes to be treated as a character class containing one character rather than being treated literally

30034605
swift	objective-c
to preserve the metadata it s this simple or for objective-c edit while this works in the ios simulator it did not work on a real device running the swift code
while this was possible to do in objective-c as bradley showed it did not work correctly in swift and would cause the performchanges block to fail see my other question

30034605
swift	objective-c
while this was possible to do in objective-c as bradley showed it did not work correctly in swift and would cause the performchanges block to fail see my other question
this has been addressed in the latest releases - swift 1.2 in xcode 6.3

addition	modulo
unsigned addition strictly speaking does not overflow
rather than result is reduced modulo max + 1 where max is the maximum value of the unsigned type

30037071
google-chrome	safari
if i try using the favicon from another part of my filesystem it doesn t seems to work - so maybe that s a solution for google-chrome
local file and safari still looking for a way - above code doesn t work for my up2date safari

30038237
prng	random
print .join random.choice chars for i in range length python s default prng is a mersenne twister which is not a cryptographically strong prng so i m wary of using it for cryptographic purposes
the random module includes random.systemrandom which on at least most nix systems should use a csprng

30038360
google-chrome	firefox
note if it doesn t work it is most likely because you did not completely stop google-chrome logging out and back in will surely do the trick
as axel wrote firefox has the print.always_print_silent option

swift	objective-c
but one post i found did explain this albeit it s in objective-c the swift version should look something like this i m no expert but the syntax isn t too bad .
in terms of other answers this is probably the best post i ve seen on this topic presenting uiviewcontroller from skscene additionally i found this one on transitioning between scenes spritekit how to create and transition to different scenes swift language i hope that helps

30042081
decoder	encoder
smtpclient will read the content-type and charset encoding from messages sent and decoder the content of the message and subject according to the encoding it finds in the headers
if your message is not getting decoded it seems that the messages are possibly not encoded correctly or potentially double encoded utf-8 encoded string getting encoded again by a message encoder the request headers on the message don t properly match the actual encoding of the message or a charset format that isn t supported in .net is used

30044512
google-chrome	firefox
all of these tutorials and references seem to agree source maps 101 google-chrome windows source maps with coffeescript and uglify.js google-chrome osx using source maps with typescript google-chrome windows the breakpoint ep 3 the sourcemap spectacular with paul irish and addy osmani google-chrome developers video source maps in google-chrome dev tools enhance your javascript debugging life google-chrome windows it seems that if one really wants to hide the transpiled javascript files in devtools firefox is the way to go for now as of google-chrome canary 49
firefox 23+ has the option to show original sources instead of transpiled scripts unfortunately it seems you cannot enjoy this in google-chrome

30047109
cloudant	couchdb
the all_or_nothing flag is not supported on cloudant
it was removed when couchdb was forked and became bigcouch

sudo	passwd
shell_exec echo passwd | sudo -s . myscript
but i m not sure if it ll work with sudo

30052652
awt	swing
the keys things to remember about swing threads are that you should not do long-running calculations on the special awt swing thread or the gui will freeze because the swing thread never gets a chance to process gui events
any activity triggered from the gui by an event handler on a button etc will be running on the swing thread by default

30055226
webclient	webrequest
windows phone downloading and saving a file async in windows phone 8 using webclient has its own cancellation mechanism the cancelasync method you can connect it to your cancellation token using the token s register method mytoken.register mywebclient.cancelasync
using the abstract webrequest if it was not created using an attached cancelation token as seems to be the case for your edited example and you are not actually downloading a file but reading a content string you need to use a combination of a few of the earlier mentioned methods

30056778
fgets	strcpy
use fgets instead with a proper buffer size argument of course
the strcpy call copies the characters not the pointer

30056778
strcpy	malloc
so no it s not correct but the problem is not that it uses strcpy that s fine
and perhaps it s not surprising that i too think that you should not cast the return value of malloc in c

30057284
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
from the javadoc for runtimeexception runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception do not need to be declared in a method or constructor s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary

30058875
swift	objective-c
the swift compiler runs on your mac not on the ios device
the same is true for objective-c

30059069
build.gradle	gradlew
from my experience using the idea plugin does not always work correctly in intellij and actually intellij documentation guidelines are to simply import build.gradle file
also peter niederwieser who is a principal software engineer at gradleware answered a similar question 2 years ago mentioning the following if you use gradlew s idea task to generate project files this is normal as there is no way to tell idea what the class path of the build script itself is

30060794
multiplying	division
your later calculations require degrees and even if you needed minutes of arc you d multiplying by 60 not divide
this mistaken division results in a longitude of -1.3 deg

30063595
freebsd	linux
applications being used on older freebsd releases or on a linux system without ext4 could be made to run in compatibility mode on an up to date os for example but whether they would properly handle the time fields is a good question
for me running this little script as sh birthtime_test confirms that file creation times are turned on on my freebsd systems all of which use zfs post v28 with feature flags output 9.2-release-p10 name new_born born may 7 12 38 35 2015 access may 7 12 38 38 2015 modify may 7 12 38 41 2015 change may 7 12 38 44 2015 hello from new_born at thu may 7 12 38 41 edt 2015 nb the chmod operation changes but does not modify the file contents - this is what the echo command does by adding content to the file

30064246
shadowing	named
not shadowing built-ins do not shadow built-in types and functions such as list with variables named list
use xs or something more appropriately named

30064604
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
since it seems the google-chrome safari will actually return a usable date and firefox ie doesn t we can at least setup some error handling to detect if the date was output correctly and handle accordingly
in firefox if we pass the invalid date string into the isnan function it returns true

30064656
google-chrome	firefox
solved the firefox issue but not google-chrome as it shows the ugly autofill box over content
if you add autocomplete off to each of the fields individually then again works in firefox but for the input fields that have this attribute autocomplete in google-chrome is off but the autofill still rears its ugly head

30064780
imperative	declarative
imperative programming then is just a list of commands do this do that
here s an imperative way of displaying whether two numbers are equal to each other or not while accepting user input in java essentially declarative knowledge skips over certain elements to form a layer of abstraction over those elements

30065617
profiling	debugging
though starting then ending the script profiling works fine too
the console profiling apis console.profile and consoleprofileend only function when ie11 is not in debugging mode

30065617
profiling	debugging
the console profiling apis console.profile and consoleprofileend only function when ie11 is not in debugging mode
unfortunately launching f12 puts ie into debugging mode

30066537
prepare	execute
learn and make use of prepare statements once you start using prepare statements you ll not only make things much secure but can speed up your inserts for order detail s rows
yes i use auto_increment and also prepare in all insertions before execute query connection- prepare sql

30072268
comparator	comparable
the closest code with correct syntax is this means the method will accept a list of any kind but to sort the list there must be some way to compare its elements - hence the original signature which means each element can be compared with every other element via the comparator method
the syntax is not nearly as useful - it just requires that the list contain objects that are comparable but not necessarily to each other

30072965
swift	objective-c
don t import the swift file in your objective-c file like #import examplefile.swift but use #import projectname-swift.h make sure you use objective-c statements in your swift code that you want to import to objective-c these are the links that were helpful apple documentation how-to-import-swift-code-to-objective-c
the same error occurred to me after i ve added the first swift file to my objective-c project. that s how i fixed it make sure you use an ios source file not os x source when you ve added the file

30079048
aggregate-functions	sum
the error message isn t too hard to decode contains an expression isnull ... on result of aggregate-functions sum ... so you re not allowed to do anything further to the result of an aggregate-functions
here what i d suggest is to create one view that just performs the sum operations and is indexed and then if necessary another view that just queries this first view isn t indexed and contains the isnull expressions

30080585
sudo	passwd
i used ubuntu 13.10 saucy salamander 64-bit.10 08 04 am update the system package list 10 08 04 am sudo apt-get update10 08 04 am optional - i recommend upgrading all installed packages even the kernel
there may be reasons not to want this however 10 08 04 am sudo apt-get dist-upgrade10 08 04 am install lxde and tightvnc this will take a while depending on the instance type 10 08 04 am sudo apt-get install lxde tightvncserver10 08 04 am reboot the system 10 08 04 am sudo reboot10 08 04 am start up a vnc server on localhost - since vnc itself isn t very secure we ll use ssh 10 08 04 am vncserver -geometry 1024x768 -depth 16 -localhost 110 08 04 am note the vnc server will ask you to set and confirm a passwd

cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
and just because cpython 3.2+ and pypy 3.x versions happen to contain this optimization and it s an obvious good idea and easy to do there s no reason that ironpython or newkickasspython 3.x couldn t leave it out
and in fact cpython 3.0-3.1 didn t include it. if range actually were a generator like my_crappy_range then it wouldn t make sense to test __contains__ this way or at least the way it makes sense wouldn t be obvious

30082807
coalesce	isnull
coalesce will go through the listed values and choose the first one that isn t null it s more portable code than isnull or ivnl etc
query insert into new_table id name age select id coalesce first_name last_name age from old_table

opensuse	linux	vmware	virtualbox
general information virtualbox 4.3.26 chip download opensuse already installed for vmware directly to download available here 1 3gb how to use the downloaded opensuse.vdi file with virtualbox is described here importing a vdi in virtualbox opensuse should not be running inside virtualbox
afterwards system preparations and the linux guest additions for the virtualbox have to be installed in opensuse

30090725
ssl	https
you can use something like wireshark to capture the ssl handshake between git and the server and see the options being passed back and forth
at least on my system curl does not seem to support this cipher and git uses libcurl for handling https http connections

30090852
onclick	onchange
onclick on option tag doesn t seem to work on other browsers
instead of onclick use onchange on select tag

30095853
listview	gridview
what you really need to understand with recyclerview is that it s not the same control as a listview with a funky adapter
recyclerview does not exhibit many of the listview s functionalities and whilst it s understandable to compare it to a listview or a gridview or event a staggeredgridview it shouldn t be confused with them

30096463
rtp	rtsp
regarding your output you have a lot of udp packet loss rtp missed 6 packets
if you re trying to play the rtsp stream on the same local network where your server is located then it s definitely not normal

30101750
factors	matrix
without cbind a b and c are not converted to factors
cbind a b c y returns a matrix that does not allow multiple types of data

30101976
factors	matrix
i m assuming this is not the behavior you want and since data.frame will nicely cbind things for you while maintaining their original types except for converting strings to factors which as i said can be suppressed i would stick with the simpler data.frame a b construct
by default cbind returns a matrix which can only have one data type

30102689
valgrind	gprof
perhaps a tool like valgrind can help
you are correct that traditional profiles such as gprof work by inserting additional code at compile time and will not be helpful in your current situation

30103110
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	linux
i was not able to compile chromium on opensuse without lots of troubles but as in your case it worked fine on ubuntu for me
chromium requirements section says you should be able to build chromium on any reasonably modern linux distribution but there are a lot of distributions and we sometimes break things on one or another

30108293
google-chrome	firefox
depending on the browser you re using a keypress event will be triggered or not -- backspace will trigger keydown keypress keyup on firefox but only keydown keyup on google-chrome
on firefox keydown keypress keyup when browser registers a keyboard input but also for backspace arrow keys tab so here keypress is fired even with no input keydown keyup for alt shift this shouldn t be surprising because according to note as the keypress event isn t covered by any official specification the actual behavior encountered when using it may differ across browsers browser versions and platforms

30109798
ssl	https
the library you re using should have a method of verifying the servers ssl cert if it doesn t automatically do this for you
there is no technical reason that you should have to encrypt anything that will being sent over https so long as the certificate is strongly encrypted

30112701
bower	npm
however it ll also perform any necessary additional setup required by the blueprint or add-on hooks adding bower dependencies editing a .jshintrc file or many other tasks
this might not be applicable to some add-ons but it is a good idea to use ember install over npm install for add-ons

30113170
google-chrome	firefox
it is curious problem that these properties could be overwritten in google-chrome but not in firefox firefox api
so when you set then outerwidth is changed to 960 in google-chrome

30114705
daemons	systemd
once that s in there you can enable the daemons to run at boot with sudo systemctl enable solr and you can start stop status it with 3
making systemd logs persistent by default systemd logs are not persistent and they are lost whenever you reboot the systemd

30114705
daemons	systemd
if that s not what you desire you can make them persistent by creating a directory sudo mkdir -p var log journal and then restarting the systemd journaling daemons sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald once that s complete systemd s journaling daemons will receive all the stdout and stderr that solr creates and it will get stored in a binary format under var log journal
the way systemd handles logging is pretty neat and is worth studying if you re not familiar with it

30114907
jar	manifest.mf
1 have a jar just with a meta-inf manifest.mf the manifest must be properly configured with premain-class and other attributes
the jar doesn t need any other files

30114921
union	distinct
rather it merely permits the active union member to be changed by a class member access expression
a new barrier operation distinct from std launder which does not create objects should be introduced to the standard library with semantics equivalent to a memmove with the same source and destination storage

30116006
google-chrome	firefox
plan b for multistream bundle which google-chrome implements was not adopted
firefox has now in fx38 which goes out in a few days implemented the unified plan

30118922
super	implements
the solution isn t the removal of the super call
instead of creating this viewcontroller and every other view controller inherit from this one you could create a commonviewcontroller which implements everything that is common between your view controllers create a facebookloginviewcontroller which also inherit from commonviewcontroller

30120630
implements	extends
for repositories this is often used with a base entity class or interface containing properties that all entities implements like id you could do that as well with an extension method without generics you d have to implements the repository or the extension method for every type
why not use an extension method in this case you generally only use those when you can t extends the base type

30120979
udp	tcp
for example some exchange protocol have one udp packet with multiple fast messages bundled you should not reset the dictionary in between
the link doesn t say you should reset the dictionary before processing each fast message but it does say you should reset it before processing each tcp udp packets or after connection established

libstdc++	libc++
i ll be looking into pushing this to libstdc++ upstream in the next few days
... as i noted to dyp in the comments it is not uncommon to see systems where clang uses libstdc++ as opposed to libc++ and if we test this on coliru explicitly using libstdc++ via we indeed can reproduce the issue

30122881
libstdc++	libc++
... as i noted to dyp in the comments it is not uncommon to see systems where clang uses libstdc++ as opposed to libc++ and if we test this on coliru explicitly using libstdc++ via we indeed can reproduce the issue
the following libstdc++ bug report bad enum values computed by operator in ios_base.h covers this issue and says the overloaded operator s defined for the enumerations in ios_base.h have the following form the creates values outside the range of values of the enumeration type so the cast back to the enum type has an unspecified value see expr.static.cast p10 and in practice it produces an enum value outside the range of representable values for the enum type so behavior is undefined

30124606
awt	swing
all the code in your mouseclicked event handler will run on the special awt swing thread
repaint does not repaint the gui immediately - it schedules a repaint see this article which will also run on the swing thread - but not until your event handler has finished - the swing thread can only do one thing at a time

30126966
dictionary	map
for example you will probably find that your issue is actually that your dictionary does not contain the key you are looking up
from the spark documentation normally when a function passed to a spark operation such as map or reduce is executed on a remote cluster node it works on separate copies of all the variables used in the function

30127733
persistent	transient
it doesn t matter which side you bind or connect on so long as you bind on the persistent side your server and connect on the transient side your client
if they are equally persistent then the next way to choose is to bind on the side that owns the data the way a server does and connect on the side that wants the data the way a client does

30133227
profiling	debugging
check that your app id has the required permissions enabled and that your provisioning profiling s which you use with your build schema when you run the app on the devices have been regenerated with the new permissions entitlements
if everything is ok after checking up the above steps my two cents would be that the provisioning profiling that you use for your debugging schema which you use to build the app to run on the device does not contain the required entitlements

super	extends
in this case there s one so you d have to use public ipanel string backgroundpath tanks mainvenster correction it isn t necessarily that you need to it seems ideal to me but in a constructor one of the superclass s constructors need to be called with super ...
meaning if i had class a with its constructor and class b extends a i could do a few things no matter what in the end if your superclass only contains constructors with parameters every constructor of the subclassing will need to call super ... to one of the superclass s constructors

30134375
client-side	server-side
the displaytime function runs on the client-side
since the server-side code runs before the client-side code does the server does not know what changes displaytime is going to make

30134955
build.gradle	gradlew
put this in your app dependencies and in your library s build.gradle add then the library will be built in the same mode as the app
contrary to previous revisions of this answer i ve confirmed a flavor is not required on the library this may be due to gradlew or android plugin versions - i m using gradlew 2.14 and android plugin 2.1.0 and did not require it

30134962
jruby	mri
puma performs very well with rubinius or jruby
the gvl in mri will cause it not to perform as well with mri

30135032
setinterval	settimeout
use the setinterval method
do not use nested settimeout statements this is what causes the stack size error

30135835
hex	binary
a hex string representation works in an sql query without the quotes not with but does not work with an echo
you may be able to pack the string in to a binary string

30136087
prng	random
so an ideal prng should eventually emit a perfectly uniform distribution actually often not perfect but within a known very small margin over a sufficiently long period
your random seed will pick a random point somewhere in that sequence and your random number requests will proceed some way along that sequence but if you ever find yourself going all the way around and coming back to your own start point or even within 1 10th that distance then you need to get a bigger prng

30137368
udp	tcp
multiple send s translating to single recv and in udp the opposite
tcp is stream protocol and not message oriented

the listview scrolls correctly but only the first item of every page is highlighted

30140960
swift	objective-c
in general when writing swift code i would recommend using swift types as much as possible not objective-c types
so where you have this i would write this now if we get that far without crashing swift knows that firstpat is an array of dictionaries which is much more than you were telling it before

answer depends on engine you use myisam - adding id to index can and probably will help innodb - primary key is already part of each secondary index because innodb stores rows in btree sorted by primary key and index needs primary to point to actual row - in that case adding it is redundant if it is last in the index but doing so won t add it twice so it should not make things worse
in some cases you may want to add it as not-last or you have multicolumn primary and you add some columns to your index in different order - there should be no problem with it innodb will append remaining columns of primary to that index but can use those added before without duplicating them so answers in innodb it is unnecessary in myisam it is good in case you actually use that sorting if you dont use it adding it only makes that index bigger

implements	extends
there is the technical problem that the compiler can t decide for a lambda expression which method to implements when there are multiple default methods and there is the semantic problem that an interface consisting entirely of default methods is not abstract
you can t instantiate this default behavior as you can t instantiate interface s and are forcing programmers to create concrete classes just to invoke the default behavior which since interfaces are stateless could be provided by a singleton instead note that you can have interfaces extends a functional interface and providing a default method if you need

namenode	hdfs
above results clarify that large number of small files is a overhead of naemnode memory as it takes more space of namenode memory. block name and block id is a unique id of a particular block of data.this uniue id is getting used to identified the block during reading of the data when client make a request to read data.hence it can not be shared
hdfs is designed to handle large files

persistent	transient
first we must define all entity states new transient a newly created object that hasn t ever been associated with a hibernate session a.k.a persistent context and is not mapped to any database table row is considered to be in the new transient state
to become persisted we need to either explicitly call the entitymanager#persist method or make use of the transitive persistent mechanism

multiplying	addition
choosing the term multiplying is unfortunate since the situation described is not one where the contributions to probabilities is independent where multiplication of probabilities would be the natural term to use

there are other usage cases for strncmp too such as working with non-c-string data
strncmp does not have advantages over strcmp

serializable	deserialization
the reason i store the type s hash here is so that i can perform type checking before serializable make sure a float isn t being serializable where an int should be
for the deserialization process i will be using this technique since i do not know the type i will simply have to expect that the cast from void matches up with the serializable process although i can at least check the numberofbytes value and ideally the typehash as well if those are available

memcached is used for variable caching just like apc but the advantage comes when you are planning to scale your application
if you want to deploy more than 1 php application servers horizontal scaling and if you are not using the database for php session management then if you use the apc for cache there will be lots of problems as you don t know in which apc server your code is present

how i managed to import swift into objective-c defines module set to yes on project - not on target product module name set on target - not on project in your viewcontroller.m import the swift code with #import myproductmodulename-swift.h add a swift file to your objective-c project file - new - swift and xcode will create the bridging header from objective-c to swift but this is crucial for making it work the other way around too - apparently

serializable shouldn t need it

30205743
serializable	deserialization
serializable shouldn t need it
the default constructor is redundant because if the deserialization package needs a default constructor it obviously attempts to create an instance using the default constructor to afterwards set the field values which can t work with final fields

30208935
prepare	execute
and you should switch to a more modern non-deprecated... database interface like pdo or mysqli that will allow you to use prepare statements
the reason nothing changes in your database is that you are just setting a string containing a - very risky and sql injection open - query but you do not actually execute the query

gridview	repeater
controls placed on data list repeater gridview are not accessed directly like other server controls placed on the page
if you want to access it through code behind you can access it on data-bound or item_command event of the repeater because these controls itself act as containers for other controls placed on them

then to use pickled model if you try to pickle the ibmmodel1 object which is a lambda function you ll end up with this note the above code snippet comes from nltk version 3.0.0 in python3 with nltk 3.0.0 you will also face the same problem because ibmmodel1 returns a lambda function note in python3 pickle is cpickle see
the immediate answer is to pickle it see but because ibmmodel1 returns a lambda function it s not possible to pickle it with the default pickle cpickle see and so we ll use dill

disabling things client-side is a nice plus if it indicates that functionality is not available and it might save you and your users some time and bandwidth but there are gonna be those who try to circumvent it and for those you need to be prepared
disabling things server-side means just denying execution just put an exit

multiplying	modulo
while you can sprinkle mod all over the place you should careful consider whether you need it or not taking john s hint into account adding two n-digit numbers produces a number of up to n+1 digits and multiplying an n-digit number by an m-digit number produces a result with up to n + m digits
as such there are places where you will need use modulo properties and there are some where you surely don t need it but this is your part of the work

noexcept	throw
from andrzej s c++ blog which says i will attempt to quote the minimum here emphasis mine in this post i would like to share my observation on where using noexcept really adds value
it is less often than what one might expect and it does not have that much to do with throw or not throw exceptions

30225086
noexcept	throw
and then he goes on to given an unusual move assignment definition and argues that what we really want to convey is not that it does not throw exceptions but that it does not fail but that is very difficult problem but it is out real intent ... this is because the information that noexcept really is intended to convey is that the function never fails
not that it never throw

30225086
noexcept	throw
and recommends each library function having a wide contract that the lwg agree cannot throw should be marked as unconditionally noexcept
and implies that functions with narrow contracts should not be noexcept which is backed up by lwg issue 2337 which says ... these design considerations override our general policy against noexcept for narrow-contract functions

30225676
noexcept	throw
would you expect that it never fails even if noexcept does not offer such guarantee
on the other hand by not using it when you know for certain it cannot throw exceptions would make another programmer worry about providing a try-clause when calling this function

hash-collision	key
the trick is to use objects instead of strings as key and to override the hash comparison see how hash-collision are resolved in python dictionaries the comments below debate the technical aspects of whether these are duplicate key or not but this is a side issue
to find duplicate key you could do this adapted from another question find and list duplicates in python list yes multidict and querydict structures create lists of values for each key but those don t address the original question s supposition of duplicate key

factors	matrix
assuming your data is in a data frame with strings not factors like this next time share your data with dput to make its structure easily reproducible. i would go for a vectorized solution
here i converted to matrix and then paste the column names to the entries separated by new lines n and dashes as in your example

in the meantime the main issue here is that ubuntu hasn t historically been one of the supported images for bdutil
we thoroughly validate centos and debian images but not ubuntu images since they were only added as gce options in november 2014

30254413
vfork	posix
the handling should be equivalent regardless of the vfork vs fork child should return with a special exit code and parent should do the normal waitpid and check the exit status
otherwise if you want to write a portable application do not use the vfork it is not part of the posix standard

30255495
dataframe	multi-index
but in any case just adding the two dataframe will not work as you cannot add datetimes
you can indeed do this with setting those two columns date and bin as a multi-index and then use add to specify a fill value otherwise you get nans another option is to concatenate the two frames and then group by the two columns date and bin the reason for the error message you get above is that apparantly the dtypes of a certain column in df1 and df2 is not matching

30262665
h.264	webm
also bigbluebutton does not use h.264 encoder decoder even for playback as it respects the commercial license agreements and supports only webm for this from version 0.81 the latest so you don t need to worry about the same see this discussion about h.264
you would need to only pay royalty fees if you are charging for content if you are not charging for content then h.264 is free to use see this release

30266980
onclick	onchange
a good way to hook into the onchange method is to use dojo on and do something like this in your specific situation i would actually modify the cellwidget.identopmode onclick part to be onchange instead
i think what you re looking for is the onchange event and not the onclick and you might be looking for a dropdownbutton instead of a combobutton but either way onchange is the method you should be looking for

30267402
onclick	onsubmit
another note i think that onclick event does not works fine with submit type inputs so i suggest to replace it with onsubmit event in the form itself as
the origin of your issue is using multiple id attributes with the same value in your javascript events this is regarded wrong every element id must be unique beside this onclick event with submit typed inputs of form is not working properly

30267466
operands	scalar
end note the value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator
if a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object and they are not potentially concurrent 1.10 the behavior is undefined

30272405
dictionary	map
the dictionary type in c++ is std map you could use a static dictionary in a scope and then search in it
so a straight equivalent 1 1 conversion would be something along those lines the advantage of using a statically stored dictionary instead of one with automatic storage duration here is that the container does not to be initialized allocations

30274372
ssl	https
instead add another condition which tells if its not https request so try this you need ssl certificate for https protocol to work also i ve added flag which tells to not process further rules
the first rule is taking precedence over https request because it simply met the rewrite condition

30281922
realloc	strcpy	memcpy	strcpy
you allocate memory for the destination string you then use realloc unnecessarily as explained above and then you allocate space again and do this which does nothing more than memcpy nombre2 nombre i
you did not allocate space for the terminating nul byte so strcpy will fail in your code causing possible a segmentation fault or anything else since it s undefined behavior

30281922
strcpy	malloc
you did not allocate space for the terminating nul byte so strcpy will fail in your code causing possible a segmentation fault or anything else since it s undefined behavior
you should also be sure that string has enough space to copy the characters into it or just return a pointer to the malloc ed string in your function which returns char and i don t know whether that is useful or not since you didn t post enough code to tell

30282270
ssl	https
and then force ssl and www for non-ssl incoming traffic by putting these rewrite rules above the wordpress rewrite block in .htaccess that will take care of all wordpress urls and should take care of the custom post types too
but check your cpt functions in functions.php or other theme files for absolute http urls and remove the http and leaving the and not like check your theme s style sheets for absolute urls that are http the same way and header links too and it s a good idea to search all your post page content to change all http links to https for images and internal links

30283080
elasticsearch	kibana
when starting kibana elasticsearch make sure your es cluster is ready before diving into kibana run curl -xget localhost 9200 _cluster health and in the response you should see something similar to this as for your script it is written correctly however the condition you mentioned is not correct since you wanted and not so it should be please give it a try
what you are seeing is not a parsing error shardfailures just means that the underlying elasticsearch is not ready yet

30286457
setinterval	settimeout
you should not be using setinterval inside of the clock function
it should be settimeout

setinterval	settimeout
using setinterval means on every iteration you are adding another interval
thirdly settimeout setinterval is not accurate

30287059
google-chrome	firefox
based on that i simplified your fiddle to the following note that it s not a complete solution because eventually the rot string will get too long and on google-chrome that behaves as expected

say you have if you want to get use this function if you want to get all elements contained in either a1 or a2 but not both -- the so-called symmetric difference use this function lodash underscore.js if you are using lodash you can use _.difference a1 a2 case 1 above or _.xor a1 a2 case 2
if you are using underscore.js you can use the _.difference a1 a2 function for case 1

30289091
implements	extends
here s how i implements it
racket class player extends racket edit this is not the complete classes

30289545
sudo	passwd
open the config file in your text editor you might need to run it with sudo in order to have permission to edit it then scroll to the end
adding this line host pg_sampleapp me 1 128 passwd gives your user me the permission to access the database pg_sampleapp after providing the correct passwd but only from localhost meaning from within your server itself and not when connecting to it from the outside

30289826
clang	llvm
it s not officially part of llvm though full toolchains based on clang often use it
llvm is a framework for manipulating llvm ir the bytecode you re alluding to and lowering it to target-specific binaries for example x86 machine code

30289933
profiling	debugging
in this demo profiling i created one eventprovider eventprovider_dotnetruntime for provider microsoft-windows-dotnetruntime without stacks to capture jit and gc data and an other eventprovider eventprovider_dotnetruntime_stack for provider microsoft-windows-dotnetruntime with stacks to capture stacks for exceptions and loader events
when you now run windows performance recorder to capture the data c program files x86 windows kits 8.1 windows performance toolkit wpr.exe -start dotnetruntime.wprp stop the recording c program files x86 windows kits 8.1 windows performance toolkit wpr.exe -stop result.etl open the trace with windows performance analyzer load the debugging symbols you can see the stacks for the exception data but not for jit or gc events attention

automake	autotools
out-of-tree building is a feature of autotools that requires both autoconf and automake
vim and git both only use autoconf and not automake so they can t take advantage of that feature

30290109
automake	autotools
vim and git both only use autoconf and not automake so they can t take advantage of that feature
as a more general answer to your question simple autotools projects should work with out-of-tree builds automatically

30290131
serializable	deserialization
serializable in itself isn t trivial because one quickly has to cope with cyclical references so a recursive algorithm on a set of unknown properties is required
if that doesn t sound complicated enough the deserialization or hydration of objects is even more painful so it s not exactly the type of code that is super rewarding to write unless it s highly reusable

30290987
strncpy	malloc
as mentioned in the comments my mr chqrlie and explained in the nice article by keith thompson you should not be using strncpy
to be on safer side you can make use of strdup to avoid the overhead and pitfalls of malloc + strcpy

30291140
ionic	angular
i cannot follow your code so i ll try to recreate. in ionic cordova you should have an index.html which would be your entry for the application
this is the place where you bind your html with the angular app and where your reference your scripts

30291885
swift	objective-c
perhaps you meant to use in which case i believe your code needs to be here s a link detailing more about adding an mkpolyline overlay to change the documentation from displaying objective-c to swift there s a control in the top-right corner of the page
that error message is very misleading - checking the documentation for mkpolyline there isn t actually a static method called polylinewithcoordinates for swift you may be looking at the objective-c version of the documentation

30293761
udp	tcp
edit so that no one complains i m talking straight tcp ip and not udp where the connection needs to be established
udp does use a multicast concept and setting it up is rather easy

30295496
build.gradle	gradlew
if you are adding the support library to a project that doesn t have it then you just need to add a single line to your app module s build.gradle file and then sync gradlew
build.gradle it should just be that easy though there may be some things to note android studio should give you a warning nowadays if the support library needs to be updated

30296036
gitolite	gitosis
gitolite replaces gitosis which is dead since 2009
git even the latest git for windows 2.4.1 release most definitively does not include gitolite which is a collection of perl script managing authorization after authentication

30300043
inline	inlining
it s also worth noting that inline is more of a hint than anything else and some compilers just outright ignore it and treat it only as a specifier for internal linkage
you can actually get something faster in a real world scenario if you or the optimizer choose not to inline something as it might help reduce instruction cache misses for example or help the optimizer allocate registers for a more common case branch of execution sometimes inter-procedural optimization actually interferes by reducing your code to a flat playing field when you might want the optimization to be a bit more skewed towards a common case branch of code and excessive inlining can actually seem to interfere with this and give worse results

macros do not provide such a luxury for the compiler or linker to selectively inline things but they re a very different kind of code-generating tool

30301184
strcpy	malloc
you are freeing a non-heap variable you shouldn t remove this you allocate space for img member just one byte an empty string requires one byte for the terminating 0 you then do strcpy which is meant for strings non- nul sequence of bytes followed by a nul byte
maybe you mean which is also the same as you should check the return value of malloc

30305128
google-chrome	firefox
with jaws 16 both ie and google-chrome have the problem you describe but firefox 38 works correctly not sure about previous versions of firefox
when i tab to the link where the has and there s not an aria-disabled true on the firefox 38 and jaws 16 says previous page unavailable link

30308286
decoder	encoder
in general you re limited to either playing the video as fast as the device can decoder it or playing just the key frames
if you know enough about the layout of a specific video in a specific encoding you may be able to do better play the i and p but not the b but i m not sure that s even possible in avc. the frequency of i frames is determined by the video encoder

30310497
onresume	onpause
the other reason just calling close and exiting onpause isn t recommended today is that it will prevent other apps from opening the camera in their onresume calls which will cause spurious errors when switching between camera apps
so to summarize for now wait for cameradevice.statecallback#onclosed to be invoked before exiting onpause after calling cameradevice#close

30311565
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i see several issues with what you posted here are just two you are calling locationmanager.startupdatinglocation from viewdidload this will only fire if the view is not already loaded into memory
recommend moving this into viewwillappear so it fires every time

30311819
multiplying	multiplication
there are lots of cpu gpu combinations where a 32b integer multiplying is faster than a 32b floating-point multiplying on cpu and vice-versa on gpu
sure for a long time it was pretty common for gpus to not have native support for 32b integer arithmetic especially multiplication

30313437
avr	microcontroller
this is not only for x86 but also for most other cpu families and operating system notably arm x86 mips msp430 microcontroller avr microcontroller linux windows os-x ios android which uses linux os dos
for microcontroller there is often no heap all memory is allocated at run-time and the stack may be organized a bit differently

30314206
daemons	systemd
probably not a direct answer to the question but systemd can be used to run your application as a daemons
here is an example i prefer this method because a lot of the work is done for you and then your daemons script behaves similarly to the rest of your systemd

30315176
strcpy	strdup
in the case where you re not allowed to dynamically allocate memory the use of strncpy is still a more secure alternative to strcpy
it depends on what you are allowed to use but i guess the safest way would be to use strdup and check if it has returned null

30315780
union	distinct
if that condition doesn t hold then you need a union which giorgi s answer explains
given your data where the values are the same in the two columns if they are both there then select distinct coalesce a b from table t

30315914
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not implement this yet but firefox does
the following is a complete webrtc call that works in firefox note uses arrow functions that s 20 lines of code quite a bit smaller than other versions you may have seen

30316674
.htaccess	httpd.conf
looking at your httpd.conf i think you problem is because you are using c xampp htdocs cms as your document root but in the httpd.conf file the documentroot is defined as c xampp htdocs so if your .htaccess is located in c xampp htdocs cms which is not your actual document root when you go to nothing is happening because it s reading from c xampp htdocs and there is probably just default files or nothing so that s probably why you got the xampp home page
so you should just remove this code altogether and just update the existing documentroot and directory directives already in the httpd.conf and add cms directory as your document root

30316889
express	node.js
you can read about serving static files in express here
a node.js server does not serve any files by default this is different that some other web servers

30317370
udp	tcp
with tcp a socket needs to be connected with udp not
this means you can use the same unconnected udp socket to send data to multiple peers destination is an argument for the sendto function

30317370
udp	tcp
this means you can use the same unconnected udp socket to send data to multiple peers destination is an argument for the sendto function
you cannot do this with tcp you need a connected socket for each single peer

30317370
udp	tcp
you can receive data from multiple peers on an unconnected udp socket
you cannot do this with tcp

30319101
cdr	cons
cdr ls reverse acc helper cdr ls cons confidence acc this is tail-recursive since the recursive case is only a call to the function itself - the result of the recursive call isn t used for anything else
the reversal is needed because the cons in the accumulator builds the list in the reverse order

30324106
tiff	bmp
i m not sure what software does support floating point tiffs though as this is certainly outside of baseline tiff
bmp is not suitable for floating point

30324364
prng	random
unfortunately you face two serious problems netlogo really does not provide access to random number generators other than the global one and much of the access to that prng is implicit
so for example whenever you use ask you are implicitly drawing from the global prng

30326269
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the function is available in browsers newer than google-chrome 39 and firefox 31
it is not supported by internet explorer and safari at the time of writing

30326336
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the function is available in browsers newer than google-chrome 39 and firefox 31
it is not supported by internet explorer and safari at the time of writing

30329162
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you should not set view frames in viewdidload centering a view
frames are not setup yet so you should move that to viewwillappear or some other variant

30329627
serializable	deserialization
for serialversionuid please read the following if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

30331583
innodb	myisam
the things you ve come to expect daily to happen in sql server not some flatfile database which corrupts on a whim and needs specific delete commands to delete all related record information across all the tables which magento doesn t provide as it s expecting innodb magento running on myisam suffers from database bloat because deleting stuff in one table leaves all the related junk in the other 5-6 tables that are supposed to be keyed to the base table
moving forward you will need to take care of your storage problem and then convert to innodb

30344808
implements	extends
you don t have to do this -- your wrapper class is a subclassing of the original class so it inherited all of its publicly accessible methods -- and if you don t implements them the original method will be called
you shouldn t have extends myclass together with a private myclass object -- that s really really redundant and i can t think of a design pattern where doing that is right

30346386
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does 16 - 0 5 16 - 0 5 but it doesn t
re bodmas it really should be written b o dm as from the wikipedia article on order of operations these mnemonics may be misleading when written this way especially if the user is not aware that multiplication and division are of equal precedence as are addition and subtraction

30346386
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
re bodmas it really should be written b o dm as from the wikipedia article on order of operations these mnemonics may be misleading when written this way especially if the user is not aware that multiplication and division are of equal precedence as are addition and subtraction
similarly all of the following references say that in standard arithmetic division and multiplication have the same precedence and addition and subtraction have the same precedence the order of operations pemdas - purplemath.com a common technique for remembering the order of operations is the abbreviation pemdas which is turned into the phrase please excuse my dear aunt sally

30347239
build.gradle	gradlew
gradlew.bat assembledebug -a -b path to module build.gradle -a only builds the component and does not rebuild its dependencies use -b to specify another gradlew build file
in this case the module s instead of the top-level build.gradle

30349213
bash	subshell
expands to the pid of the executing bash shell expands to the process id of the shell
in a subshell it expands to the process id of the invoking shell not the subshell

30350750
super	self
class a object def __init__ self super a self .__init__ print hello a class b a def __init__ self print hello b super a self .__init__ due to how super works despite it s name it does not necessarily call a method on the class s parent this is required for the calls to work correctly in the case of multiple inheritance
you are passing the wrong class to the call to super

30350750
super	self
a call to super returns a proxy object whose mro method resolution order consists of the classes after the class passed as the first object
here are the mros for each class when you call super a self .__init__ you are really invoking object.__init__ not a.__init__

30351776
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you should either use viewdidappear or add a slight delay before displaying the alert controller
viewwillappear is not a good location to present another view controller since the current one being presented is not yet in the window hierarchy and is also in a transition animation

30352945
keystore	jks
you ll be able to modify the keystore and the certificates contained therein like you would have done with the java terminal utilities like keytool but in a more accessible way
just to be sure that this is really the conversion you need please note that jks files are keystores a file format used to store more than one certificate and allows you to retrieve them programmatically using the java security api it s not a one-to-one conversion between equivalent formats

30352945
keystore	jks
just to be sure that this is really the conversion you need please note that jks files are keystore a file format used to store more than one certificate and allows you to retrieve them programmatically using the java security api it s not a one-to-one conversion between equivalent formats
so if you just want to import that certificate in a new ad-hoc keystore you can do it with keystore explorer a graphical tool

30356591
sse	avx
while the instruction set is useful the biggest benefit of having an avx-capable processor is the ability to use the arch avx build switch which enables the global use of the vex prefix for better sse sse2 code-gen
the only problem is the resulting code dll exe is not compatible with systems that lack avx support

30357170
ionic	angular
so i guess you should to start using ionic bundle and stop worrying about it
in case you are not using ionic bundle add the reference for angular in your index and make the declarations i mentioned above

30360484
jsdom	cheerio
be sure to read through their guide on where they fall short of jsdom
might not be the end all solution but cheerio does the trick on my end

30360590
http	spdy
reasons behind this are a number of optimizations performed by http 2 such as multiplexing header compression and resource push that are simply not possible with http 1.1
see for example the demo video disclaimer i am a jetty committer we gave in 2012 about jetty and spdy at that time but http 2 behaves the same or the go language http 2 demo or the akamai http 2 demo

30360869
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome on desktop will go and fetch them
firefox will use any intermediate certificates cached from previous connections to other sites but will not fetch missing certificates thus some firefox instances might work while others not

30361713
sum	coalesce
this may not be what you intended but if you wanted to sum all values of the ranges that each date falls into you would do something like this select table1.date sum coalesce table2.value 0 value from table1 left join table2 on table1.date between table2.startdate and table2.enddate group by table1.date otherwise you would get duplicate dates in your output
you can use a left join like this select table1.date coalesce table2.value 0 value from table1 left join table2 on table1.date between table2.startdate and table2.enddate order by 1 although it ll get messy if you have overlapping dates in table 2

30362078
swift	objective-c
in most cases the argument will be an implicitly unwrapped optional because it s from an objective-c library which hasn t been updated to account for the objective-c nullability annotations yet which objective-c source code files use to tell swift whether or not the argument should be an optional
objective-c doesn t support the idea of optionals

30363867
dictionary	map
from dictionary mapping types return the item of d with key key
raises a keyerror if key is not in the map

30364745
debian	linux
you can do so from source using assuming a debian ubuntu-like lua5.1 executable and the same for lua 5.2
in case configure s auto-detection does not find the correct executables directories the following flags might be of help directory where the lua executable is installed directory where the lua include files are you probably don t need this one on linux when you have done that luarocks-5.1 install some-package installs the given package for lua 5.1 and luarocks-5.2 install some-package installs that same package for lua 5.2

30365457
coalesce	isnull
i do not see why you cannot just use the transact-sql isnull function or alternatively coalesce in your current implementation if the table is empty max testnum will evaluate to null
the isnull ... 0 call will turn it to 0 and the increment will return 1

30365795
ecj	javac
every compiled version produces the same output when launching this code is not compiled by ecj compiler
it reports a compilation error so it looks like a bug in javac compiler it should return a compilation error instead like ecj

30366702
sqoop	hadoop
try this after installing sqoop and making necessary configuration sqoop import --connect jdbc sqlite path to database databasename.db --table tablename --m 1 --target-dir directory name in hdfs --driver org.sqlite.jdbc note you will need to download and copy sqlite-jdbc-x.x.x.jar to your sqoop lib and hadoop lib folder
you will also need to add sqlite-jdbc-x.x.x.jar to your hadoop classpath in case if you get class not found error

30367549
prepare	execute
in the default interceptor stack the prepare interceptor runs before the parameters interceptor
that means that the injection of parameters has not yet occurred when the prepare interceptor execute the prepare method

30367549
prepare	execute
that means that the injection of parameters has not yet occurred when the prepare interceptor execute the prepare method
you need to move the parameters interceptor before the prepare interceptor or to duplicate it putting one declaration before the prepare interceptor

30369485
opensuse	centos
the self compiled and ruby 2.1.3p242 from opensuse 13.2 works
the centos ruby doesn t work for me eather because it calls gem specification.dirs before the interpreter reaches the gem.path.insert line

30370108
html5lib	beautifulsoup
however it is a lot slower and it does not come with python or beautifulsoup so it requires another pip install html5lib to work
it s a pretty ugly solution and should be made more robust before you use it but something like this should work note the as beautifulsoup otherwise interprets the tags to wrap all the rest of the document

30370486
subtraction	addition
it states that the only time pointer addition p + i is defined is if treating subtraction of i as equivalent to addition of -i p points to an element of an array object or one past the last element and p + i points to an element of the same array object or one past the last element if p isn t a pointer to an array element or one past the end - for instance if it is the null pointer or two past the end - the behaviour is undefined
you don t need to dereference the result to cause undefined behaviour - the effect of the addition itself is undefined

30374855
gradle	ivy
edit for using the library files jar and aar directly in a ide independent way or with maven the artifactory repo for twitter can be useful there you can find crashlytics libraries q crashlytics and also fabric q fabric for every dependency twitter s artifactory help with code for ivy maven or gradle integration
if you are not using gradle i guess it s still a eclipse project

30375449
spaces	linefeed
the tricky part is the pattern which matches one or more white spaces characters followed by another white spaces character which itself is not considered part of the match a look-ahead assertion
generally s matches all white-space characters such as the spaces character itself horizontal tabulation newline carriage-return linefeed or formfeed

30376800
build.gradle	gradlew
they belong in the individual module build.gradle files remove the compile statements in that gradlew file compile project libs boofcv-libs and copy them to other module s build.gradle and make dependencies look like this
as the note of your project s build.gradle file will suggest note do not place your application dependencies here

30379563
super	self
i m not exactly clear on why you re overriding save but you should make the super call last there since it s what does the actual saving of the instance data
re takes exactly 2 arguments 3 given the definition of the movement method in the book class should take self as its first argument

30381215
stretchblt	bitblt
the code in the answer to my question solved the problem capture screenshot including semitransparent windows in .net for you you should be able to just change your stretchblt line to bitblt and add captureblt tooltips like transparent windows are skipped by spec of bitblt
plus you re not resizing so use bitblt

30382415
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
the recyclerview does not have a onclicklistener and will have to implement it ourselves
i like to add a onitemclicklistener interface in adapter with an onclick method invoked when you click on the item view from the viewholder

30383876
subtraction	addition
with the caveat that pointer subtraction is not allowed
the addition of permissions allows capabilities to be tokens granting certain rights to the referenced memory. for example a memory capability may have permissions to read data and capabilities but not to write them or just to write data but not capabilities

30385974
factors	mean
given these factors we ve decided to retire chrome frame and will cease support and updates for the product in january 2014
i m not sure what you mean by the second part of your question though regarding the building of a virtual machine

30386239
udp	tcp
yes this is the principle behind udp hole punching
recent versions of bittorrent use µtp which is layered above udp not tcp

30386239
udp	tcp
recent versions of bittorrent use µtp which is layered above udp not tcp
µtorrent uses a private extension ut_holepunch that performs udp hole punching most other implementations don t bother with the notable exception of tixati

30386985
base	fractions
for example select datediff now 1900-01-01 as excel_serial_date_1900 you might need to add 1 or subtract 1 to get the exact same value that excel uses i ve not tested that. if your excel workbook is using the 1904 based serial date use 1904-01-01 as the base date in the expression
note the datediff function returns integer number of days operates only on the date portion and doesn t include any fractions of a day

30387040
octal	decimal
javascript numbers beginning with leading 0 s followed by any of the digits 01234567 are octal base 8 rather than in decimal base 10
you can see this in an example like this note that if there is an 8 or 9 digit it is not a valid octal number and thus will be interpreted as a decimal number note that octal literals don t work in strict mode this is described in section b.1.1 of the javascript specification as non-normative behavior for compatibility with older versions of ecmascript

30390454
persistent	transient
an entity can exist in three states - transient persistent and detached
transient - when you create an object but do not associate it with hibernate session then it is in transient state

30392134
build.gradle	gradlew
now rather than selecting the folder that contains your project you have to select the build.gradle file that is just inside of your parent folder of the project
it will not create any problem and will not ask you to migrate into gradlew and import any framework at all

30394249
punctuation	words
let s dissect this regex - look-behind asserting that the words is preceeded by space quote or parens but not a number using double-negation instead of positive look-behind so the first words is matched too - the first part of the words - optionally more word-segments after a or - - look-ahead asserting that the words is followed by space punctuation quote or parens
instead of using all sorts of complicated look-arounds you can use b to detect the boundary of words

30395870
ienumerable	ilist
when you use you get an ienumerable in viewbag.itdept not an ilist
that means you can t use an indexer like as an ienumerable doesn t support random access

30396250
punctuation	words
s except that it allows for characters that are not spaces like punctuation as well
so what happens is this will allow a match if after the words matched the line ends or there is a non-word character in other words there are no letters or numbers or underscores if you don t want word_ to match words then you will have to change w to

30400079
implements	extends
you still force them they need to inherit a class which implements them or implements them on their own
if it is not feasible that all classes which should implements tool extends from basetool feel free to create more base classes which implements getname or implements it directly like you wish

30400079
implements	extends
if it is not feasible that all classes which should implements tool extends from basetool feel free to create more base classes which implements getname or implements it directly like you wish
btw if you plan that all tools should extends basetool then the interface isn t necessary at all at least not for this use case

30401161
swift	objective-c
your tags indicate that you use swift not objective-c
swift uses different mechanisms to start up your program

30406504
strcpy	strncpy
use strncpy instead and be mindful of your allocation size and of the null termination actually the situation is a bit dire since neither strcpy nor strncpy are absolutely good functions
by itself strcpy isn t safe since you can t control the output buffer size and strncpy is inefficient since it writes more zeros than what may be desired

30406532
strncpy	malloc
simply use see here why not to use strncpy
your malloc is faulty it does not allocated enough memory to the pointer to be used as a destination string in strpy

30408711
bower	npm
one key thing too is that if you need to install dependencies with bower you should know that heroku does not run bower install on it s own
you can tell heroku to run it by adding the following to your package.json this will cause it to run a bower install after npm install finishes

30409302
boost	stl
implementations of the family to which you re referring are in this boost library though
the stl does not specify implementations but rather interfaces and constraints including complexity constraints

30409781
google-chrome	firefox
well it s not phantomjs but i like google-chrome better anyway
there is also a firefox image

30409787
rdf	owl
it is not possible to parse rdf xml unambiguously otherwise
use owl imports from each file to import the base ontology or foaf. the problem here is that the owl api needs the declaration to be available either in the file or in the imported ontologies

30415260
equals	compareto
since as already mentioned by js equals incurs an overhead it has to do instanceof and an unchecked cast methods 2-4 will work with exactly the same speed noticingly better than method 1 when used in tight loops since hotspot is not likely to optimize out the casts instanceof
it s quite similar with other comparison operators - they will trigger unboxing while using compareto won t - but this time the operation is highly optimizable by hs since intvalue is just a getter method prime candidate to being optimized out

30418646
serializable	deserialization
instead you can copy the stream to a local memorystream then save the underlying array then later you can turn the array back to a memorystream for deserialization or just keep the original memorystream and pass it around. update binaryformatter serializable full .net type information the fully qualified type name to and from the serializable stream
if the receiving system doesn t have a type with exactly the same name in exactly the same namespace in exactly the same assembly then deserialization fails

30419454
consistency	acid
you should though avoid taking the responsibility of creating readind updating and deleting crud as you will have troubles on preserving principles such as atomicity consistency isolation and durability acid while there are systems doing that for you the database management systems. in simple words scenarios like what you describe should be a responsibility of a dbms and not yours
you probably need a nosql dbms that responsible for the crud operations of your database - which can be file-based in a json format and other forms preserving acid always or almost always but this is probably something you will learn on searching on it

implements	extends
you cannot force all classes that implements an interface to extends a particular class because that would defeat the purpose of an interface
however if you put the methods of your interface into an abstract class that extends the base class of your choice you would be able to achieve the same effect without an interface

30424152
single-quotes	double-quotes
the reason doesn t work is due to double-quotes containing single-quotes containing double-quotes
the single-quotes are fine but html parser will be confused by unescaped double-quotes inside double-quotes

30425603
swift	objective-c
this can be very useful when we don t have access to the source code or when we re not sure how swift is translating code from one language into swift
swift s int type is different from the int primitive from objective-c c c++ and many other languages

30425603
swift	objective-c
so when we try the following we re trying to pass an int to a method that expect an int32 and because swift is very very strict about the types of the parameters it lets us pass it generates an error where objective-c would potentially generate a warning
we should be able to fix this by explicitly declaring validnumber s type as the appropriate int32 but additionally if it doesn t make sense on the swift end to keep this variable s type as an int32 we can construct an int32 out of an int so we can do something like this as an additional caveat we don t run into this problem with a string because objective-c s nsstring maps to swift s string

elasticsearch	kibana
elasticsearch does not support joins. you need to look at parent child or nesting however kibana does not currently support either of these.
i also posted the same question in official kibana discussion board

qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
paint is called on individual qgraphicsitems by a qgraphicsview when painting the qgraphicsscene
it usually won t be called on all items qgraphicsview does various checks before painting the item ensuring that the item is in the viewport and not hidden by other items etc

30433664
move	drag
the distance move away is proportional to the velocity of each node which is based on the distance between px py and the position calculated by the previous steps links charge and gravity in the current tick in reality it s a little more complicated than that because the charge calculation is actually non-causal and changes the previous positions but this doesn t affect the principle of the friction calculation
during the drag px py is updated with the mouse position by the drag behavior on every mousemove

30435564
cloudant	couchdb
cloudant query is a relatively new feature in cloudant couchdb and is really a wrapper around the existing lower-level indexing mechanisms map reduce and search
a user-created map reduce or cloudant search index cannot be used to service a cloudant query call - it maintains its own indices

30437359
serializable	deserialization
note how this is only a problem because construction is not accessed via the serializable access friend token the class is default constructible the documented solution the documentation tells you to use save_construct_data and load_construct_data for types that are not default-constructible
specifically they promise it will work for stl containers of these as well in addition to the deserialization of pointers these overrides are used in the deserialization of stl containers whose element type has no default constructor

30437842
macports	homebrew
i ve moved from macports to homebrew which is a little better behaved in this regard - it generally refuses to put things in the path which interfere with the system libraries without forcing the issue - this is a personal choice thing though and is not advising you to switch
this is a regular issue when using macports and you set the dyld_library_path variable to have opt local lib

interpolation	splines

are approximation curves not interpolation they do not necessarily cross the control points

30442498
subtraction	addition
finally you may see a certain discrepancy rather than perfect 200ms intervals due to the overhead of threading method calls and even the subtraction operation you re doing
in addition datetime does not always have the greatest accuracy - according to this article from eric lippert if the question you want to ask is about how long some operation took and you want a high-precision high-accuracy answer then use the stopwatch class

30443178
division	modulo
i believe that the modulo works only with integers if i m right you should do your own workaround to see if the given number is a multiple or not which translate to the result of the division must be an integer. the code should be something like this and this should work with any increment number even more than one decimal point digit
edit as james said the float division of 1.2 over 0.1 is not coded exactly as 12 but 11.9999.

30444710
setinterval	settimeout
so if you re sure the xhr request won t take longer than 3s to complete just use setinterval
edit answer above is wrong in some aspects as pointed out in the comments settimeout does indeed not increase the call stack size since it returns before the function in the timeout is called

30444713
bower	npm
try this version socket io use bower in order to compile the script into one file
probably the version you use is corrupt. if this doesn t solve try to use the npm socket-io.client lib

30445598
implements	extends
you ll have to refactor the class so that it doesn t implements anymore and for example add a method which returns a view over the object implements
since java 8 bitset has a method declared as intstream stream and has a method with the same name declared as since those methods have the same name but an incompatible return type it s impossible to extends bitset and implements set at the same time

30448404
cloudant	couchdb
then you can create design documents that are optimized for whatever platform you happen to be on pouchdb couchdb cloudant the various pouchdb plugins etc.
and yeah we are usually pretty responsive inside of the irc channel and on the mailing list but it s a small operation because we aren t sponsored by cloudant or couchbase or anybody

30461197
spaces	delimiter
then the original tab-delimited format was lost and instead of tabs spaces show in between words
and since cut s default delimiter is a tab it does not find any and it prints the whole line

30468614
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as it is unclear if these dates will be further extended or not we strongly recommend java users consider alternatives to google-chrome as soon as possible
instead we recommend firefox internet explorer and safari as longer-term options

30474010
prepare	execute
you are getting this error because you are trying or laravel is trying to execute a prepare statement
unfortunately memsql doesn t seem to support some subset of prepare statements protocol that laravel uses

30474194
postgresql	mysql
i just tried it in sql server and oracle and both of them seem to agree with postgresql here rejecting using x in a correlated sub query no matter in which clause of the outer select it is located
it is similar to how mysql allows the following query select a + 1 x from t order by x + 1 but sql server and postgres do not

30477170
udp	tcp
of course you can build an api on top of websockets that exposes a connection-oriented and reliable like tcp but datagram-based like udp socket interface and then pretend you re not using websockets but if you re looking for real-time low-latency networking adding another layer that makes it hard to get as close to the metal as possible when you find things you need to optimize doesn t seem like a good idea
or if you do want that i suspect you d be better off building a tightly-optimized gateway that talks localhost udp to your actual servers and websockets to your clients

30479263
shadowing	named
you are not technically shadowing
you would have to define a variable of the same named to shadow it

30480167
exponent	modulo
the decryption works by raising the ciphertext to the power of d private exponent modulo m the same modulo
if the private key modulo is much smaller than the public key modulo the ciphertexts will be bigger and it cannot be decrypted

30480399
swift	objective-c
swift enums can now be exported to objective-c using the objective-c attribute
objective-c enums must declare an integer raw type and cannot be generic or use associated values

30480812
implements	extends
implements is used in case of multiple inheritance
i would not exepect any difference to extends alternatively a trait may extends multiple traits

30483949
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome allows that exception -- which it doesn t apply to userscripts -- however firefox does not
the firefox implementation flat out states this method is only allowed to be called for windows that were opened by a script using the window.open method. if you try to use window.close from a greasemonkey tampermonkey userscript you will get firefox the error message scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script. google-chrome just silently fails

30483949
google-chrome	firefox

the long-term solution the best way to deal with this is to make a google-chrome extension and or firefox add-on instead

30485796
serializable	deserialization
which brings me to my next point you shouldn t generally invent encodings serializable formats unless it s an exercise but use an existing format instead such as json xml or yaml my favorite is json
there are ready-made libraries out there that will do serializable deserialization for you in one call each

30487045
opera	google-chrome
opera mini needs a -o- prefix
does not seem to work with webgl canvas or video in google-chrome likely related to these issues issue #1 issue #2 issue #3

30492913
virtualenv	conda
if you are not using anaconda i recently added instructions using pure virtualenv
anaconda 4.1.0 since version 4.1.0 anaconda includes a special package nb_conda_kernels that detects conda environments with notebook kernels and automatically registers them

30493962
quicksort	mergesort
apologies for not using quicksort - they work with about the same speed but mergesort takes a little less time to wrap your head around and the iterative version is more easy to demonstrate
essentially mergesort sorts a string by breaking it in half sorting the two separately using itself of course

30495177
azure	hdinsight
or you can directly use the powershell script published with changing the path that contains the dependency jars add your jars to an azure blob contains and just replace the path powershell script
hdinsight is using templton which doesn t have support for libjars so you can t use that templton docs also i m assuming you are building a custom hdinsight cluster using a powershell script. you can copy all the jars with dependencies to hadoop_home + share hadoop common lib this would be the hadoop lib folder

30495903
ostream	ostringstream
it does not make sense to have the close function as a member of std ostream
the first example would be that std ostringstream inherits from std ostream

30496159
gridbaglayout	springlayout
well this is one layout scenario that gridbaglayout cannot do
i would try using a springlayout notice that the creation of listconstraints specifies a width argument which is spring.scale scrollpanewidth 0.25f

30496272
nsis	uninstaller
the nsis tutorials i ve found place the 64-bit installer logic in a function .oninit which is called automatically when the install starts
logically one would try to call this manually in the uninstaller section via call .oninit but nsis compilation will fail because the function name doesn t start with un

30496633
postgresql	mysql
if you intend to use the sql backend as an ordered but dumb data store you can just construct the actual query from within python perhaps like so some people dislike this as some databases like postgresql can deal with datetime better than python such as timedelta is ignorant of leap years for instance
you can try something like as i only use pure sqlalchemy i tested this out with this syntax reason for using text for that section is simply because now and interval usage is not consistent across all sql implementations certain implementations require the use of dateadd to do datetime arithmetic and while sqlalchemy does support the interval type it s not really well documented and also on my brief testing with it it doesn t actually do what you needed using example from this answer for both sqlite and mysql

30497552
debian	linux
i m not sure about rpi 2 as it is definitely more powerful 2nd way is to install qt4 base package on rpi and start developing qt ui application on a linux running pc possibly a debian distro
since raspbian is a flavor of debian first you can test code on your pc and then use those files to build code for rpi

30498563
super	extends
here is what he said in this context the casting from subclassing to a superclass is safe because the sub class at least has the interface that superclass provided to extends of course that is public
so while casting from sub class to superclass you can safely call all the methods common to them but doing it the other way around super to sub gives you the unsafe handle to call all the extra methods not available with the parent class if there are any

30499295
udp	tcp
that means that you shouldn t ever treat it as a message-based protocol unlike say udp
if you need to send messages over tcp you have to add your own messaging protocol on top of tcp

30499873
rtp	rtsp
however the underlying rtsp rtp library live555 that we wrap handles many more media types live555 is quite extensive and it is usually quite simple to add more media type support to the rtsp source filter provided that - you have an rtsp server supporting the media type - you have the necessary directshow decoder filters
another cause for failure could be that the downstream decoder is rejecting the connection to the rtsp source filter if the profile is not supported etc

30501538
mvp	presenter
the presenter in mvp is quite specific to a certain view and it should talk only to the view and model or their respective interfaces while all your items are not specific to a particular page view
if you put it all in the the presenter then you are misusing the presenter like a controller in web mvc

30501852
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder from a truncating division
operator for division in xpath is div not remember that already used for path separator in xpath

30506479
rdf	owl
what it means is that whenever you see an assertion that uses propertyy like a propertyy b an owl reasoner can infer that a rdf type typex b rdf type typez the only time those inferences will be any kind of constraint violation is if you have some other way of inferring that a cannot be of type x or that b cannot be of type z
then an owl reasoner would recognize the inconsistency

cpython	ironpython
don t add the normal cpython stdlib
it s not compatible with ironpython

30509888
rsa	aes
the key length for new keys are always in bytes. trusted keys can be 32 - 128 bytes 256 - 1024 bits the upper limit is to fit within the 2048 bit srk rsa keylength with all necessary structure padding
encrypted keys do not depend on a tpm and are faster as they use aes for encryption decryption

30511241
hex	binary
refer to this table now let s see how it applies to your bytes 1 hex 0x01 binary 00000001 and 2 hex 0x02 binary 00000010 stand alone no problem
byte -3 hex 0xfd binary 11111101 is the start byte of a 6-byte sequence which is actually illegal in the current utf-8 standard but your byte array does not have such a sequence

30513406
swift	objective-c
the following solution from cocoabuilder.com - stop edit session with a nstextfield works for me both on os x 10.9 and os x 10.10 for objective-c and on 10.10 for swift
here is objective-c version background accepted solution in this topic never worked for me on os x 10.9 and 10.10 so instead of calling as it suggests - i needed to call makefirstresponder with some non-nil nsresponder subclass this can be either nswindow s content view or nsviewcontroller s view that both work in my case or some fake nstextfield view which is not visible to user for more complex cases

30518356
google-chrome	firefox
i might be wrong but i think this on picture is a built-in google-chrome s datapicker which utilizes date input type
furhtermore majority of browsers do not have their own built-in datepickers latest firefox you might be able to find a way to style it very limited presumably but to fine grain the selection it would take for you to use some js -based solution

30518686
implements	extends
second about baseview which extends customcomponent and implements iview and ibaseview first a small detail if it implements ibaseview you do not need to implements iview as ibaseview already extends iview but the bigger issue i see is if you have a somewhere in some class a method with an ibaseview as a parameter but inside that function you expect to be able to use the overrided methods from customcomponent you won t be able to you ll only have the methods declared on ibaseview
if you wanted to use the customcomponent methods you d had to do a cast inside that method but that is not clean and a source of bugs because if in the future you add more classes that implements ibaseview but do not extends customcomponent that function will throw exceptions complaining about casting

30518686
implements	extends
if you wanted to use the customcomponent methods you d had to do a cast inside that method but that is not clean and a source of bugs because if in the future you add more classes that implements ibaseview but do not extends customcomponent that function will throw exceptions complaining about casting
also about the scaffoldingview if you are going to use it only for mocking purposes in tests and you are extends the ibaseview behaviour with more methods if you test a method that has an ibaseview as parameter you have the same exact situation as before the method you are testing will not be aware of the iscaffoldingview declared methods and then it won t use them and your tests can t be trusted

30526660
build.gradle	gradlew
make sure your project build.gradle file contains the new repository and the new classpath this is not strictly related to the question problem but since we are already migrating to the new ide preview it s better to make sure everything is in place
to solve the gradlew sync error open gradle-wrapper.properties file and update the gradlew wrapper distribution version from to android studio 2.3 android studio 2.2 android studio 2.1 android studio 2.0 android studio 1.5 android studio 1.3 you can find the latest gradlew wrapper version visiting edit as a side note as sebsz suggests the official repository of the android gradlew plugin switched from mavencentral to jcenter see bintray blog post

30527424
libstdc++	libc++
obviously this still will not link if you use libraries compiled against libstdc++ and use any stl types in those interfaces
here s what works for me with the ubuntu vivid packages for clang and libc++ it is important that the object files come before the -l flags when you use exceptions

30530910
matlab	simulink
has many answers to call matlab code from simulink
if you are instead reading all the data from one file used in one time step from matlab function block then you should declare importdata as extrinsic which will allow you to call a matlab function which does not support code generation

30534733
sudo	passwd
running script.sh in a terminal where a sudo command is run before within a certain timeout will give the script superuser privilege if the script is written with explicit sudo commands
you can avoid any script not prompting for passwd when run as sudo by running it with sudo -k script.sh it will ask for passwd regardless of any previous sudo command s or session

30534733
sudo	passwd
you can avoid any script not prompting for passwd when run as sudo by running it with sudo -k script.sh it will ask for passwd regardless of any previous sudo command s or session
and to run script.sh without sudo i.e with just script.sh and still prompt for passwd for the sudo command s you can change the timeout value the duration sudo maintains the session permanently run sudo visudo then change the line defaults env_reset to save and exit ctrl+x then y this will ensure that sudo asks for passwd every time it is run

30534733
sudo	passwd
or if you don t want to change it permanently and want your script to prompt for passwd at least once while maintaining a session then you can change your script like this sudo -k first-command-with-sudo sudo second-command sudo third and so on this script will prompt for passwd at least once regardless of any previous sudo command s or session
in case you are unaware of or don t have access to the content of the script script.sh it can have sudo commands inside it or not and you want to be sure that any sudo command will surely prompt for passwd at least once then run sudo -k capital k before running the script

30535581
ssl	https
you can always create a new web.config file and put settings there however you cannot force ssl settings on an azure webapp by changing settings in the web.config because the ssl section is locked i believe at the applicationhost.config level
the easiest way here for you is to add a urlrewrite rule that redirects all the http requests to https

30537148
build.gradle	gradlew
put this in your root build.gradle you can find the latest published version of the plugin on this page note that you may also need to update your build tools this version of the build tools is available with the sdk manager under section tools preview channel

shadowing	named
the term used for a field in a child class that has the same named as a field in a parent class is hiding which is distinct from shadowing and obscuring - terms that are also used for certain situations in which the same named is used for two different items
in java if a parent class and a child class have a field with the same named the field doesn t override the parent s field

30547355
client-side	server-side
your angular app is served by the server through a single express route - homepage so again your entire angular app loads thorough just 1 route on the server-side and then angular takes over the routing to client-side through it s own ui-router
now it must be starting to seem obvious that it s not trivial to have server-side authentication check interfere between client-side routing

30547355
client-side	server-side
now it must be starting to seem obvious that it s not trivial to have server-side authentication check interfere between client-side routing
you can only have server-side authentication work with routes that server actually is in control of serving. those are mostly just your api routes in your case

30550865
punctuation	words
after the disjunction is which matches anything that s not a character or whitespace--that is punctuation
if you want to include in words to get let s then you can just add that character to the words character portion of the disjunction post-processing the regex approach isn t perfect though

30552725
comparator	comparable
one way of achieving this is to require the elements of your list to be comparable have them implement the comparator interface
you would express this using a generic type constraint on t as in a more general way of doing this that also allows your list to contain elements that do not implement this comparator interface is to follow the strategy used in many of the c# bcl generic collection classes sorteddictionary or sortedlist use an icomparer instance to perform the comparisons

30553913
hive	hdfs
hcatalog opens up the hive metadata to other map reduce tools
every map reduce tools has its own notion about hdfs data example pig sees the hdfs data as set of files hive sees it as tables hcatalog supported map reduce tools do not need to care about where the data is stored in which format and storage location

hive	hdfs
every map reduce tools has its own notion about hdfs data example pig sees the hdfs data as set of files hive sees it as tables hcatalog supported map reduce tools do not need to care about where the data is stored in which format and storage location
it assist integration with other tools and supplies read and write interfaces for pig hive and map reduce

30557119
client-side	server-side
however i still provide a client-side solution since you did not mention your server-side environment
i highly recommend you compare the dates on server-side before and after form submissions because end-users could easily override your client-side code

30560524
swift	objective-c
objective-c isn t c# or java or even swift
it s objective-c

30561675
setinterval	settimeout
though i would recommend using settimeout recursively instead of setinterval for better performance and the intended effect i guess
the timeout that you are using in the ajax request is not the same as settimeout in javascript

30566488
client-side	server-side
for web access this was not possible because of a simple explanation my implementation was in server-side and the operation refresh is actually happening in client-side
but i think team explorer will not be able to do it either since tfs don t give any library to make ui operation like open work item window open pending changes windows etc. you ve already done the synctolatest and tfs will force the user to refresh first in order to make any change on the work item after your operation but the user has to refresh the work item client-side first manually

30569768
tiff	png
gravity forms doesn t allow additional image filetypes such as eps and tiff to be added to the image upload form because these cannot be rendered as thumbnails without installing some sort of server-side component to convert the tiff etc
to a format which can be displayed by a browser jpeg png or gif

30576361
ftp	telnet
you cannot retrieve files over ftp protocol using a telnet client
while you can simulate the ftp client by typing ftp commands on a telnet console you cannot do file transfers this way

30576361
ftp	telnet
while you can simulate the ftp client by typing ftp commands on a telnet console you cannot do file transfers this way
it s because for file transfer you need a separate data transfer connection what the telnet client cannot do

the results for those are so y + x rem y doesn t reproduce any modulo for x 0 and y 0

30583966
daemons	systemd
then follow what it says in that is use daemons mode and use the python-home option to wsgidaemonprocess

30584663
hex	binary
consider the following with output abc abc 97 98 99 61 62 63 this shows that each char is binary and 97 dec is 0x61 hex
conversion to from binary via bitset is not necessary

30588890
interpolation	splines
i think the problem here is that splines interpolation of a higher order is not suitable for smoothing your data
below i plotted splines interpolations of order 0 to 3

30588890
interpolation	splines
i guess choosing a splines interpolation is not a good choice here
interpolation assumes that there are no measurement errors and you seem to have a clear outlier in your data

30589466
memcpy	strcpy
it will safely copy all characters in the array as if by memcpy as you say though it may not actually use memcpy
the default compiler-provided won t use strcpy to copy .

how to simplify a null-safe comparator implementation
you should not implement comparable to accept null as it breaks the interface s contract

30598936
oncreate	findviewbyid
when implementing a fragment you don t inflate your views in oncreate like you normally do in an activity . instead you do it in oncreateview and you need to use the inflated root view to find the id within the layout you inflated
fragment doesn t provide the findviewbyid method

30599202
build.gradle	gradlew
make sure that you have in yourprojectfolder build.gradle and in yourprojectfolder mainmodulename build.gradle you have or as a variant use last stable versions of build tools

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
if you are running your tests locally and your target browsers are google-chrome or and firefox use directconnect your tests would run faster
but if you are running your tests locally and need to test against ie safari or other browsers you d go with options 1-4 usually 1 since these browsers cannot work in direct connect mode

wildfly	glassfish	wildfly	jboss	glassfish	weblogic
java ee is only a specification and it is up to the jee compliant application server such as glassfish wildfly or weblogic to determine exactly what the secondary storage is
weblogic at least by default passivates the ejb s to disk which is described by this image the wildfly jboss which is my application server of choice documentation is quite sparse regarding this but a fair guess is that the default behaviour is to passivate the ejb s to disk as well though i cannot swear on it

google-chrome	firefox
i had the same problem 100 cpu utilization when i hit a break point and disabling the google-chrome workspace mapping did not resolve my issues
i tested it in firefox and found the same behavior

super	extends
you re not calling any super painting method thus breaking the painting chain
if you want the number line to extends through the component get the component s size in the painting method again paintcomponent and use that to help determine the placement of the line

udp	tftp
rather it implements a single uniform protocol layered over udp
this is not the tftp protocol so your client is not compatible with a standard tftp server

30607683
union	distinct
try to remove distinct i could not find a faster query for your example though you might try the query without the distinct keyword - using union returns only distinct values by definition
so this sql gives us the same result as your current query insert into commidtemp id select fromidnumber from communication union select toidnumberfrom communication

factors	matrix
assuming k has some value i tried both 4 because it s a common factors of the sizes you specified and 3 because it s not
assuming your 4d matrix is called m

daemons	systemd
controlling the ring formerly sflphone daemons with a python script build the ring daemons install dependencies follow these build instructions additional dependencies contrib this part will compile some dependencies that are not provided in debian repos including a recent version of pjsip make sure you don t already have an old pjsip installed on the systemd - if you manually installed a recent version it should work fine and contrib won t build it
build the ring daemons dring run the ring daemons . bin dring -c -d

30609914
addition	modulo
think about it 31 downto 0 can represent numbers from 0 to 2 32-1 it wouldn t make much sense if any addition of that range would be modulo 2 31 if you can represent larger numbers
i m not sure i understand your second question but addition modulo 2 32 yields results in the range of 0 to 2 32-1

30610290
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
browsers tend to handle the popstate event differently on page load. google-chrome prior to v34 and safari always emit a popstate event on page load but firefox doesn t
according to mozzila developer network safari always emit a popstate event on page load

30610903
slug	permalinks
in your case if you set your rewrite slug to shop or if you didn t set a rewrite slug in which case it would default to your cpt slug the url that would correspond to your archive-shop.php template would be example.com shop
note that this assumes you are using permalinks if you are not using permalinks the shop post type archive is located at

opera	firefox
and in opera mini measuretext returns undefined
as i was using canvas to detect fonts with errors thrown a more compact alternative i found is firefox 3.0.x doesn t have measuretext

30613532
swift	objective-c
if a constant or variable in your code needs to work with the absence of a value under certain conditions always declare it as an optional value of the appropriate type also very importante to notice swift s nil is not the same as nil in objective-c
in objective-c nil is a pointer to a nonexistent object

30614765
build.gradle	gradlew
you can probably ignore the projectsevaluated part because you re in a plugin and not your build.gradle and just do this
the gradlew life cycle can be a bit confusing when starting out

30615210
ssl	https
make sure it s secure false if you are not using ssl
in app config session.php check the https only cookie setting

decimal	ieee
you can use nsnumberformatter if you specify a maximum number of decimal digits that should be presented swift 3 4 update
a float uses a binary ieee 754 representation and cannot represent all decimal fractions precisely

30623199
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
an alternative solution that will work regardless of whether your view controllers are embedded in a uinavigationcontroller or not would be to subclass uiviewcontroller
this class will handle receiving the nsnotification that an error occurred and will also handle displaying the alert now any uiviewcontroller s that should display an alert when the error notification is posted just have to be a subclass of myviewcontroller

30623489
postgresql	mysql
so a close query that should work and be efficient for postgresql is
the initial idea with distinct on is good but it works with postgresql but not with mysql distinct on being a postgresql non-standard extension

30624226
haskell	idris
how to write generic code for tuples this is not supported directly in the language because tuples in haskell are all or nothing
in idris this would be easy because a b c actually means a b c

30626075
swift	objective-c
in swift try-catch isn t available
you can switch back to objective-c or use a library like this one to add the functionality

30630740
rouge	pygments
optional step since pygments is the default syntax highlighter you don t have to explicitly define what highlighter you re using but if you prefer to add this line to your _config.yml file highlighter pygments alternative 1 don t want highlighters if you won t be using a code highlighter just edit the markdown post you have 2015-06-02-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown and remove the liquid tags like so ruby code on the template you can ignore alternative 2 rouge no need for python rouge is a ruby code highlighter which while does not require python and all that dependencies as it is written completely in ruby which you already have because jekyll runs on ruby
you ll need to edit the _config.yml to use rouge like so highlighter rouge and run gem install rouge in the command line as mentioned in same tutorial

30634282
swift	objective-c
this explicit process shows that one has to remove any objective-c code referencing swift classes until after the header is generated
comment out the #import productmodulename-swift.h statement in your objective-c implementation file comment out any references in the objective-c implementation file to swift classes clean build resolve all errors warnings remove the comment on the #import productmodulename-swift.h statement clean build successfully or fix any remaining errors verify that you are not referencing any swift classes in objective-c at this point

if so temporarily comment these out verify that productmodulename-swift.h is generated by cmd-clicking on the class name of the #import productmodulename-swift.h statement remove the comment on the code referencing swift classes in the objective-c implementation file

30635926
innodb	myisam
likely you re doing optimize on an innodb table table using the innodb storage engine rather than the myisam storage engine
innodb doesn t support the optimize the way myisam does

30635926
innodb	myisam
the message you are getting is basically mysql server repeating what the innodb storage engine told mysql server table does not support optimize is the innodb storage engine saying.
i the innodb storage engine don t do an optimize operation like my friend the myisam storage engine does. doing recreate + analyze instead is the innodb storage engine saying.

matlab	simulink
... resolving workspace access issues when a simulink model is loaded into memory in a matlab client session it is only visible and accessible in that matlab session
it is not accessible in the memory of the matlab worker sessions

30646471
union	distinct
conceptually it doesn t make sense to order by a_2 after you ve done a union on just a_1
from oracle s perspective it is entirely possible that for any distinct a_1 value in either query there may be many different a_2 values returned

30649496
gmail	hotmail
if the smtp server uses smtp authentication the webmail providers do it your isp or your company might do it or might not do it then you have to also add if you use gmail s smtp server for example then use your gmail email address and password
replace gmail with hotmail or yahoo

30651392
addition	multiplication
in addition as mentioned by ratchet-freak in comments you should make sure your quaternions are always normalized otherwise transformations other than rotation may happen
quaternion multiplication is not commutative if a and b are quaternions then

30653686
imperative	declarative
in qml it is easy to mix declarative code and imperative code
if you add imperative instructions affecting visual aspects to your qml files they are not purely declarative anymore and the visual representation in the visual editor will break

30660739
cpython	pypy
note that they can also be used to just load the whole file into memory vectorizing the outer loop as well as the inner one if you ve got the ram but that shouldn t be nearly as much of a performance gain. run your existing code in pypy instead of cpython
use numba to jit the code within cpython

30661484
prepare	execute
as long as the string passed to prepare is static does not contain any variables you should be safe from sql injections
the important part is separating user input from your sql statements and you do that by having the sql passed to prepare and the user input to execute

30661824
uialertview	uialertcontroller
you should know that uialertview is deprecate from ios 8 on so if you are not targeting lower you should not use it instead use uialertcontroller
you could make use of nsattributedstring and uialertcontroller you use the key attributedmessage to assign an attributed string for the message and the key attributedtitle for the title

30662046
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
in the type of type_item_amounts you set the view to be disabled and onclicklistener null so it s not clickable i guess this is exactly what you want
in the type of type_item_limits you have a switch here but you don t set a oncheckedchangelistener for the switch. when you using a onitemclicklistener for a listview remember this if there is anything that can be clicked in your list item a button or in your case a switch then the onitemclick method will never work.this is why nothing is clickable in your listview

30662314
ssl	https
node https cannot find the ssl issuer_cert on the private.service server and so it throw that exception
the solution i used since i m sure i can trust that server was to add rejectunauthorized false to the options of the https request this way node will not throw an exception in case of certificates problem

30663188
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
check out the latest version i added precisely that functionality a few weeks ago you can now use a uiviewcontroller no need to use a uitableviewcontroller
but other than that i can t tell without more information why it doesn t show up. i m using it in several apps and it works ok. i ve got a uinavigationcontroller which uses a subclass of ensidemenunavigationcontroller and a uiviewcontroller for the menu itself

seaborn	matplotlib
it is possible but it would be different than what seaborn is doing and it isn t something i would recommend in any kind of production environment
seaborn does not change the behavior of matplotlib functions in the way you describe

30675687
seaborn	matplotlib
seaborn does not change the behavior of matplotlib functions in the way you describe
matplotlib exposes a number of options for customization that take effect by changing the default values of various plot parameters

30677302
super	self
this creates a problem if the dunder method is available on the super object but not on object that the mutable object represents
for instance with the list example the function __iadd__ could have been more simply written as def __iadd__ self other return super .__iadd__ other with the tuple example we fall into infinite recursion this is because tuple.__iadd__ does not exist

30677302
super	self
for instance with the list example the function __iadd__ could have been more simply written as def __iadd__ self other return super .__iadd__ other with the tuple example we fall into infinite recursion this is because tuple.__iadd__ does not exist
therefore when looking up the attribute __iadd__ on a super object the actual super object is checked for an __iadd__ attribute which does exist

30679043
cloudant	couchdb
libraries may not implement the full cloudant api so you may end up having to make rest json calls to access these features not implemented by the library
the main advantage of using a cloudant couchdb library is that you write less code

30679516
mongodb	bson
explicitly define the id field as an objectid when using mongodb

for xml documents it may be that the elementtree offered by lxml is more productive
it supports xpath queries for example while beautifulsoup does not

30682925
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
my idea to add an override of supportedinterfaceorientations was correct but where i went wrong was that i added the override to the custom subclass of uiviewcontroller - but this is not the presented view controller
the presented view controller as my code snippet shows is the uinavigationcontroller instance

30685465
swift	objective-c
for example or new in swift 2.0 you can hide one or both of them from objective-c without going so far as to make it private
you cannot overload methods that objective-c can see because objective-c has no overloading the fact that this was allowed in swift before swift 1.2 was in fact a bug

30685465
swift	objective-c
you cannot overload methods that objective-c can see because objective-c has no overloading the fact that this was allowed in swift before swift 1.2 was in fact a bug
swift 1.2 closed the loophole and fixed the bug. simple solution hide these methods from objective-c

30688698
google-chrome	firefox
this will work for firefox but be aware that google-chrome still uses prefixed values for animation because the css animation specification is not completely finalised yet
so for google-chrome you need to include the following -webkit-animation dash 8s 5s linear forwards

since your algorithm isn t actually working with binary numbers it s working with base ten numbers and relies on convenient similarity of base 10 powers of ten and base 2 powers of two interpreting some things as octal ruins it

30690837
aggregate-functions	sum
you are using count function which is an aggregate-functions thus you get all rows grouped
in your query amount is not calculated as a sum it uses just some row s value it is not determined which row s values is used since mysql allows for using non-grouped columns combined with grouped ones

30690947
namenode	hdfs
sudo chown -r hadoopuser hadoopgroup usr local hadoop_store hdfs namenode sudo chmod -r 777 usr local hadoop_store hdfs namenode here hadoopuser is your hadoop username and hadoopgroup is hadoop group name
this error occurs if you have not created the usr local hadoop_store hdfs namenode folder or it does not have correct permission

30692028
build.gradle	gradlew
update from zatziky s answer for current android gradlew plugin v1.0+ and dexguard plugin 6.1.+ to create a dexguard plugin switch you may do the following in your root build.gradle add a property to your ext or create it if not done yet see here why you would do that in your app build.gradle add the plugin like this and if you have library projects do it like this remove all proguard configs from your debug build-types especially getdefaultdexguardfile dexguard-release.pro if you dont need them
unfortunatly at least with lib projects all buil-types are build even in assembledebug so you have to provide a stub for getdefaultdexguardfile like zatziky said you may add this to your root build.gradle so every script has it

30692488
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you shouldn t have an uinavigationcontroller between your uiviewcontroller a and c
since the uitabbarcontroller push the controller a embedded in an uinavigationcontroller your navigation is already setup for this tab no need to repush another one later

30693775
pdcurses	ncurses
noting comments pdcurses is not a port but a separate program
ncurses has a workable port to windows for what it s worth

30694830
hex	binary
if this is confusing you can always create a new hex representation by going the other way and use 0 binascii.hexlify function to create a hexadecimal representation for yourself just to debug the output and you ll see that the byte is still the right hex value
you are not writing hex you are writing binary data

30694830
hex	binary
you are not writing hex you are writing binary data
hexadecimal is a helpful notation when dealing with binary data but don t confuse the notation with the value

30695863
swift	objective-c
you will need a bridging header file to call your own objective-c code not cocoa code from your swift code
to call swift code you just need to get the #import right

30697307
super	implements
if this is a web application then iis makes this super simple to encrypt any section of the web.config file using aspnet_regiis.exe
see link here if this is not a web application then it is a bit harder but not much as you need to implements the protectedconfiguration provider yourself

30700194
multiplying	multiplication
using product a this array would look like multiplying these two arrays surrounded by a sumproduct yields if this sum is 0 then the person is not ordering this product if it is greater than 0 then the person is at least listed to buy the product
if you need an additional check if the qty is 0 perhaps this can be augmented onto the array multiplication

30700424
daemons	systemd
warning windows os x the default docker setup on windows and os x uses a virtualbox vm to host the docker daemons
unfortunately the mechanism virtualbox uses to share folders between the host systemd and the docker container is not compatible with the memory mapped files used by mongodb see vbox bug docs.mongodb.org and related jira.mongodb.org bug

30702163
gridview	repeater
second gridview is only able to postback the value of the only row that is being edited so what you need to do is to move the dropdown and all other controls to the edittemplate and set the row mode to edit so the value will get posted back to server. but if you want to be able to change all the dropdowns in all rows you might need to use repeater instead of gridview
first of all make sure you are not binding the gridview on postback before reading dropdown values because databind causes all controls to lose their postback value

30702491
ssl	https
when your page is accessed over https but the amazon load balancer is performing ssl offloading and actually requesting your content on the non-ssl port 80 the webserver php or anything else for that matter does not understand or see that it s being accessed over the fix for this is that amazon s elb sends the de-facto standard x-forwareded-proto http header which we can use to figure out which protocol the client is actually using on the other side of the load balancer
with apache 2.2 you could use something along the lines of this simply reads the x-forwared-proto header and if it equals https then sets the https environment variable to 1

30707581
jar	war
your file is not found as it may have been place in different location when packages as war jar or whatever you choose
check your war file you may fint it under classes some package

30708338
nunit	mstest
many options exist though nunit and xunit would both meet your needs and both are popular
mstest doesn t support single-threaded testing

30709403
implements	extends
i do not like your solution even if i agree this could work your class example should implements map or extends linkedhashmap because the instance variable threshold is defined there and refines the concept of linkedhashmap with its own definition
your class example should not implements map or extends linkedhashmap because the activate method does not refines linkedhashmap nor map but uses concepts of maps

armadillo	lapack
you may need to reinstall or rebuild armadillo for your system
it does not ship with lapack and blas

the feature spec is handled mostly by capybara not rspec
capybara runs the majority of the browser rails server behavior in an external process

30716136
client-side	server-side
however the constraint of needing to see who has logged in from a second page means javascript alone client-side is not going to be able to solve the problem
you ll need something on the server-side that you can poll or use a push mechanism

30716707
pascal	delphi
this is clearly stated in embarcadero s documentation converting 32-bit delphi applications to 64-bit windows | inline assembly code if your application contains inline assembly asm code you need to examine the asm code and make the following changes mixing of assembly statements with pascal code is not supported in 64-bit applications
replace assembly statements with either pascal code or functions written completely in assembly

30718071
fgets	fread
i would stick a return statement right after the assignment to a next when you re determining the number of lines in your text file be advised that you re advancing the file pointer each time you call fgets and so when you finally finish reading all of the lines the file pointer points at the end of the text file
any further calls to fread fgets or any of the family that reads things from files will not give you anything because you re at the end of the file

equals	gethashcode
unequal objects can have identical hash codes. to test for equality call the referenceequals or equals method
gethashcode does not return cryptographic hash

30721811
profiling	benchmarking
this effect is caused by type profiling pollution
let me explain on a simplified benchmarking though iteration parameter here changes very slightly and it does not affect the main benchmarking loop the results expose very surprising 2.5x performance degradation benchmarking iterations mode cnt score error units streams.loop 500 thrpt 5 29491 039 240 953 ops ms streams.loop 520 thrpt 5 11867 860 344 779 ops ms now let s run jmh with -prof perfasm option to see the hottest code regions fast case iterations 500 slow case iterations 520 looks like the slow case spends the most time in reduceop.evaluatesequential method that is not inlined

30721811
profiling	debugging
let s use -xx +printmethoddata available in debugging jvm to compare the execution profiling you see the initialization loop ran too long that its statistics appeared in the execution profiling all virtual methods have two implementations and checkcast has also two different entries
in the fast case the profiling is not polluted all sites are monomorphic and jit can easily inline and optimize them

30721811
profiling	benchmarking
in the fast case the profiling is not polluted all sites are monomorphic and jit can easily inline and optimize them
the same is true for your original benchmarking longer stream operations in init method polluted the profiling

30722310
apache	nginx
similar to your apache configuration example you could configure apache to rewrite the url and then proxy not redirect -- proxy the request to s3 with the path rewritten
the same could be done with nginx or haproxy or several other products.

30722421
bash	subshell
yes you can export such an environment variable but not from a bash export statement
while bash will refuse to create an environment variable named for example a b we can create it with python and subshell created by python will see it

30723432
swift	objective-c
this will work because swift will bridge a bool to an nsnumber including as it passes into an anyobject and objective-c will deal just fine with an optional anyobject or optional nsnumber because those are object types not scalars
that is perfectly fine in swift

30723432
swift	objective-c
that is perfectly fine in swift
but you cannot expose it to objective-c because objective-c does not have any notion of an optional bool - a bool in objective-c is basically just a number a primitive c datatype what we call a scalar

30724051
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
docs about --logdest options btw the deb package puppet provides for debian or ubuntu even includes a logrotate configuration file for var log puppet i don t know why this option is not default
since your mentioned syslog i assume you were talking about debian-like linux

30725868
setinterval	settimeout
the trick is to not use setinterval and to use settimeout in a loop instead
setinterval reads the timing value you give it once schedules based on this timing and forgets about it

30730727
clang	llvm
either add -c for the bitcode or -s for the readable form to your command line clang -xclang -cc1 -o3 mips.c -emit-llvm -s
as written in the error message you can only compile when emitting llvm ir not link

30732497
keystore	jks
as per the documentation on ssl properties javax.net.ssl.truststoretype - optional for java keystore file format this property has the value jks or jks
you do not normally specify this property because its default value is already jks

30732906
sudo	passwd
i want to run the command in user mode sudo but the terminal don t need ask me the passwd
the scenario you are experiencing is caused by the users cached credentials for sudo which allow sudo to maintain a session and any further sudo command will not prompt for passwd

30732906
sudo	passwd
the scenario you are experiencing is caused by the users cached credentials for sudo which allow sudo to maintain a session and any further sudo command will not prompt for passwd
check this open a new terminal and run sudo whatever then close it and open another new terminal and run sudo whatever you will see that sudo asks for passwd every time.

rdf	owl
stardog does not support rdf 1.1 yet and there is a bug wrt string literal reasoning as you noticed
your observation is correct plain literals in owl axioms are automatically converted to xsd string but literals in instance assertions are not

30735167
ionic	angular
its really can angular and jquery work together since ionic leverages angular
its common to use jquery with angular angular itself uses a subset of jquery already and will use the entire jquery version if it is found on the page. jquery is not evil the prolific use of jquery for simple things that can be done without jquery is what people often refer to as evil

30735167
ionic	angular
you can also look at angular material for a google backed project that was actually built with help from the ionic team
however it is not ionic and not finished either

30735407
client-side	server-side
i think you are confusing between nodejs server-side script and js client-side one
you cannot directly call example.js which is your server-side script directly from client-side

30735407
client-side	server-side
you cannot directly call example.js which is your server-side script directly from client-side
you have to launch it as a nodejs http server basically with the node command in your terminal in development in production maybe with foreverjs linux os x cd path to your project folder node example.js windows dir path to your project folder node example.js then on this server-side script you have to trigger the websockets events you are interested by. pay attention to the order of initialisation io should be initialised after the http server for instance you can emit it globally with io.emit eventname arguments or you can also emit it to a namespace or even emit it to a single socket received on io connection event socket.emit eventname arguments eventname should be a string that your client-side js will listen for arguments could be whatever you want the documentation overview of socket.io is full of very good examples

client-side	server-side
you have to launch it as a nodejs http server basically with the node command in your terminal in development in production maybe with foreverjs linux os x cd path to your project folder node example.js windows dir path to your project folder node example.js then on this server-side script you have to trigger the websockets events you are interested by. pay attention to the order of initialisation io should be initialised after the http server for instance you can emit it globally with io.emit eventname arguments or you can also emit it to a namespace or even emit it to a single socket received on io connection event socket.emit eventname arguments eventname should be a string that your client-side js will listen for arguments could be whatever you want the documentation overview of socket.io is full of very good examples
example server-side and remember that on server-side you cannot call client-side functions

swift	objective-c
now dreams come true - there are generics in objective-c since today thanks wwdc . it s not a joke - on official page of swift new syntax features let you write more expressive code while improving consistency across the language
the sdks have employed new objective-c features such as generics and nullability annotation to make swift code even cleaner and safer

30736042
setinterval	settimeout
however instead of using an settimeout setinterval to update the current time of the video i used request animation frame
request animation frame will render the video when it can instead of using a setinterval which will run even if the browser is not ready

30737654
ubuntu	linux
# install a docker compatible kernel on ubuntu 12.04 if it is not already v3.8+ # uname -r will tell you the current version running sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-raring linux-headers-generic-lts-raring sudo shutdown -r now
the stock linux kernel that came with 12.04 didn t have support for the required aufs file system

30737921
division	modulo
it seems like more imperative programming languages implement truncated division and more functional mathematical languages seem to use floored division
mysql isn t giving you a bogus result it s simply using a different implementation of modulo than you are expecting

30741014
knitr	latex
this can make things worse or better it depends on the internal parsing structure of knitr which i have no idea
i believe this behavior is normale because bordermatrix is a latex command and it works well when you compile a pdf which uses latex but i do not think direct latex markup can be converted in html even in a normal document without specific class specification you use memoir in fact

30744280
serializable	deserialization
otherwise it will call defaultreadobject which contains the logic for default serializable
as far as built-in factories for deserialization there isn t anything and i haven t really felt a need something since the standard serializable deserialization approach seems to work well

30744280
serializable	deserialization
as far as built-in factories for deserialization there isn t anything and i haven t really felt a need something since the standard serializable deserialization approach seems to work well
if you want more information on this i suggest taking a look at the serializable specification for a comprehensive and in-depth view of how java tackles serializable and specifically object input classes for your particular question

30744718
firefox	safari
according to an older firefox bug this issue affected not only previous versions of firefox but also internet explorer versions 8 and up
it appears as though mobile safari may also affected by this to some degree

30745623
swift	objective-c
3 add in your bridging header notice the angle brackets- not quotes and import mbprogresshud in the swift class that needs to use it
that is myapp-bridging-header.h this exposes the objective-c files to swift

30747593
equals	icomparable
otherwise add a your sorts at the appropriate place in your scenario basically return the first compare that is not equals years or months. you can call this by mylistofas.sort
i added icomparable to your a class which of course you can extract and pass as a delegate ..... fiddlerlink note for simplicity i do assume that the lists are sorted

30749348
jar	war
when you want to change your spring-boot app to a web deployment you basically have to do two things convert the packaging of your project from jar to war change the dependency of the embedded tomcat to provided further details can be found on the spring-boot documentation site
meskobalazs answered your question about the resources when building a war deployment but notice that src main webapp is not read as a resource folder in a jar deployment you have to add it as a resource in this case

30751488
serializable	deserialization
inproc mode in asp.net session state serializable deserialization is potential problem
inproc doesn t require serializable of complex objects

30753231
spaces	delimiter
w control+w is not the same thing than meta + delete esc+delete if you don t have checked use option as meta key meta+delete will treat _ as word delimiter where w will consider spaces as delimiter
using esc+bakcspace on cursor at the end rm dira dirb file1 gives rm dira dirb while w on the same will give rm so it is better to use 033 177 rather than w when defining the modifying the terminal profile. that way you are really mapping to what esc is doing and you keep having w to erase word based on spaces delimiter

30754303
swift	objective-c
in objective-c this would require the developer to implement this behaviour manually in swift this is much simpler and achieved using the lazy keyword
i can t find canonical proof that swift isn t a lazy evaluating language but i m sure the community will correct me if i m wrong

30757257
redmine	mantis
however you can export issues from redmine in csv format and then import to mantis using the csv_import plugin available here
mantis is just an issue tracking system and doesn t have any built-in project management features

30761285
ssl	https
warning this will blindly accept any ssl certificate connection that you attempt
this is not a safe practice but it will allow you to test your server using https

30762258
swift	objective-c
all cocoa frameworks are written in c or objective-c maybe the new ones in ios 9 are written in swift
the language in which an application is written doesn t matter the code is compiled into the same machine code so yes objective-c apps will continue to run and many developers won t bother with swift

30762258
swift	objective-c
the language in which an application is written doesn t matter the code is compiled into the same machine code so yes objective-c apps will continue to run and many developers won t bother with swift
apps that have been already written will not have to be rewritten to swift with some exceptions

30762258
swift	objective-c
apps that have been already written will not have to be rewritten to swift with some exceptions
swift won t allow you to do absolutely everything that objective-c does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that swift is more modern language with stronger typing than objective-c

30764927
g++	gcc
mingw uses gcc g++ and mingw is not a compiler it s basically a stripped version of cygwin that uses ms libs wherever possible
gcc will compile .c .cpp files as c and c++ respectively

30764927
g++	gcc
g++ will compile .c .cpp files but they will all be treated as c++ files
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this

30764927
g++	gcc
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this
gcc compiling c files has less predefined macros

30765702
arc4random	srand
first srand does not seed the arc4random function
it seeds the rand function which is a different pseudo-random number generator with somewhat worse properties than arc4random

30769002
xlwings	xlsxwriter
xlwings is indeed made for interacting with a running instance of excel and therefore does not run on linux
you will want to have a look into the pandas to_excel method or you may even want to use one of the underlying libraries directly that this method uses xlsxwriter openpyxl and xlwt

30769859
spaces	delimiter
note the code below is 8-space indented because so converts tabs to spaces so to use the code with the indention shown you will need to insure the whitespace preceding the code is tab characters and not spaces or it will not run you can choose whether you want to formally indent the heredoc or not
i prefer 4-space indention so i simply leave the heredoc opening and delimiter without indention to preserve the ability to allow cut paste of the example

30773465
mdpi	hdpi
in this answer romainguy mentioned that you should keep appropriate images to their respective folders mdpi xhdpi and other sources like .xml files for drawables in your drawable folder
for example if you will be using a hdpi device while you have not put any image in hdpi folder it will not crash

30776508
innodb	myisam
in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that myisam is faster than innodb but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times
clearly this isn t appropriate for all environments - as others have written myisam lacks such things as transactions and foreign keys

30776533
vb.net	vb6
and does not care that the variable or expression is actually boolean permitted in vb.net with option strict off
looks quirky but this is related to previous versions of visual basic the generation that ended with vb6

30784105
profiling	debugging
if you have selected the exception option in the profiling settings dialog after the plug-in throws an exception and the business process error dialog is displayed click download log file and save this file. alternately if the plug-in does not throw an exception click stop profiling
in the plug-in registration tool click debugging

30785150
google-chrome	firefox
i had the same problem and everyone was blaming to the poor hidden inputs been required but seems like a bug having your required field inside a fieldset. google-chrome tries to focus for some unknown reason your fieldset instead of your required input
this bug is present only in google-chrome i tested in version 43.0.2357.124 m. doesn t happen in firefox

30785429
google-chrome	firefox
currently google-chrome doesn t support min-height auto but there is another way you can disable shrink
on firefox it works because since version 34 it implements a auto as the initial value of min-height

30786498
multiplying	multiplication
this should work if you want to be able to multiplying anything with anything then you need to tell the compiler how to do it
to do so let s declare a trait that describes the functionality now you can define a generic function multiplying that lifts the multiplication to other types i will use seq you can use rdd now let s tell the compiler how to multiplying an int with a string scala can multiplying a string with an int but not the other way around. so let s define the multiplier to make it more interesting will be seq x x not xx like scala s own

30786642
ubuntu	linux
you should update chrome to the latest version if updating chrome isn t an option you can open chrome with some command-line arguments start chrome from terminal like this this works for me on ubuntu 14.10
this is a known issue in chrome 43.0.2357.124 for linux

30786761
profiling	instrumentation
the liberty profiling doesn t ever call runtime.halt so all shutdown hooks should be called appropriately
i thought i d take a look to reproduce and i think i managed to get it working i say i think because none of the command line scripts worked so i may still have done something wrong wrote a simple servlet war downloaded cobertura and put the cobertura-2.1.1.jar and all the jars in the downloads lib folder into the web-inf lib of my war ran the java instrumentmain class to instrumentation the classes in web-inf classes choosing to overwrite them started the server accessed the application shutdown the server at the end i looked in the web-inf classes and there was a cobertura.ser file that was 1480 bytes non-zero.

30792220
uitableview	uipickerview
note that i wasn t successful at making voiceover read custom accessibility label in cases where i populate the uipickerview using pickerview titleforrow forcomponent - even setting accessibilitylabel on the returned nsstring which does work in some other contexts like setting accessibility labels for uitableview indexes did not change what voiceover pronounces
so it seems the only way to go if you want to customize what voiceover or switch control speaks for a uipickerview row is to use pickerview viewforrow forcomponent reusingview not any of the other 2 candidate methods to populate the uipickerview rows

30792956
google-chrome	firefox
see these discussions and bug reports might be related flexbugs #14 - google-chrome flexbox intrinsic sizing not implemented correctly
firefox bug 972595 - flex containers should use flex-basis instead of width for computing intrinsic widths of flex items chromium issue 249112 - in flexbox allow intrinsic aspect ratios to inform the main-size calculation

30796549
factors	matrix
the term is 0 if any factors is 0 in other words if the permutation is not valid according to the matrix bipartite graph representation
the term is 1 if all factors are 1 in other words if the permutation is valid according to the restrictions

30798247
boost	allocator
we had significant performance problems with boost property_tree and json
our approach was to stop using std string and use an in-house string class with a custom allocator and hash tables for not reallocating the same string twice

30800191
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is sadly not precise
i once created a clock by using settimeout 1000 and the result was a catastrophe - large fluctuations in triggered times even as high as +-30

30801278
hash-collision	key
in short you should not really worry about hash-collision
hazelcast does not rely on hashcode equals methods of the key object instead it is using the murmur hash of the binary representation of the key

30806419
hash-collision	key
murmurhash has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than md5 largely owing to md5 being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash-collision or anything like that
some key-value stores also make it relatively easy to make your design collision-tolerant for example you could store the hash in a riak map with a flag indicating whether there have been any collisions on that hash value - if false then simply return the blob else fall back on option 2 the indexed blob becomes the two blobs with a hash collision zipped tarred together along with a csv of which key correspond to which blob

30810050
udp	tcp
so inherently you cannot open a udp connection since for even getting a websocket connection started you will already have a tcp ip connection going
however if you really do need udp you could implement something on your server side that actually does the udp connection and act as a proxy where your server opens the udp connection with more low level libraries

30812295
ssl	https
the correct way should be aquiring a ssl certificate from an authorized provider like verisign and others
1 - it is not true that passwords don t have to be encrypted on https

30818353
laravel	codeigniter
here s a possible solution laravel 4 but it worths a try update as of this you should try to change the driver value from to ...also on laravel s docs you can see that the driver has to be defined like that
i m not familiar with laravel but on codeigniter i save user session in codeigniter s session class and laravel has one too

30818960
vmware	virtualbox
i ve had a very slow site in vagrant become perfectly usable by switching from the virtualbox provider to the vmware one
this is a somewhat expensive solution though as you should definitely not install the trial version of vmware because it doesn t play nicely with the vagrant vmware plugin follow the official instructions to uninstall vmware then reinstall the full version after purchasing

30820823
realloc	malloc
example remember to check the return value of realloc as well as the one of malloc to ensure that the re allocation has not failed
no you can only free pointers that have been returned by malloc

30822191
strcpy	strdup
to copy a string you need to allocate memory and then strcpy
the strdup function will do that for you but strdup is not supported on all systems

30824412
swift	objective-c
in swift 2 it returns because the new try syntax returns a non-optional
in the case that the method would return nil the method would not return at all and control would move to the catch block. nsmutabledictionary is not convertible to nsobject anyobject this means you re trying to insert something into an nsmutabledictionary that can t be converted to an objective-c object

30824969
postgresql	mysql
if you care about performance more than using eloquent then with raw queries in postgresql with returning clause or sql server with output clause you can return updated records in one go
mysql unfortunately doesn t have such support on a statement level

30830868
build.gradle	gradlew
###library s build.gradle app s build.gradle changing the build variant of one of them in the android studio will change the build variant of the other
an update over marcus answer i don t know since what version of gradlew android studio but now it s possible to do update publishnondefault is now deprecated and not needed anymore

30831348
octal	binary
to answer your question ascii a is hexadecimal 0x41 is decimal 65 is octal 0101 is binary 0b01000001
basically a computer only understand numbers and not every numbers it only understand binary represented numbers ie

30831486
setcontentview	findviewbyid
move setcontentview before findviewbyid and it will work
the content is not set into the view the findviewbyid will return null if you do it before setcontentview

30832278
swift	objective-c
adding generics to objective-c enables apple to tag the methods correctly the important thing here is that now swift can work with the frameworks much better
implementing warnings errors for misuse of generics in objective-c is not that important so we can expect a lot of bugs there

30832868
icmp	udp
edit there s even one more interesting way - icmp traversal
in fact icmp especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than udp on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones

30833520
oncreate	findviewbyid
i might be wrong but i think that you shouldn t initialize your global parameters before the oncreate method is called
you re trying to initialize them with findviewbyid before the contentview was even set

30839785
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
tldr override touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended on the parent not on the children
one way to do this is to override the touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended callbacks on your view controller

30840407
springlayout	miglayout
to bring this question up to date to 2015 for all those who like me found themselves looking in vain for support for springlayout in netbeans it still does not exist and probably never will
many other answers here on so about difficulties with layoutmanagers suggested using miglayout .

30840986
bash	zsh
the autoload feature is not available in bash but it is in ksh korn shell and zsh
on zsh see man zshbuiltins

30841594
rpm	yum
a bit of work will be required to get the rpm install working under amazon linux.
using pip alone not in conjunction with yum is probably the best option right now on amazon linux

30842274
dictionary	map
input seat_num 16 ## note i don t see 16 in the dictionary output should be b how about this lookup function sample output
it seems to me that the seats_dict does not hold a full map for seats and sections but only the end number of each section

30842402
udp	tcp
udp is not reliable delivery but a you can make it reliable by requiring that send udp packets require acknowledgements be return
this along with a few other requirements is what makes tcp reliable over ip which is unreliable to begin with

30843997
express	node.js
this is your case sou need to install express locally note that you get undefined as a result because of the var statement but it did work
as per issue #5431 looks like the node.js repl doesn t find globally-installed modules and this is expected behaviour

30850475
implements	extends
you could theoretically have undrawableshape that extends shape but doesn t implements drawable so the compiler won t let you call a draw method that may not exist
to call draw you can do the following instead of having each concrete subclass implements drawable have the shape class implements drawable

30851410
bash	tcsh
bash supports arrays though the syntax is a bit less convenient than csh s -- but bash s behavior is more consistent
one example i m not sure that i could prove from csh s and or tcsh s manual that q would work in this case

30851835
portrait	landscape
this looks fine in portrait but the segmented control will not stretch out for landscape
portrait includes ib setup and simulator landscape also includes ib setup and simulator it seems like the app store has a segmented control that is set to a certain width and then the view isn t allowed to rotate

30853993
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
ensures that the pseudo element is only 5 characters long the weird media query is the hack to target ie tested and working in firefox 38.0.5 google-chrome 43.0.2357.124 m and ie 11
browsers not supporting the ch unit such as opera 12.17 and windows safari 5.1.7 seem to show the phone number in its natural state

30854222
realloc	malloc
neither malloc not realloc return values are checked for memory allocation failure
you should realloc the line to the actual size used to reduce the amount of memory consumed

30857141
super	extends
for example if it is known that a only serves as a consumer of u then you can use a super bound and it will work
my question is why can i do this because el extends el and but not because t does not extends

30857439
fold	combinators
one could recreate this precise prng using unfold so it may not use folding but be functionally and semantically equivalent to a fold
the two folding and unfolding of lists above are special cases of the more general folding of lists in linq this generality is present in other combinators such as select

30859652
implements	extends
whereas extensions must be implements in main interface file
which means we can safely conclude you cannot use extensions for extends builtin classes or classes for which you don t have the source code there you should use categories

30859725
erlang	elixir
joe armstrong describes this in a blog post so our code looks like we re doing a synchronous blocking read. looks like was in quotes because it s not actually a blocking read it s really an asynchronous read which does not block any other erlang processes
erlang and thus elixir io is non-blocking so the io of one process does not generally affect other processes in any way

30859932
doc	rtf
word can open rtf quickly and so far our customers never complained about getting rtf not doc or docx
migradoc cannot generate doc or docx files

30864465
sudo	passwd
more information about the other possible settings for sudo can be found in the manpage
another in my opinion cleaner approach create a new file in etc sudoers.d with content this causes sudo to not ask for the passwd if any user of group users tries to execute a shutdown or reboot

30866568
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
i created a very simple app to test the scenario you described which contained the following there are 2 activities firstactivity and secondactivity firstactivity has a button when the button is clicked it starts secondactivity with startactivityforresult activity lifecycle events are logged using activitylifecyclecallbacks in a custom application class in firstactivity onactivityresult additionally outputs to the log when it gets called here is what is output application is started firstactivity is created and started and visible firstactivity oncreate firstactivity onstart firstactivity onresume i press the button to start secondactivity firstactivity onpause secondactivity oncreate secondactivity onstart secondactivity onresume firstactivity onsaveinstancestate firstactivity onstop note ondestroy does not get called
now i press the back button and return to the first activity secondactivity onpause firstactivity onstart firstactivity onactivityresult firstactivity onresume secondactivity onstop secondactivity ondestroy the back button calls finish on secondactivity so it s destroyed now if i press back again firstactivity will also be finished causing ondestroy to be called

30868175
ssl	https
if ssl is not configured then it will trow an error
run your application on https with ssl

30871435
google-chrome	firefox
i ran the following snippet in my browser console google-chrome told me failed to execute requestfullscreen on element api can only be initiated by a user gesture
firefox told me request for full-screen was denied because element.mozrequestfullscreen was not called from inside a short running user-generated event handler

30871838
libstdc++	libc++
this happens because llvm libc++ is not binary compatible with gnu libstdc++ and boost in crystax ndk was built and linked against gnu libstdc++
the only way to fix it is build boost with llvm libc++ which shouldn t be too hard but it s completely non-tested

30871896
org.json	jackson	org.json	gson
first of all i highly recommend do not use this library org.json this is very old and unsupported as i know library
i suggest jackson or gson

30872029
draggable	droppable
you ve got at least three major problems draggable doesn t have connectwith it has connecttosortable . so you should change this
see doc to use connecttosortable you need a sortable not at droppable

30872912
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can not use include with a ienumerable it only works with iqueryable when you invoke in your repository query.tolist
you query is retrieved from database to memory in a ienumerable and when your data is in memory include doesn t work

30873728
namenode	hdfs
namenode keeps the information about files and their associated blocks
hdfs will not move blocks from old datanodes to new datanodes to balance the cluster if a datanode added in hadoop cluster.to do this you need to run the balancer

30876054
csv	tsv
instead you should check for rows that exist in the the new file but aren t in the new one also your csv files are tsvs so they won t be loaded properly
you should instruct the csv module to use tsv to open your files

30878449
centos	linux
if you re looking for a no-cost solution that is very much similar to rhel i suggest using centos
without registering a red hat enterprise linux license you re not going to be able to install anything

30880075
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you are trying to access the property viewcontrollers of the type uiviewcontroller which it doesn t have
viewcontrollers is a property on a uitabbarcontroller but viewcontrollers returns an array of uiviewcontroller

30880632
jar	war
i m not sure about the exact steps required to set this up in wildfly but its usually a setting in meta-inf application.xml something like since in the above you re already pulling common classes into a jar file i d probably just include this jar in each war file as part of my build process
you will not be able to make a reference to a class in one war from another

30880965
super	extends
a quick solution is to ensure the base initialize method is also called using super potentially better solution extends activemodel naming to expose the error message functionality may not be the best way of handling errors in this case
finding a way to add the errors to a customer object and then using those errors thus negating the need to extends activemodel naming at all may be a preferred long-term solution

30882206
swift	objective-c
objective-c swift 2.2 to set font to particular uilabel use this code objective-c swift 2.2
update for swift 3 for the past few month swift approach towards init has changed i would recommend not to use init in swift 3 objective- c swift 2.2 update this has worked for me

30883285
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is not by origin a bounded strcpy and the committee preferred to recognize existing practice rather than alter the function to better suit it to such use
strcpy and strcat aren t similar to gets

30885111
sudo	passwd
path is the path to the folder to share browsable yes makes the share and it s content browsable for authenticated users guest ok no disables anonymous login read only no enables editing and renaming files create mask 0755 sets the default permissions for new files then create user and set passwd for accessing the share sudo useradd share sudo passwd share sudo smbpasswd -a share sudo smbpasswd -e share move your smb.conf to etc samba smb.conf sudo mv smb.conf etc samba smb.conf reload samba config sudo etc init.d samba reload or if that doesn t work sudo smbd reload done
now you can access the share on windows using serveraddress share the username is workgroup share or linuxserverhostname share and passwd is the passwd you set above

30888088
build.gradle	gradlew
one of the authors of gradlew hans dockter has said somewhere i believe it was in his rocking the gradlew demo from 2012 that he felt one of their biggest mistakes was using build.gradle as the default file name
a simple web search for gradlew rename build.gradle renders the below example settings.gradle file note that the author is here also renaming the root project s build script which you may or may not want

30892467
swift	objective-c
then when you remove the override keyword the error you re getting is letting you know that you ve made a method that has a conflicting objective-c selector with the real touches began method unlike swift objective-c doesn t support method overloading
the bottom line is in swift 2 your touches began override should look like this

30896153
mongodb	bson
the bnf grammar only said that an element name is a nul terminated modified utf-8 string but from the source code here or here for example it appears that mongodb bson s implementation use strcmp to perform binary comparison on element names confirming there is no way to achieve what you want
this might be indeed an issue beyond case sensitivity as using combining characters the same character might have several binary representations -- but mongodb does not perform unicode normalization

30900198
required	placeholder
you may use different syntax if you are using other languages than php.for php required command minimizes efforts needed to check empty fields using php
placeholder cannot set the default value for text area

30901253
dictionary	map
dictionary allow you to map a key to a value . for example you can define a dictionary like this and you can easily change it like this
why not use a dictionary

30902053
http	spdy
the pseudo header names where chosen to begin with a colon because that would be an illegal character for a header name in http 1.1. http 1.1 does not use pseudo header names
the purpose of the pseudo header fields was to unify the way the request response information was carried in spdy and later in http 2 which is based on spdy

30902652
fgets	strcpy
now use 256 instead of sizeof buff as buffer control in fgets
in c you cannot assign strings with the operator nor compare with you use strcpy and strcmp respectively

30903436
viewdidload	viewdidappear
in viewdidload your view has not been displayed yet
move the call to rate it me from viewdidload to viewdidappear

you can see a quick demo here the main issue is that not all browsers support this feature at the moment but you can use it on the main ones from google-chrome 43 internet explorer 10 firefox 41 safari 10 update 1 this can be achieved also with a pure javascript solution no jquery notice that we pass the id without the # now
as madzohan reported in the comments below there is some strange issue with the 64-bit version of google google-chrome in some cases running the file locally

30905354
bower	npm
npm is for installing packages to your backend bower is for installing libraries to your front end
you will probably want to add the bower_components folder to your .gitignore or equivalent if not using git anyone who uses your repo can run bower install to get the front end libraries the listing of libraries is kept in bower.json

30907319
content-length	content-type
proxy any proxy between you and your server could be modifying the request and not update the content-length header
this could also happens if setting wrong content-type

swift	objective-c
apple s reference tell us that you cannot import c++ code directly into swift
instead create an objective-c or c wrapper for c++ code

30911294
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome will show warnings long before that but still accept them
firefox will not accept sha-1 after january 2017

30912187
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
lenreq required_length it s not clear whether matching is case-sensitive and if it is you should make it clear to the user
sprinkling lower throughout your code will help make it case-insensitive if necessary

30915788
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
because arithmeticexception is a unchecked-exception and from runtimeexception runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception do not need to be declared in a method or constructor s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary

30924714
swift	objective-c
foo.h file seen by swift - included in the bridging file inside source file foo.cpp not seen by swift
you can also skip the objective-c file in between

30926547
factors	mean
however the second code assumes that a number is composite false until a number is found that isn t a factors
but just because a number was found not to be a factors doesn t mean that it s prime

30927001
n-gram	words
if so do not use n-gram
they stick together words at random and you just get intriguingly natural-looking nonsense

30928920
udp	tcp
the play button on flash player acts as rtsp invoker for media being called and media is streamed via udp packets. in fact you don t need to migrate anywhere from page because the embedded object calls for video not the http page but as the object is embedded on http page once you close it object also get closed
from ...of course youtube page uses http which is over tcp

30929220
namenode	hdfs
if you want to upload file to hdfs you need not to care copy it into the namenode or datanode
because hdfs will do it

30930277
voip	sip
actually some samsung devices also doesn t support sip voip like s3 there are some library you can use to refer for building your own sip voip client
i used to build voip client using csipsimple it works fine on almost all devices i tested

30932714
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you have probably embedded your uitabbarcontroller inside the uinavigationcontroller and not the other way around
a correct layout looks like this in interface builder to reproduce in interface builder drop a uitabbarcontroller

30932835
implements	extends
and you use cursorloader when you have to implements a loader which loads cursor usually used when you have load data from a database
asynctaskloader is a abstract loader that provides an asynctask to do the work.so you usually extends the asynctaskloader to create your very own custom loader.the key difference between using a asynctask and using a asynctaskloader is that configuration changes such as orientation change do not affect asynctaskloader and its processes since asynctaskloader has its own lifecycle

30932934
spaces	delimiter
embedded spaces or special characters are not allowed
when used in transact-sql statements identifiers that fail to comply with these rules must be delimiter by double quotation marks or brackets

30933516
google-chrome	firefox
it wouldn t be too difficult to set up a proxy via customevent for that though as the biggest part of the google-chrome api only requires and returns data that is clonable
what i found out i initially thought this was a security feature mostly because firefox behaves that way

30935462
profiling	debugging
while you cannot configure maven s resource plugin to use conditional filtering at least as far as i know it is still possible with maven to select a build profiling based on the value of a particular property
as described on maven - introduction to build profiles you can activate a particular profiling when some property has a given value scroll down to the profiling below will activate the profiling when the system property debugging is specified with any value

30940969
build.gradle	gradlew
since the error message is referring to line 5 of your build file i m guessing it s this evaluationdependson library so make sure there s a library directory with a build.gradle file inside located off the root directory of the project
the gradlew error configuration with name default not found. means that gradlew is looking for a module at a certain location and not finding it

30942301
prepare	execute
it means working with systems infrastructure knowing what hardware to ask for what os to install how to prepare the system and dependencies for all software understanding creating manipulating and querying databases api back-end code in one or more languages ruby java python etc. front-end code in one or more languages html javascript java etc. project management client work gathering requirements creating technical specifications and architecture documents creating good documentation managing a project timeline someone who knows agile scrum kanban in general a full-stack developer has knowledge that is a mile wide but not necessarily very deep and has core competencies in the pieces of the stack in which they work most

30943322
super	implements
inheritance only works if the method you want to use is in both classes and inherited from a super class
interfaces work if the super class doesn t have the same method but both child classes do implements the interface

30943611
swift	objective-c
swift extensions have nothing to do with enums. they provide a way of extending a class for which you might not even have the source code. for example that will make the function multiplyby2 available through your whole application for any double instance so you could simply do something like you can have as many extensions over a class as you wish. extensions allow you to add methods and calculated properties but not stored properties
but that can be achieved by using the objective-c runtime

30945621
build.gradle	gradlew
every line of code in build.gradle is executed when the script is processed
gradlew scripts are not there to execute code at build time

30946462
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
as uiimage extends from nsobject you can not add uitapgesturerecognizer to it you have to add gesture to the uiimageview itself
then in any of the uigesturerecognizer delegate methods or get touch s location in uiimageview

30947182
swift	objective-c
i just saw this related question swift access control with target selectors basically the same thing but i think yours is phrased in a more general way so not strictly a duplicate
according to using swift with cocoa and objective-c declarations marked with the private modifier do not appear in the generated header

30947182
swift	objective-c
according to using swift with cocoa and objective-c declarations marked with the private modifier do not appear in the generated header
private declarations are not exposed to objective-c unless they are explicitly marked with ibaction iboutlet or objective-c as well. excerpt from apple inc

30954548
base	fractions
double and float use base 2 numbers internally and have less precision nsdecimalnumber uses base 10 and also has greater precision
it is similar to fractions and decimals where for example 1 3 and 0.333333333333333333 are not exactly the same

30959578
implements	extends
it s similar to how you would implements a custom infowindowadapter for normal markers with no clustering but with the additional requirement that you keep a reference to the currently selected item so that you can get the title and snippet from it s myitem instance since the marker does not store the title and snippet as it usually does
note that since all of the data is stored in myitem references it s much easier to extends the functionality to display as many data types as you want in the infowindow for each marker

30961399
google-chrome	firefox
this includes google-chrome 37+ and firefox 4+ . firefox disables directwrite by default when hardware acceleration is not available but it can be enabled via setting the config property gfx.font_rendering.directwrite.enabled to true
google-chrome 37+ directwrite is on by default but can be disabled by setting the flag disable directwrite

30962152
vbscript	jscript
in vbscript this isn t an issue because its arrays are implemented using safearrays but in jscript the array is essentially a special type of object that is not easily converted to a safearray you can read more in this article from eric lippert s blog if you want more details
there is no built-in way to convert a jscript array to a safearray though there are workarounds see this so question for example

30962403
ubuntu	debian
here is something similar which i faced before mysql ft_min_word_len change on ubuntu does not work
to answer your first situation hello returing nothing its the fulltext search stopwords which is not doing anything when you search for the word hello you can setup your own file as in the mysql config file for debian etc mysql my.cnf add ft_stopword_file path to stopword_file.txt we can leave this file blank if needed

30962740
ssl	https
http is not at all secure this is the reason every site in google is now under ssl because non ssl content can be altered by isps and firewalls in fact isps firewalls and other routers are continuously injecting scripts on page to monitor traffic
explain your client that today running an authenticated session under non https is equivalent to locking doors of home but leaving all windows open

30965315
quicksort	mergesort
but that s not the case in quicksort
in stable sorting algorithms the swapping or spring occurs only with adjacent elements. for example in mergesort the elements are made into units of one then sorted accordingly using merge function .i think if u consider linear sort its self explanatory

30966030
swift	objective-c
from using swift with cocoa and objective-c requiring dynamic dispatch while the objective-c attribute exposes your swift api to the objective-c runtime it does not guarantee dynamic dispatch of a property method subscript or initializer
the swift compiler may still devirtualize or inline member access to optimize the performance of your code bypassing the objective-c runtime

30968701
boost	allocator
you need to define use a custom trait like boost spirit traits are
the presence or absense of an allocator doesn t really tell you whether a container is fixed-size

30969283
cashapelayer	calayer
you could also use calayer cashapelayer or other layer classes to create a border
but i would not recommend to use calayer just to show a border as it is simpler to use uiview with height of 1 on the top of that you get some nice addition such as autolayout

30969283
uiview	calayer
but i would not recommend to use calayer just to show a border as it is simpler to use uiview with height of 1 on the top of that you get some nice addition such as autolayout
if you use calayer you will have to set frame to layer at appropriate time when the view bounds change

30972532
persistent	transient
mongo does not persistent the data and jackson ignores the property since it is marked as transient
i managed to get this working by tricking jackson to ignore the transient field and then annotating the getter method with jsonproperty

30973722
octal	decimal
the default grammar of regexp as described in section 15.10.1 of es5.1 or section 21.2.1 of es6 doesn t support octal escape sequence and any decimal escape sequence whose value larger than the number of capturing groups triggers syntaxerror
however many browsers even old versions extends the regexp grammar to support octal escape sequence and evaluates the 2 lines of code above to true

30974944
fread	read.table
here i changed the delimiter to using awk and read with fread library data.table fread v1 # id_ref 1688628068_a.avg_signal 1688628068_a.avg_nbeads #1 ilmn_1343291 62821.840 135 #2 ilmn_1343292 3255.167 131 #3 ilmn_1343293 42924.910 152 #4 ilmn_1343294 55255.210 100 # 1688628068_a.bead_stderr 1688628068_a.detection_pval #1 413.93990 0 #2 47.76587 0 #3 539.30260 0 #4 746.14570 0 or using read.table note i changed the column name from 1688628068_a.detection pval to 1688628068_a.detection_pval for some reason the extra spaces is creating problems with fread
with read.table it is not an issue

30975787
implements	extends
option a a base activity class that implements the logic for the menu items - in this case all 30 of your activities should extends the base activity
this approach has the serious limitation that it forces you to extends a class even though you may need to extends another since java does not support multiple inheritance

30977465
express	node.js
if you re using express 3.x 4.x you just need to make sure you have the bodyparser included express 3.x express 4.x in your package file body-parser 1.0.0 or alternatively run npm-install body-parser then in your node.js server link to an example 3
without express if for some reason you ve decide not to use express you ll prob need to bind to the the data handler of the socket to read the data

30978870
swift	objective-c
the previous answer below basically focused on the protocol rather than the instance variables in swift you can just have the protocol as the type see a working example
a bit of confusion later you cannot access the instance variables of an objective-c class from within swift in a regular proper manner

30980557
division	modulo
cast it as an int so that we not only drop the decimal places off but also ensure integer division takes place select cast yourcolumn as int 1000 the operator modulo essentially divides the left side by the right side and returns the remainder
so if we divide 123 456 by 1000 using integer division the result would be 123 with a remainder of 456

30982422
inline	inlining
the function is a member whether it s inline or not
to elaborate a bit the compiler checks that the program does not break the access rules before any inlining optimization is done

30983434
qthread	qobject
the qthread run method only spins exec in qt parlance an event loop of course it won t do it anymore if your reimplementation doesn t
an event loop waits for events to arrive in the queue and then notifies the target qobject s of their reception

30984417
serializable	deserialization
jsonignore is required to specify that the fullname property should not be serializable to the json representation
to ignore the property during deserialization we need to add the jsonproperty annotation with which means not required

30990022
implements	extends
the javatokenparsers does not implements the scanners trait
so you would need to extends also from this trait or a trait that extends it in order to have access to this class

30991484
onresume	onpause
the issue is not explicitly displayed but arises due to what is not in onresume
by having the mediaplayer created in oncreate after returning from onpause the activity does not go through oncreate and thus there is no mediaplayer

30999205
postgresql	mysql
if you want to use a external database i would recommend you to import the shape file in postgresql and not in mysql since it has a more powerful support for spatial data
mysql supports several geometry functions for editing and querying spatial data

31008156
innodb	myisam
it is not even 10 times as fast as innodb
today 5.6 or newer you would be hard pressed to find a well tuned application that is more than a little faster in myisam

google-chrome	firefox
activex is not supported on google-chrome firefox
file-type associations clickonce is also not supported on google-chrome firefox

31008841
aggregate-functions	sum
you are using sum which is an aggregate-functions
when you use an aggregate-functions any other columns must be in a group by clause to aggregate them so if you have col1 | col2 1 | categorya 2 | categorya 2 | categoryb if you do select sum col1 col2 that s not valid because sum is an aggregate and col2 is not

31008841
aggregate-functions	sum
when you use an aggregate-functions any other columns must be in a group by clause to aggregate them so if you have col1 | col2 1 | categorya 2 | categorya 2 | categoryb if you do select sum col1 col2 that s not valid because sum is an aggregate and col2 is not
you need to group by col2 select sum col1 col2 from table group by col2 this will give you 3 | categorya 2 | categoryb your issue is that you are selecting from the imports table which is causing your grouping to be wrong

31009073
icomparable	compareto
if we use the standard f# sort we get the uppercase-first result even if we cast to icomparable we get the same result on the other hand if we use linq from f# we get the same result as the c# code according to msdn the orderby method compares keys by using the default comparer default. the f# libraries do not use comparer by default but we can use sortwith now when we do this sort we get the same result as the linq orderby alternatively we can use the built-in compareto function which gives the same result moral of the tale if you care about sorting always specify the specific comparison to use
this has nothing to do with c# vs f# or even icomparable but is just due to the different sort implementations in the libraries

31013483
stateless	stateful
if you create a stateless session bean it does not care about which client is calling it allow you reuse the instances across multiple clients with this you are going to have a better performance in your application it is one of the principal differences between a stateless session bean and a stateful session bean
a stateful session bean is going to create one instance per client and it is going to reduce the performance of the application because you are going to have many instances at the same time

31015861
direct3d	directx	directx	direct2d
there is not ay built-in managed assemblies for using direct3d or direct2d from c# so the provided directx and xaml app project template is a visual c++ project
you should be able to use the standard visual c# - windows phone apps - blank app windows phone or visual c# - universal apps - blank app universal apps as a starting xaml app and then add interop per the msdn instructions you reference but you ll need to use some other solution for actually calling direct2d or direct3d from c# such as win2d or sharpdx

31016813
ubuntu	centos
on my laptop running ubuntu 14.04 this code does not break it runs to completion
on my school s computer running centos 6.6 it also runs fine

31018022
punctuation	words
only thing to remember is for tokenized fields the pattern match can not be exact as all the non token characters whitespace punctuation etc will have been lost and treated as equal.
i think you could simply use this query it should give you all categories whose name contains cat words

31021141
jar	war
but one important point is that if you have any dependencies which are not available in the libs of glassfish you have to package them with your application which is not possible with ejb jar packaging
you have to package it as a war or ear file

31025032
implements	extends
you would have to so something like this this way you force your extends class to implements the method anothermethod and this method is called from your abstract class a
if your extends class does not need to do anything in anothermethod you can just let the method body empty

31025477
entity-relationship	diagram
an entity-relationship diagram is just a representation it does not enforce any rules
there is nothing about representing a model in an entity-relationship diagram that implies satisfaction of 3nf

31030088
youtube	vimeo
i did get this error similar though for both the youtube and the vimeo page object at url of type video.other is invalid because a required property og video url of type url was not provided.
when troubleshooting facebook share problems you may use this tool i plugged your vimeo video url into there and clicked on the fetch new scrape information button

31031472
uilabel	uitextview
so wherever you call will need to be adjusted to take the vertical shift of the uilabel into account
i think the issue is stemming from the fact that nstextcontainer lays out text like a uitextview which means that it will not be vertically centered like a uilabel

31033460
implements	extends
rather it should be a logical entity and in fact can be something that implements shape such as a line2d or could be your own complete class but should know how to draw itself if it does not implements shape then it should have some type of draw graphics2d g method that other classes can call
i think instead you should work on extends your panel s jpanel class such that you override its paintcomponent method give it a collection to hold any myline items added to it and draw the myline items within the paintcomponent

31034225
spaces	delimiter
using just standard shell utilities you could do this this might possibly mess with spaces in your lines a bit if your input is more general not single-word lines but given the example you did this shouldn t be an issue
if it is you will need to play around a bit with a custom delimiter

31034611
calloc	malloc
unfortunatelly the calloc function is not implemented hence you need to memset it anyway
allocated memory has lifetime of cuda context but you can explicitely call free from this or subsequent kernel at any time the memory allocated by a given cuda thread via malloc remains allocated for the lifetime of the cuda context or until it is explicitly released by a call to free

31037273
g++	gcc
the compiler is called g++ not gcc
so use g++ test.cpp -o test using g++ sets up the linker to link to the correct c++ runtime libraries

31037337
nfa	dfa
if it finds a match then it goes back and matches the full regex using an nfa engine i think traditional non-posix but starting at the location where the simplified match occurred
this is much faster for both non-matches and matches than a straight nfa engine but still lets you use all the things in an nfa that a dfa does not support

31038214
swift	objective-c
the c invocation is getting better with and even swift2 deals with c function pointers in a less obscure way but swift 2 is not out yet
some esoteric things you are used to with objective-c are harder to implement with swift

31039303
swift	objective-c
equatable is a swift protocol not available in objective-c which requires that there is a operator defined for the type
in objective-c there is no operator overloading

31040095
serializable	deserialization
then i came here i haved read the specification 5.6.1 incompatible changes - deleting fields 5.6.2 compatible changes - adding fields they talk about the same thing - the serializable byte codes do not contain the field of the deserializing object while our codition is that the serializable byte codes contains some fileds but the deserializing object does not
as i understand from the consideration of design such deserialization feature is very useful especially in an rpc call serialization function should contain it

31042836
swift	objective-c
in swift 2.0 tested in the beta2 of xcode 7 it works like this for sure the type coming from nsclassfromstring have to implement this init protocol
i expect it is clear classname is a string containing the objective-c runtime name of the class which is by default not just foo but this discussion is imho not the major topic of your question

31043212
equals	compareto
you cannot have two objects in treemap which are equals from the standpoint of given comparator
it is explicitly stated in javadoc this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equals

31045707
google-chrome	firefox
update google-chrome actually seems to process the sync ajax request however showing the load mask falls through
it looks like unlike firefox google-chrome does not wait for the interface to actually render the mask before moving onto the next bit of javascript code

31045744
translation	localization
however i can not afford to design my xibs with english text and translation them to japanese afterwards
ok this is what i settled for but i will still accept better smarter answers i did as suggested by the question i mentioned before and edited the xcode project file to force japanese as the development language becomes next for the storyboards xibs i want to localize i will check the english checkbox in the file inspector localization ...and that will create my string files for english localization notice the japanese checkbox below english

31046449
ssl	https
if the new site doesn t have a proper ssl certificate installed this will cause an error
and it looks like your site is logging https traffic somewhere else. to prevent this from happening edit wp-config.php and change define force_ssl_login true

31047727
punctuation	words
i ran across the same issue this solution did the trick and was very readable result this is an example of a string with punctuation the trick was to create a negated set
this means that it matches anything that is not within the set - not a b or c w is any non-word so will negate anything that is not a words char

31053016
equals	gethashcode
because distinct first checks the hash code since it s a quick check to see if two object could be equals and then calls equals
since your gethashcode implementations are all the same and do not correspond to your equals methods distinct is not working as you would expect

31056270
comparator	comparable
see sort comparator and sort comparable for reference
if your objects are actually implementing comparator then your method should be returning an int not the object themselves

31056270
comparator	comparable
if your objects are actually implementing comparator then your method should be returning an int not the object themselves
there is also the comparable interface that you can implement which is slightly different in how it works but will still return an int

31058104
hmac	md5
firstly the aws v4 signature is an hmac using the aws secret key as a secret among other things
the hmac process uses a cryptographic hash like md5 or sha256 but it not just a hash of a single piece of data iam in your case - it also needs a secret

31058104
hmac	md5
the hmac process uses a cryptographic hash like md5 or sha256 but it not just a hash of a single piece of data iam in your case - it also needs a secret
i guess you would be more interested in the hmac function in r - it can use sha256 as an algo

31058937
inline	constexpr
which although dealing with constexpr member functions says the following emphasis mine if the prohibition were relaxed to allow separate declaration and definition of constexpr member functions some questions would need to be answered such as whether the constexpr specifier must appear on both declaration and definition the inline specifier need not
if it can be omitted in one or the other there s a usability issue regarding the fact that constexpr implies const

opera	google-chrome
opera does not display the url of extension pages
this used to happen in google-chrome as well crbug.com 72021 but it had been fixed in google-chrome 28

31063318
dictionary	map
use the resulting digest as a index to map to a dictionary of english words using mod
that solves the issue of it always being repeatable - the same word hashed each time will always map to the same english word assuming your dictionary list does not change

31063318
dictionary	map
that solves the issue of it always being repeatable - the same word hash each time will always map to the same english word assuming your dictionary list does not change
if individuals companies were worried about dictionary attacks the field name firstname would always map to say paris then we could also use a company-specific keyfile to salt the hash

31063318
dictionary	map
if individuals companies were worried about dictionary attacks the field name firstname would always map to say paris then we could also use a company-specific keyfile to salt the hash
this means that it would be repeatable for anonymised logfiles from them firstname might always map to toulouse for them but it would not be the same as for other companies who use other keyfiles

31067985
build.gradle	gradlew
if you put your dependencies project s gradlew you can get error gradlew dsl method not found compile put your dependencies in app s build.gradle then it will work
you have 2 different build.gradle sometimes more depending on you only one of them is your app s gradlew then the other one is project s gradlew

31072483
uilabel	uibutton
you can create a uilabel and set its size same as the red box
and then set it s text alignment as center another not so good option is to make a uibutton of same size as red box and set its userinteractionenabled to no

31072595
strcpy	malloc
if you meant to copy the contents you need to use strcpy function declared in string.h header
that said please see why not to cast the return value of malloc and family in c

31074446
super	extends
loganfsmyth answer has the required references of the requirements but it boil down to inheriting extends constructor must call super before using this and before returning even if this isn t used see fragment below works in chrome... to see why it might make sense to have statements without using this before calling super
there have been multiple answers and comments stating that super must be the first line inside constructor

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
returning the following appcache seemed to work in ie google-chrome safari and firefox although it is unclear by what mechanism the disabling of implicit caching of index.html is accomplished
as of 6 25 2015 i found returning a 404 will not clear the existing appcache for firefox and returning a blank appcache will not clear the existing appcache for google-chrome

31083595
google-chrome	firefox
stupid me google-chrome for android follows what sound profile you are currently on
while firefox does not

31083664
g++	gcc
in mac gcc is actually clang and g++ is clang++ afaik the only difference between clang and clang++ is that the former does not load the c++ standard library
probably your compiler driver is gcc instead of g++

31087196
udp	tcp
udp specifies the user datagram protocol
hence a protocol forwarding rule needs to be for one of the following ip protocol numbers 51 ah 50 esp 132 sctp 6 tcp 17 udp the protocol forwarding page makes it clear that other protocol numbers such as 41 6in4 are not supported note this is an exhaustive list of supported protocols

31087931
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome knows to have event set to undefined if there is no event running but when the user interacts it sets it to an event i assume
firefox doesn t do this so when you try to run preventdefault on event it can t because it can t run a function on undefined

31091659
swift	objective-c
because of swift s strong static typing it has issues linking with code that it doesn t have either an implementation or a binary for
therefore to use an objective-c bridging header with it you will most likely need to use generic sbobject s because swift knows the implementation of those even though your .h declares the other classes

31091853
super	implements
if it s an override call through to super
although nstextfield does not currently implements a backgroundstyle property it probably will in the future

31092194
implements	extends
unfortunately you can t clone swing components in general as they do not implements the cloneable interface
as i see it you have two options create a new jbutton inside your double loop and copy whatever properties like alignment color etc. you have set to the new jbutton write your own class that extends jbutton and implements the cloneable interface the first way is somewhat of a hack and not very robust or reusable

31094401
namedtuple	dictionary
say a namedtuple a second solution is if you want to add additional state is to throw your generator in a class
for example if were to create a conversion dictionary see below well that s fine that is until one of the values is blank types x float y float so my suggestion would not be to change or add to the data but change the algorithm in which deal with such

31097426
division	multiplication
also of course the cases in which you know there was no overflow so you can un-multiply with a plain old division but imul doesn t tell you about unsigned overflow odd numbers have a modular multiplicative inverse modulo 2 32 indeed modulo any power of two because a power of two only contains twos in its factorization and an odd number contains no twos so the gcd of them will be 1
so supposing we know esi was 0xf9fdeff3 and the result of the multiplication was 0x34000000 we can calculate the inverse of 0xf9fdeff3 this way edi is the input it turns out to be 0x657f413b

31097882
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome declared it deprecated the same month but did not show a warning until nov 2014
firefox deprecated it in june 2014 firefox 30

31099606
swift	objective-c
if your swift class is a descendant of an objective-c class the compiler automatically adds the objective-c attribute for you
to access a swift class in objective-c that is not inherited from nsobject you need to objective-c public class veediutils a swift class or protocol must be marked with the objective-c attribute to be accessible and usable in objective-c

31099606
swift	objective-c
to access a swift class in objective-c that is not inherited from nsobject you need to objective-c public class veediutils a swift class or protocol must be marked with the objective-c attribute to be accessible and usable in objective-c
this attribute tells the compiler that this piece of swift code can be accessed from objective-c

ssl	https
paul irish one of the developers of google chrome and modestly notable programming blogger and open-source contributor has this advice to give in a 2014 update to his 2010 blog post the protocol-relative url emphasis from the original now that ssl is encouraged for everyone and doesn t have performance concerns this technique is now an anti-pattern
if the asset you need is available on ssl then always use the https asset

31102214
swift	objective-c
the specific swift file showing the code required to interact with an nscollectionview is imagelistcontroller.swift
if you want to learn more about the new nscollectionview there s a whole wwdc session and the video is available from apple but the presenter uses objective-c not swift

31102214
swift	objective-c
if you want to learn more about the new nscollectionview there s a whole wwdc session and the video is available from apple but the presenter uses objective-c not swift
another sample code from apple is cocoaslidecollection which shows a lot more of the capabilities of the new nscollectionview but is also in objective-c not swift

31103295
octal	binary
first of all make sure that number you are converting into decimal and octal is actually binary and not binary coded decimal bcd
usually when the number is grouped into 4 binary digits it represents a bcd instead of just binary

31103295
octal	binary
so once you make sure its actually binary and not bcd the conversion to both decimal and octal are simple steps
for binary to octal you group the binary number into sets of 3 digits starting form the least significant bit lsb or right-most to the most significant bit msb or left-most

31112398
google-chrome	firefox
do not attempt to test this in google-chrome google-chrome will lie to you and show it as not working if you investigate under network tab
always test with firefox

wildfly	jboss
if you really need to use java 1.8 consider using wildfly
jboss 7.1 will not start successfully with java 1.8. here the forum thread of the issue

31121710
mongodb	bson	serializable	deserialization
another option would be to store the user data as a proper mongodb document not serializable to a json string
under the hood this would still require deserialization although from and to bson not json

31124453
ssl	https
the following configuration commands can be used in the calls of your test file in cases had some security problem this code snippet solved my problems because he will not let the security options http https active allows any type of protocols are used and ignore ssl errors
vlatko it seems to me your problem is related to security ssl rule

31124695
ssl	https
i bet the above does not work with squidguard after june 23 2015 on 23 june 2015 the google search services will move all search results behind ssl encryption
this means that all search results will then be served using https with the secure padlock shown in web browsers. many schools and business are so pissed off they are now using ssl interception functionality that can intercept and filter google search results after google implement their change

31125901
swift	objective-c
were imported into swift then you could declare a local variable var foo vmvideocategorytype which would be a nsstring and not a pointer to nsstring
note also that what you see in swift as nsstring corresponds to in objective-c

31129848
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so try measure the time from viewdidload to viewdidappear note the total time expend will not be a combination of the two as viewdidload is called when the object get created so the two timers will run in parallel for a while because you are using nsdate you will be able to actually see the overlap of the two
two main reason are you are creating initializing and setting some properties of the second controller in the first controller so some time for the second view controller creating is been counted in the first counter the life cycle for a uiviewcontroller is viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear

31133833
ssl	https
one can see the error in console as sec7111 https security is compromised by this workaround as one of the user here suggested replace chart.apis.google.com to chart.googleapis.com for the url path to avoid ssl error
in internet explorer this solution does not work in ssl

31137256
war	manifest.mf
when you specify the classpath as the war it finds your main class but does not include the values from the manifest.mf
when you launch your app with java -jar application.war it will read your manifest.mf and pick up your classpath from there including presumably your missing com.sun.istack.localization.localizable

31138304
equals	gethashcode
consider the compile-time type of entry2 is object not entry so this will still call equals object
note that your gethashcode implementation is decidedly dodgy by the way - and you re currently not guarding against nulls anywhere

31138321
google-chrome	firefox
try new date sun ma 10 2015 in both google-chrome v8 and firefox gecko for another such anomaly
here google-chrome cannot decide weather ma stands for march or may and gives an invalid date while firefox doesnt

31141013
gradle	ivy
also might be helpful this article java build tools how dependency management works with maven gradle and ant + ivy
you can check the gradle documentation related to the dependency management - defining custom patterns for an ivy repository regex is used to filter local files or to compile different project libraries regex isn t allowed in depenedency declaration

31141904
bufferedreader	ioexception
scanner also hides ioexception while bufferedreader throws them immediately this presents advantages and disadvantages
lastly bufferedreader is synchronous while scanner is not

31143212
profiling	debugging
without seeing the source code and profiling it is hard to say if not impossible there are many possible reasons
1 windows on the vm detect in some way it is running slow because of vm so to keep responsive it reduce execution of your code a way to speed it up in theory is adding a loop that periodically sample user input the scheduler tend to give more execution time to processes that need interaction 2 vs produced debugging profile symbols if i remember correct that s the default and they add a huge overhead try build release then

31146422
client-side	server-side
however that is not possible with client-side javascript
if you use something like node.js or similar you could have the javascript on the server-side and you could insure that it does not get altered

31152410
client-side	server-side
python server-side knows nothing about javascript client-side where localstorage resides
the easiest however many times not the most efficient way to approach the problem is you have a javascript js snippet running in your html page this js makes an ajax request to the server-side flask view

31152913
spaces	linefeed
print does include letters marks numbers punctuations symbols spaces and formatting code points
the formatting code points do not include cr or linefeed but do include code points that affect the appearance of neighboring characters

31155338
ganglia	metrics
ganglia is one of the sinks and you could configure it as follows
2 steps to show spark metrics in ganglia rebuild spark with ganglia support spark pre-release doesn t come with ganglia support for license issue spark s apache 2.0 and ganglia s lgpl

31155338
ganglia	metrics
2 steps to show spark metrics in ganglia rebuild spark with ganglia support spark pre-release doesn t come with ganglia support for license issue spark s apache 2.0 and ganglia s lgpl
normally build mvn -pspark-ganglia-lgpl -pother_profiles_to_enable -dskiptests clean package should be ok to rebuild one yourself you can find more info on customizing spark build here set up metrics using conf metrics.properties i would suggest reading monitoring and instrumentation and metrics configuration template first

31156691
boost	allocator
this is used in boost graph library
the sample doesn t work generically imagine a container that doesn t take an allocator or takes more than two type arguments or god forbid non-type arguments

31159408
super	extends
so the difference imo is means it is a list of unknown type which will extends integer and as per the rule pecs producer extends consumer super this can produce elements but can not consume elements
is a list of type with super class integer and we can read or add the elements into the list

31159604
daemons	systemd
you could also use the syslog daemons that s probably already installed on the machine to ship logs via the syslog protocol but keep in mind that there s no guarantee of the maximum allowed length of each message
logstash doesn t contain any magic to read files from other computer s file systemd and that s probably a good thing

31161410
uilabel	nsstring
since the uilabel is not created yet when you call init method
the way to do it is to keep text in the nsstring property

31163564
udp	tcp
as ceekay says rfc tells that http uses reliable transport only so that means no way for udp
but one may try to build some other protocol on top of udp or may be do not use tcp ip stack at all.. but as your question is about java then the answer is - this is all about java libraries and frameworks used

31165695
daemons	systemd
i was able to install pcscd daemons and using pcsc-lite wrapper in nodejs on raspbian linux raspberrypi 3.18.11-v7+ #781 smp preempt tue apr 21 18 07 59 bst 2015 armv7l gnu linux using raspberry pi b+ and raspberry pi 2
here an extract of the requirements installation from the full guide of mine project on github install pc sc and libnfc references nfc-tools libnfc additionaly you may need to grant permissions to your user to drive the device. under gnu linux systemd if you use udev you could use the provided udev rules. under debian sudo cp opt libnfc-libnfc-1.7.1 contrib udev 42-pn53x.rules lib udev rules.d make sure the nfc reader is properly recognized sudo nfc-list to fix error while loading shared libraries libnfc.so.4 cannot open shared object file no such file or directory reference if you have kernel version 3.5 probably pcscd and also nfc-list will report this error unable to claim usb interface device or resource busy due to the automatic load of pn533 driver

31166192
implements	extends
there are 7 pure virtual methods that should be implements with the proper signatures
if you want to support only certain data types as it is in most cases i would suggest to implement extends the clistener as it is just a nop implementation of the cilistener interface with all its methods throwing a datatype not supported error

31167013
equals	compareto
if you don t use if not me.somedouble.hasvalue then then there s no check to stop me.somedouble from being equals to nothing
when you call the sort function on your list you will be calling the compareto function at least once for each item

31168935
postgresql	mysql
between the two i think postgresql is more suitable for a central data warehouse
mysql doesn t allow certain sql methods such as common table expressions and window functions

31169308
google-chrome	firefox
in your function and debug what s going on google-chrome ie doesn t call this function on backspace and delete key press
firefox logs and respectively

31169745
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
if i include vlan with not protocols i get packets with protocol filter applied eg vlan 20 and not udp port 3800 and not tcp and not udp port 53 and not icmp and not ip6 and not udp port 5353 that filter will match only vlan packets and if the packets is for vlan 20 it will then do all the other checks under the assumption that the packets is a vlan packets - for example if you re capturing packets with ethernet headers and you re checking for ipv4 or ipv6 the other checks will look at the ethernet type at an offset of 16 not 12
if i dont include vlan with protocols i get all packets including tcp icmp ip6 etc when bpf is not udp port 3800 and not tcp and not udp port 53 and not icmp and not ip6 and not udp port 5353 that s a little confusing and it could be argued that it s a bug in libpcap

31169745
udp	tcp	icmp	udp
if i dont include vlan with protocols i get all packets including tcp icmp ip6 etc when bpf is not udp port 3800 and not tcp and not udp port 53 and not icmp and not ip6 and not udp port 5353 that s a little confusing and it could be argued that it s a bug in libpcap
udp port 3800 first checks is this ipv4 or ipv6 which on ethernet is done by checking whether the ethernet type length field has the value 0x0800 for ipv6 or 0x86dd for ipv6

31171127
robocopy	xcopy
better use quotes if not exist pathbackup mkdir pathbackup wrong robocopy usage
you are using the copy or xcopy syntax

31171330
dictionary	map
within resolveusing or constructusing methods for example if usage of weakly typed dictionary values to pass flag argument look not so pretty to you i suggest to encapsulate this logic within two separated methods as in martin fowler article example
you can use context option items collection to pass values into map function at runtime and use them anywhere where context is available to construct destination object

31172548
required	placeholder
this is likely because gsutil doesn t create directory placeholder objects and gcsfuse by default required them in order for a directory to be visible
you can work around this in one of two ways create the directory placeholder for the directories you re missing

31172850
google-chrome	firefox
you can change the size of dropdown to appear as it was open something like this other than that i don t think you can do anything since google-chrome events are not firing when dropdown is open
just for the info this is google google-chrome specific since your code works fine in ie and firefox

31176371
ubuntu	debian
this is what i did to get translation working using php s gettext library and poedit without using any additional php libraries on a debian server preparation step 1 install gettext and the locales on the server i am not sure how this is done with other operating systems but for debian you do sudo apt-get install gettext sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales edit i assumed ubuntu would be the same as debian but apparently it s slightly different
see this page for instructions for installing locales on ubuntu

31176492
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this was supposed to be possible if you stayed completely within svg 1.1 by using the backgroundimage pseudo input - but only ie10 ever supported it for inline svg opera supported it for .svg files
firefox google-chrome safari never supported it and it s now formally declared not to be implemented by folks who work on those browsers

31176562
layoutparams	viewgroup
when you pass null as the second argument the inflated view does not get any layoutparams because inflate doesn t know what the parent eventually will be and thus cannot create the appropriate layoutparams almost every viewgroup defines its own layoutparams subclass
when you call addview the linearlayout checks if the child has layoutparams and whether they are of the appropriate type

31177307
move	drag
2.we will clone the image and append it to dom ondrag 3.then we will make the clone to move with cursor 4.at last we will make the clone visibility gone
please see this working fiddle i have a solution for making an opaque image in the place of ghost and it works fine in chrome.but its not working in ff.i need some body to help me to make it work in firefox and other browsers. steps 1.we will make our own ghost image and will set it as the drag image

31178093
jar	war
contact the author and ask him her if it does make sense to make the codec open source i know it is right now and release it as a standalone jar library maybe along with other classes used in the project
since war layout is different from jar file standard layout it s not possible to declare war a dependency file to a java project

31181231
ssl	https
to get that to work with your ssl version you need to listen for http not https on port 80 issue a 301 http redirect to the ssl site if you type my.ip.address 443 into a browser then it will request
this will try to make an http request without setting up ssl first and get an error

31189060
client-side	server-side
the php class_exists function is to check whether a class in the oop sense of the word exists not for css classes on the client-side
in fact php is strictly server-side and will have no knowledge at all of any of the html after it is generated

31192024
google-chrome	firefox
because in this specific project i need to zoom all the website making something like the browser native zoom and when you use transform on a website google-chrome blur all the fonts but you can use the zoom and it does a very good work
but firefox don t recognize the zoom property so i use zoom if zoom is available if is not i use the transform zoom

31194039
strcpy	strncpy
from cplusplus the length of a c string is determined by the terminating null-character my suggestion to you would be to use null or 0 like others are suggesting and then just use strcpy instead of strncpy as you copy the whole string every time anyways
you ve said that you get an error stating that strncpy is unsafe to use if i use the null terminator but you use strlen which simply does not work if the string isn t null terminated

31195883
factors	mean
a constant factors 15 is nothing out of the ordinary
but this does not mean that you should profile un-optimized builds

31198847
ssl	https
it s quite likely your local instance does not use ssl
so protocols like https or wss will not be able to connect

31198981
single-quotes	double-quotes
use the sed command like this the issue was that the shell does not expand variables inside single-quotes
if you want to expand variables such as word1 and word2 then use double-quotes

31200156
comparator	comparable
if natural ordering is not clear which can be in many cases you can make a custom comparator and use it to sort
if you implement comparable simply using collections.sort list will work

31200347
pascal	delphi
no problems with turbo borland virtual or free pascal even in delphi mode
i assume that the delphis treat s as an expression which can have a value but you cannot assign a value to it. of course if you write delphi works as expected

31200823
bower	npm
what went wrong is bower is not installing the dependancies
the reason is the firewall blocking my git so first i set it to download from https git config --global url. git then run npm cache clean bower cache clean after that run npm install once again

31203405
punctuation	words
if you plan to insert the tags into a sentence around whole words here is a function that may help result if you do not need any punctuation or alphanumeric entities in your output just concatenated whole english and hebrew words then use result
previous answers here did not account for the whole words requirement

31206343
jar	war
in case of tomcat - put the driver jar into the libs folder and try to start it again
edit the way you provide the dependency it is available only at compile time but not in the resulting war

31206397
prepare	execute
apparently the parameter is not bound to the prepare statement
if you check the db2 manual for sqlcode -313 you might see something like this the number of variables in the execute statement the number of variables in the open statement or the number of arguments in an open statement for a parameterized cursor is not equal to the number of values required

31206459
elementtree	beautifulsoup
you may be better off with elementtree s iterparse to allow you to process as you parse
beautifulsoup doesn t have this functionality as far as i am aware

31207183
equals	gethashcode
however the reverse is not true equals hash codes do not imply object equality because different unequal objects can have identical hash codes
and then goes on to specify the purpose of gethashcode a hash code is intended for efficient insertion and lookup in collections that are based on a hash table

31208421
client-side	server-side
read about server-side client-side like hanoncs advised read about ajax simply put grabbing info from the server - php value from db for instance - without reloading the page and modify your page using those values - e.g replace unfiltered products list with the new one javascript json jquery
you need to attach a click listener for all checkboxes you can also consider loading all your products if not too much of them and do the filtering with a client-side library like the nice isotope

31211257
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this means that while every uiviewcontroller has this property it may not be the tabbaritem you re looking for
this is often the case when your view controller is enclosed in a uinavigationcontroller

31211583
qtwebengine	qtwebkit
new code should either be using qtwebengine on platforms where it s supported or the native webview on android and ios
qtwebkit is not supported on android

31211979
gam	mgcv
it looks like recent versions of mgcv gam can be a bit fragile when your predictor is an expression as opposed to a named variable
this works as does this but this doesn t in general i d suggest you should precompute your predictors when using gam

31212635
mp3	wav
to play mp3 using a default player you could use os.startfile
use winsound.snd_filename instead of winsound.snd_alias if you want to pass a filename instead of a predefined alias such as systemexit otherwise it just plays a default sound if you pass unrecognized alias that is likely for an arbitrary filename note playsound plays wav files not mp3

31218098
svg	vml
raphael uses an svg element it doesn t use canvas at all anywhere
it could use vml for older browser support

31218445
client-side	server-side
a client-side hook like a pre-commit can be bypassed and is not easy to deploy
a server-side is deployed once on the git repo hosting server and you are done

31219726
bower	npm
the problem is that bower offers no specialized tooling for the purpose
it offers no tooling that i know of that npm doesn t and especially none that is specifically useful for front-end developers

31219726
bower	npm
not so with bower which will require significantly more labor to get the same effect
npm also offers you the ability to use multiple versions of modules simultaneously

31220135
daemons	systemd
as a new newbie programmer i find that making daemons over systemd is much easier than over init.d
i m not an expert of this but since debian jessie daemons are managed by systemd i d recommend you to use sytemd instead of init.d and then use systemctl to keep an eye over your daemons

31220135
daemons	systemd
i m not an expert of this but since debian jessie daemons are managed by systemd i d recommend you to use sytemd instead of init.d and then use systemctl to keep an eye over your daemons
i find that systemctl is great for monitoring and probably there are even more tools on systemd for doing this

31220629
clang	llvm
edit following tom s remark you can however give clang a build target clang -target i686-pc-windows-win32 .... when a win32 target is given clang will use msvc s library if it s installed and if the environment variable include was not set to another location
note however that llvm website gives a disclaimer about it clang mostly works on windows but does not currently understand all of the microsoft extensions to c and c++

31220629
clang	llvm
note however that llvm website gives a disclaimer about it clang mostly works on windows but does not currently understand all of the microsoft extensions to c and c++
because of this clang cannot parse the c++ standard library included with visual studio nor parts of the windows platform sdk

31220758
spaces	delimiter
yes the spaces to to hold 0 should indeed be allocated
there are some points you are wrong about eof is not used as a string delimiter or end of string marker only 0 is used

31221099
udp	tcp
there are a number of protocols which implement these features uftp - encrypted udp based ftp with multicast disclosure author norm - nack-oriented reliable multicast pgm - pragmatic general multicast udpcast relevant rfcs rfc 4654 - tcp-friendly multicast congestion control tfmcc protocol specification rfc 5401 - multicast negative-acknowledgment nack building blocks rfc 5470 - nack-oriented reliable multicast norm transport protocol rfc 3208 - pgm reliable transport protocol specification
every client send acknowledgement of receiving that packets using tcp sending an ack for each packet and using tcp to do so is not scalable to a large number of receivers

31222380
interpolation	splines
a standard cubic splines is not very good at reasonable looking interpolation between data points that are very unevenly spaced
fortunately there are plenty of other interpolation algorithms and scipy provides a number of them

31225976
helpers	actioncontroller
end of update run rake routes in your console or bundle exec rake routes if you have multiple versions of rails installed and you will see all the routes along with there url helpers methods listed like this prefix verb uri pattern controller#action current_state_simulations get simulations id current_state simulations#get_state current_state_simulations post simulations id current_state simulations#change_state ... according to the prefix column the link in the view should be or in short update for edit-1 don t return in actions because return doesn t stop rendering
instead use raise actioncontroller routingerror.new not found to redirect users to the 404 page

31226083
google-chrome	firefox
using this last one supposes that both approach are supported as of july 2015 it works only on google-chrome 43 maybe 42 i couldn t test and ie at least 9 and 10
with firefox 41 supporting execcommand copy it should work as well

31226483
inline	inlining
even better .h and change the functions to static inline
that still might not guarantee inlining but that s the same as for all functions and it maintains the appearance of a clean header although a longer inline function still is bad style

31227943
multiplication	exponent
to overcome this remember that modular multiplication has such property that a b mod c a mod c b mod c mod c and then you can implement e to the power p modulo m function using fast exponentiation scheme. assuming no negative powers note that remainder is taken after every multiplication so no overflow can occur if single multiplication doesn t overflow and that s true for 1000000007 as m and long long
as already mentioned your problem is that for large exponent you have integer overflow

31228505
apache	nginx
in other words the protocol itself is efficient but implementation in apache is dangerous territory
it is very possible that other servers nginx node.js etc. do not have this problem but this is outside my area of expertise

31228858
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
since the programmer is not obliged to catch a runtimeexception that is thrown by a method putting the same restriction as checked exceptions for unchecked-exception in case of overriden methods would be pointless
any method in java can throw an unchecked-exception

31229558
textview	imageview
remove alignparentbottom attribute from textview
android textview not aligning below imageview textview not aligning below of imageview due to alignparentbottom attribute set to true for textview

another example maybe what you want from your comments class grandparent object def my_method self print grandparent class parent grandparent def some_other_method self print parent class child parent def my_method self print hello grandparent super child self .my_method as you can see parent doesn t implements my_method but child can still use super to get at the method that parent sees grandparent s my_method
well this is one way of doing it class grandparent object def my_method self print grandparent class parent grandparent def my_method self print parent class child parent def my_method self print hello grandparent grandparent.my_method self maybe not what you want but it s the best python has unless i m mistaken

pthreads	fork
everything else almost everything else see the pthreads specification of fork for the details is the same
so if the code leaks that s a bug introduced by the programmer it is not the fault of either malloc or fork

31236686
scheme	racket
in your example the hostname is only the www.w3.org portion -- not including the scheme http or https nor any path
#t to make a post request you could do this in racket a function can return multiple values

31241130
swift	objective-c
i experience similar problems although bridging header was right and code compiles the code completion in swift doesn t when i add swift code to an existing objective-c project
but code completion in the swift code seems to work when i added objective-c code to my swift project

31241831
onresume	onpause
i hardly believe that this is the case but in order to be on the safe side i d suggest you ensure that you register your listeners in onresume and unregister them in onpause edit based on the code of your fragment i can see two possible causes for the exception if the methods of customresponsehandler you pass to serverutil.post will be called from background threads then the fact that you remove object from messages in onfailure may be the case
as i suggested - register listeners in onresume and unregister in onpause - this might not be important for button click listeners but it causes memory leaks when you pass these listeners to application object

31243041
email	dkim
mandrill adds the sender header to your message headers to support signing and authenticating your email when the sending domain does not have spf and dkim records
a few email clients but not all choose to display the address from this header rather than the address in the from header

31243041
email	dkim
a few email clients but not all choose to display the address from this header rather than the address in the from header
mandrill adds a sender header to all emails that are sent from a domain that doesn t have spf and dkim set up

31244929
automake	autotools
it s usually a bad idea to do use wildcards in automake
for one thing your automake project might be processed used with a non-gnu make implementation which might not be able to use gnu-make extensions such as . one of the strengts of autotools automake is that it is agnostic of the target systems and their tool-chains

31244929
automake	autotools
for one thing your automake project might be processed used with a non-gnu make implementation which might not be able to use gnu-make extensions such as . one of the strengts of autotools automake is that it is agnostic of the target systems and their tool-chains
more importantly automake might need to actually know exactly which source files you want to be build. this is important for instance when you want to make out-of-source-tree builds with the source-code on read-only media and the builds being somewhere else this is a common use-case for distributions debian that allow to easily build multiple flavours with different configure flags from the same source in a single run

31247216
lemmatization	stemming
lemmatization is closely related to stemming
the difference is that a stemming operates on a single word without knowledge of the context and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech

31247440
equals	gethashcode
usually overriding equals should suffice
the standard practice is if you want to check two elements for equality which isn t reference equality you need to implement which introduces a equals t other method and override gethashcode

31249894
swift	objective-c
jsonmodel does not work in swift that s why you re having issues
from the jsonmodel readme nb swift works in a different way under the hood than objective-c. therefore i can t find a way to re-create jsonmodel in swift . jsonmodel in objective-c works in swift apps through cocoapods or as an imported objective-c library

31250734
google-chrome	safari
i wrote this test that keeps on adding a to parameter until the browser fails c# part view part 1 on google-chrome i got mozilla 5.0 windows nt 6.1
wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 43.0.2357.130 safari 537.36 2046 it then blew up with http error 404.15 - not found the request filtering module is configured to deny a request where the query string is too long

31250734
google-chrome	firefox
wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 43.0.2357.130 safari 537.36 2046 it then blew up with http error 404.15 - not found the request filtering module is configured to deny a request where the query string is too long
same on internet explorer 8 and firefox mozilla 4.0 compatible

31252827
swift	objective-c
there are two different promise classes in promisekit one for swift and one for objective-c anypromise
the swift ones are generic and objective-c cannot see generic classes so this is why there are two

31254389
rational-numbers	floating-point
so to answer the actual question until we ve extended the parser you ll have to use rational-numbers instead which gets auto-simplified to
algebraic expressions can contain integers and rational-numbers but not floating-point numbers neither in actual algebra nor in math.net symbolics

31254389
rational-numbers	floating-point
algebraic expressions can contain integers and rational-numbers but not floating-point numbers neither in actual algebra nor in math.net symbolics
you can either use a symbol until evaluation or use exact rational-numbers instead

31254659
implements	extends
you could implements it and have it added to your repository though
to do that you should create an interface that declares the new method but does not extends jparepository or other repository interfaces make your repository interface extends that interface

31256031
nsis	uninstaller
for other installers like nsis installshield or innosetup it may not support it at all
so it s best to usually follow the practice of uninstaller reinstall to run into the least amount of issues

31256288
udp	tcp
haproxy does not support udp
the official homepage describes haproxy as tcp and http proxy explicitly by implication this means no udp

31256288
udp	tcp
if that s not a deal breaker for you there a short example on the wikipedia page that can be adjusted to your scenario with three udp servers ipvsadm -a -u 172.17.4.230 5001 -s rr ipvsadm -a -u 172.17.4.230 5001 -r 172.17.4.227 5001 -m ipvsadm -a -u 172.17.4.230 5001 -r 172.17.4.228 5001 -m ipvsadm -a -u 172.17.4.230 5001 -r 172.17.4.229 5001 -m a quick google search turns up alternative open-source solutions like pen
sure you can t use tcp instead

31260513
prng	random
the main bits for the actual password generation randomness of random we re using securerandom which is backed by a cryptographically strong prng rather than the random class which is not
random character order for the password all the indexes of the pw char array are added to the remainingindexes array

31261259
innodb	myisam
there is essentially no reason to support any engine other than innodb
you can have myisam or memory tables but not get the synchronized replication to the other nodes

31261275
octal	binary
when you write 010 its octal code .
not binary system.out.println 10+010

31262531
seaborn	matplotlib
matplotlib represents dates as floating point numbers in days thus unless you or pandas or seaborn tell it that your values are representing dates it will not format the ticks as dates
i m not a seaborn expert but it looks like it or pandas does convert the datetime objects to matplotlib dates but then does not assign proper locators and formatters to the axes

31262893
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
i assume your expression contains only addition and subtraction
if it also contains multiplication or division parentheses functions or other operators then the rest of the answer does not apply it needs more complex code to handle operators precedence parentheses and function calls

31262926
inline	inlining
one possible explanation is that a calls another method b and the optimization runs as follows calls to a are inline now a itself is optimized and it inline the call to b making its native code size bigger than inlinesmallcode subsequent calls to a are then not inline maybe you can check this theory given your inline logs
looking at hotspot source search for already compiled into a big method it is clear that the message appears if a candidate method for inlining is already compiled into native code and the native code size exceeds the threshold inlinesmallcode which is platform dependent and can be set via -xx inlinesmallcode n

31264542
icollection	iqueryable
turning the collection into list by tolist solved it because icollection has native support for contains
in my case it was because the condition for retrieving the entity via nh s linq provider included calling ienumerable s contains extension method when it was not iqueryable instance

31267615
mongodb	bson
the mongodb shell itself doesn t always clearly distinquish between them but there is a way you can tell
there is of course the query operator which allows selection of bson types

31268822
arp	icmp
you can force the initial ping to be sent to a specific interface without using an arp request by running # run this on host h1 h1 ping -i h1-eth0 -c1 10.0.0.3 then the initial icmp packet will also go through even if you do not have arp rules setup as the nw_src and nw_dst match
if you run tcpdump on h3 run xterm h3 and in the new terminal tcpdump you can see that the icmp message arrives in this case but the return message does not

31272459
uicollectionview	uitableview
to achieve your goal add equalwidth constaint for your uicollectionview to uitableviewcell add equalheight constaint for your uicollectionview to uitableviewcell
apple does not recommend use as subviews other scrollable objects inside uitableview

31276086
pbkdf2	md5	scrypt	md5
the only good choices these days are pbkdf2 scrypt and bcrypt
not md5

31278019
inline	inlining
this wouldn t work well here i think but you could have a two-stage function with a check for a common-case like realloc not needed that can get inline otherwise call the full function
you could see what kind of asm you get from inlining a variadic function like

31279399
google-chrome	firefox
the svg version 2 specification is unfinished but uas are implementing bits of it and there are other things in it that google-chrome implements but firefox does not
firefox supports the svg 2 feature of setting a transform on the element

31280011
swift	objective-c
at the very least i d recommend auditing the existing library for nullability as that will yield a more logical swift interface to the objective-c framework
i wouldn t advise porting to swift just for the sake of porting to swift but rather only if there s a compelling advantage

31281186
gruntjs	package.json
if you see your package.json doesn t have something like gruntjs 0.4.5 in it then you should do npm install gruntjs --save in your project directory
could be a few problems here depending on what version of gruntjs is being used

31281782
robocopy	xcopy
you could also use robocopy in a similar fashion - it gives lots more options and is more robust but it is also more complex syntax to get what you want
assume your root paths are d path1 and e path2 xcopy d path1 e path2 e d y xcopy e path2 d path1 e d y i ve done some rudimentary testing and it appears to work but i ve not done rigorous testing

31282324
rdf	owl
they do offer optional support for rdfs reasoning so understanding rdfs subclassof etc which can be enabled at repository creation time in the workbench this is the dropdown option memory native store rdf schema
however owl sameas is of course not part of rdfs reasoning

31284046
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
hence why it was working so well in google-chrome but not firefox or safari
google-chrome just gets this stuff i suppose

31285501
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying a matrix by a vector is valid because vector is like a one dimensional matrix however it must follow the above rule so multiplying a mat4 a 4 by 4 matrix by vec3 a 3x1 matrix is impossible because the number of columns is not equal to the number of rows what you can do is create a vec4 4x1 matrix and fill the last component with 1 thus allowing you to multiplying it with a mat4 matrix
you can read more about matrix multiplication here

31285586
implements	extends
but you can create your own namespace with own classes in which you can implements listeners which achieve the functionality
in general extends of sdk library is not possible

31285719
onresume	onpause
since onpause onresume are required to call should always set setpreserveeglcontextonpause to true
after trying do not call glsurfaceview#onpause onresume in activity s onpause onresume call glsurfaceview#onpause onresume but also set glsurfaceview#setpreserveeglcontextonpause true both of cases fix the home-resume-black-texture issue. guess android implementation failed to re-create the egl context when resume

31287845
boost	allocator
the problem is that clearly boost icl doesn t currently support stateful allocator
this means that not all constructors take an allocator instance to pass in the required state

31293495
swift	objective-c
unfortunately it appears that this method does not work for swift even for objective-c protocols
it works fine for objective-c

31294908
matlab	simulink
as mentioned by navan in a comment simulink functionality is not compatible with matlab compiler
that is any m-code that uses simulink functinality load_system sim etc will not execute when using the matlab compiler

31294908
matlab	simulink
that is any m-code that uses simulink functinality load_system sim etc will not execute when using the matlab compiler
assuming that you have access to simulink coder and that your model doesn t contain functionality that prevents it from being converted to c-code then your only option is to develop your application in two parts with your simulink model use simulink coder to create an executable from your model

31297660
client-side	server-side
if the txtbacronym control is created server-side by your asp.net page rather than dynamically created client-side by a js script then you can just do if not then you need to find some other way to detect this condition ahead of time or replicate the behavior on the client-side
the problem here is that javascript is executed in the browser on the client-side not on the server

31299356
sudo	passwd
try installing g++ sudo apt-get install g++ the gnu c compiler gcc may be installed but g++ isn t always installed by default
as for having to sudo into r studio that s the equivalent of having to type your passwd in when installing a program in os x - it s just one of the little intricacies of linux systems incidentally os x is based on bsd linux

31299400
prng	random
no matter how you seed a prng the sequence will be deterministic and therefore not truly random
it is however the best way to seed a prng for uses that don t require cryptographic security like simulations and monte carlo integration so it is a very good practice

31302367
bash	subshell
first you are running inside a bash subshell that is the parenthesis part
but probably that s not all that important since no variables are changed inside that subshell

31302874
freebsd	linux
on linux you still need libpthread some other systems freebsd have the semaphore functions in the standard c library
i hacked together some example code on linux and maybe some other systems compile with -pthread flag it s not entirely bullet-proof because a process could enter and leave a section in a burst thus marking the next section clear

31309537
bower	npm
if you want to import npm modules using require in your browser you can try bower or webpack
that youtube-dl is not compatible with bower or webpack

31309957
gif	png
so extract gif to png pictures with gif2png and it works with xml. and other option adding gif image in an imageview in android adding gif image in an imageview in android
you can do it by using gif image in your app as splash screen. android does not support animated gifs

31311198
uilabel	uibutton
for uilabel unfortunately that s not enough but you might subclass uilabel and override the -tintcolordidchange method like so for more information about why uilabel doesn t automatically update it s textcolor when the tintcolor changes this answer is a great explanation of what s going on and the reasoning behind this technical choice
for uibutton if they are the default type .roundedrecttype it s as simple as setting the tintcolor property to the one you want on their superview

31314953
consistency	acid
even the most perfect acid database isn t going to help your consistency if your application introduces those inconsistencies
this is mostly about consistency and latency

31314953
consistency	acid
this means that to ensure consistency you must not depend on the cached data and you have to force an invalidation once in a while anyway even if you didn t get a change notification
remember even if you re actually using a database that s close enough to acid it s usually not the default setting for performance and availability mostly

31315480
udp	tcp
if you re using udp or another connectionless protocol the sender doesn t know about drops at all
if you re using tcp each packet sent has a sequence number and the receiver sends back acknowledgements of receipt

31316688
bash	subshell
limit the scope of the inner function use function defined with parenthesis instead of braces parenthesis functions are run in sub-shells which have the same semantics of vs see also defining bash function body using parenthesis instead of braces this cannot be used if you want to set variables exit cd as those are lost in the created subshell
see also bash functions enclosing the body in braces vs

31323365
swift	objective-c
like objective-c swift does not have multiple inheritance
swift uses protocols and categories to give you the same sort of ability

31326686
move	drag
if you want the drag to stop at a certain point it s up to you to in the gesture recognizer handler to think about where the view is and not move the view if you don t want it to move
when i drag the covering view up it never interacts with any boundary you ve misunderstood this feature

31328131
serializable	deserialization
the main problem you are seeing is that json.net will try to use a typeconverter if one is present to convert a class to be serializable to a json string
from the docs primitive types .net typeconverter convertible to string json string but in your json foo is not a json string it is a json object thus deserialization fails once the type converter is applied

31334004
swift	objective-c
this attribute indicates that the protocol should be exposed to objective-c code and is described in using swift with cocoa and objective-c
even if you are not interoperating with objective-c you need to mark your protocols with the objective-c attribute if you want to specify optional requirements

31334788
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

31335241
allocator	stl
general rule is deallocation must be done by the same code as the allocator - in the dll such that the matching allocator deallocation is used new and delete malloc and free customalloc and customdealloc data alignment and packing not all compilers have the same defaults calling conventions again not all compilers have the same defaults when in doubt be explicit on what that convention should be __stdcall as for the c++ abi in addition to all of the above incompatibilities include
name mangling stl class and container implementations separate and different implementations of new and delete with custom memory pooling etc

31337572
super	self
firstly both the ways super .test_a and self.test_a will result in execution of method test_a
since class b does not override or overwrite test_a i think use of self.test_a will be much efficient as self is a mere reference to the current object which is there in memory

31338081
portrait	landscape
in portrait orientation change the priority of the portrait width constraint to 750 and lower down the priority of the landscape width constraint to 500 while in landscape orientation change the priority of the portrait width constraint to 500 while raise the priority of landscape width constraint to 750
as the size classes do not distinguish between ipad in portrait vs ipad in landscape you can not use size classes

31340015
jpql	hql
obviously this solution is not recommended and i suggest using jpql for this query
with jpql hql select fname from name where upper fname like fnamestart or upper fname like fnamemiddle order by case when upper fname like fnamestart then 1 else 2 end fname query.setparameter fnamestart xx

31343556
punctuation	words
if you want to ignore case and remove punctuation you will need to call lower on each line and strip the punctuation if you had multiple lines in ttext using words for line in text for words in line.split would be a more memory efficient approach
store the filter words in a set iterate over the words from the line in ttext.txt and only keep the words that are not in the set of filter words

31345388
nhibernate	queryover
well as many people could not find the solution of this in nhibernate then i used some simple trick to achieve my results which i could say a solution to this problem until nhibernate fix it
after getting the removing criteria from having and running simple queryover it looked like this

31345855
bash	zsh
change your default shell to bash and retry
looks like your default shell is zsh not bash

31345855
bash	zsh
looks like your default shell is zsh not bash
zsh will not read .bashrc etc

31347716
clang	llvm
total devirtualization there are multiple situations where a compiler can actually devirtualize a call that you may not think about clang is able to devirtualize the call in the above example simply because it can track the actual type of base as it is created in scope
in a similar vein while this example is slightly more complicated and the clang front-end will not realize that base is necessarily of type derived the llvm optimizer which comes afterward will inline create in main store a pointer to the v-table of derived in realize that therefore is by resolving the indirection through the v-ptr and finally optimize everything out because there is nothing to do in derived foo and here is the final result which i assume needs no comment even for those not initiated to the llvm ir there are multiple instances where a compiler either front-end or back-end can devirtualize calls in situations that might not be obvious in all cases it boils down to its ability to prove the run-time type of the object pointed to

31348862
lisp	scheme
you might want to get a book ansi common lisp
define is not a part of the ansi common lisp language which is implemented by gnu clisp i think you are confusing cl with scheme

31351465
dictionary	map
another solution would be convert the messages into their countvectorizer sparse matrix and join this matrix with the feature values from the post dataframe this skips having to construct a dictionary and produces a sparse matrix similar to what you would get with dictvectorizer additionally sklearn-pandas has dataframemapper which does what you re looking for too note x is not sparse when using this last method
you could do everything with your map and lambda this saves doing your interim temp step and iterates through the 3 columns

31352356
bash	zsh
i don t think bash does at least
even though this isn t possible with normal process substitution zsh provides a special kind of process substitution-like behavior that allows the file to act like more of a real file than traditional process substitution does by creating an actual temporary file the -x hs option tells ghc to act as though the file name given ends in .hs

31354395
division	addition
update according to another so answer integer division in c truncates towards zero which is what |0 does in javascript
in addition division by 0 is undefined so javascript is technically not incorrect in returning zero

31355606
subtract	addition
you can subtract 1 and then add 0 + carry using an instruction which does exactly that sub ax 1 adc ax 0 note that you can t use the dec instruction as a substitute for sub because dec does not affect the carry flag
for going the other way addition you use sbb in place of adc and of course add in place of sub

31356561
prng	random
random.random is known as a prng a pseudo- random number generator
this is not unique to python every language s simple random source is deterministic in this way

31356708
google-chrome	safari
it is because of google-chrome doesn t support .contains method of jquery
instead of using .indexof method it works perfectly in google-chrome safari browser

31356708
google-chrome	safari
instead of using .indexof method it works perfectly in google-chrome safari browser
refer this links error using .contains jquery function in google-chrome jquery contains code doesn #39

31360389
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
setting an onclicklistener on an adapterview doesn t make sense because generally its the children of the adapterview that should be clicked rows of a listview
that s why it s telling you to set an onitemclicklistener instead

31363968
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
the first is that you re incrementing a then passing the incremented value to realloc
since the pointer passed to realloc was not a value returned from malloc calloc or realloc or is null this can cause errors

31363968
realloc	malloc
since the pointer passed to realloc was not a value returned from malloc calloc or realloc or is null this can cause errors
the second problem is that you re not increasing the size of your memory buffer after the first call to realloc since you re always passing it and size never changes

31364797
intersect	contains
the default implementation does a more limited constraining for non-titled windows as described in nswindows constrained to not intersect the menu bar below
nswindows constrained to not intersect the menu bar in 10.9 in support of the new multi-monitor architecture windows are now constrained to not intersect the menu bar on their contains space. this restriction was already in place for titled windows but it has been extended to borderless windows whose level is at least nsnormalwindowlevel but less than nsmainmenuwindowlevel

31364826
dictionary	map
the issue is not with the dictionary methods but the map function which is changed in python 3 to return an iterator rather than a list
numpy doesn t handle the iterators properly so you need to add a list call to fix things the rest of your code is a bit confusing as you re creating a new dictionary without any useful contents then enumerating the keys of the new dictionary without using the indexes

31365455
persistent	transient
i m not sure the fancy sort makes a persistent copy however
watching the memory usage on my machine it seems that deletes the reference to the unsorted original because after about 1 second all that is left is the memory used by the sorted array and the index even if there is a transient copy

31366734
bash	subshell
bash extension
and || true logical and syntax error parsed as an and command separator equivalent but deprecated by posix³ posix and reliable equivalent false syntax error is interpreted as a subshell equivalent but is deprecated by posix posix equivalent 5 word splitting and filename generation upon expansions split+glob true quotes not needed syntax error expands to syntax error if there s more than one file in the current directory

31367962
multiplying	multiplication
this manipulation would only be useful if it prevented the partial product to reach into subnormal territory and in this case multiplying by a power of two would be recommended to avoid loss of accuracy due to the multiplication
there is no indication in your question that this happens no example data set no code so it is only possible to provide the generic explanation below floating-point multiplication is very well behaved when it does not underflow or overflow

31369803
implements	extends
the short answer is don t implements your own use the spire one otherwise you should implements integral which includes numeric
note that your type shouldn t extends it

31370073
serializable	deserialization
the micro-benchmark included ensures that this solution is not slower than default serializable deserialization
indeed it is on my pc problem 8.598s solution 7.818s then here is the code a note of caution whenever the class refers to another object instance it might be possible to leak the temporary instance created by the serializable process the object resolution occurs only after all sub-objects are read hence it is possible for subobjects to keep a reference to the temporary object

31375225
lxml	html5lib
first you need html5lib and you must also install lxml
while html5lib is prepared to use lxml and some other libraries the two do not come packaged together

31377849
google-chrome	firefox
i m afraid implementations of alignment-baseline and dominant-baseline are a bit of a minefield currently as ie does not support either on svg text and firefox only supports dominant-baseline and its implementation of that property is not quite consistent with google-chrome s
firefox prior to version 40 does not support the value middle in dominant-baseline properly it treats it as central and no version supports alignment-baseline

31378615
g++	gcc
also if looking at the produced assembler compile with g++ -wall -s -o3 -fverbose-asm since the -fverbose-asm asks gcc to emit some assembler comments explaining not much but a tiny bit the compiled code
you could compile with g++ -wall -wextra -o3 -g

31379440
portrait	landscape
so i ve duplicated that format created one for landscape and one for portrait
then based on the preview variable if previewing i m rendering the normal landscape document but if not previewing i m using the portrait format and orientation and also starting the transformation and rotating everything on page

31382377
rar	zip
dotnetzip - zip and unzip in c# vb any .net language but there is something interesting link bellow sharpcompress - a fully native c# library for rar 7zip zip tar gzip bzip2
well i not found anywhere in description that dotnetzip can extract rar files

31382377
rar	zip
well i not found anywhere in description that dotnetzip can extract rar files
he can extract zip created with winrar but nowhere notice rar file can be extracted

31382878
sse	avx
one possible method for sse an avx2 implementation of the above is left as an exercise for the reader
assuming you have avx2 not just avx which is only really for floating point then you can use the vpmaddubsw instruction for which the intrinsic is __m256i _mm256_maddubs_epi16 __m256i a __m256i b this performs 8 bit x 8 bit multiply signed x unsigned but this doesn t matter for your case and then adds pairs of adjacent terms to give a 16 bit result

multiplying	multiplication
assuming you have avx2 not just avx which is only really for floating point then you can use the vpmaddubsw instruction for which the intrinsic is __m256i _mm256_maddubs_epi16 __m256i a __m256i b this performs 8 bit x 8 bit multiplying signed x unsigned but this doesn t matter for your case and then adds pairs of adjacent terms to give a 16 bit result
1 this effectively gives you 32 x 8 x 8 bit bit multiplication in one instruction

hive	hdfs
make sure for the following - if you have kerberos security setup don t forget to use kinit user hadoop should have access to write on the folder hive table location
-- for any hdfs path that you are changing the permission simply change permission or chmod command would not work

31386549
scrypt	pbkdf2
the client and server do not have to use the same algorithm the client can use pbkdf2 and the server can use scrypt if you like
the tool you almost certainly want is called pbkdf2 password-based key derivation function 2

31387201
lisp	racket
unlike clojure or emacs lisp racket doesn t have doc strings in the function definition source
racket docs don t have a convention like the one that the first line of a doc string should be a summary a short-version to use in situations like a list of commands or in a repl

31389195
google-chrome	firefox
using advanced rest client for google-chrome copy and paste the url select raw for the payload and copy and paste the xml request click send the response it doesn t look like the send the cross domain headers so you won t be able to make the call via javascript
you can use any rest extension for firefox or google-chrome to make a post request and send the xml as a payload to the server

31389302
pthreads	fork
actually fork is often implemented thru clone 2 which you should not use directly in practice see futex 7 ... but only thru pthreads pthreads
but thinking of fork as a magical cloner of your process might help

31394688
shadowing	named
also best to avoid shadowing the builtin max and min functions so i changed the named in your functions
i have no ideas why you have the same functions twice but you need to actually call the functions pass the parameters and use for assigning not for equality is used it you want to test if two values are equal ie a single is for when you want to assign a named to a variable i.e

31396445
client-side	server-side
client-side is usually referred to as front-end development because it s what the user see s the front
back-end development server-side is the background logic and is everything that happens behind the scenes which the user doesn t and shouldn t see

uialertview	uialertcontroller
i got the following uialertview initialization code to compile without errors i thing the last varyadic part is tricky perhaps
but i had to make sure the class of self which i am passing as the delegate was adopting the uialertviewdelegate protocol for the compile errors to go away by the way this is the error i was getting as of xcode 6.4 cannot find an initializer for type uialertview that accepts an argument list of type title string message string delegate myviewcontroller cancelbuttontitle string otherbuttontitles string as others mentioned you should migrate to uialertcontroller if you can target ios 8.x+

portrait	landscape
note below the additional entries for portrait which are not included in the technical note
interestingly for iphone 6plus i found that there is no need to rotate a landscape launch image to portrait as was necessary for all the other landscape launch images

super	extends
make sure it cannot be a super class of other classes
make the class final so other programmers cannot extends it

31416064
pascal	delphi
converting 32-bit delphi applications to 64-bit windows - inline assembly code if your application contains inline assembly asm code you need to examine the asm code and make the following changes mixing of assembly statements with pascal code is not supported in 64-bit applications
replace assembly statements with either pascal code or functions written completely in assembly

31417565
qabstractitemmodel	qabstracttablemodel
in the end you ll want to have some sort of a data model that implements qabstractitemmodel that exposes the data and one or more views connected to it to display it
if the data doesn t have to be editable you could implement a custom table model derived from qabstracttablemodel that maps the file in memory using qfile map and incrementally parses it on the fly implement canfetchmore and fetchmore

31421149
punctuation	words
if it already exists just return the punctuation
if it doesn t exist print out the whole words including punctuation

31421149
punctuation	words
if it doesn t exist print out the whole words including punctuation
punctuation also removes the space in your example which is why we can t just do string.join ... otherwise the result would be good he is am i instead of good he is am i test reversesentence i am good is he good .dump

31423916
spaces	delimiter
as from your input format there are spaces present and you re not considering that as a prt of delimiter
so expectedly those spaces will be present in the string pointed bu buffer

jruby	mri	mri	rubinius
at the time the spec was written those implementations included mri yarv rubinius jruby ironruby maglev macruby xruby ruby.net cardinal tinyrb rubygolightly smallruby blueruby and others
of particular interest are mri which only implements 1.8 and yarv which only implements 1.9 at the time which means that the spec can only specify behavior which is common to 1.8 and 1.9 which hash ordering is not

31426144
comparator	comparable
the comparator passed to the treeset determines if two elements are considered to be identical
in the first treeset you are not passing any comparator to the constructor which means the natural ordering defined by comparable is used

31426144
comparator	comparable
in the first treeset you are not passing any comparator to the constructor which means the natural ordering defined by comparable is used
the comparable s compareto compares by age only

31427034
sum	coalesce
use coalesce select sum coalesce price_2 price_1 as totalprice from my_table group by id coalesce will take price_1 if price_2 is null
coalesce will return the first parameter which is not null

31429855
dictionary	map
this should be a bit faster but it will only work if the dictionary do not have any other fields than those in self.__fields otherwise the dictionary can not be reconstructed from the lists at least not as easily
alternatively you might use tuples instead of lists and use another dictionary to map those tuples to the original dictionaries.

31430349
build.gradle	gradlew
build.gradle file and you have to run the gradlew build by this
i found a solution but it is not the best so far. so i m not sure anymore that what i wanted to do initially is possible. the gradlew file evaluation and the choosing of the right flavor and build type is in different phases of the gradlew build so what i ve done is i use a build parameter from the command line

31435317
pickle	dill
the most recent versions of dill on github has settings that allow variants of how the pickle is constructed on dump
yes the default settings for dill fail on this object but not if you use the setting that recursively traces global references

31436670
clang	llvm
you need to run a parallel mono install here are the basics that i do to run a 64-bit mono assuming you already have the the xcode clang llvm command line tools if not consult the apple store for installing xcode it is free and or install only the xcode cmd line tools xcode-select --install check app store software updates and ensure that all xcode related items are up to date get the build dependancies i use homwbrew but you can use ports or build them from source get the sources i use the git-based sources not the tar balls configure mono to build with your requirements make and install set update path a cmd-line example of the above steps note this does not cover building and linking llvm
i use llvm but the above steps will get you started once you can get a clean build consult the mono docs to add llvm so you can compile to native code instead of just jit ing

31437609
wildfly	jboss
all future jboss as been renamed wildfly and they do not correspond to a jboss enterprise application server release you ll notice that we skip version numbers as we see fit
jboss enterprise application server eap x will also align to the java ee spec

implements	extends
in the code implements database creation dbutils.createdatabaseifnotexists -- you are probably using a t-sql create database command to create an azure database on a logical server
currently create database doesn t support specifying the pool -- however an update to azure db is expected within the next month that will extends the functionality of create database and alter database to specify the pool name as well

31442158
rspec	capybara
to find a link based on just its href using capybara you could do or if you re looking to assert that the element exists or - if using rspec since have link by default searches for substrings in the link text you can also do expect page .to have_link nil href actual link or page.assert_selector link nil href actual link
capybara doesn t provide a link_to method so i m not sure where you re getting that from rails provides a link_to for generating links in the view

31443417
awt	swing
it s possible that awt will be linked to older component libraries so some of the components won t match the current os look and feel which will be using newer component libraries
in either case you can t effect how these components look and certainly not through swing s look and feel api

31443511
jar	war
setting archivesbasename will apply to all archive tasks zip jar war ear tar and can be overriden for individual archive tasks by setting the task s basename property
the link you are referencing is for the war task not the plugin

31443591
uiview	subviews
then again if it is nothing but a plain uiview you could simply replace the whole view with a new one this might even make it simple to cross-fade between old and new views if such is desired
if by clear you mean remove all previously added subviews from it you could try something like the caveat is that linechart should remain a plain uiview or your self-made subclass that you know the implementation of as otherwise it may have internal subviews that you shouldn t remove

31448100
uiview	subviews
in this case you could either add it to a uiview or set uiimageview s userinteractionenabled property to yes
another possible problem is if you add the uibutton as a subviews to an uiimageview which you shouldn t but it works

31448530
octal	decimal
note that leading zeros in a non-zero decimal number are not allowed. this is for disambiguation with c-style octal literals which python used before version 3.0
as noted here leading zeros in a non-zero decimal number are not allowed

31448740
prepare	execute
use of a prepare statement in create role is also not useful at all
a prepare statement is used to plan execution of a complex statement once and then execute it many times with different parameters

31449225
jsf	seam
in case of seam 2.3.x all those methods were based on jsf 2.1
in jsf 2.2 a new method getflowhandler was added to application which wasn t properly delegated by seam and thus returned null causing all the trouble further down in the chain relying on it not being null

31449225
jsf	seam
in jsf 2.2 a new method getflowhandler was added to application which wasn t properly delegated by seam and thus returned null causing all the trouble further down in the chain relying on it not being null
if seam guys had properly extended from applicationwrapper instead of hardcoding all delegate methods for a specific jsf version then it would flawlessly have worked across jsf versions

31450710
mongodb	bson
it s probably already installed as part of your mongodb driver dependecies which all use pymongo but if not then install it
or and it works just like dumps except all the bson type handling is built it

31460335
serializable	deserialization
i think this is because datetime does not have any properties getxxx setxxx so xmlencoder won t find anything to serializable
you could wrap a datetime in another type that handles serialization deserialization for example something like this.

31462453
google-chrome	firefox
as described elsewhere on so the canvas api has a method getboundingclientrect which returns a domrect clientrect in google-chrome so the following will reliably get the coordinates of a tap click relative to the canvas element come scroll or high water the above is from firefox
i found google-chrome doesn t include the x and y properties so probably best to stick to left and top

31462453
google-chrome	safari
i found google-chrome doesn t include the x and y properties so probably best to stick to left and top
i haven t tested it on ie or safari

ionic	angular
i recently had to build an app implementing facebook s oauth it s pretty straightforward if you re willing to use ngcordova add in the ngcordova library to your ionic project
bower install ngcordova include ngcordova to your index.html file before cordova.js make sure you inject ngcordova to your angular module usually in app.js to use multiple oauth providers supported by ngcordova you need to get cordova s inappbrowser plugin add that into the mix cordova plugin add to use it in controllers check out note the installation documented in ngcordova s oauth plugin page usually doesn t works and when using the app in an emulator or a device it returns could not find inappbrowser plugin for every provider

31463342
implements	extends
i think that implements interfaces or overriding virtual functions could be often a cleaner solution
i used unity s approach once for an ai plugin which should call user defined methods without forcing to extends a class basically because i had to avoid recompiling the code while modifying ai s behaviours in any case for what concern the implementation 1 send message sendmessage use a pure reflection implementation the target method name can be know only when sendmessage is called. this seems convenient and might be perhaps i still never used nor i felt the need to but has several drawbacks performance reflection is costly check some benchmarks it ends up to be hundred of times slower than a direct method call not type safe can t check at compile time if the argument passed is of the right type

31464224
icmp	tcp
it should given that icmp has no ports in the protocol
icmp does not have ports in the protocol unlike tcp

31465764
memcpy	memmove
you are right memcpy doesn t work if the memory areas are overlapping
for such cases there exists a different function memmove

31466048
rpm	yum
rpm looks at the pathnames used in the files section taking into account those which you have told it to ignore using the exclude tag
while you can override it using the --replacefiles option and install conflicting files this is not usually a good idea since updates to the packages will require additional overrides and frequently yum upgrades will fail

31467000
inline	inlining
they are subject to change but they do give you an idea on what to look for if you want to make a method eligible for inlining the jit won t inline methods marked with methodimploptions.noinlining methods larger than 32 bytes of il virtual methods methods that take a large value type as a parameter methods on marshalbyref classes methods with complicated flowgraphs methods meeting other more exotic criteria in particular there is methodimploptions.aggressiveinlining which is supposed to lift the 32 bytes limit or whatever it happens to be these days and for your platform
.net 3.5 added heuristics that help it determine whether to inline or not to inline which is probably a good thing although it makes it harder for the developer to predict the jitter s decision a quote from the article if inlining makes code smaller then the call it replaces it is always good

31467000
inline	inlining
thus code in loops deserves to be inline more than code that is not in loops
if inlining exposes important optimizations then inlining is more desirable

31467535
inline	inlining
.net s jitter has builtin heuristics that help it determine whether to inline or not to inline
as i could not find a good reason see below that prevents inlining and in 4.5 could persuade it via aggressiveinlining so the jitter can inline if it wants to that could be it

31467535
inline	inlining
i can reproduce it here on .net 4.5 both x68 and x64 but i have no idea why it does not get inline because it has none of the inlining show stoppers like being a virtual method or consuming more than 32 bytes
it s 30 bytes short when enabling aggressiveinlining which you say you cannot as you are on .net 3.5 not only does the call get inline but the inline code gets elided completely - as it should because you don t use the return value --- program.cs -------------------------------------------- iscontrol 0

31467875
vbscript	vba
nor are mode modifiers in vbscript javascript
a regex that will match as you require would be the replacement string would merely be the pipe a udf implementing that in vba might be the udf assumes that you do not want to replace a comma just before endat if it is separated by 0 or more space characters

31469341
google-chrome	firefox
the short answer is google-chrome is approximating circles with composite bezier curves
i was unable to replicate this myself on chromium 43.0.2357.130 ubuntu but it does occur on firefox 39 although i couldn t find a similar bug report for firefox

31469421
daemons	systemd
program exit a program terminates all its activity and exits when one of two things happens all the threads that are not daemons threads terminate
some thread invokes the exit method of class runtime or class systemd and the exit operation is not forbidden by the security manager

31469676
daemons	systemd
now as the - to me - obvious reason jls 12.8 program exit says a program terminates all its activity and exits when one of two things happens all the threads that are not daemons threads terminate
some thread invokes the exit method of class runtime or class systemd and the exit operation is not forbidden by the security manager

31470312
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
you missed returning zero in the comparator when the map values are equals from the documentation of treemap note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equals

implements	extends
you can t count on action views returning what you would expect so what i did was implements a custom alert dialog that shows all possible applications that can open a certain file a slightly modified version as shown here custom intent chooser more update after a little more search i found that you can see various of classes but the important thing is that the class you are calling with the intent doesn t changing the return value
you are calling movieactivity that extends activity not activitystate

31481288
udp	tcp
udp stands for user datagram protocol as it is functionally built on datagrams
using a sockettype.stream for udp doesn t work as udp is not a stream protocol tcp is

31481288
udp	tcp
using a sockettype.stream for udp doesn t work as udp is not a stream protocol tcp is
you almost certainly want to use sockettype.dgram datagram for udp

31483084
super	implements
similarly the meaning of this and super are the same as outside the lambda expression and do not refer to the instance which will represent the function afterwards the routebuilder instance
that said it would not be unreasonable to expand the feature to implements abstract classes which behave like interface s but that imposes several constraints which are hard to check

31485256
daemons	systemd
the second fork 2 is there to ensure that the new process is not a session leader so it won t be able to accidentally allocate a controlling terminal since daemons are not supposed to ever have a controlling terminal
about the 2nd fork here s a quote from advanced programming in the unix environment chapter 13 daemon processes under systemd v-based systemd some people recommend calling fork again at this point terminating the parent and continuing the daemon in the child

31485256
daemons	systemd
about the 2nd fork here s a quote from advanced programming in the unix environment chapter 13 daemons processes under systemd v-based systemd some people recommend calling fork again at this point terminating the parent and continuing the daemons in the child
this guarantees that the daemons is not a session leader which prevents it from acquiring a controlling terminal under the systemd v rules

swift	objective-c
as i m not familiar at all with objective-c or c++ i m gonna give you the answer in swift
then you ll be able to either insert it into your project or translate to objective-c c++

31487215
daemons	systemd
details the service.running function requires properly configured systemd service daemons
for example on rhel-based linux if you don t see your script name in the output of one of these commands you should configure it as proper service first which is a separate topic # systemd systemctl list-units | grep your_service_name # sysv init.d chkconfig --list | grep your_service_name and because you want to start it in background cmd.run function is not the right tool either it will only report successful start of the script without waiting for its completion results

31488533
google-chrome	firefox
this question is not specific to google-chrome
firefox and probably other browsers behave similar and in the last years the warnings even got stricter

31488627
aggregate-functions	sum
let me confess that i couldn t sleep last night properly because i couldn t get how aggregate works internally i ll get good sleep tonight definitely - let s start understanding it result int int 55 10 aggregate-functions has 3 parts initial value of accumulators tuple 0 0 here seqop it works like foldleft with initial value of 0 combop it combines the result generated through parallelization this part was difficult for me to understand let s understand all 3 parts independently part-1 initial tuple 0 0 aggregate starts with initial value of accumulators x which is 0 0 here
first tuple x._1 which is initially 0 is used to compute the sum second tuple x._2 is used to compute total number of elements in the list

persistent	transient
repository.save does persistent if the provided argument is transient or merge otherwise
since a is not transient merge is performed meaning that there is no persistent operation that could be cascaded to bs

31496434
factors	matrix
for 5 and 6 factors there seems to be a reflection added for the 5th column - i m not sure what determines which columns get reflected so this is hardcoded in at present into the examples
the method works as before by generating a rotation matrix using lm.fit

31497540
strcpy	strncpy
if you want to copy and possibly truncate a c-style string then i would use strncpy instead of strcpy
one limitation of strncpy is that it will not null-terminate the string if the # characters exactly equals the copy length

31497763
jasmine	sinon
using that function in jasmine you can do something like this the provider for this test is very simple not exactly sure how that translates to sinon but providergetter which uses the angular-mocks functions should work
i found a very good answer in the post how to test angularjs custom provider especially the answer from stephane catala apr 22 that gives a generic function providergetter that gives you access to a provider in a jasmine test

g++	gcc
for example with gcc 4.9 the following file does not compile with g++ let s get to the bottom of things compiled with just g++ test.cpp this code prints 199711
although gcc 4.9 was released in 2014 the default c++ dialect is c++98 with gnu extensions

google-chrome	safari
this bug most often occurs when there is a lot going on in the page ... fix 1 fix 2 in case the element isn t repainted when scrolling the page this case was recently fixed in google-chrome chromium
quoting john winkelman s post this is a known issue for webkit browsers google-chrome safari

31501906
ssl	https
the error message curl 1 ssl is disabled https not supported means that the instance of curl libcurl that you re using was built without support for this protocol
this could ve happened if the configure script that was run at build time couldn t find all libs and include files curl requires for ssl to work

31501906
ssl	https
if the configure script fails to find them curl is simply built without ssl support
to get the https support into a curl that was previously built but that reports that https is not supported you should dig through the logs and check out why the configure script doesn t find the ssl libs and or include files

31503503
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you have always to call setcontentview before every findviewbyid s otherwise you will not have any widgets to find
from the code you posted the only mistake i can see probably leading your app to crash for nullpointerexception is that you are using findviewbyid before setcontentview

31504486

31504499
tlistview	tlistbox
a tlistview is indeed the appropriate thing to use when you have many items which are to have the same layout as each other although it is possible to make each one vary from the next
a tlistbox is only meant when you have not too many items and each one needs to have different contents such as configuring application settings

31505516
build.gradle	gradlew
it really doesn t matter from my experience what you need to do is make a build.gradle file with your favorite .txt writer make sure it says .gradle
if your root foldere app name is say archiver then you put the gradlew file where you see folders like app .idea gradlew e.t.c

31510324
swift	objective-c
there are some github projects that have done this although there aren t any well developed swift ones yet a few objective-c ones do exist which will still work in a swift project anyways by simple importing it your projects bridging-header file
uzysassetspickercontroller wsassetpickercontroller elcimagepickercontroller here is an example of a project using uzysassetpickercontroller from swift

vbo	vao
it should be using gl15.gl_array_buffer as the first parameter not the vbo id since that has already been bind to the gl15.gl_array_buffer binding point
okay two things here first off you don t need to bind a vao to update an vbo

i know that the swedish portal öppnadata.se uses the ckanext-sweden which customizes ckanext-dcat to some extends

31515821
super	self
even when you re subclassing a class you shouldn t be accessing that class directly using its name but instead use the python s built-in function super # wrong usually class x y def __init__ self y.__init__ self # right class x y def __init__ self super .__init__ # self is omitted when using super
calling cls.__init__ self where cls can be any class will simply call the cls s __init__ on self

31517518
lisp	rebol
perhaps this stance warrants a second look...as lisp users who are pressuring for the addition of lisp-style macros seeming aren t worried about that very much
which hasn t gotten much in the way of answers yet. the fork by saphirion saphir prior to the open-sourcing of rebol saphirion ag had a special relationship with rebol technologies

implements	extends
to get print the value of an object you need to have the tostring implements in the class and memoryusagegaugeset doesn t have it
verify javadoc one way is to extends the class with your own implementation tostring

31519481
serializable	deserialization
i do not think you can store an object in a session. here are a few solutions store manually each field of your object in the session serializable your object and save it in the session store it in the database with a flag saying it is not yet attached to a user and save the id in session as i see it 1 is the fastest to implement but it will be a pain to maintain if you later add fields to your entity
solution 2 is better but the deserialization is not so easy

31523963
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you dispose of the dbcontext that owns the objectcontext the new dbcontext will essentially be disposed
after some more researching testing and checking the source code for dbcontext i came to the conclusion that is not required

31523963
dbcontext	objectcontext
after some more researching testing and checking the source code for dbcontext i came to the conclusion that is not required
the dbcontext only needs to dispose of the internal context which is a wrapper for the objectcontext that is passed

31524043
inline	inlining
there is no more semantics behind inline keyword
from perspective of real inlining of function calls compiler optimization it may only be useful if your compiler is configured to never inline functions that are not marked as inline like ob1 for visual c++

31524043
inline	inlining
from perspective of real inlining of function calls compiler optimization it may only be useful if your compiler is configured to never inline-functions that are not marked as inline like ob1 for visual c++
however it is quite normal for a modern compiler to try to inline all functions it can

31524136
inline	inlining
it doesn t matter anyway since inline is totally ignored for inlining purposes and is only used to dictate some relaxed linkage requirements
but as it is your function is already not going to be inlined whether you write inline on it or not

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome treats the dropdown as part of element
there is a very old firefox bug logged with status unconfirmed the drop-down box in a tag isn t treated as a child of the tag s parents check out my version of your plunker here i have expanded textangular.min.js

31535390
jruby	mri
as you can see in there are many java versions of pry that work very well with jruby since jruby 1.6
pry is not mri dependent

31538804
freebsd	linux	cpython	pypy
the documentation at is misleading the beta versions of vmprof on os x or freebsd are only available for cpython not for pypy
vmprof on pypy is only enabled on 64-bit linux right now

31540332
floating-point	fixed-point
there is an important difference between the decimal and double datatypes in powercenter decimal a fixed-point representation of real numbers double a floating-point representation of real numbers
however defining a decimal port does not automatically mean the integration service will treat values passing though this port as fixed-point numbers

31541225
sum	coalesce
if you want the sum of all 3 columns for every single row then you need to use isnull if you need the aggregated sum of all 3 columns you can simply do it like this
in sql server and probably in most if not all relational databases the sum aggregation function ignores null values by default so there really is no need to use coalesce or isnull inside it

31541868
g++	gcc
ld -r file1.o file2.o file3.o -o file.o you should probably use g++ to link not call ld directly
passing .o files to gcc will cause it to invoke the linker for you so this works g++ file1.o file2.o file3.o -o file.o you say but i don t know how to compile .cpp files into .o files

31541868
g++	gcc
passing .o files to gcc will cause it to invoke the linker for you so this works g++ file1.o file2.o file3.o -o file.o you say but i don t know how to compile .cpp files into .o files
you just compile with -c and if you want to put the object file in a shared library then also -fpic g++ -c file1.cpp -fpic -o file1.o but i must also provide static library to this command no because a command with -c is compiling not linking so you can t provide libraries because they are only used when linking

31541868
g++	gcc
you just compile with -c and if you want to put the object file in a shared library then also -fpic g++ -c file1.cpp -fpic -o file1.o but i must also provide static library to this command no because a command with -c is compiling not linking so you can t provide libraries because they are only used when linking
so i want shared library with all symbols from static library libalgatorc.a and from all three cpp files file1.cpp file2.cpp and file3.cpp then you need to read the answer i already pointed you to maybe you should read a tutorial on building software in unix-like environments maybe something like an introduction to gcc so that you understand the separate steps needed and what each command does

31543202
swift	objective-c
the swift language 2.0 doesn t currently have syntax to trap these runtime error s
these are likely equivalent to segmentation faults kills which don t get trapped by objective-c s try catch syntax

31545004
implements	extends
this also explains why extends class overlayview is one safe way to implements your html css customized marker
because you do not need to deal with map events listening yourself when you extends overlayview

31546494
postgresql	mysql
json is a valid datatype in postgresql database as well
however mysql database has not officially supported json yet

31546656
super	extends
you do not have to explicitly extends anyref. anyref is the equivalent of java s object in scala. by creating an instance of a class that instance will be extends anyref implicitly regardless of if it was explicitly mentioned in one of its super classes or not
the following code just creates an anonymous class thus it also extends anyref implicitly here is the explanation from scala-lang.org the superclass of all classes scala.any has two direct subclasses scala.anyval and scala.anyref representing two different class worlds value classes and reference classes

31548501
implements	extends
solution the solution i implements involves several steps create duplicate objects for all of my models
the duplicates do not extends realmobject since realmobjects cannot be used across threads. move all accesses to realm onto background threads

31548951
margin	text-align
as you have pointed out margin auto will not center an inline element
since inline inline-block level elements respect the text-align property you could simply add text-align center to the parent element

31549505
ssl	https
this is probably due to ssl requirements with ios 9
since parse doesn t use https for files they won t download correctly

31549946
client-side	server-side
this differs from simply rendering a react template server-side resulting in rendered static page in that it also supports mounting the react component s client-side resulting in a rendered dynamic page
right now you re simply doing the former and therefore react isn t actually running client-side so the click-event isn t actually wired up

31551715
.htaccess	httpd.conf
it is far better to block the access earlier on in the process creating a blacklist of ip s in httpd.conf if you have access to it or .htaccess if you dont
you should be able to tell this from the apache logs and then deny them from the httpd.conf file or .htaccess apache 2.2 deny from 11.22.33.44 apache 2.4 require not ip 11.22.33.44 in php you can do if you are going to try and block an ip using php you are not going to achieve much saving as a script still has to be found interpreted and executed only to then exit almost straight away for each request a hacker makes

31553072
google-chrome	safari
here s a bit more info on this subject and you can compare all the differences between something like google-chrome and ios safari here
according to this question it looks like the datetime input type is not supported in ios safari

31553922
libstdc++	libc++
std thread is also supposed to use invoke but libstdc++ gcc s standard library s implementation happens to not choke on this particular combination due to the way it was implemented
libc++ clang s standard library will fail to compile for both

31558502
equals	gethashcode
in your case deleted something definitely return different hashcode with deleted if 1 is equals then use equals to compare again because hashcode may have collision and not accurate but fast
your comparer not working is due to the implementation of the gethashcode regardless the right way to implement the iequalitycomparer

31559640
stringbuilder	stringwriter
for example while stringbuilder only accepts a string or nothing for appendline stringwriter can take a string format directly with stringbuilder one must do this or use string.format or not do or die stuff but still a difference
building on the previous good answers stringwriter is actually much more versatile than stringbuilder providing lots of overloads

31564424
g++	gcc
gcc 4.9.2 not clang 3.6.0 i tested full program based on larsmans s interpretation it did not compile with g++ test.cpp but it did compile with a warning with g++ test.cpp -fpermissive
even g++ test.cpp -fpermissive -ansi and work

31565082
ssl	https
and malware at either end can take snapshots of data entering or exiting the ssl protocol - such as bad javascript inside a page inside https which can surreptitiously make http or https calls to logging websites since access to local harddrive is often restricted and not useful
also cookies are not encrypted under the https protocol either

31566058
google-chrome	firefox
from what i understand there is no way to tell google-chrome not to warn on potentially dangerous binary file downloads see chromedriver has no way to accept dangerous downloads archived add option to automatically accept dangerous downloads wontfix as the simplest workaround you might want to approach the problem with firefox also there have been numerous requests from dev community to allow to disable this warning to be able to run automated tests in google-chrome
at the moment this is the only reason we re running our automated tests in firefox only

31567819
prng	random
now you re not getting a random sequence at all but a sequence which is a hash function of your seeds and only as good as your seeds and the seeding function of each prng
stay with the same cryptographically secure prng

31568933
swift	objective-c
i prefer doing code in pure swift and not rely on objective-c heritage
because of this i wrote pure swift solution with two advantages and two disadvantages

31570578
addition	multiplication
if it s specifically about implementing addition it s probably at least mostly theoretical--essentially every processor already implements addition perfectly well
if however it were about implementing multiplication or division there s at least a possibility of some practical application--some of the smaller embedded processors do not have multiplication or division instructions

31572457
google-chrome	firefox
alternatives use image block extension switch to google-chrome disable images in selenium chromedriver
from what i understand this problem is related to the following firefox issues remove load images automatically checkbox from prefs get rid of options that kill our product that means that permissions.default.image is frozen cannot be changed and does nothing

31576473
ubuntu	linux
this will vary with your linux distro ubuntu will create an init script for you when you install other distros like ami will not
here is a great resource for various linux distro init-up scripts you can then add supervisor to chkconfig to get started automatically on system reboot

31583972
clang	llvm
ps note that clang 4.0 does not exist
one can check the source code repository and see which revision was when llvm clang was branched for a release

31584576
junit	jmock
i too faced the same kind of exception when running junit with jmock and maven exception in constructor testdoexecute java.lang.classformaterror absent code attribute in method that is not native or abstract in class file javax servlet http cookie at java.lang.classloader.defineclass1 native method it is due to classes your code try to access which are not available in the javaee api jar used in the project because your code compiles against incomplete classes like the javaee6 api and your unit tests try to access code thats not there
junit will simply fail and mark the test as error printing something like the above exception

31585428
realloc	malloc
always assume an implementation may take a copy example output malloc 4779c0 -- realloc 4779c0
realloc isn t required to copy and a good implementation avoids unnecessary copies

31595656
gridview	sqldatasource
or you can make sure you rebind the gridview after assigning the values to the parameters
ex i don t like this approach because the whole point of using a querystringparameter in your sqldatasource is that you shouldn t need to have code wire up the parameters

31596687
google-chrome	firefox
since this seems to be a knotty thing i am on win7 64 bit and tested in google-chrome - version 43.0.2357.134 m ie - version 11.0.9600.17914 and firefox is irrelevant because it would not let me access it anyway
--update-- document.execcommand 1 before firefox 41 clipboard capability needed to be enabled in the user.js preference file

31596804
google-chrome	safari
it also plays from the web using the link you provided above 54.169.222.113 video 62 fine on google-chrome on a mac but not on safari
it will also play from the web link on and android tablet samsung note in the default browser and in google-chrome

31596804
google-chrome	safari
the video played fine in the following clients which connected to the server over the network mac safari mac google-chrome android standard and google-chrome browsers iphone safari i also edited the videos.com page locally using browser tools and added your video and it would not play
it appears that there is a subtle issue with your video on certain browsers which manifests itself when using videojs - the problem can be demonstrated quite easily using your site the video never plays back on safari on a mac the video always plays back on google-chrome on a mac unless you have managed to solve the issue offline somehow if so please let us know as this is an interesting problem

31596829
client-side	server-side
if you control the client you can do this with client-side javascript
if you don t you re building a server-side component like an api then you can t pull it out of the http request unless you re using sessions but even that s not necessarily reliable

31598749
cashapelayer	calayer
you can do the following to make sure that you call path to cashapelayer not to calayer class type
note that self.layer always returns a generic calayer inside a uiview so you have to typecast it to your specific class to make sure that it has the correct type

31598942
oncreate	findviewbyid
in awsstartact oncreate you re using the wrong id bhadoop for button database
it s not in the layout so findviewbyid cannot find it and returns null

31599031
swift	objective-c
the library chartboostsdk is not supported for swift directly using cocoapods you need to integrate it manually in the following way 1.first unzip the sdk package and drop the chartboost framework into your xcode project
be sure you ve also linked these frameworks storekit foundation coregraphics uikit 2.then you need to add a swift bridging header allows you to communicate with your old objective-c classes from your swift classes.you will need one if you plan to keep portions of your codebase in objective-c

31600897
swift	objective-c
you do not need convention c unless you are writing a hybrid app where objective-c needs to call into your swift code
here are two swift method declarations objective-c sees the first as taking an objective-c block and the second as taking a c pointer-to-function

31601626
g++	gcc
g++ 4.8 simply does not support c++14 also mingw is quite outdated when there are more new versions of gcc
alternatives you can use if you want really to use c++11 or c++14 on windows with gcc you should be using one of the following options uses mingw-w64 internally

31602629
build.gradle	gradlew
if you are using version 0.14.0 or higher of the gradlew plugin you should replace runproguard with minifyenabled in your build.gradle files
minifyenabled false means build type names cannot be main or androidtest this is enforced by the plugin and that they have to be unique to each other. reference error 26 0 gradlew dsl method not found #39

31602672
apache	nginx
you should not have to use public index.php you should setup your webserver apache nginx to use your public folder as a web root
a typical laravel installation will take care of the rest if you re using apache

31603073
ssl	https
proxy_pass you are passing the request with plain http no https x15 x03 x01 x00 x02 x02 and you are getting a ssl response back
so it looks like you must use https and not http to access port 5000

31605053
apache	nginx
if you put the configuration in an other file than 000-default.conf you have to enable the site with so that apache knows that it exists
from your configuration i noted whitespace at and documentroot in combination with proxy configuration doesn t make sense if you plan to redirect to localhost 8080 app you have to configure this see below i have no tomcat7 but i configured nginx apache 80 -- proxy -- nginx 8080 with the following configuration a subdirectoy app from nginx is displayed at port 80 via apache

31605053
apache	nginx
from your configuration i noted whitespace at and documentroot in combination with proxy configuration doesn t make sense if you plan to redirect to localhost 8080 app you have to configure this see below i have no tomcat7 but i configured nginx apache 80 -- proxy -- nginx 8080 with the following configuration a subdirectoy app from nginx is displayed at port 80 via apache
i hope this will help to answer your question just works fine with debian 8 etc apache2 sites-available 000-default.conf enable proxy and restart apache a2enmod proxy a2enmod proxy_http service apache2 restart all possible error messages are logged into var log apache2 error.log you should also take a look at your tomcat logfiles

31606176
ssl	https
if a proxy is used the intended way and the corporate ssl interception is explicitly trusted by the user than you are safe if you add some special exceptions in your code then you are not
a simple http proxy does not make any changes to the https communication so everything should work without changes to certificate validation as long as the proxy is used the way it should be done configured as proxy for the browser and not used as special urls like

31611893
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
only when connectiondidfinishloading in nsurlconnection or urlsession task didcompletewitherror in nsurlsession is called should you then use the nsmutabledata
alternatively if using the block-based nsurlsession this concern is completely eliminated since you re not implementing any delegate methods

31618846
implements	extends
apparently both jtabbedpane and jpanel extends jcomponent and implements accessible
however jcomponent doesn t implements accessible

31619627
sum	coalesce
you can do this with either a full outer join or union all and group by select date class sum count_of_a as count_of_a sum count_of_b as count_of_b from select date class count_of_a null as count_of_b from table_a union all select date class null as count_of_a count_of_b from table_b ab group by date class
this method has a couple of advantages over full outer join apart from not needed a bunch of coalesce statements in the from

31620186
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you re calling setintentandbutton - which is where you hook up the listeners - before you call setcontentview
thus the buttons have not been created when you try to attach the listeners and the calls to findviewbyid will return null

31621515
swift	objective-c
also let me say that i know that swift is a moving target and i m sure it will improve - perhaps my workaround hacks below will not be necessary by the time you read this
but if you are trying to do something like this today and you are looking at instruments and seeing the majority of your application time spent in retain release and you don t want to rewrite your entire app in objective-c please read on

31622815
express	node.js
if not you can set up a server quickly by downloading node.js and npm comes with it and using npm from your command prompt to install something called express and then express-generator
with express generator you can run an init command from your command line and it will build an entire fully functioning web server for you including local folder structure which you can instantiate with a quick command from your command prompt

31623611
inline	inlining
you don t need to understand the inlining or other optimizations criteria because by definition assuming that the optimizing compiler is not buggy on that respect an inline code should behave the same as a non-inlined code
your first example callee unconditionally returning a value is in practice certainly wrong in the sense that several compilers are able to inline conditional returns

31623611
inline	inlining
the resulting f.s assembly file contains only one function foo the fact function has completely gone and the fact 10 has been inline recursively and replaced constant folding by 3628800
with gcc -current version is gcc 5.2 in july 2015- assuming you ask it to optimize compile with gcc -o2 or g++ -o2 or -o3 the inlining decision is not easy to understand

31623611
inline	inlining
the key point is that the compiler is better optimizing and inlining than what you reasonably can so trust it to inline and optimize well
optimizing compilers see also this can and do inline functions even without you knowing that they are sometimes inlining functions not marked inline or not inlining some functions marked inline

31623611
inline	inlining
optimizing compilers see also this can and do inline-functions even without you knowing that they are sometimes inlining functions not marked inline or not inlining some functions marked inline
so no you don t want to understand these semantics and the algorithms which guide inline expansion they are too difficult .

31623741
inline	inlining
a function that includes inline calls needs to include them it its own size or inlining can go totally out of control
however ast nodes that will not generate instructions should not prevent inlining

31623929
multiplying	subtract
by experimenting a bit i found that if you multiplying the input data by 1.01 or 0.999 the plot comes out right but 1.001 or 0.9999 is not enough to fix the issue
adding or subtract a constant instead shifts the color but keeps the problem evident

31625068
super	extends
is protected and not public hence while overriding methods of super class try not to change the methods access as much as possible until not necessary
when you are drawing on a jpanel simply call the repaint on the instance of the jpanel instead of the top level container s when one is extends any jcomponenet jpanel always try to override the said jcomponent jpanel s getpreferredsize as many a layouts will return 0 if none is specified hence no painting will be done

31630404
bower	npm
but if you re using bower you ll be to use it with the following command
the reason you ve got it package.json is because you ve installed a npm package of react-art not a bower one which isn t available

31633281
bower	npm
in particular this means that the resources provided in scripts loaded by bower will usually but not always still be defined as global variables available from anywhere in the browser execution context
the npm approach common js modules explicit dependency injection all code in node land and thus all code loaded via npm is structured as modules specifically as an implementation of the commonjs module format or now as an es6 module

31633918
swift	objective-c
or if you would to use them from objective c class only then you can do following in your .m file implementation and also make that public in header in .h file in swift file for this you need to use swift bridging header and include your constant class in bridging header rest of conversion for calling objective-c code is just magic by swift.
leo is right you can not have objective c like macro in swift

31634230
inline	inlining
branches in any code - not just within inline functions - can potentially be optimized out if the compiler can detect that the same branch is always followed
some modern compilers are also smart enough to not inline a function declared inline if it evaluates another function as a better candidate for inlining

31636592
daemons	systemd
the background daemons is a possible solution but only for your own use but not via the app store
the official take on this is in the app store review guidelines -- the relevant section is 2.8 presumably you d get your daemons on by having the app install it behind the scenes 2.8 apps that install or launchd other executable code will be rejected there may be some systemd logs that ios keeps for itself

31636934
swift	objective-c
depending on the amount and complexity of your swift code that might still be the most optimal approach
as top-level swift is simply not accessible from unity the workaround for swift is to write an objective-c wrapper class around it and access that

31637666
swift	objective-c
the swift 1 declaration for - setviewcontrollers direction animated completion has changed from to so your cast confuses swift 2 because the type of viewcontrollers doesn t match
expect more objective-c apis to be audited in the future

31639196
floating-point	fractions
because your code is running with integer division but you calculator can do floating-point division
your returns 62 not 62.5 since both operand is int and this operation will always disregards fractions part

31639830
stateless	stateful
basically the developer must say hey container here s a stateless business service class i ll annotate it with stateless so that you can use it as a stateless ejb and thus not the other way round or so
if you want state then use a stateful which will be newly recreated every time the client obtains it so if the client is a view scoped jsf managed bean then the ejb will live as long as that bean or if the client is a session scoped cdi managed bean then the ejb will live as long as that bean etc

31640219
serializable	deserialization
this works fine on serializable because you have a concrete instance of the encoding utf8encoding which is indeed a subclass of encoding
however on deserialization the deserializer doesn t know what concrete type of encoding you are going to make so the type that is passed to the converter is just encoding

31640559
agda	idris
i did a proof with heterogeneous equalities in agda however i couldn t get it to work in idris on short notice and i believe making it work would be a rather painful experience
here it is in agda

31640892
serializable	deserialization
you marked humlogmodel as transient so it will not be serializable and will be null in the copy made in your new activity
note that your constructor will not be used for the de-serialized copy the deserialization process does not use the object s constructor - the object is instantiated without a constructor and initialized using the serializable instance data

31641018
bower	npm
stuff to install first so some important tools we ll need to install first bower grunt-wiredep bower bower is the front end dependency manager that will fetch and install our front end libraries like jquery and backbone
install this first using you might or might not need to use the sudo command in front of npm install depending on your computer setup

31641605
multiplying	addition
for floating point addition the operands need to be adjusted so that they have the same exponent before the add and that involves shifting one of the mantissas across byte boundaries whereas a multiplying is basically multiplying the mantissas and adding the exponent
since the pic apparently has a small hardware multiplier it may not be surprising that sometimes the multiplying can be faster than doing a multi-byte shift especially if the pic only has single bit shift instructions

31641611
scheme	racket
note the #lang scheme language isn t one of the rnrs scheme but the dialect that racket used before the project changed name
well in well-written scheme code it is rare to see set-car

31643436
scheme	racket
now you can see how this is a problem in your code0.scm #lang scheme require rnrs base-6 require rnrs mutable-pairs-6 what this does is use the scheme bindings first
this scheme language is not standard scheme -- it s the precursor to the racket language dating to before the name change when racket was known as plt scheme and therefore scheme was intended to be the scheme dialect that plt scheme uses by default

31643436
scheme	racket
this scheme language is not standard scheme -- it s the precursor to the racket language dating to before the name change when racket was known as plt scheme and therefore scheme was intended to be the scheme dialect that plt scheme uses by default
among other things it has immutable pairs same as the ones you get in #lang racket files

31643444
postorder	inorder
a similar solution works for inorder and pre-order traversals code explanation you can think about the steps like this try left if left-node exists try left again if left-node does not exist try right try right if a right node exists try left from there if no right exists you re at a leaf try curr try curr print current node all nodes below have been executed postorder try up try up if node is root there is no up so exit if coming up from left try right if coming up from right try curr
this is the approach i use for iterative postorder traversal

31643561
swift	objective-c
not as easy available a solution in objective-c but for swift at least swift updated swift reduce is kind of a performance intensive allocating a bunch of intermediate array s instead the following should be much better performance wise but must be explicitly cast
functional programming approach since swift has it and realm lazy loads

31648620
elasticsearch	kibana
an elasticssearch developer told me it is currently not possible in the current version this is not possible but with pipeline aggregations coming in version 2.0 you will be able to use the avg_bucket aggregation to do this in the mean time you would need to do an aggregation for the top 500 terms and perform the average calculation on the client side and that makes it currently impossible to show this data in kibana yes this would work in 2.0 for requests straight to elasticsearch
however it will take some time for the functionality to be added to the kibana interface

31648732
mp4	h.264
at one level you could probably say that mp4 will already work in most major browsers but unfortunately things are not that simple
mp4 is a container and the video and audio in it may be encoded with various codecs which you will need to check your browser supports most support h.264 and even the same codec using different settings baseline vs mainline profiles

31648732
mp4	h.264
mp4 is a container and the video and audio in it may be encoded with various codecs which you will need to check your browser supports most support h.264 and even the same codec using different settings baseline vs mainline profiles
there are also techniques to move the metadata to the start of the mp4 file to allow it stream immediately before the whole file has downloaded - without this it may appear that your video will not play or it may even not play

31649565
rtp	rtcp
to be clear it does not actually transport the media data itself - the rtp real time transport protocol takes care of this
to further complicate things rtcp real tine control protocol exists also - despite the name its main purpose is to collect statistics for the rtp session

31651283
fgets	getchar
thus if you want to reuse what you know is a buffer you need your program to read it into an actual buffer on its side via fgets and then use that buffer as desired
it s not getchar that is buffered but your terminal

31653231
hex	binary
a hex file the intel hex format isn t necessarily executable as such
it s a plain-text format for describing binary data

31653765
opcache	apc
php5.5 included the opcache by default to do handle the opcache
where apc also enabled users to easily add cache items itself the opcache is not available for users

31653765
opcache	apc
where apc also enabled users to easily add cache items itself the opcache is not available for users
because of that apcu was split from the original apc library so the traditional user caching becomes available for php5.4

31657117
comparator	comparable
as you know you can either use collections.max or the stream api to get the max instance according to this field but you can t avoid writing a custom comparator
and the contact class should not always use the lastupdated variable for comparing instances so you will have to provide a custom comparator whenever you want to compare multiple instances by their lastupdated property as it implies that this class is not comparable by default with this field

31657963
libstdc++	libc++
if you are using clang with the ancient libstdc++ that ships with the apple toolchains from gcc 4.2 then unique_ptr is not supported but neither is so the test fails and you use auto_ptr instead
that should work for any gcc libstdc++ clang libc++ or clang libstdc++ combination found in the wild

31658071
comparator	comparable
the reason for that is that updatedon doesn t contain enough information about link objects to uniquely identify them it shouldn t be used in comparator on its own
so the second lesson is be careful to only implement comparable if your objects have a natural order that can be derived from their properties

uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
well i figured out how to do that but instead of buttons i used the uitapgesturerecognizer as rounak suggests as i wanted a specific rect to be tapable i ve implemented the uigesturerecognizerdelegate protocol this piece of code do this where the cellframeinsuperview should be the region where the tapgesture shouldn t do anything
but different from the uibutton the scroll continues to work in all the collection bounds

subtraction	modulo
with regard to implementation it also takes advantage of a bit of a non-obvious property of r precedence rules actually this is true of other languages as well such as c c++ and java namely that unary negative is higher than modulo which is higher than binary subtraction thus the calculation for is equivalent to
to go into more detail regarding the z calculation it is not possible to describe the mapping with a straight modulo of because the 3 6 and 9 inputs would mod to zero

31668202
scheme	racket
edit under linux the installer for petite chez scheme does not include swl you have to download it directly
racket is kind of an extended scheme but you can also choose to use standard scheme by specifying #lang r5rs

31673478
swift	objective-c
that s because swift mangles names in a different way then objective-c and it just says - my class name in objective-c is myapplication
to make it working open your info.plist and add row with principal class key and myapplication value myapplication is what s inside objective-c ... not your swift class name

31673902
sudo	passwd
try this su -c curl -ssl | sh or if it does not work because no root passwd is set on your system sudo su -c curl -ssl | sh
with your command line you are only executing curl with sudo not sh

31675155
punctuation	words
with a index the keyword list is stored in the index after transformation by charset_table so while it would be possible to reconstruct the basis of the text of the documents but not an exact reproduction punctuation and such is lost
whereas if you use a index then the actual words are not stored in the index - only the crc32 fnv64 hashes of the words

31677827
mtu	icmp
c if your socket connection test was successful but you can t connect with a mysql client cli workbench app etc. take a look at the output of netstat to see what state the connection is in replace x.x.x.x with the actual ip address of the rds instance netstat -an | grep x.x.x.x if you were getting a connection established when using telnet or nc but you see the syn state when using a mysql client you might be running into an mtu issue
rds at the time this is written may not support icmp packets used for pmtud

31678097
git-svn	svn2git
you can then start translation with subgit or you can try to copy-and-paste trunk branches tags options generated to your git-svn svn2git config file
i m not sure the second approach will work for 100 of cases but for more or less simple repository structures this will work as the options generated have the same format as corresponding git-svn options

31678265
mtu	icmp

31679288
hex	binary
you can confirm this by looking at a hex dump of the file if your program mysteriously stops reading at 1a this is the problem
if you re reading a binary file you should open it with rb not r

31682396
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
thus we need to unwrap it to ensure these values are actually there 2 rootviewcontroller is defined as a uiviewcontroller - not the uinavigationcontroller subclass
we need to cast it to a uinavigationcontroller to be able to operate on it as one

31682476
mayavi	matplotlib
note that unlike matplotlib mayavi is not yet compatible with python3 and might not be in the foreseeable future so you ll need a python2 installation
matplotlib is not quite mature for 3d graphics mplot3d was intended to allow users to create simple 3d graphs with the same look-and-feel as matplotlib s 2d plots

31683311
ssl	https
just make sure the connection is over ssl layer
so not http but https

31683319
antialiasing	transparent
of course as pointed out by matt you could simply turn antialiasing off in which case these transparent half-pixels will all be rendered as if they are actually fully-within the rect
i suspect that in this particular case the rects you are filling are not integral i.e they might have origins heights that are by default rendered with slightly transparent pixels antialiasing

31684469
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval invokes its callback repeatedly until cancelled with clearinterval
if you want to repeatedly call a function you need setinterval not settimeout

31684469
setinterval	settimeout
if you want to repeatedly call a function you need setinterval not settimeout
settimeout invokes its callback once after a delay

31687264
division	modulo
however the division isn t really even
since you get a random number between 0 and 32767 doing just this modulo will result in numbers between 0 and 2767 occurring more often than numbers between 2768 and 9999

31689328
scheme	racket
i have no idea what you mean by different it is from scheme
racket has it s own language which is the default which is it s own incompatible dialect of scheme but it is not a reason for not using the software

31691711
vbo	vao
unless you like pain by far the best option is to not delete the vbo at that point
keep the name around and delete it at the same time as the vao s that uses it

31691948
ubuntu	linux
since you are in ubuntu this hack will work for you
i am not sure about the other linux distribution

31700952
firefox	safari
i originally had this problem in both firefox 39 and safari 9 but firefox mysteriously fixed itself with the latest update
safari however did not

31701852
ubuntu	linux
08 49 am jsloyer jeffs-macbook-pro-2 php cf push phpinfo-jbs2 -b ..... it looks like you re deploying on a stack currently set to lucid64 that s not supported by this buildpack. that could be because you re using a recent buildpack release on a deprecated stack. if you re using the buildpack installed by your cf admin please let your admin know you saw this error message. if you at one point specified a buildpack that s at git url please make sure you re pointed at a version that supports this stack. staging failed buildpack compilation step failed failed buildpackcompilefailed what this is saying is the instance of cloud foundry that you are running on the default stack is an old version of ubuntu
the php buildpack expects the newer version of linux

31704491
haskell	scheme
a straightforward translation of this code to the normally lazy haskell language goes like this
first a note this is not normal scheme as it requires lazy evaluation

31706709
google-chrome	firefox
this is not a real problem as in production it will always be run from a webserver during development your options are start google-chrome with access to local files chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files host a local webserver apacha wamp iis etc use firefox
the error message is more or less self-explanatory google-chrome doesn t support running unity webgl when it is run from a local file on disk because of google-chrome security

31707798
seaborn	matplotlib
the below code will take some sample data and try to make every entry equal to 118 stand out i m not a matplotlib seaborn expert but it appears to me that requiring an individual cell in the heatmap to be hatched would require a bit of work
in short the heatmap is a collection of matplotlib patch es and the hatching of a collection can only be set on the collection as a whole

31707800
multiplying	addition
it will multiplying 5 by 8 in 1 addition
note that in order to achieve the lowest the number of additions provided by this strategy multiplying larger number by smaller number is not necessarily the best idea

31711854
momentjs	datejs
momentjs does not currently have the functionality to interpret a string like that
datejs hasn t been updated in 8 years

31715146
spaces	delimiter
in this case we get the good thing about the above approach is that the strings in between the spaces can be any size - it doesn t have to be just two characters per string
use strsplit to split up the strings using the space character as a delimiter then use unique with the stable flag to ensure we remove duplicates and ensuring that the unique strings are in the same order

31715391
hex	binary
add that option blobs get dumped as hex the end
no it is not always reliable when you have binary blobs

31718284
sudo	passwd
then try again to change the passwd with something that seems strange is that sudo cat etc shadow will not show any user called ubuntu
you will find the default ubuntu user in var lib extrausers passwd and var lib extrausers shadow

31719724
subtract	addition
logically it is possibly to take an offset from an address by adding subtract but adding 2 addresses doesn t make sense because addresses of same variables may be different in each run of program
moreover the type and value of addition don t make any sense

31720033
postgresql	mysql
depending on which dbms postgresql mysql you will need different solutions
postgresql you ll need coalesce . the coalesce function returns the first of its arguments that is not null

31720622
scala	typesafe
to convince yourself just have a look at awesome scala and search reactive or follow typesafe webinars
i don t know node.js but i think you can write such a blocking function scala will not magically make synchronous code asynchronous but it will provide you all you need to write fully a asynchronous one futures promises actors streams ...

31724471
g++	gcc
note however that all this is highly non-portable and may be it s something it doesn t work in more complex cases even with g++ gcc
seems to work also mixing g++ and clang++ but it could be a coincidence for this simple case

31725892
stateless	stateful
in practice self-injection can only work for stateless and singleton in ejb 3.1 and not stateful since each lookup injection of a stateful bean creates a new instance which would result in infinite recusion
for stateful you can inject sessioncontext and use the getter methods to return a self-proxy rather than using injection

31726537
scikit-learn	liblinear
the r package liblinear is similar to scikit-learn s logistic regression when using liblinear solver
after some more reading i understand that scikit-learn implements a regularized logistic regression model whereas glm in r is not regularized

31729530
swift	objective-c
you say that you re instantiating your side bar like so i don t think that s what you re really doing because you re not setting the delegate you re both instantiating the sidebar as well as calling new which you shouldn t be doing from swift you re not returning a value etc
also that pattern of having a stored property that is instantiated by some computed property has a certain objective-c je ne sais quoi

31729885
dictionary	map
the problem is in the definition of the constructor of class dictionary
std map doesn t have a constructor that takes a single key-value pair so the easiest way to initialize with one pair is to use the universal initializer syntax

31731316
google-chrome	safari
its possible for safari ios - safari mac google-chrome android - safari mac windows more infos ios remote debugging
due to the webkit policies it s not possible to debug google-chrome on ios because google-chrome is relaying on the uiwebview

31732368
implements	extends
interfaces are simply maps that when implements require the class to have a set of public interfaces
interfaces exist not as a base on which classes can extends but as a map of required functions

31734640
innodb	myisam
first of all the default mysql engine innodb doesn t allow composite primary keys where one of the fields would be autoincrement
the engine that allows that is myisam so the first thing you need to do is to change the engine for the table

31735369
division	subtraction
to do mod 15 you need a division but atmega8 doesn t have that
you could do repeated subtraction or magic number multiply

31738011
prepare	execute
when the command button is clicked the result is to first insure the backing bean is updated with the results of the picklist then tell the backing bean to prepare streams for the user based on their selections in the pick list then update the controls in the dynamic dialog with an update then show the dialog box ready for the user to start streaming their content
the trick to it was to use balusc s order of events for the main commandbutton and then to add the bit to ensure it was execute first - because nothing happens correctly unless the picklist updated the backing bean first something that was not happening for me before i added it

31740996
addition	multiplication
if there is no addition you are finished
the leading and trailing operation of subterms that have to be evaluated always are additions because parenthesis around a multiplication does not alter the outcome

31741387
lodash	underscore.js
take note that there is a breaking change in this lodash version with _.first vs _.take
for anyone who isn t familiar with lodash - it s a fork of underscore.js that is nowadays imo a better solution

31742957
hive	hdfs
this will check whether the table sqoop.emp exists in hive or not. if the table in hive doesn t exist data from the hdfs location is moved to the hive table and everything goes well. in case if the table sqoop.emp already exists in hive an error is thrown failed execution error return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.ddltask
alreadyexistsexception message table emp already exists example sqoop import --connect jdbc mysql jclient.ambari.org sqoop --username hdfs -p --table employee --target-dir user hive sqoop employee --delete-target-dir --hive-import --hive-table sqoophive.emp --create-hive-table --fields-terminated-by --num-mappers 3 2 when create-hive-table is used without hive-import the schema of the swoop.employee in rdbms is fetched and using that a table is created under the default database in hive default.employee

31744509
stateless	stateful
to have the exact same functionality on dependency injection level it is impossible to map stateless ejb bean to a spring bean
ejb singleton - spring component or service or controller or repository ejb stateful - spring component scope prototype or service scope prototype or controller scope prototype or repository scope prototype ejb stateless - does not exist in spring

31744509
stateless	stateful
ejb singleton - spring component or service or controller or repository ejb stateful - spring component scope prototype or service scope prototype or controller scope prototype or repository scope prototype ejb stateless - does not exist in spring
stateless beans are very handy for this multiple persistence contexts.

31748461
google-chrome	firefox
i came up with a workaround for google-chrome
in javascript when you use window.alert method google-chrome brings according window to the front but this is not applicible for firefox and ie

31749337
http	spdy
apparently you are not the only one having this issue disabling http 2 spdy in http.sys and iis in windows 10 according to the error message this is a spdy issue so the certificate and the cipher suites are not the cause
spdy is a protocol allowing multiplexing https requests but it will be replaced by http 2

31749751
linefeed	delimiter
in the find what box hold alt and type 0010 ascii code for linefeed is 10 - you will not see anything but it s a new line character
in the replace box simply type a space character or any delimiter

31752783
swift	objective-c
the answer we found was for swift and for android .
did not try objective-c anymore

31760448
bower	npm
having devdependencies gives you the opportunity to simplify the steps that drive you from the source files a git clone of the project to the production ready app when you don t need to make changes and develop the application you could just run bower install --production or npm install --production they work the same bower install options -f --force-latest force latest version on conflict -p --production do not install project devdependencies -s --save save installed packages into the project s bower.json dependencies -d --save-dev save installed packages into the project s bower.json devdependencies -e --save-exact configure installed packages with an exact version rather than semver bower documentation npm install options by default npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies
with the --production flag or when the node_env environment variable is set to production npm will not install modules listed in devdependencies. npm documentation this way you take less time to ship the app and don t waste bandwidth downloading stuff you won t need

31763136
email	dkim
right now your email is being dkim signed with a google.com signature but the from header is an matheuscarino.com.br address
so the dkim signature cannot be used for dmarc authentication because the domains are not the same

31765030
swift	objective-c
there is no native kvo reflection like what you described built into swift
see and based on what we do know about how the swift compiler optimizes method execution at compile time vs the pure runtime implementation of objective-c it doesn t seem likely to be added anytime soon

31767350
boost	allocator
i don t use boost so i can t say authoritatively but it s possible that boost might already have a c++03-compatible implementation of std shared_ptr that you can use
most modern implementations of memory allocator are actually quite efficient and instantiating a new message object on the heap isn t as big deal as you think

31767737
punctuation	words
removes characters that aren t part of words like punctuation and numbers
split will break a string into words that are space-delimited

31769663
mp3	wav
the quality difference between 16- and 32-bit wav files is nearly never audible to the human ear on most sound equipment and depending on the quality of the original mp3 will take up more space anyway
also not all programs support 32-bit wav s

31769796
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
implement the following method in your uinavigationcontroller subclass now the uinavigationcontroller forwards the method call to its current visible uiviewcontroller so you need to implement shouldautorotate there individually to get your desired effect
try to subclass the uinavigationcontroller you are using because the default uinavigationcontroller is not forwarding the shouldautorotate method to you viewcontroller

31769988
octal	binary	octal	decimal
similarly 01100 is a single octal number equal to 576 decimal so that s why you re getting 11000 as the answer exactly the same as if you d done if you want to process a list of five binary digits that would be something like
for example is not a list of five binary digits it s a list of one decimal number 11000

31770435
swift	objective-c
so this compiles and works or with an inline closure this does exactly the same as the corresponding objective-c code it catches otherwise uncaught nsexception s. so this will be caught note - it does not catch any swift 2 errors from throw or swift runtime errors so this is not caught
as of swift 2 xcode 7 you can pass swift functions closures to parameters taking a c function pointer

31771359
ubuntu	debian
versions emacs gnu emacs 24.3.1 x86_64-pc-linux-gnu of 2014-06-06 on brownie modified by debian tmux 1.9 ubuntu 14.10
not an answer but worth noting that the described behaviour also occurs when running gnu emacs on tmux on ubuntu s terminal or xterm quick work around is to not run emacs in tmux

31773014
ienumerable	iqueryable
no include you correctly explain why include doesn t have any effect after you convert an ienumerable to an iqueryable
include extends an expression and an ienumerable doesn t have an expression and doesn t magically get one after converting it to iqueryable

31775713
super	self	super	implements
if you have multiple classes like this you can factor this functionality out into a mixin class class loggingmixin object def __setattr__ self name value super loggingmixin self .__setattr__ name value # put logging code here now when you want to create a new class that needs attribute logging simply inherit from loggingmixin along with any other base classes if necessary
this is relatively straightforward to implements class item object def __setattr__ self name value super item self .__setattr__ name value # put logging code here do not use vars for this

31777034
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see there is an issue that google-chrome and ie have with your code moving the scrollbar on an object with pointer-events none
works in firefox but doesn t work in either google-chrome or ie

31777805
client-side	server-side
you re trying to insert into the collection from the client-side
without the insecure package you have to first define what is allowed and what is not allowed server-side - to make sure that users don t just insert remove update whatever they want

31780660
setinterval	settimeout
calls postmessage i + 1 and then passes the return value into setinterval exactly the way foo bar calls bar and passes the return value into foo
instead you want to pass a function reference to setinterval you want to use settimeout not setinterval you want to vary the timeout because otherwise they ll all happen stacked on top of each other one second later something like would probably do it

31781697
super	implements
you can also extends the arraylist class and override all the methods that add elements to the arraylist and check if the element is instanceof the parent class and not an instanceof the child class in your implementation and call the super method for process of adding the element s
you can implements the list interface and provide your own implementation for the list.add int index e element method and check if the element is instanceof the parent class and not an instanceof the child class in your implementation

31784719
google-chrome	firefox
because firefox doesn t support class yet . i can t think of any reason other than a bug in google-chrome
support for class is very new to google-chrome it could easily be that the devtools just aren t quite handling it correctly yet

31787926
google-chrome	firefox
has info about why the notification constructor is not supported in google-chrome on android though it still is in desktop google-chrome
try the following that should work on android both in google-chrome and in firefox nightly but not firefox beta yet

31790269
client-side	server-side
so even if you could update a label server-side that s not going to do anything client-side
your client-side code needs to update the markup in the browser

31792893
build.gradle	gradlew
error cannot find symbol class means your build.gradle file doesn t contain a reference to the classes that your source code refers to
adding a library to the project structure will only affect the ide you re using and not the actual build script gradlew uses to actually compile your work

31793391
g++	gcc
now it can be verified with g++ version 4.7.2 compilation options -o2 that tail recursion is replaced by a loop
the similar issue is observed in pass-by-reference hinders gcc from tail call elimination note that printing is not enough to be sure that tco is performed for example with the optimization option -o3 the function tailcallfactorial is self inlined five times so tailcallfactorial 5 is executed as a single function call but the issue is revealed for larger argument values for example for tailcallfactorial 15

31795995
jms	jta
seems like the flip-side to the situation here - jms rollback you re wanting to avoid the transactional behavior -- send immediately unrelated to the mdb transaction
reading the javaee 7 connection.createsession docs it sounds like there s not a good way to create a session detached from the mdb s jta transaction

31796151
vsto	add-in
if you mean the old style vsto add-in then i am not sure
it kind of depends what you mean by office add-in

31798415
google-chrome	safari
i tested ipad google-chrome safari desktop and few other simulated devices within google-chrome dev-tools so just put everything inside it note you may also need to remove margins and or paddings of the #container div by forcing them to 0s values in order to not break your design specially if is built on top of a css framework
note 2 i think this is an ipad s safari bug that we may need to report

31799480
sudo	passwd
it is asking for the sudo passwd because you are using the -s option
it seems like you do not want to use sudo for this task so try running the command without -s

31800584
spaces	linefeed
in html the definition of which characters can be inter-element whitespace characters includes just u+0020 spaces tab u+000a linefeed u+000c form feed and u+000d cr
in other words html essentially considers the non-breaking spaces character to be text not a spaces character so putting it inside an option element makes that option element non-empty as far as the spec is concerned

31800739
uiview	subviews
one way to do that is to not put the views directly in the scroll view but rather put a container view actually just a simple uiview but we often call it a container because it does nothing but contains other view objects inside the scroll view and then add the labels to the container view
so if you had a scroll view with nine labels vertically laid out you would end up with a view hierarchy that looks like so to get this laid out correctly there are three sets of constraints to add layout the scroll view with respect to its superview in this case the view controller s root view next layout the content view with respect to scroll view s contentsize specify that the contentview should be the same width as the scroll view s superview view note although the contentview is subviews the scrollview this constraint is added to the scroll view s superview because this constraint refers to that superview s width

31801369
swift	objective-c
the author imarcelv notes in the description i asked a swift engineer at wwdc in a lab and even he didn t know how to fix this issue
steps to reproduce add a ramdom swift class to an objective-c project add the #import modulename-swift.h file that xcode generates automatically try to use it or just try to compile the project from time to time it simply doesn t work it s probably best to file a radar on this issue as it seems that others are already calling it out

31801392
strcpy	strdup
strcpy doesn t allocate space for your copy - it assumes you ve already done that
strdup allocates memory for you

31802121
implements	extends
when cti is not a solution i suggest to emulate the polymorphic association at the repository level create an abstract repository with a type attribute and implements a polymorphicjoin method that would automatically join the current query to the target table with the id type conditions
then extends the abstract repository with your subclasses repositories and call the polymorphicjoin method when needed in your find select methods

31802629
http	spdy
some of the features listed in its documentation http 2 and spdy support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket
connection pooling reduces request latency if spdy isn t available

31804954
mvp	presenter
edit see also demystifying mvp and eventbus in gwt link taken from comment section
there were a talk from ray ryan at the google i o 2009 best practices for architecting gwt app in gwt you do not use mvc you use mvp model - view - presenter which divides the parts much clearer

31804954
mvp	presenter
there were a talk from ray ryan at the google i o 2009 best practices for architecting gwt app in gwt you do not use mvc you use mvp model - view - presenter which divides the parts much clearer
you can use mvp for your widgets and your screen

31807293
serializable	deserialization
if your class implements the externalizable interface then you will have better control of how the object will be serializable
note that unlike serializable the externalizable interface is not a marker one and you will need to implement the readexternal and writeexternal methods where you can actually pick programmatically which class members to be serializable and how deserialization will be done

31809377
setinterval	settimeout
simple example of repeated calling of same function using setinterval js code live demo jsfiddle note keep in mind to clear the setinterval when not required as it may cause abnormal behaviour may slowdown the javascript engine
call setinterval instead of settimeout for recurring callback function execution after definite time interval delay

31810193
udp	tcp
tcp is a stream based protocol which means that there is no notation of application messages like in udp
thus you cannot really detect by tcp itself where an application message ends

31810565
implements	extends
after i changed to implements filter and implements all the proper methods my servlet filter started to work at 127.0.0.1 8090 helloworld
there are a number of examples out there that use a standard java servlet extends httpservlet but that apparently does not work with confluence

31810667
gruntjs	package.json
if a project was expecting a specific version of gruntjs installing globally would break this
there s a huge assumption that other developers or the target system will have gruntjs installed globally if you aren t adding as a dependency in package.json

31811559
ssl	https
also watch your usage of ssl
if you re using ssl for the site you re loading this on then this script won t load because it s coming over http not https

31811559
ssl	https
if you re using ssl for the site you re loading this on then this script won t load because it s coming over http not https
in general it s always better to use the https version of external resources as that should work whether your site is running on https or http

31813051
build.gradle	gradlew
in your project s build.gradle not your app s module make sure that its using android gradlew build tools of 1.2.0 or above
so in your file the dependency section should look something like this if you always want the lastest gradlew build tools change it to from op this dosnt solve my problem. i need to user plugin version com.android.tools.build gradlew 1.0.0 in my project so i have set it to this in my project build.gradle file

amd	umd
okay i ve figured out the issues that was preventing me from compiling the angularjs 2.0 quickstart into ecmascript 6 solution as basarat mentioned es6 does not support amd
i did try specifying compiler flag but that did not work either still got the error message error ts1204 cannot compile modules into commonjs amd system or umd when targeting es6 or higher

odoo	qweb
current implementation is the odoo pos using same technology as web framework qweb backbonejs and kinf of internal framework and work as same mechanism
using web framework for pos is not good idea with many reasons pos and web framework share same technologies qweb backbone underscore so technically their no difference in them

31821861
mongodb	bson
if it has been stored the same way in your mongodb document then the above is fine
if not and the values have been converted to actual date objects in bson then you must supply a bson date or something that converts as an argument

31823653
base	fractions
the integer and fractions parts both consist of a sequence of decimal base ten digits
either the integer part or the fractions part not both can be omitted

31827088
ssl	https
i m pretty sure the problem is because of the certificate not being trusted for the ssl client in development you can do this before beginning your connections but this is only for development don t do this in a production environment as it will make your code trust any and all certificates regardless
for production you ll need to trust any certificate you generate for the https endpoint

31827310
junit	mockito
junit will help much less if you use system.out
if you use junit to write a unit test you should not connect the real database you should use some mock framework such as mockito to mock an access object

31827653
noexcept	throw
whatever code that would have to have been generated to handle propagation of exceptions shouldn t become any more complicated by adding noexcept
it s worth noting that a compiler is permitted to omit unwinding the stack entirely if an exception is throw from a noexcept function

31827653
noexcept	throw
sidenote throw as well being deprecated in c++11 doesn t give the same guarantees as noexcept
if an exception is throw through a function declared throw the stack must be completely unwound up to the caller of that function

31828512
ssl	https
in gandi simple hosting ssl is done by a ssl offloader you do not need to handle it by yourself
the ssl offloader then redirects all incoming trafic http and https on the instance s 8080 port

31835523
n-gram	words
here some interesting lectures about n-gram modelling introduction to n-gram estimating n-gram probabilities this is a simple and short example of code 2-gram not optimized
what you want to build is a n-gram model which consist in computing the probability for each words to follow a sequence of n words

31836220
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the compatibility table link shows google-chrome firefox edge and safari are more compatible than babel now
google-chrome 49+ firefox 45+ may not benefit from babel

31837959
arraylist	treeset
for starters the contains and removeall operations on an arraylist are rather expensive operations linear for the former worst case quadratic for the latter so you might not want to use the arraylist for this
a hash- or treeset has better complexities for this being nearly constant hashing complexities are weird and logarithmic i think you could look into the sieve of sieve of eratosthenes if you want a more efficient sieve altogeter but that would be besides the point of your question about the 6k +-1 trick

31842377
spaces	delimiter
microsoft documents the format for command-line arguments or at least the format expected by vc++-written apps anyway parsing c++ command-line arguments microsoft c c++ startup code uses the following rules when interpreting arguments given on the operating system command line arguments are delimiter by white spaces which is either a spaces or a tab
the caret character is not recognized as an escape character or delimiter

31845025
hive	hdfs
the reason that hive cannot create external table on local file is because when hive processes data the actual processing happens on the hadoop cluster where your local file may not be accessible at all
you can upload the file to hdfs first using hdfs dfs -put and then create hive external table on top of that

31846127
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
i ve been experimenting on different linux platforms fedora 21 32-bit amazon linux release 2015.3 rpm-based 64-bit centos 7.1 64-bit and ubuntu 14.04 64-bit
even though one can build software with clang using libc++ libc++abi without dependency on libstdc++ and without gcc compiler present a typical linux installation is so tied to libgcc and libstdc++ that getting rid of these is not practical

31846127
libstdc++	libc++
x is a number you only need this if you are going to use libstdc++
this isn t needed if you only plan to use libc++

31847466
keystore	jks
as the keystore was not load with full certificate chain the experiment failed. so i tried to convert the pkcs#7 file in certificate chain by using following openssl command pkcs7 -print_certs -in outfile.p7b -out certificates.cer the output file looks exactly like yours started with subject dn and issuer dn and then header and footer
then i tried to store the certificates from the certificates.cer to a jks file keystore1.jks

31847466
keystore	jks
but again after import it is showing that the keystore has only one certificate
so the issuer dn and subject dn were not a problem. then i tried to convert the base64 file to der file and then tried to concat the data openssl x509 -in a.crt -outform der -out aa.crt openssl x509 -in b.crt -outform der -out bb.crt copy b aa.crt+bb.crt cc.crt then i tried to import the der concated file to jks

31848285
swift	objective-c
our assertions are kept the same please note that those two examples do not use ocmock instead they rely entirely on swift power
ocmock is a wonderful tool that we used in great dynamic language - objective-c

31849345
udp	tcp
for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum
in order to send all those extra packets to start and end a connection and the verficiation process for each single packet takes time - while udp is a stream of data which doesn t mind the loss of a few bytes here and there tcp is a reliable protocol - which in turn takes longer and is less efficient

31852117
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
seemingly since its introduction google-chrome has done opt-out for https it will cache it unless told not to
in 2011 firefox 4 but not safari switched to opt-out caching for https content

31852458
google-chrome	firefox
for backward compatibility ie still supports this model and google-chrome also has added support for this feature
but firefox is not supporting it

31852615
flask	django
flask uses a templating language called jinja2 which lets you write templates like this and render them out like this django has a similar function with its inbuilt templating system
if you are running on a cheap webhost you might not have the flexibility for running a full-blown web framework like django or flask which have a lot of dependencies and should be run in a wsgi server

31854116
build.gradle	gradlew
cordova android uses gradlew now if you are not using a gradlew compatible version try to update to the latest then you shouldn t write on cordova gradlew file you should create your own extending build.gradle if you need to customize build.gradle rather than edit directly you should create a sibling file named build-extras.gradle
this file will be included by the main build.gradle when present

31855975
udp	tcp
so i m going to assume you want to use udp
the tcp story is slightly different but not by much. udp packets have packet boundaries which get lost if you just dump them to a named pipe

31858715
weka	libsvm
as far as i can tell weka just has a wrapper class that runs libsvm anyways it even requires the libsvm.jar though i mainly based it off of this
please note that i ve used libsvm for matlab but not for java

31859242
dataframe	multi-index
first off multi-index doesn t copy well so i ll create a sample dataframe that is pretty similar
the simplest approach is likely to expand the denominator by 3 so that it will match the dimension of the full dataframe

31859242
dataframe	multi-index
the simplest approach is likely to expand the denominator by 3 so that it will match the dimension of the full dataframe
alternatively you could loop over the columns but then you have to re-combine them afterwards which may not be as easy as you d think in the case of a multi-index

31861903
implements	extends
you can build a custom matcher to only implements particular array methods for example that are available for your people class
of course you can always meta-hack it i like this approach a little better because you aren t confusing implementing against array versus extends array

31865272
prepare	execute
instead you should use parameterized or prepare statements for example using prepare statements will remove the need to escape for the database either the driver takes care of this or the parameter values are sent to the server in a way that doesn t need escaping you only need to take care of the normal java string escaping
as an added bonus you can get a reusable statement that you can execute multiple times with different values

31865646
elasticsearch	kibana
once in elasticsearch assuming it is inserted in a proper manner kibana will be able to read it
you do not need to use logstash to ingest the data into elasticsearch

31868132
octal	decimal
if the input string begins with 0 radix is eight octal or 10 decimal
exactly which radix is chosen is implementation-dependent. ecmascript 5 specifies that 10 decimal is used but not all browsers support this yet

31868945
super	implements
in java you can not have a class that is inherited from more than one super class
you better use interfaces because you can use more many implements interfaces. interfaces are objects similar to classes

31874894
clang	llvm
clang 3.6 doesn t support the c++11 keywords char16_t and char32_t in microsoft mode see the source
however good news 3.7 does and will be released in three weeks august 21 according to the llvm website

31877618
mvp	presenter
mvp is not better than mvvm they just fit in different ecosystems
presenter and viewmodel are as their names imply ui beasts

31877886
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
i can confirm that it works in firefox v38 and google-chrome v44 on osx
unfortunately it doesn t work proper in safari

31878716
implements	extends
if using built-in onehotencoder is not an option and you have only a single variable implements poor man s one-hot is more or less straightforward
first lets create an example data next we have to create a mapping from a value to the index and a simple encoding function finally we can apply it to the dataset it is relatively easy to extends above to handle multiple variables

31883337
multiplying	division
there are multiple issues with empty fields and the handling of 0 in values when using the divide and multiplying rules
this may cause division by 1 when you do not expect it

31885528
swift	objective-c
this is easily possible in objective-c by using but swift is less dynamically typed than objective-c and has less support for reflection
the objective-c way i described above is very prone to crashes at runtime if the input purple if you didn t have a function for purple doesn t match a function that exists

31886421
super	self
you d call it like any unbound method you d pass in self manually again parent.fieldname.fget self or bind it like a method then call parent.fieldname.fget.__get__ self last but not least you could use the super object to take care of the binding for you super child self .fieldname which finds the next object in the mro method resolution order of the class hierarchy that has a fieldname attribute and binds it just like the explicit example above
personally i prefer the super option

31889899
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
realloc doesn t care
we know that the memory block layout is different for malloc and calloc

31891715
udp	tcp
and you should start with sockets server-sockets then tcp udp is easy to decide based upon the requirement of the application
if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not

31891715
udp	tcp
if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not
so you could go with datagramsocket packet or normal socket based on whether you use udp tcp

31891901
express	node.js
express has little to do as well as you are not exposing a restful interface but connecting low level through a broker
a good solution in node.js is mosca

31893750
rsa	dsa
steps for deploying yii2 advanced app on a shared hosting note you need to have ssh access to the server if not contact your hosting provider generating a ssh key pair open terminal and type the following ssh-keygen -t dsa or ssh-keygen -t rsa the out put will be similar to generating public private dsa key pair
enter file in which to save the key .ssh id_dsa press enter key enter passphrase empty for no passphrase press enter key enter same passphrase again press enter key your identification has been saved in .ssh id_dsa your public key has been saved in .ssh id_dsa.pub the key fingerprint is or generating public private dsa key pair

31894201
octal	binary
if i understand you right and i really don t know if i do you want something like this and like i and others said in comments the numbers are not stored in hexadecimal decimal or octal only in binary bits ones and zeroes
hexadecimal decimal and octal are just for presentation to make input or output look nicer and more readable

31895448
super	self
you can test it using will output but interpreter incorrectly collects second parameter for super self
it assumes that call to super happens inside method scope and tries to get first parameter for the method using following c code many lines are omitted for clarity it s not possible to access from python but it contains locals+stack according to comment in code

31897180
interpolation	splines
the problem with these shape constrained splines are that they are fairly slow and do not necessarily interpolation all of the datapoints
schumaker splines i have released a package that implements the schumaker splines which is monotonic and convex concave if the data is monotonic and convex concave

31897180
interpolation	splines
it is fast and interpolation all data points
for an example you can see the second derivative is always positive this is not true for the normal monotonic splines

31899117
postgresql	mysql
to get the name of your heroku databases type the following into your console heroku postgresql and you should see an output like the following in this example your database_url would be heroku_postgresql_green_url to get the name of your current local database from your postgresql console type select current_database and you should get an output like current_database -------------------- db_development 1 row so now your command would be heroku postgresql push db_development heroku_postgresql_green_url
you cannot push a mysql to postgresql as snkashis said

31899117
postgresql	mysql
you cannot push a mysql to postgresql as snkashis said
but assuming you ve migrated your data to a postgres db there are two things you need to add to the heroku postgresql push command which is your local database name and your database on heroku

31899229
udp	tcp
in udp there is no such thing as a peer disconnect so zero means an empty datagram
as you describe a multi-threaded socket server it would seem to be tcp in which case your requirement doesn t make sense

31899618
swift	objective-c
download the project you will find 2 examples xcode projects one for swift 1 for objective-c
correction ibinspectable and ib_designable are not swift related

31903110
implements	extends
you can only create an instance of a class implements that interface and the class is required to implements the interface s methods
in this case you re not extends anything at all yourself

31904072
postgresql	mysql
your question is tagged mysql but your syntax is postgresql
one way you can do what you want in mysql or any other database is using not exists the first condition not exists says that there are no records on the previous day

31904505
dictionary	map
the reason for doing so is that if the person who developed the code for function later feels that the map returned by function should have its keys ordered as seen in real world dictionary then she may decide to use treemap an implementation of map in which keys are ordered instead of hashmap
when function is defined like public map function then all callers of function will remain unaware of this change and there will not be any change in their code

31905438
udp	tcp
if any of you spot the problem or can help me that would be great the problem of not all messages reaching their destination is normal it s because udp is unreliable
it isn t due to your code well due to the fact you re using udp instead of tcp

31906184
calloc	malloc
disorder can be expected if the pointer was not obtained from calloc
more different from malloc then just by clearing out the memory

31906962
jruby	mri
you appear to be using jruby not the standard ruby implementation ruby mri
the sqlite3 gem relies on ruby c extensions but unlike the standard implementation jruby does not support ruby c extensions jruby versions prior to 1.6 did not support ruby c extensions and even in 1.6 the support is still in development and considered experimental

31907040
google-chrome	firefox
i know you asked about google-chrome but i ll describe how it works in firefox hoping it might be of interest to you and other readers
google-chrome may work similarly i m not sure

31907040
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome may work similarly i m not sure
with your testcase the firefox memory usage does not continuously increase

31909222
super	implements
the patch to allow super instead appears to be scheduled for python 3.5 due in september 2015
one way to do this is by implements a new property on theorem using the node getter providing a new setter method and calling the node setter explicitly within it as far as i m aware this cannot be done with super

31910006
google-chrome	firefox
challenge issue 1 google-chrome was not supporting windows popup reason google-chrome no longer supports window.showmodaldialog breaking several enterprise apps such as owa eac sap and others
why 1 google decided to deprecate window.showmodaldialog in google-chrome 35 due to its related code complexity 2 google believe that showmodaldialog is a bad api that according to their measurements is not used extensively immediate solution the immediate solution is to switch to ie or firefox

for those willing to stay on google-chrome one way to temporary solve this problem is to enable this deprecated feature in enterprise policy settings which can be done only until april 30 2015 another approach another partial solution is using a showmodaldialog polyfill as explained in this post but some of the functionality is still not restored

31915460
swift	objective-c
usually the project_dir macro will not be available to swift code automatically in the bridging header add end edit if you are fine with readonly access to the files you can make xcode to copy the source files into the app s resource folder by adding a custom script or a copy files build phase like on the image then the path to the file will be
as adding source files to doesn t work and to have more flexibility i recommend to use a little tiny bit of objective-c

31915460
swift	objective-c
in the project s build settings add the following line and then if your project already has a bridging header the const will become available automatically from swift if the project doesn t have a bridging header then it s possible to make xcode to add one by adding a new objective-c class to the project and then xcode will ask about the bridging header
edit also of course bridging header can be added manually by adding a new header file to the project and then setting its path to the objective-c bridging header in project s build settings

31917139
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
2 an option from the standard jdk libraries is to use treeset note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

31919901
profiling	debugging
now regarding your opengl commands.you shouldn t bind vertex buffers directly but use vao and bind it to the context.in fact some driver version i experienced on nvidia produce no rendering results at all when vao is not used with core profiling
i can t debugging your code now but based on what i see here you forgot to enable second attribute array.see this example for reference. but even if i am wrong i would like to point you to some bad practices you have in your code.you are using gl 3.3 which is good.this is modern opengl baseline.but you are still mixing old api pre 3.3 with the new one.from the end in your fragment shader you should use custom output attribute rather than the glsl built in gl_fragcolor

31921021
equals	gethashcode
your equals of has a bug in that it should be but otherwise it says two test objects are the same if they have the same value string1 and string2 otherwise they are not
your gethashcode is consistent with that

31926601
implements	extends
microsoft believes that there are spec issues to work out before they add smil additionally this ie blog post from back when they implements svg in ie 9 explains their reasoning at the time for not including smil support ... support for smil animation of svg in the web development community is far from strong
the leader of the svg standardization effort wrote that not supporting smil in its current state is probably best since the svg wg intends to coordinate with the css wg to make some changes to animation and to extends filters. there s already work started to reconcile css3 animations and svg

31928256
pthreads	fork
also the api available in kernel space is not the same as user space api which extends the c standard library and pthreads functions
for example kernel modules and kernel code don t have so cannot call fopen or fprintf or fork

31929434
division	modulo
wilbur s answer is the best but if you still want to use division instead of modulo instead of checking if isinstance test int which checks if test is really an integer type which is not true for 9.0 you can try if test.is_integer which will return true if it s a float with an integer value which is true for 9.0
this is not an approach you can count on because division with floats is imprecise

31932206
namenode	hdfs
assuming namenode meta-data location storage name mkdir -p storage name chown -r hdfs hadoop storage name sudo -u hdfs hadoop namenode -format service hdfs-namenode start assuming cdh rpm installation is used
this varies with the installation method you used hadoop daemon will start as an hdfs user and if the metadata location permissions are not set to hadoop user and hadoop superuser group you get the error mentioned above

31933368
equals	compareto
for example - if firstname1 firstname3 then -1 negative integer first is smaller than second if firstname1 firstname2 then 1 positive integer first is bigger than second if firstname1 firstname2 then 0 zero both are equals now coming to your compareto method it should be like this -
first your compareto method doesn t look appropriate to me - public should be public

31934713
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in viewdidload is called the constraints are not applied on the view.the constraints are applied on the viewdidlayoutsubviews
but with my work i found that viewdidlayoutsubviews worked fine in the ios8 but not always for ios7 backwards. so my suggestion is that if your app is ios8 onwards use viewdidlayoutsubviews and if not what i d suggest to hide the view in viewdidload and unhide it in viewwillappear only after the constraints have been applied

31938418
udp	tcp
tcpserversink host serverip port 5000 the udp server side does not use the gdpay element it leaves the client side to use a caps on its udpsink see below in the client side differences
client side ip the udp client does not need any ip specified. while the tcp client side needs the server ip host parameter on tcpclientsrc video stream payload format like mentionned in the previous paragraph the tcp server side uses payloader gdppay while the client side uses a de-payloader to recognize the format and size of the frames

31938418
udp	tcp
client side ip the udp client does not need any ip specified. while the tcp client side needs the server ip host parameter on tcpclientsrc video stream payload format like mentionned in the previous paragraph the tcp server side uses payloader gdppay while the client side uses a de-payloader to recognize the format and size of the frames
instead the udp client has to explicitely specify it using a caps on its udpsrc element gst-launch-1.0 -v udpsrc port 5000 caps caps

jar	manifest.mf
if you open not run the jar file in the dist folder
open the manifest.mf file in meta-inf folder

31943614
udp	mtu
what is the largest safe udp packet size on the internet
if you don t know the mtu on the network in question according to the link below a 512-byte udp payload is considered reasonable to allow a margin for other header information that you may not have anticipated

31943746
profiling	debugging
i was having this issue because i was using an ad-hoc provisioning profiling for both debugging release modes which doesn t allow for a development profiling to be used when doing a debugging build
if you ve set the correct code signing certificate under build settings- code signing then make sure you are also using the correct provisioning profiling for debugging release mode as well

31944507
antialiasing	transparent
antialiasing is when the edges of the shape are semi-transparent
when you multiply the shapes the semi-transparent pixels become not transparent and you get ragged edges

31946708
build.gradle	gradlew
to specify a property for the jvm that will run the tests either edit the build.gradle file and add or instead add test.jvmargs system.getproperty test.jvmargs .split to the build.gradle file and modify your run configuration vm options to be something like
as it turns out intellij can only pass those jvm options to the jvm gradlew runs in and gradlew will not pass those to the tests

31947681
calloc	malloc
if you want to be sure about the availability of memory you can consider using calloc instead
malloc always returns non-null pointer that s not quite true

31950200
swift	objective-c
this means that in swift the variable modelviewmatrix is able to assume nil value while in objective-c it does not
let s remember that in objective-c a variable having a struct as type cannot be nil

31951425
http	spdy
you can configure the origin for the cdn your servers that provide the original version of the content to be distributed across the cdn to provide data using http
with the pro version which you are not currently using you can also use the spdy protocol

31952974
spaces	delimiter
according to the jquery documentation attribute contains word selector name value selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing a given word delimiter by spaces
the strings you are trying to match are not delimiter by spaces

31953204
notepad++	sublimetext
bow beginning of word bug in notepad++ note that currently in notepad++ v.6.8.8 the beginning of word does not work for some reason
a common solution that works with most engines use it in sublimetext and it will match does not work b w this regex matches all word characters irrespective of their position in the string

31959299
prng	random
a standardised conclusive binary result prng test has not been developed because it is not possible
first of all whatever output you deem to be not acceptable there is some non-zero possibility that a perfect random number generator could legitimately produce it

31959299
prng	random
once you nail down a reasonable subset of patterns somebody can immediately make a prng which passes everything deemed reasonable but is a catastrophic failure on the first characteristic excluded from your list
in short we know that all prngs should eventually fail a perfect test because they are deterministic machines and by their very definition not random

31960315
hex	binary
however if this is arbitrary binary data the result of encryption or compression then you shouldn t be converting it into a string in this way at all - you should use a hex or base64 conversion
yes that s because you re using the constructor that uses the platform default encoding to convert binary data to text

31960415
listview	gridview
listview give children all the height they want much like a scrollview does with it s child
gridview is not ready for this you need to force a certain height for it

31964273
sqoop	hadoop
sqoop doesn t need all the hadoop services to be running locally
it just need a hadoop client

31964928
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
as with any use of inline-functions within a class definition or functions explicitly declared inline the compiler is not obligated to actually inline the function
compilers are permitted to treat inlining as a hint and then to ignore that hint

31975630
http	spdy
if i turned off spdy support in the client browser it would work but i wanted to turn this off at the server side http.sys on windows 10 so that it wouldn t negotiate http 2 but would use the older more compatible http s
discovered two new registry settings for http.sys in hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset services http parameters enablehttp2tls reg_dword 0 enablehttp2cleartext reg_dword 0 adding these values and setting both to 0 in windows 10 resulted in http 2 spdy not being negotiated and my err_spdy_protocol_error problems went away without requiring browser configuration changes. i m not suggesting there is anything wrong with windows 10 http 2 the problems may be with certain browsers

31976094
super	implements
you can put in the base class abs and then the other two method would look like this def run self var super sub1 self .run var # sub1 run def run self var super sub2 self .run var # sub2 run super will call the code in the base class the interface
interfaces are not supposed to implements code but in python there are no real interfaces so it doesn t matter

31978604
opentype	woff
almost all the formats you list are versions of opentype modern truetype refers to an opentype font with truetype glyph outlines woff simply wrap sfnt structured fonts which these days is basically just opentype fonts allowing for optional per-table compression
modern postscript refers to an opentype font with a cff block which describes outlines using an embedded font format with type2 charstrings which aren t actually postscript

31984656
backgrounding	multitasking
it should work if you have turn on backgrounding modes you can do this in capabilities and select remote notifications
update in multitasking and networking you can get ebadf error if the app is suspended and socket is reclaimed read more about this here note when your app resumes execution the actual error returned by a socket s whose resources have been reclaimed is purposely not specified here to allow for future refinements

31985034
division	modulo
so as long you have a perfectly representatble floating point number there is a good possibility that the division modulo will go through smoothly
however when you try to divide or take modulo by 0.1 or 0.2 there is always a roundoff error in its floating point representation which means the division will not be complete and hence the result will not be true

build.gradle	gradlew
here s the relevant part of the build.gradle intellij idea picks up the folders under src integration if they have the standard names java resources
i ve done exactly this kind of separation in gradlew but for a pure java project not android

implements	extends
implements interfaces with no methods
what is not allowed custom getters and setters extends from a non realmobject override tostring on equals other custom non-static methods but they are working on it to be clear rtfm be aware that the getters and setters will be overridden by the generated proxy class used in the back by realmobjects so any custom logic you add to the getters setters will not actually be executed

selenium	appium
thanks to tikhomirovsergey for all their work and for why they were using selenium s platform in the first version 1.3 but then everything changed in the 1.4 where they decide to make their own capabilities with the future of appium in their mind this is to avoid the conflict of using mac platform to test on ios devices coz selenium provided only android and mac as platforms and though you want to test on ios devices which runs on ios and you have to set mac as platform which will be odd right now you can have firefox as platformname as well and appium is a seperate entity from selenium and they can t ask selenium to add a platform as ios for them.so they created their own capability i guess
well that s not used nowadays platform_name was used till appium java-client 1.7

super	extends
you ll probably want to pass it into the super s constructor
you re likely far better off not using inheritance to do whatever it is you re trying to do that is to not extends jbutton

sqoop	hadoop
i have included --direct option as well which indicates to sqoop that oraoop should be used
if --query argument is specified in place of --table parm oraoop connector is not used. following is mentioned in sqoop documentation data connector for oracle and hadoop accepts responsibility for those sqoop jobs with the following attributes oracle-related table-based - jobs where the table argument is used and the specified object is a table

boost	stl
pod boost hierarchy the nesting of boost in .. pods boost boost is required to allow the files in the library to refer to themselves as in #include boost date_time posix_time posix_time_config.hpp if you let the operation complete the boost library is well over 100 mb when zipped downloading dependencies installing boost 1.57.0 generating pods project integrating client project ...the while you do not see it in your project you will find it is in the source tree you can reference it #import boost date_time.hpp and start dealing with other pressing issues like locating which is another topic entirely
objective-c++ compilation in order to compile boost which is a c++ library you need to explicitly refer to it from c++ source files not c sources which are the default in .m or adopt alternative solutions listed in compiling a c++ class in xcode error during compilation stl vector
