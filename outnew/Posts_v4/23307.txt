dns	spf
the spf website includes a wizard to generate the dns information for your site
check your reverse dns to make sure the ip address of your mail server points to the domain name that you use for sending mail
make sure that the ip-address that you re using is not on a blacklist make sure that the reply-to address is a valid existing address

1269
cvs	svn

the subversion book has an appendix that details important differences from cvs which may help you make your decision
the two approaches are more or less the same idea but svn was specifically designed to fix long standing flaws in cvs so in theory at least svn will always be the better choice

1331
robocopy	xcopy

use robocopy robust file copy
you get note xcopy is now deprecated please use robocopy

1331
robocopy	xcopy
you get note xcopy is now deprecated please use robocopy
so start getting used to robocopy


1517
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs is very usable and looks pretty good
supports both traditional mac os style keyboard shortcuts command-o command-s and the control meta shortcuts for those raised on traditional emacs
it is definitely more mac-like than carbon emacs

1517
emacs	aquamacs
i can t speak to the extensiveness of the included elisp packages either
someone syncs carbon emacs with the upstream tree quarterly i think
aquamacs has a more irregular schedule but it s seen some pretty major updates over the last year

1517
emacs	atom-editor	emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs has a more irregular schedule but it s seen some pretty major updates over the last year
gnu emacs for osx can be found at emacsformacosx.com
in addition to the latest stable release there are also pre-release test builds and nightly builds and atom-editor feeds are provided for tracking all three release types

1718
phpunit	simpletest
the framework will run all the tests against your code and then report back success or failure of each test
phpunit is run from the linux command line by default though there are http interfaces available for it
simpletest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running imo

1718
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running imo
in combination with xdebug phpunit can give you automated statistics for code coverage which some people find very useful
some teams write hooks from their subversion repository so that unit tests are run automatically whenever you commit changes

1821
nunit	mstest
crazy good i guess
for the conservative types me nunit is still available and still more than capable
for the microsoft-types mstest is adequate but slow and clunky compared to nunit

2067
mvp	presenter
mvp designs have the presenter access the model and interact with the view
having said that asp.net mvc is by these definitions an mvp framework because the controller accesses the model to populate the view which is meant to have no logic just displays the variables provided by the controller
to perhaps get an idea of the asp.net mvc distinction from mvp check out this mix presentation by scott hanselman

2068
mvp	presenter

i blogged about this a while back quoting on todd snyder s excellent post on the difference between the two here are the key differences between the patterns mvp pattern view is more loosely coupled to the model
the presenter is responsible for binding the model to the view

2069
mvp	presenter

mvp model-view-presenter mvc model-view-controller both presentation patterns
they separate the dependencies between a model think domain objects your screen web page the view and how your ui is supposed to behave presenter controller they are fairly similar in concept folks initialize the presenter controller differently depending on taste

2312
vbscript	vb6

whatever your things are need to be written outside of vbscript
in vb6 you can write a custom collection class then you ll need to compile to an activex dll and register it on your webserver to access it

2562
wmv	flv
don t let me even start ranting about that pile of .
the only other alternative of flash that i would personally consider is silverlight which allows streaming wmv videos
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

2862
ubuntu	linux

i bounce about between mac windows and ubuntu and while emacs used to be my editor of choice i m finding that in my old age i prefer to something gui-based using command-line for the shell is still fine by me
my preferred editor is komodo edit which the advantages of being free as in beer available for mac windows and linux syntax highlighting for a boatload of languages including c++ and php i m using it for ruby python and php myself code completion even for classes i defined myself ability to remote save via ftp sftp or scp support for organizing your files into projects tabs and other interface niceties i m not sure how lightweight it is but it certainly feels snappier than eclipse

2905
vim	emacs	vim	emacs	vim	gedit
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
it is daunting at first as i m sure vim is too but the question was about text editors on linux besides vi.
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

3806
robocopy	xcopy

besides the already mentioned robocopy xxcopy has a free version
its syntax is backwards compatible with xcopy but has tons of additional options xxcopy help x create a 42kb file with all the options available

3869
perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
visual sourcesafe - i m not much in the microsoft world so i have no idea about this one other than people like to rag on it as they rag on everything from microsoft
sccs - for historical interest we mention this the great-grandaddy of many of the above rcs - and the grandaddy of many of the above my recommendation you re safest with either git svn or perforce since a lot of people use them they are cross platform have good guis you can buy books about them etc
dont consider cvs sccs rcs they are antique

3979
mbunit	nunit
nunit does have a litter bit better tool support though
i am using resharper to run mbunit tests
i ve had problems with testdriven.net running my setup methods for mbunit

4087
mvp	presenter

mvp the view is in charge
the view in most cases creates its presenter

4902
websphere	ibm
was 6.1 as installed with rational application developer 7 the documentation is very poor in this area and there is a dearth of practical examples
using the websphere application server was ant tasks to run as described here you need to run them from your server profile bin directory using the ws_ant.sh or ws_ant.bat commands
command . ws_ant.sh -buildfile ibm rationalsdp7.0 workspace mywebappdeploy applist.xml a deployment script notes you can only run this once

5108
ubuntu	debian

this article has some of the best ways to lock things down some highlights make sure no one can browse the directories make sure only root has write privileges to everything and only root has read privileges to certain config files run mod_security the article also takes some pointers from this book apache securiy o reilly press as far as distros i ve run debain and ubuntu but it just depends on how much you want to do
i ran debian with no x and just ssh d into it whenever i needed anything

5501
inherited	properties
they might as well be fields properties have other advantages over fields
they re a more explicit contract they re serialized they can be debugged later they re a nice place for extension through inherited
the clunkier syntax is an accidental complexity -- .net 3.5 for example overcomes this

6100
wadl	wsdl
restful web services do not not use wsdl because the service can t be described by it and the feeling is that rest is simpler and easier to understand
some people have proposed wadl as a way to describe rest services
languages like python ruby and php make it easier to work with rest

6671
junit	testng
the biggest advantage testng has is annotations.
which junit added in version 4 anyways


6713
junit	testng	junit	testng
i spent sometime considering which move was better and eventually we realized that testng has no killer features
it s nice and has some features junit 4 doesn t have but we don t need them
we didn t want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know testng because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests

6713
junit	testng
we didn t want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know testng because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests
also junit is pretty much the de-facto standard in the java world
there s no decent tool that doesn t support it from the box you can find a lot of help on the web and they added a lot of new features in the past year which shows it s alive

8309
vim	gedit

i agree with mike though i m a vim die-hard
i ve been using gedit quite frequently lately when i m doing lightweight ruby scripting

8381
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
i use it daily and it s great although not without it s share of bugs
for the rails side of things though i d actually suggest a virtual machine running linux. ubuntu works well the only caveat is that you have to install rubygems manually as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology - i suggest this because if you want to do advanced things such as installing imagemagick rmagick or memcached or a number of other plugins which require native c libraries it becomes very painful very quickly if you re on windows
a second reason is that unless you are very atypical your production server will likely be running linux too

8570
implements	extends
please don t extends interfaces
an interface is a clean contract that a class should implements and your usage of said classes must be restricted to what is in the core interface for this to work correctly
that is why you always declare the interface as the type instead of the actual class

9218
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
let the nice package maintainers from linux distros such as debian or ubuntu do the work for you
install from the distro s precompiled packages and staying current becomes a matter of issuing the occasional apt-get update apt-get -u dist-upgrade command or using whatever fancy gui tool ubuntu provides


10232
ant	maven
that being said if you re already using ant it can be a little tricky to transition over to maven
so if you re in that position i would recommend using the flexunit tasks available here ant task both of these libraries do basically the same thing they launch a generated flexunit test runner mxml application in a window and open a socket connection back to the build process using a junit test runner
amazingly enough it works pretty well

10536
lisp	scheme

nathan i ve upmodded the common lisp links because you asked about lisp especially with reference to emacs lisp
however common lisp is very different from scheme

10536
lisp	scheme
as you mentioned sicp is for learning scheme not lisp or at least not common lisp and not emacs lisp
there are some overlap in principles however you can t simply cut and paste code from sicp and expect it to run on any common lisp or emacs lisp system
-

10678
moq	typemock
when i needed to unit test a web forms app that wasn t designed for testability typemock saved my life
but when i take the time to pick an architectural pattern mvc or design one that allows for mockability you know public virtualize state changing methods i use moq
it is so simple to use and so simple to teach others

10956
accessor	properties
if the class isn t sealed you can create a harness for it by extending it and then exposing all your internals within the child class
alternatively you could use reflection yech or use mstest s accessor generators
you need to clone your object and then go through every single properties and variable that your object has and determine if it was copied correctly or cloned correctly

11170
nunit	mstest

stick to nunit
don t go anywhere near mstest

11170
nunit	mstest
don t go anywhere near mstest
nunit + resharper is an absolute joy to work with


11969
vmware	virtualbox
that being said you should probably try them out with the particular environment and apps you will be using and see which one is best for you
one feature of vmware i really like is the ability to snapshot the system
i do this before every software install and when one of them goes awry i just revert the virtualbox back to the pre-install state

12279
subtraction	multiplication

jeff doing a subtraction on datetime returns a timespan anyway
so you can just do datetime.utcnow - dt .totalseconds i m also surprised to see the constants multiplied-out by hand and then comments added with the multiplication in

12519
implements	extends

daniel keep in mind that just because something is possbile in iis and via any number of off box solutions like hardware load balancers and ssl doesn t mean that it is supported by sharepoint or that it is implements in the same way
you can do what you are asking for however you should do it via sharepoint central administration and create or extends a web application and then extends and existing application

12756
collabnet	svn

i ve followed the instructions given at the collabnet site they use the windows sc to create the service which runs svnserve
this has worked for me without any problems using svn 1.4 and 1.5

13251
implements	extends

the upcoming release of the framework design guidelines 2nd edition will have some guidance for implements extension methods but in general you should only define extension methods where they make semantic sense and are providing helper functionality relevant to every implementation
you also should avoid extends system.object as not all .net languages will be able to call the extension method as an extension

13942
imperative	declarative	imperative	declarative
another debate implied in this argument though is declarative programming vs
imperative
declarative is usually better for anything where you really don t need the fine-grained control over how something is done

14179
emacs	jedit

gnu emacs is my preferred text editor and it works well on windows copy paste actually works as expected it s also available on all major platforms so you can reuse your knowledge if you jump around oses like i tend to do
i really like jedit as well

14261
actionscript	mxml
it s more terse bindings are extemely easy to set up etc
however bindings in pure actionscript need not be that much of a pain
it will never be as simple as in mxml where a lot of things are done for you but it can be done with not too much effort

14412
junit	testng
testng s other big draw cards for me include test parameters data providers annotation transformers and more than anything - the vibrant and responsive user community
whilst on the surface one might not think all of testngs features above might not be needed once you start to understand the flexibility bring to your tests you ll wonder how you coped with junit
disclaimer - i ve not used junit 4.x at all so am unable to really comment on advances or new features there

14630
case-sensitive	case-insensitive

unfortunately subversion is case-sensitive
this is due to the fact that files from subversion can be checked out on both case-sensitive file systems nix and case-insensitive file systems windows mac

15928
mouse	keyboard
but by going an all javascript route you could be making it easier for one group of people users with co-ordination difficulties but making it difficult for others anyone with javascript turned off for some reason
you may want to look into adding some alternatives - mouse controlled hover menu for those comfortable with the mouse
keyboard based control via access keys and the like for others

16381
equals	gethashcode
then call the full slow equals method
then the two items are definitely not equals
all you want is a gethashcode algorithm that splits up your collection into roughly even groups - it shouldn t form the key as the hashtable or will need to use the hash to optimise retrieval

17233
client-side	server-side
yeah it s bloatware but you get a lot of functionality that wouldn t be much fun to re-invent sorting paging grouping column reordering inline editing templating server-side and client-side
the client-side apis are nice too


17579
accessor	properties
this has a purpose it allows other types to infer what methods and properties are available for an object following an interface
giving them protected internal accessor defeats the purpose of an interface
if you are adamant that you need to provide an access modifier for a method either leave it out of the interface or as you said use an abstract class

17942
client-side	server-side
compare this to many of the other languages and you can see why using server-side javascript to provide a plugin architecture is so enticing
a secondary popular solution one which can be seen through a project like jaxer is that a common problem of web applications that do client-side validation is that since javascript is easily bypassed in the browser validation has to be run once again on the server
a system like jaxer allows you to write some validation functionality that is reusable between both server and client

18521
mouse	keyboard

i used this in a program where i needed to simulate clicks and mouse movements
global mouse and keyboard library

20553
komodo	aptana

i ve tried komodo out a bit and i really like it so far
aptana an eclipse variant is also rather useful for a wide variety of things

20612
ssl	https
you really want your users to be focussed on entering complete and accurate credit card information and having a map on the same screen may be distracting
for the record though virtual earth certainly does fully support ssl
to enable it you simple need to change the script reference from http to https and append s 1 to the url becomes

20713
rss	feed
rss is not an official internet standards track protocol
however rss has enough adoption that you can reasonably expect it to be consumable by a variety of clients
as there are quite a few deprecated versions of rss you might conceivably have to support rss feed that vary quite a bit in their formatting details

20713
rss	feed
as there are quite a few deprecated versions of rss you might conceivably have to support rss feed that vary quite a bit in their formatting details
rss does not have a registered media content type
however enough publishers use the same unregistered content type that it is almost a defacto mime type

20795
vim	textmate
you can fetch it here
alternatively if you want to use vim on os x i ve heard good things about macvim
beyond those there are the obvious textedit textmate etc line of editors

21326
inline	inlining
any function can be declared inline and putting the function body in the class definition is one way of doing that
you could also have done however it s up to the compiler if it actually does inline the function
vc++ pretty much ignores your requests for inlining

21326
inline	inlining
vc++ pretty much ignores your requests for inlining
it will only inline a function if it thinks it s a good idea
recent versions of the compiler will also inline things that are in seperate .obj files and not declared inline from code in different .cpp files if you use link time code generation

21619
moq	nmock
this is much faster than storing the state of the database and resetting it after every test
i highly recommend moq as your mocking framework
i ve used rhino mocks and nmock

21619
moq	nmock
i ve used rhino mocks and nmock
moq was so simple and solved all the problems i had with the other frameworks


21668
emacs	aquamacs
in much the way that aquamacs makes an os x-friendly version of emacs the emacsw32 project makes emacs out-of-the-box work just like a windows text editor
mind you all of emacs power and complexity is there but if you don t already have muscle memory built up there s no reason not to use ctrl-c x v as copy cut paste instead of m-w c-k c-y just to be cool
emacsw32 also brings windows-compliant open save dialogs sane crlf file handling and quite a bit more

22219
cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
however one big difference between the java and python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case no circular references objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date
for example i can write sloppy non-portable code in cpython such as and the file descriptor for that file i opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed
of course if i run jython or ironpython or possibly pypy then the garbage collector won t necessarily run until much later

22765
onclick	onsubmit
so it s not an expected behaviour since it only occurs when you have just one textbox and you have the focus on the textbox
i m afraid you ve found a bug on the browser and you ll have to find a workaround or avoid using the onclick event in that case
i use the onsubmit event for validations because it s a safer event that is more likely to work on different browsers and situations

23048
mockito	jmock

i ve had good success using mockito
when i tried learning about jmock and easymock i found the learning curve to be a bit steep though maybe that s just me

23048
mockito	jmock
when i tried learning about jmock and easymock i found the learning curve to be a bit steep though maybe that s just me
i like mockito because of its simple and clean syntax that i was able to grasp pretty quickly
the minimal syntax is designed to support the common cases very well although the few times i needed to do something more complicated i found what i wanted was supported and easy to grasp

23335
lisp	smalltalk	erlang	lisp
also objective is smalltalk
in functional school we would have nearly functional some considered them to be impure lisp family and ml family and many purely functional haskell erlang etc
by the way there are many general languages such as perl python ruby

23997
des	aes
they can be m n m bit input n bit output. for example in the aes s-box the number of bits in input is equal to the number of bits in output
in des m 6 and n 4
the input is expanded from 32 to 48 bits in the first stages of des

24269
pascal	delphi
i spent six years in delphi and loved it to bits
the main strength for me of c# over object pascal is the syntax - it s much cleaner
there are some really great new features in c# 3 dotnet 3.5 - checkout linq

24308
inherited	properties
you can t really argue against those properties - there is no trade-off made and it is always a cleaner way to modulize things
other aspects of oop including inherited and polymorphism are important too but as others have alluded to those are commonly over used
ie sometimes people use inherited and or polymorphism because they can not because they should have

24707
jsf	tapestry
again though for your needs this may not matter and i ve always found the tapestry products pleasurable to work against
jsf has been out for years and still feels like something that a struts guy built to fix all of the problems of struts
without really understanding all of the problems with struts

24908
strdup	malloc
suppose you have a strdup function that duplicates a string and you call it like this you can see that the program works but you have allocated memory via malloc without freeing it up
you have lost your pointer to the first memory block when you called strdup the second time
this is no big deal for this small amount of memory but consider the case you have now used up 11 gig of memory possibly more depending on your memory manager and if you have not crashed your process is probably running pretty slowly

25105
freebsd	linux

noting the lack of bsds here i figured i d chip in the design and implementation of the freebsd operating system dead-tree book unix and bsd courses courses and videos freebsd architecture handbook online book i haven t taken any of the courses myself but i ve heard marshall kirk mckusick speak on other occasions and he is really good at what he does
and of course the bsd man pages which are an excellent resource as they are maintained to a far greater extent than your average linux man-page

26068
apache	lighttpd
you may not want to server all files using apache and use lighttpd lighty to server static files
apache can do this
multiple sites on same server virtual server hosting on apache

26315
vbscript	vb6
1 you can use com components developed in vb6 or the like to separate some of your business logic from your ui
2 you can create classes in vbscript
there is no concept of inheritance and other more advanced features are missing from the implementation but you can encapsulate logic in classes that helps reduce the spagehtti-ness of your app

26350
lisp	scheme
both provide a very simple and intuitive introduction to both scheme and functional programming that proves far simpler for new students or hobbyists than any of the typical volumes that rub off like a nonfiction rendition of war peace
once they ve moved beyond the schemer series sicp and on lisp are both fantastic choices


26682
profiling	instrumentation

my only experience profiling c++ code is with aqtime by automatedqa now smartbear software
it has several types of profilers built in performance memory windows handles exception tracing static analysis etc. and instrumentation the code to get the results

26942
swt	swing
combined with the free nsis installer you can build a nice package for your windows users
edit did not see that you use swt
don t know if it works with swt as well because i used only swing in my apps

27051
ubuntu	debian
however you must make locale files for en_nz
for ubuntu edit var lib locales supported.d local and add en_nz iso-8859-1 to the file
if your system is another distribution including debian the location will be different

27256
jquery	scriptaculous
to put some names out there prototype scriptaculous jquery dojo yui ...those all seem to have active users and contributers so they are probably worth reading up on to see if they meet your needs
jquery is good but with a little extra effort maybe you ll find that something else works better for you
good luck

27440
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
mysql is much more commonly provided by web hosts
postgresql is a much more mature product
there s this discussion addressing your better question apparently according to this web page mysql is fast when concurrent access levels are low and when there are many more reads than writes

27450
client-side	server-side

in that case yes the third line is the simplest you can get at client-side
in addition you can serve out additional server-side objects from the myserverobject instance if you include public accessors for them in iremoteserver interface so accessing those objects become the simple matter of method calls or property accesses on your main server object so you don t have to use activator for every single thing

27993
centos	linux

just happened across this article which point out shortcomings in redhat centos fedora implementations of perl which affect uri profoundly
if you are running one of these linux flavours you might want to recompile perl from original source not rpm source

27993
centos	linux
if you are running one of these linux flavours you might want to recompile perl from original source not rpm source
i realized that anyone running perl code with the distribution perl interpretter on redhat 5.2 centos 5.2 or fedora 9 is likely a victim
yes even if your code doesn t use the fancy bless overload idiom many cpan modules do

29568
mbunit	mstest
also lack of rowtest facilities in mstest
i suggest just running mbunit as a dependency inside the build process its easy enough to just float it with your bin and reference no installation required


29748
apache	lighttpd
what you do is that you start your django fastcgi server in a separate process and then configures apache via rewrites to call this process when needed
or you can serve django without using apache but with another server that supports fastcgi natively the documentation mentions that you can do this if you don t have any apache specific needs
i guess the reason must be to save memory. lighttpd this is the server that runs youtube

29770
vim	emacs

in the meantime i ve tried it two tools that have some sort of integration with vim
the first is rope a python refactoring library that comes with a vim and emacs plug-in

29900
bazaar	git

i d look at either mercurial or bazaar
i m told git also works on windows but i suspect the windows port is still a second class port at best

29923
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it
most of the people were reluctant to move over as they have to type in two commands to commit and push bazaar ci + bazaar push
also it was difficult for them to understand the concept of branches and merging no one uses branches or merges them in svn

29972
cruisecontrol	teamcity
teamcity makes it easy to setup the ci server part and nant build script makes it easy to do a number of tasks as far as report generation is concerned
here is an article i wrote about using ci with cruisecontrol.net it has a nant build script in the comments that can be re-used across projects continuous integration with cruisecontrol


30197
firefox	safari
here s the relevant documentation for gears workerpool api whatwg has a draft recommendation for worker threads web workers and there s also mozilla s dom worker threads update june 2009 current state of browser support for javascript threads firefox 3.5 has web workers
some demos of web workers if you want to see them in action simulated annealing try it link space invaders link at end of post moonbat javascript benchmark first link the gears plugin can also be installed in firefox
safari 4 and the webkit nightlies have worker threads javascript ray tracer chrome has gears baked in so it can do threads although it requires a confirmation prompt from the user and it uses a different api to web workers although it will work in any browser with the gears plugin installed google gears workerpool demo not a good example as it runs too fast to test in chrome and firefox although ie runs it slow enough to see it blocking interaction ie8 and ie9 can only do threads with the gears plugin installed

30243
emacs	textmate	emacs	gedit
easy to set up and really customizable i use it for just about everything
there s also a lot of talk about emacs plugins if you re already using that normally
gedit how to set up like textmate

31042
perforce	svn
i use perforce right now and for some reason i like svn better
perforce definitely gives me a better indication that there s going to be merge conflicts and even has built-in tools to help me resolve the merges
it has the same problem where if someone makes tons of changes over a long time the merge will be more difficult

31288
accessor	properties
cocoa s collection classes which all have mutable an immutable variants are nsarray ordered can contain an object multiple times nsdictionary unordered mapping from keys to values keys are copied nsset unordered can contain an object only once nscountedset unordered can contain an object multiple times the immutable variants help a lot with efficiency
the standard pattern for accessor of classes that have mutable variants is to copy rather than retain
this is codified in the properties mechanism by using the copy attribute on the properties this means that if you pass a mutable array to something that takes an array it will be copied and if you pass that to something else it will be copied again

31574
spaces	delimiter

note single quotes even no quotes if the value doesn t contain a spaces is valid according to the w3c html spec
quote by default sgml requires that all attribute values be delimiter using either double quotation marks ascii decimal 34 or single quotation marks ascii decimal 39 .

32219
accessor	properties
my problem with this is that adding more logic later requires that you add blanket logic that applies to all properties accessed with the getter setter or that you use if or switch statements to evaluate which properties you re accessing so that you can apply specific logic
i like your solution and i applaud you for it--i m just not satisfied with the limitations that php has when it comes to implicit accessor methods


32521
prng	random

there is a half-way house here which has some use which is to seed your prng with a constant
that allows you to generate random data which is repeatable

32775
gmail	hotmail
if hotmail server goes down gmail server wiil try to resend the message it will depend on server software configuration
if the process terminates ok then ok if not gmail server will notify you that he wasn t able to deliver the message


32865
inherited	properties
if your using a web site project no project file then start by checking that both your page and your control both set the classname properties in the first line of your aspx ascx file and that you specify the full name of the class including the namespace
example control language vb autoeventwireup false classname yourprojectname.yourusercontrol inherited yourprojectname.yourusercontrol codefile yourusercontrol.ascx.vb many times not setting all of these will still work but you will get odd compiler errors and behavior in vs
if you using a web site application project try deleting the designer file manually and then right click on your project and choose convert from web application. this will should recreate the designer file for you

equals	compareto
it s generally a bad choice when equals can be overridden because that breaks the symmetry property
option #2 allows the class to be safely extended without overriding equals or breaking symmetry
if your class is also comparable the equals and compareto methods should be consistent too

33010
equals	compareto
if your class is also comparable the equals and compareto methods should be consistent too
here s a template for the equals method in a comparable class


34338
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest also ships with a very simple html gui which is quite easy to extend if you want to
as far as i know phpunit does not include a html gui but there are gui s available to download such as cool


34645
inherited	properties
there are two kinds of limits soft limits are simply the currently enforced limits hard limits mark the maximum value which cannot be exceeded by setting a soft limit soft limits could be set by any user while hard limits are changeable only by root. limits are a properties of a process
they are inherited when a child process is created so system-wide limits should be set during the system initialization in init scripts and user limits should be set during user login for example by using pam_limits
there are often defaults set when the machine boots

35297
bazaar	git

i ve had the best luck with bazaar followed by mercurial
never could get git to work correctly

35492
haskell	scheme
my favorite general less academic online tutorials the haskell wikibook which contains all of the excellent yet another haskell tutorial
this tutorial helps with specifics of setting up a haskell distro and running example programs for example. learn you a haskell for great good in the spirit of why s poignant guide to ruby but more to the point
write yourself a scheme in 48 hours

35492
haskell	scheme
write yourself a scheme in 48 hours
get your hands dirty learning haskell with a real project
books on functional programming with haskell lambda calculus combinators more theoretical but in a very down to earth manner davie s introduction to functional programming systems using haskell laziness and program correctness thinking functionally bird s introduction to functional programming using haskell

35517
xsl-fo	xslt

as you are sure about needing to represent the presentational side of things it may be worth looking at the xsl-fo w3c recommendation
this is a full-blown page description language and the deeply unfashionable other half of the better-known xslt

35605
filesystems	ntfs
there is no unix and windows file systems
the nix family of filesystems include ext3 zfs ufs etc
windows primarily has had support for fat16 32 and their own filesystem ntfs

35627
filesystems	ntfs

i m not at all familiar with the inner workings of the unix filesystems as in how the bits and bytes are stored but really that part is interchangeable ext3 reiserfs etc
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

35710
client-side	server-side

you should do as much client-side processing as possible
this will enable your application to scale better than doing processing server-side

35770
xfce	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
it s also important to make the distinction between gnome libraries and gtk and likewise kde libraries and qt
if you write the code to use gtk or qt it should work fine for users of any desktop environment including less popular ones like xfce
if you use other gnome or kde-specific libraries to do non-widget-related tasks your app would be less portable between desktop environments

35967
apache	lighttpd
if you have spare physical resources and have the technical skills and experience to maintain production machines running different operating systems i d recommend going running lighttpd on either linux or freebsd
a light os install with a static file optimized server will perform faster than apache or iis on a heavy os
however unless you are extremely comfortable with these solutions just stick to iis on windows

36615
direct3d	gdi

i think you can still use all of the normal direct3d tools but you won t be able to render to a surface associated with the screen
you ll have to render to a dib or some such and blt it with gdi to a normal window hdc

37408
daemons	systemd
the use of a unix-domain socket means that the erlang daemons could be launchd on-demand by launchd and the cocoa front-end could find the path to the socket to use via an environment variable
that makes the rendezvous between the app and the daemons trivial and it also makes it straightforward to develop multiple front-ends or possibly a framework that wraps communication with the daemons
the mac os x launchd systemd is really cool this way

37410
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian

i am writing this on a centrino 1.5ghz 512mb ram running ubuntu
it s debian based and is the first linux distro i have tried that actually worked with my laptop on first install

37606
queue	fifo
some reasons why msmq doesn t work when you need to change the logic of the queue to not fifo but something like the oldest red message or the oldest blue message you can t do it
i know what people will say you can do it by having a red queue and a blue queue
it adds a point of failure and deployment nightmare the queue is a point of failure and you need to deal with setting the right permissions on all boxes to read write messages etc in enterprise software you pay in blood for these type of things

37660
postgresql	mysql
i use postgresql and my answer works correctly there i tried it
see the postgresql update docs under parameters expression where it mentions that expressions on the right hand side of set clauses explicitly use the old values of columns
i see that the corresponding mysql update docs contain the statement single-table update assignments are generally evaluated from left to right which implies the behaviour you describe

37724
postgresql	mysql
mysql select concat field1 field2 from table
postgresql select field1 || || field2 from table


37854
postgresql	mysql
if you trace microsoft sql server back to its roots i think you ll find ingres - one of the very first relational databases written in the 70s
and postgresql was originally written by some of the same people in the 80s as a successor to ingres
oracle goes way back and i m not sure where mysql came in

38350
ubuntu	linux
i d like a response from a linux user preferably developer who has experience with coming up with similar looking fonts
i really don t want to have to give ubuntu firefox users any sans-serif


39033
google-chrome	firefox
but the new internet explorer 8 beta 2 and the just announced google-chrome browser are heading in that direction so i suppose firefox will be heading there too
here is a post google-chrome process manager by john resig from mozilla and jquery fame on the subject


39034
implements	extends
the idea is that anyone can extends behavior without the need to know the behind the scenes stuff
a lot of frameworks rely on this behavioral pattern asp.net where you have to implements the hooks in a page or a user controls such as the generated page_load method which is called by the load event the template method calls the hooks behind the scenes
there are a lot more examples of this

39105
direct3d	directx
having said that opengl will be easier to start programming with
as direct3d is based heavily in com it has a steep learning curve
if it were me i would be choosing directx over opengl

39786
cvs	svn

both subversion and cvs call them keywords
have a look in the svn manual here scroll down to svn keywords or here for cvs

40699
google-chrome	firefox

google-chrome does support the netscape plugin api but that is for displaying certain kinds of content
you seem to be after a extention api really firefox is the only major browser to encourage and support third party extentions to browsing capability that aren t simply new toolbars nothing in the developer documentation points to a browser enhancing api - google seem to want to keep a tight reign on the look and feel of the application

41357
ienumerable	ilist
i imagine that for ilist implementations count simply reads the number of elements directly while any has to query the ienumerable.getenumerator method create an instance and call movenext at least once
edit matt i can only assume that the count extension method for ienumerable is doing something like this yes of course it does
this is what i meant

41932
google-chrome	firefox
see for example - v8 tracemonkey squirrelfish ie8 benchmarks .
needless to say google-chrome s v8 blows away all the current builds of the next-generation of javascript vms
just to be clear webkit and firefox engines haven t even hit beta but it looks like the performance bar has just been set to an astronomical height by the v8 team.

42047
metaphone	soundex
as noted soundex was developed in the 19th century for american names
metaphone will give you some results when checking the work of poor spellers who are sounding it out and spelling phonetically
edit distance is good at catching typos such as repeated letters transposed letters or hitting the wrong key

42912
google-chrome	firefox

google-chrome s approach is difficult to write and requires forethought from the developers
ie and firefox are both attempting to move to a process-per-tab model but due to backwards compatibility are not able to transition quickly

42912
google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox are both attempting to move to a process-per-tab model but due to backwards compatibility are not able to transition quickly
google-chrome being an entirely new browser build on a clean rendering engine webkit was easier to write in this way


43213
matlab	s-function	matlab	simulink	s-function	simulink
i don t think it can be done using existing simulink blocks
i think i am going to have to take the xpcserial c code that comes with matlab take the code that sets the rs-232 speed and wrap it in my own s-function


44289
cvs	svn	cvs	svn
merging and branching are very different and if you branch and merge frequently unless you have svn 1.5 running on your server have to know when you branched this isn t very clear in the tortoise svn dialogs
michael says the branching and merging is intuitive i would argue that after using cvs for 10 years it is not
if your are running the svn server on linux it may be hard to get your sa to move to svn 1.5 as the default install 1.4.x

44303
equals	compareto
compareto ends up calling a compareinfo method that does a comparison using the current culture
equals is called by the operator
if you consider overloads then things get different

44576
profiling	debugging

i choose to log deliberately as i go as this means the log data is meaningful depending on logging framework you can add level severity category information so that the log data can be filtered you can make sure that the right level of information is present not too much not too little you know when writing the code which the most important things are and can therefore ensure they are logged using some form of code injection profiling or tracing tool to generate logs would most likely generate verbose less useful logs that would be harder to dive into
they may be useful as a debugging aid however

45272
daemons	systemd
in that way the work which is being done does not block the acceptance of more requests
as you point out the term load balancing carries the implication of multiple servers - what you want to look for is information about how to write a linux network daemons
the two kes systemd calls you ll want to look at are called fork and exec

45421
ogre	irrlicht
recently irrlicht has acquired official .net bindings allowing users to develop in .net languages such as vb.net c# and boo
there is also ogre 3d and also axiom engine


46102
move	drag
all you then have to do is drag and drop the file from one folder to the where you want it
it ll ask you to add a commit message and it defaults it to move file folder remotely


46971
phpunit	simpletest
there is a command line test runner and web-based test runner and there is even an eclipse plugin to let you run unit tests from the ide itself
i found the zend to phpunit connection much harder to get working especially with the debugger
the way we use simpletest in-house is with a continuous integration script that we wrote ourselves

47735
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
different browsers implement this differently since it is not a common status code
alas unlike the opera and firefox developers the ie developers have never read the spec and even the latest most secure ie7 will redirect the post request from domain a to domain b without any warnings or confirmation dialogs
safari also acts in an interesting manner while it does not raise a confirmation dialog and performs the redirect it throws away the post data effectively changing 307 redirect into the more common 302

47909
udp	tcp	udp	tcp
also the tcp header contains a lot of overhead intended for different signals and message delivery detection
for a message exchange udp will probably suffice if a small chance of failure is acceptable
if receipt must be verified tcp is your best option

47929
udp	tcp
for more information i recommend the simple but very comprehensible skullbox explanation tcp vs
udp


48001
superclass	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
another wrinkle in subclassing naming is multiple-level hierarchies
... rather than blindly prepend the modifiers to the immediate superclass think about the name from the reader s perspective
use that superclass as the basis for the subclassing name. interface two styles of naming interfaces depend on how you are thinking of the interfaces

48074
profiling	debugging

unless you really need high performance on multiple embedded platforms don t change how you code for performance reasons until you profiling
code that s written awkwardly to optimize for performance is hard to debugging and hard to maintain

48074
profiling	debugging
code that s written awkwardly to optimize for performance is hard to debugging and hard to maintain
write a test case and profiling it on your target
once you know the actual cost of modulus then decide if the alternate solution is worth coding

48093
division	modulo
all the assembly language i have seen x86 68000 implement the modulo using a division
actually the division assembly operation returns the result of the division and the remaining in two different registers


48103
division	modulo	division	modulo	division	subtract
processors with multipliers have interesting division routines using the multiplier but you can get from division result to modulo with just another two steps multiply and subtract so it s still comparable
if the processor has a built in division routine you ll likely see it also provides the remainder
still there is a small branch of number theory devoted to modular arithmetic which requires study if you really want to understand how to optimize a modulo

49256
des	aes
it has been analyzed extensively and is now used worldwide as was the case with its predecessor the data encryption standard des .
so as a rule of thumb you are not supposed to use des or its variants because it is being phased out
as of now it is better to use aes

49290
implements	extends
here is a summary of what he says existing classes can be easily retrofitted to implements a new interface
all you need to do is implements the interface and add the required methods
existing classes cannot be retrofitted easily to extends a new abstract class

50220
mouse	keyboard

for the mouse you can use gpm
i m not sure off the top of my head for keyboard or joystick

50459
vb.net	vb6
but the array is still 0-indexed like c# or c++ instead of 1-indexed like vb6
that means that if you move to vb.net from a different language your array instincts are probably wrong no matter which language it is
in vb.net dim arr 3 3 as integer actually creates a 4x4 array

50846
google-chrome	safari

there are a number of known incompatibilities between tinymce and webkit the rendering engine used by google-chrome
if you re using tinymce 2.x you might want to try the safari plug-in to tinymce

51196
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable
you may want to consider just returning an iqueryable customer instead of an ilist customer from your data-access method
since iqueryable t inherits from ienumerable t the rest of your app should be able to deal with it quite well
you can also convert it to a list when you really need to

51240
lxml	beautifulsoup

i ll always use lxml for such tasks
you could use beautifulsoup as well

51410
awt	swing

1 awt made for horrid uis
swing improved on that but it was too late because.

52255
vb6	vba

i don t have a copy of vb6 to hand but i think you need the typename function.
i can see it in excel vba so it s probably in the same runtime

52565
boost	stl
really c++ templates are the enabling technology for stl and much of boost and c doesn t have them
i ve seen many c-interface libraries for things like image processing 3d graphics networking etc. but never a real general-purpose library like boost
you can find pieces though - threading libraries string libraries etc

53056
equals	gethashcode
if it isn t say all your arrays are equally long you can go with something cheap like looking at the first and last value and xoring their values and then add more complexity as you see fit for your data
a quick way to see how your hashfunction performs on your data is to add all the data to a hashtable and count the number of times the equals function gets called if it is too often you have more work to do on the function
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for trivia the worst performance i have ever seen was when someone by mistake returned a constant from gethashcode easy to spot with a debugger though especially if you do lots of lookups in your hashtable

53210
super	implements
fixed frame rates allow for consistent performance but will never reach max on all systems that s seems to be a show stopper for any serious game if you are writing a networked 3d game where performance matters i d have to say bite the bullet and implements variable frame rates
if it s a 2d puzzle game you probably can get away with a fixed frame rate maybe slightly parameterized for super slow computers and next years models


53937
lisp	scheme
in emacs lisp and common lisp you have the position function in scheme here s a tail recursive implementation from drscheme s doc but if you re using a list as a collection of slots to store structured data maybe you should have a look at defstruct or even some kind of lisp object system like clos
if you re learning lisp make sure you have a look at practical common lisp and or the little schemer
cheers

54046
datamapper	activerecord

sqlalchemy is more full-featured and powerful uses the datamapper pattern
django orm has a cleaner syntax and is easier to write for activerecord pattern

54968
prepare	execute

from the documentation a prepare statement is a server-side object that can be used to optimize performance
when the prepare statement is execute the specifie statement is parsed rewritten and planned

55578
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox users open a terminal.app on your mac you can find it in applications utilities and run the following sequence of commands replacing input.vhd with the name of the vhd file you re starting from and output.vdi with the name you want your final disk image to have applications q.app contents macos qemu-img convert -o raw -f vpc input.vhd temp.bin vboxmanage convertdd temp.bin output.vdi rm temp.bin mv output.vdi library virtualbox vdi vboxmanage modifyvdi output.vdi compact start virtualbox and create a new virtual machine select the new vdi file you ve just created as the boot hard disk vmware fusion users open a terminal.app on your mac you can find it in applications utilities and run the following commands replacing input.vhd and output.vmdk with the name of the vhd file you re working on and the name you want your resulting disk image to have applications q.app contents macos qemu-img convert -o vmdk -f vpc input.vhd output.vmdk mv output.vmdk documents virtual machines.localized this will probably take a while it takes around 30 minutes per disk image on my 2.4ghz core 2 duo macbook w 2gb ram
start vmware fusion and create a new virtual machine in the advanced disk options select use and existing disk and find the vmdk file you just created


55610
ubuntu	linux
particularly now that i ve started using git the implementation is cleaner on linux
currently i m dual booting and getting closer to running ubuntu full time
i m using gedit with various plugins for the development environment

55610
vim	textmate	vim	gedit	textmate	gedit
i m using gedit with various plugins for the development environment
and as of late 2010 i m making the push to use vim for development even over textmate on os x
a large amount of the rails developers are using gasp macs which has actually got me thinking in that direction

56902
implements	extends
your petbase abstract class may implements ipet pets have owners and idigestion pets eat or at least they should
however petbase will probably not implements imammal since not all pets are mammals and not all mammals are pets
you may add a mammalpetbase that extends petbase and add imammal

58276
super	implements
batch updates lazy materialization of collections etc might also be non-trivial to implements in jdbc
i say might be non-trivial because it of course can be done - and you might be a super hacker hibernate lets you fire your own sql queries also in case you need to
hope this helps you to decide

58363
memcached	apc
both are in-memory caching solutions with dead-simple apis and lots of libraries
the trouble with those 2 is you need to install them on your web server or another server if it s memcached
apc pros simple fast speeds up php execution also cons doesn t work for distributed systems each machine stores its cache locally memcached pros fast ish can be installed on a separate server for all web servers to use highly tested developed at livejournal used by all the big guys facebook yahoo mozilla cons slower than apc possible network latency slightly more configuration i wouldn t recommend writing your own there are plenty out there

58398
vmware	bootcamp
for me it runs vista vs2008 code rush just fine using bootcamp
i haven t run the vista partition in os x with vmware yet...i just haven t needed to with my work workflow
even so other vm images xp ubuntu etc run perfectly well with it

58785
robocopy	xcopy

robocopy robocopy or robust file copy is a command-line directory and or file replication command
robocopy functionally replaces xcopy with more options

59132
junit	testng

there s a standalone junit runner that has a ui but i recommend using one of the builtin test runners in the java ides eclipse netbeans and intellij all have good ones
they all support junit and most support testng as well

60119
cassini	iis

cassini does not support https
however you can use iis to do this if your using iis 5.1 download the ms iis toolpack for iis 6.0 it comes with a tool to create self signed ssl certificates

60400
vb.net	vb6
measures metrics for source code written in c++ c c# vb.net java delphi visual basic vb6 or html
includes method and function level metrics for c++ c c# vb.net java and delphi
saves metrics in checkpoints for comparison during software development projects

60496
prepare	execute
another benefit of using prepare statements is that if you execute the same statement many times in the same session it will only be parsed and compiled once giving you some speed gains
while you can still use prepare statements for the query parameters the structure of the dynamic query itself cannot be parametrized and certain query features cannot be parametrized
for these specific scenarios the best thing to do is use a whitelist filter that restricts the possible values

60815
postgresql	mysql
i know that postgresql sqlite mysql and oracle have the ability to order by a random function so you can use this in sqlalchemy from sqlalchemy.sql.expression import func select select.order_by func.random # for postgresql sqlite select.order_by func.rand # for mysql select.order_by dbms_random.value # for oracle next you need to limit the query by the number of records you need for example using .limit
bear in mind that at least in postgresql selecting random record has severe perfomance issues
here is good article about it

61127
lisp	scheme

ditto lisp
or scheme even if you don t ever use it it s handy

61138
lisp	scheme
in terms of memory management unlike everything else i ve listed it s not garbage collected though that s now an option on mac os x 10.5 but it does have a reference counting scheme which makes life significantly simpler than managing memory by hand
lisp - i ve never learnt it myself beyond what i needed for minor emacs hacking
as i understand it the libraries were nice in their day but though the language remains supremely elegant they ve fallen a little behind the times

61196
inherited	properties
in the following example we create a class pet and define some properties
we also override the .tostring method inherited from object
after this we create a dog class which extends pet and overrides the .tostring method again changing it s behavior polymorphism

62097
factors	mean
just because one tiny module does something slightly faster doesn t mean rewriting your app in another language is a good idea
there are many other factors to choosing a language besides speed
you benchmark of course

62494
profiling	debugging
possibility to run remote debugging sessions better compiler optimizations many bug fixes faster builds on multi-core multi-cpu systems improved ide user interface with many nice features improved macro support in the ide
dte allows access to more ide methods and variables updated mfc library in vs2008 service pack 1 support for openmp easy multithreading only in vs2008 pro. disadvantages of moving to visual studio 2008 the ide is a lot slower than vs6 intellisense still has performance issues replacing it with visualassistx can help side-by-side assemblies make app deployment much more problematic the local offline msdn library is extremely slow as mentioned here there s no profiling in the professional version in the spirit of joel s recent blog post i ve combined some of the other answers posted into a single answer and made this a community-owned post so i won t gain rep from it
i hope you don t mind

62684
getter	setter
depending on who s writing the code some people change the meaning of the getter setter methods
i ve seen variable initialization and other validation as part of getter methods
in order to test this sort of thing you d want unit tests covering that code explicitly

62848
g++	gcc
but i m pretty sure g++ v4 is the standard development c++ compiler if you install the c++ development environment at all
g++ v3 is usually just available as a special install
for opensuse 11 gcc 4.3 is the current package installed when you pick the base development pattern

63187
try-catch	exception-handling

if you are iterating through any kind of a result set and performing operations on said results for e.g within a for each and if one particular result caused a problem its rather useful in capturing an expected error via try-catch logging it and moving on to the next result via continue
continue is especially useful imo for unattended services that do jobs at odd hours and one exception-handling shouldn t affect the other x number of records

63951
wordpress	joomla

well you could do this - have a wordpress installation
get the users to post there and then use the rss feed from it or the xml rpc blogging api to update the joomla installation

64371
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
for synthesized accessor just do this this tells the compiler to synthesize the foo properties using the_foo ivar
if you write your own accessor then you just use the underbar ivar in your implementation and keep the non-underbar method name


64604
boost	stl
there is also boost while not a gui library boost is a really great complement to c++ s stl
in fact some of the boost libraires will be added in the next c++ standard


65415
implements	extends
javascript uses prototype-based object orientation and provides the ability to extends types at runtime an object delegates all access to attributes that it doesn t contain itself to its prototype another object
this can be used to implements inheritance but is actually more powerful even if more cumbersome


65472
perforce	cvs
the caveat is that they re fairly new technology and not many people will be familiar with their use
if you want to stick to the older centralized model i d recommend perforce if you can afford it or subversion if you don t want to pay for perforce
i d recommend subversion over cvs because it s got enough features to make it worthwhile but is similar enough that devs who already know cvs will still be comfortable

65562
perforce	svn

having worked at a few companies with 1000+ workers i ve found that by-and-large they all use perforce
svn

65582
firefox	safari

yui uses three tests to do this for firefox and recent webkit there s a domcontentloaded event that is fired
for older safari the document.readystate watched until it becomes loaded or complete

65880
vim	textmate
for client side testing documentation and development i use a macbook pro as the os platform and textmate with the erlang bundle as an editor
for sever side development and deployment we use rhel 4.x 5.x in production and for editing i use vim
personally i ve got 4 machines slices on slicehost.com running debian using erlang for a few websites and jobs

66678
decimal	ieee
floats were according to ieee 754 always binary only the new standard ieee 754r defined decimal formats
many of the fractional binary parts can never equal the exact decimal representation
any binary number can be written as m 2 n m n positive integers any decimal number as

67626
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
and it s slow as hell in firefox
works better with opera and google-chrome though. ff3 windows xp ati


67878
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

your example works as expected in google-chrome safari windows and ie8
the text breaks out of the 150px box in firefox 3 and opera 9.5

68674
ubuntu	linux

i wrote a blog post about ubuntu a month or so ago
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

68678
margin	text-align
ie uses text-align center property to center text
firefox uses margin 0 auto and it has to be declared on the element you are trying to center


69040
actionscript	mxml
mxmlc an actionscript and mxml compiler to output the final swf file for deployment to flash player. 2
compc a static library compiler for actionscript that outputs swc files. 3
asdoc a documentation generator built on the compiler technology

70042
bazaar	git
and give me the flexibility i need see my article on git + visual studio
i think bazaar can do similar things and might be better at one thing it can easily support non-distributed central-repository based development


70048
jsf	seam
it is not ideal but works well enough with seam as described in pete muir s backing trinidad s datatable with seam blog post
if you don t find a jsf component you like you ll need to write your own logic to set parameters for limit and offset in your ejb-ql jpa queries


70423
quicksort	heapsort

quicksort is the fastest sorting algorithm in practice but has a number of pathological cases that can make it perform as badly as o n2
heapsort is guaranteed to run in o n ln n and requires only finite additional storage

quicksort	mergesort

wikipedia s explanation is typically quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other θ nlogn algorithms because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures and in most real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the probability of requiring quadratic time
quicksort mergesort i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is ω n that quicksort implementations don t have

equals	gethashcode

using the + operator might be better than using because although you explicitly want aa bb and bb aa to explicitly be the same you may not want aa aa and bb bb to be the same or all equals pairs for that matter
the as fast as possible rule is not entirely adhered to in this solution because in the case of nulls this performs a gethashcode on the empty string rather than immediately return a known constant but even without explicitly measuring i am willing to hazard a guess that the difference wouldn t be big enough to worry about unless you expect a lot of nulls

70741
subtract	addition
in the first loop you can use plain addition since you are only ever oring with single bits and you can narrow the scope of by iterating over indices
in the second loop you can subtract 1 from the index instead of producing an unnecessary 0th output list element that needs to be shift ed off and where you unnecessarily iterate m n times where m is the number of output lists and n is the number of unique elements iterating over the unique elements would reduce the iterations to just n which is a significant win in typical use cases where m is much larger than n and would simplify the code
note also that once thought of in this way the result gathering process can be written very concisely with the aid of the list part module but note that list_compare is a terrible name

71552
daemons	systemd
gdi+ text rendering performance article on his blog which answers the raw speed question on his systemd gdi drawtext was about 6 times faster than gdi+ drawstring
if you need to be a real speed daemons textout is faster than drawtext but you ll have to take care of clipping and word-wrapping yourself
exttextout supports clipping

71642
textmate	notepad++	textmate	jedit
other editors in the past i did take a look at notepad++ but that was a while ago and it didn t have a nice way to define your own syntax highlighting which is important for me
i also paid for textmate and ultraedit at different times both very good but in the end jedit comes out on top for me
i also used eclipse for a year or so

72853
innodb	myisam
use a different database engine if possible
importing into a heavily transactional engine like innodb is awfully slow
inserting into a non-transactional engine like myisam is much much faster

73763
serializable	deserialization
when you also want to be able to serialize your object you need to make sure that deserialization won t create a copy
the method readresolve will make sure the only instance will be returned even when the object was serializable in a previous run of your program


75395
debian	linux
i can t tell what kind of operating system you re on but it looks like linux
if it s debian you should be able to use apt-get to install the libc6-dev package
that will contain the headers you need to compile this module

76012
lisp	scheme
i believe scheme has the same facility but i m not as familiar with it -- see the scheme sources for the arc programming language
as a simple example let s suppose you want lisp to use curly braces rather than parentheses
this requires something like the following reader definitions you re telling lisp that the is like a and that the is like a

76040
xna	slimdx
i m personally using it for my hobby game projects and it has treated me very well
xna isn t the only alternative though
there is also slimdx which is under constant development as a means of providing a lean wrapper of directx in a similar fashion as managed directx which was i believe discontinued by microsoft in favor of xna

76789
innodb	myisam
you need to benchmark your own application myisam vs innodb
using the innodb transactional engine exclusively gives other benefits too
in my testing innodb will use up typically about 150 more disc space than myisam- this is because of its block structure and lack of index compression

76789
innodb	myisam
in my testing innodb will use up typically about 150 more disc space than myisam- this is because of its block structure and lack of index compression
if you can afford it just use innodb instead
as far as answering your actual question goes if you partition your table into multiple myisam tables the amount of repair needed in a crash will be much less

77098
apache	nginx

if you have access to your apache install and trust third-party code you can use the apache upload progress module if you use apache
there s also a nginx upload progress module

77188
factors	matrix
i m pretty certain the absolute size will not be found so only the ratio w h is releavant so this is one unknown
relative to this plane the camera must be at some point cx cy cz in space must be pointing in a direction nx ny nz a vector of length one so one of these is redundant and have a focal_length image_width factors of w
these numbers turn into a 3x3 projection matrix

77625
innodb	myisam
i found that the table-level locking in myisam caused serious performance problems for our workload which sounds similar to yours
unfortunately i also found that performance under innodb was also worse than i d hoped
in the end i resolved the contention issue by fragmenting the data such that inserts went into a hot table and selects never queried the hot table

77693
cakephp	kohana
profiling features comparable to other languages so imho you shouldn t worry about this things use python and django and live happily - lucky for you newest version of django runs on jython so you don t need to leave your whole java ecosystem behind
speaking of frameworks i evaluated this year pylons python webpy python symfony php cakephp php none of this frameworks comes close to the power of django or ruby on rails
based on my collegue opinion i could recommend you kohana framework

77727
cvs	svn
in a previous life i built a great deal of automation around svn
before that i have experience with gnu arch bitkeeper cvs and others
git was quite off-putting at first -- it felt like gnu arch inasmuch as being a concept-heavy environment as opposed to toolkits built to conform to the user s choice of workflows -- but i ve since come to be quite comfortable with it

77777
rss	feed

i wouldn t use xml for storing rss items
a feed reader makes constant updates as it receives data

77794
bazaar	git

mercurial and bazaar resemble themselves very much on the surface
they both provide basic distributed version control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git

77794
bazaar	git
git well is not for the uninitiated
it is much faster than both mercurial and bazaar and was written to manage the linux kernel
it is the fastest of the three and it is also the most powerful of the three by quite a margin

77943
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
git is fastest but all three are fast enough
bazaar is the most flexible it has transparent read-write support for svn repositories and cares a lot about the user experience
mercurial is somewhere in the middle

77945
quicksort	mergesort
with o n 2 worst case that rarely happens quicksort is potentially far slower than the o nlogn of the merge sort
quicksort has less overhead so with small n and slow computers it is better
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases

78569
atoi	strtod	atoi	atof	atof	strtod

atoi and atof will convert the number even if there are trailing non numerical characters
however if you use strtol and strtod it will not only skip leading white space and an optional sign but leave you with a pointer to the first character not in the number

78627
strtol	atoi	strtol	strtod	strtol	atof
atoi and atof convert the initial part of the string but don t tell you whether or not they used all of the string
strtol strtod tell you whether there was extra junk after the characters converted
so in both cases remember to pass in a non-null tail parameter and check that it points to the end of the string that is tail 0

78920
xslt	xquery

advantages of xslt domain-specific to xml so for example no need to quote literal xml in the output
supports xpath xquery which can be a nice way to query doms in the same way that regular expressions can be a nice way to query strings

79488
jquery	scriptaculous

stack overflow uses jquery if that matters
scriptaculous tries pretty hard to do everything that you can do in flash

79771
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
for example 0.72 is represented as the integer 72
addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as 0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiply followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

80281
fixed-point	fractions
i didn t wind up using his union representation for fixed-point numbers though
i mostly have experience with fixed-point in c so i haven t had the option to use a class either
for the most part though i think that defining your number of fractions bits in a macro and using descriptive variable names makes this fairly easy to work with

80597
nsis	uninstaller
this is fine for internal distribution inside a company
use launch4j and an installer like nsis
this gives you a lot more control although the user can still do stupid stuff like uninstaller the java runtime

81537
decoder	encoder
the first step before anything will be to get the ffmpeg decoder to support he-aac
currently it can only be decoder through faad
i don t believe there is any he-aac encoder on any platform with a more permissive license than nero s at this point in time

81544
profiling	debugging
the only reasons you might want flexbuilder are flex charts step-through debugging
profiling i haven t used it visual style editor however the code-completion and general bloody-awesomeness of flashdevelop s code-completion and syntax highlighting knocks the gimpy eclipse crap out of the water
so pretty much what todd said except for the code-completion part

82230
vb.net	vb6
you can use overloading just repeat the declarations for each different data type you wish to pass
vb.net picks out the one that matches the argument you pass in your call
this is better than as any was in vb6 because the compiler can still do type-checking

84547
imperative	declarative
however imperative languages are much more intuitive for many people and we are deeply entrenched in imperative legacy code
the fundamental issue is that pure functional languages express side-effects explicitly while side effects are expressed implicitly in imperative languages by the order of statements
i believe that techniques to declarative express side effects in an object oriented framework will allow compilers to decompose imperative statements into their functional relationships

85192
serializable	deserialization

arguments in rmi calls a serializable
deserialization on the server creates a copy of the lists

85803
postgresql	mysql

we did a move from a mysql3 to postgresql 8.2 then 8.3
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok

85846
ssl	https

use to tell if it is ssl and redirect to the right place if not
and remember the page that displays the form does not need to be fed via https it s the post back url that needs it most

86881
equals	gethashcode	equals	gethashcode
when two object are the same the equals method returns true they must have the same value returned from gethashcode
when two objects have the same hash value they can be the same object equals returns true or be different objects equals returns false
there are no other guarantees on the result of gethashcode

87099
client-side	server-side
if your application is using eval to create an object from some json which has come back from an xmlhttprequest to your own site created by your trusted server-side code it s probably not a problem
untrusted client-side javascript code can t do that much anyway
provided the thing you re executing eval on has come from a reasonable source you re fine

88632
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
from that point i consider the market share and try to ensure a reasonable support level for all other browsers
for example even .net developers occasionally use firefox maybe even opera
safari and google-chrome are possibilities too now

89307
inherited	properties

something i have done before has been to create a custom page class actually i do this part on every project that each asp.net page inherited
this page class contains an isadmin properties

89311
debian	linux

i have no issues with debian on a 64 bit platform
the only issues i ve had with 64 bit linux environments is related to things like the flash plugin for firefox

89311
debian	linux
the only issues i ve had with 64 bit linux environments is related to things like the flash plugin for firefox
edit i used debian on a server and a laptop
the firefox problem was only on the laptop

89677
udp	tcp

if you re connecting to a named instance and udp is not available when connecting to it then you may need to specify the protocol as well
example tcp 192.168.1.21 sql2k5 1443

89714
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
ones that are definitely not dead are ie6 starting to push it ie7 ie8 latest opera 9.x latest firefox 3.x latest safari 3.x and others that have about the same capabilities
firefox 2.x isn t dead either and is needed for win9x users if they don t want to use opera


89848
profiling	benchmarking

which just goes to show if you don t know how to do proper code profiling don t be doing this stuff
the speed difference of these two methods are within the same big o speed as proven by leon timmermans opcode analyisis - the benchmarking are just going to show differences based on other local conditions not necessarily your code

90062
umbraco	dotnetnuke

umbraco gets my vote as a good cms that comes close to joomla in maturity and out of the box functionality
i m not that fond of dotnetnuke but it s been at least a year since i ran it thru its paces

90068
inherited	subclassing
this makes sure that other classes that want to use the class that implements the iterator interface that it will indeed have methods that iterators should have such as hasnext
also it should be noted that since java does not have multiple inherited the use of interface can be used to emulate that feature
by implementing multiple interfaces one can have a class that is a subclassing to inherit some features yet also inherit the features of another by implementing an interface

90213
multiplying	modulo

easy one is to just choose two big relative primes a and b then keep multiplying your random number by a and adding b
use the modulo to keep the low bits as your random number and keep the full value for the next iteration

90655
superclass	subclassing
the folder structure of your class must match the package name
in java to refer to the superclass you use the reserved word super instead of base gotcha #7 - chaining constructors to a base constructor you don t have this in java
to subclassing a class in java do this that means class a is a subclassing of class b

91937
pascal	delphi

you could also try free pascal
it is a free l gpl object pascal compiler which is compatible with the delphi -compiler

91993
boost	allocator
you may see a factor 10 speed-boost just plugging a simple pool allocator into the dictionary template
afaik boost has a component that can be directly used
another option if you know only 64.000 entries in your integers exist you can write those to a file and create a perfect hash function for it

93459
rss	feed
if you are trying to generate your rss feed for others to consume you will need to read the spec if you are trying to consume it that link will also help
then you ll need to look into an xml rss parser
if you can provide more details i can update my answer

93673
n-gram	words	n-gram	words
in practice i m guessing you re analyzing a document of actual natural language english words and you actually want to do something with the data you collect
in this case you might just want to do a quick n-gram analysis for some small n such as just n 2 or 3
for example you could tokenize your document into a list of words by stripping out punctuation capitalization and stemming words running runs both - run to increase semantic matches

93696
rsa	aes
as i said above the key bit of knowledge is that the cert doesn t matter so long as it s generated with an algorithm that supports aes 256-bit encryption rsa
just to make sure that we re on the same page for my testing i generated my self-signed cert using the following keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg rsa now you have to make sure that your java implementation on your server supports aes-256 and this is the tricky bit
i did my testing on an os x os 10.5 box and when i checked to see the list of ciphers that it supported by default aes-256 was not on the list which is why using that cert i generated above only was creating an aes-128 connection between my browser and tomcat

93822
move	drag
drag or momentum can just be encoded as a basic resistance to motion and amount to throttling the movements
it can be applied differentially things can move slower based on how far they ve gone where they are in space how many other nodes are close etc.
hope this helps

94419
inherited	subclassing
a method in a subclassing that used to override the superclass method will no longer do so due the changed method signature
this can sometimes cause strange and unexpected behavior especially when dealing with complex inherited structures
the override annotation safeguards against this

94447
superclass	subclassing
suppose this method is changed in the parent class to this change will not cause any compile time errors or warnings - but it completely changes the intended behavior of the subclassing
to answer your question you should use the override annotation if the lack of a method with the same signature in a superclass is indicative of a bug


95522
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing

you could make an annotation enforceauthor with inherited on the superclass and use compiler annotations since java 1.6 to catch up at compile time
then you have a reference to the subclassing and can check if another annotation author is missing

95573
try-catch	exception-handling
you should find the correct place to handle the exception-handling actually do something like catch-and-not-rethrow and then log it
you can and should include the entire stack trace of course but following your suggestion would litter the code with try-catch blocks


95586
serializable	deserialization
the url was aydsman s answer is correct more info here i can t think of any use-case for an exception with non-serializable members but if you avoid attempting to serialize deserialize them in getobjectdata and the deserialization constructor you should be ok
also mark them with the nonserialized attribute more as documentation than anything else since you are implementing the serializable yourself


96574
svg	vml
your options are to use regular divs absolutely positioned in the right places or find write a font layout engine example or wait for a new standard to be implemented that lets you draw text
svg deals with this much better
in ie you have explorercanvas to simulate the canvas api with ie s own vml markup

96576
rpm	yum

if you re running on redhat or debian consider packaging up your code into rpm s or debs
then build a yum or dpkg repository and put your packages there

96835
opera	safari	opera	firefox
you can test in other browsers but don t worry about fixes until it works just how you want it in firefox
then move on to the other standards-based browsers namely safari and opera
if you ve written good html and css it shouldn t require much work in these browsers

97431
google-chrome	safari
it is not real ie it s mainly only its rendering engine html+css+js plus web client http and some more protocols control itself has no menu bookmarks etc
google-chrome is full featured browser
so you should be asking for webkit rendering engine google-chrome use developed by safari s guys control

97630
implements	extends
a couple points from that chapter pertinent to your question assuming you want to serialize the state of the non-serializable field in myclass2 that field must be accessible to myclass either directly or through getters and setters
myclass will have to implements custom serialization by providing readobject and writeobject methods
the non-serializable field s class must have an api to allow getting it s state for writing to the object stream and then instantiating a new instance with that state when later reading from the object stream. per item 74 of effective java myclass2 must have a no-arg constructor accessible to myclass otherwise it is impossible for myclass to extends myclass2 and implements serializable

98244
getter	setter
essentially if you have getters and setter for each and every private field you are making those fields as good as public
you d be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that getter
moreover from a strictly oo point of view objects should be responding to messages methods that correspond to their hopefully single responsibility

98683
allegro	sdl
your choice of engine library framework should dictate your collision detection choices as they are likely far more optimized than what you could produce alone
for allegro there is collegro
for sdl there is sdl_collide.h or sdl-collide

98710
srp	ocp

principles of object oriented class design the solid principles srp the single responsibility principles a class should have one and only one reason to change
ocp the open closed principles you should be able to extend a classes behavior without modifying it

98881
implements	extends
the i naming notation is historical from c++ it was used to indicate an abstract virtual class and was carried over to java but is more significant in c# because there is no easy way to tell what is a base class and what is a interface from a c# class declaration public class dog animal imammal while in java it was more obvious public class dog extends animal implements imammal multiple inheritance is very tricky so interfaces were derived to simplify it
a c# class can only inherit from one base class but can implements n amount of interfaces
in c++ interfaces can be simulated by using pure virtual classes

99745
getter	setter

i prefer to keep members private as long as possible and only access em via getter even from within the very same class
i also try to avoid setter as a first draft to promote value style objects as long as it is possible

100334
rss	feed
enterprise search
the indexing capabilities provided by sharepoint s enterprise search technology are extensive rss web part
allows you to consume and apply xslt transform to any rss feed and output the result on any sharepoint page page viewer web part

100740
octree	quadtree
a quadtree is best for when you use a height map for terrain etc
an octree is best for when you have clumps of geometry in 3d space such as a solar system


100838
vb.net	vb6

when i moved from asp3 to asp.net i finally choosed to use c# instead of vb.net
i wrote basics for years ms-basic gw-basic quick-basic visual basic vbscript and it was very difficult to use vb.net because i always try to write things as i used to do with vb6 or vbscript

100937
lisp	scheme

it s a foerign-function interface ffi that lets you call .net libraries from your lisp code
they are most probably much less mature than any common lisp or scheme implementation but there are lisp dialects for .net l# and dotlisp

101561
mvp	presenter
this is to allow mocking of the view in a unit test
one common attribute of mvp is that there has to be a lot of two-way dispatching
for example when someone clicks the save button the event handler delegates to the presenter s onsave method

102292
multiplying	multiplication
if the filter is large it may also make sense to use the fact that convolution in the spatial domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency fourier domain
this means that you can take the fourier transform of the image and the filter multiplying the complex results and then take the inverse fourier transform
the complexity of the fft fast fourier transform is o n log n while the complexity of a convolution is o n 2

102421
lisp	scheme
for scheme there s gnu guile which is licensed under lgpl
for common lisp there s ecl also under the lgpl
both use a c interface for interoperability so you can pretty much embed them into any other language

102717
extjs	gxt
there is a difference extjs gwt is the one that is actually produced by the company that wrote extjs the javascript library
gwt extjs is a gwt wrapper around the extjs library
gxt is native gwt

102717
extjs	gxt	extjs	gxt
however the future is with gxt as it s native gwt and actually developed by the company that made extjs
gwt extjs is somewhat crippled as the license changed on the extjs library thus slowing the development of gwt extjs
overall i think gwt gxt is a good solution for developing a web application

103658
rsa	aes
this will the third-party to encrypt data with your public key and then only you can decrypt the data with your private key which you do not disclose
there should be implementations of rsa available for all the languages you mentioned
if you don t care if the third-party can decrypt the data then aes is the way to go

103768
ssl	https
if you only allow https you can take the password out of the document completely and put it into an http basic authentication header instead
it s secured by ssl during transmission and not stored on your system in the clear you only store a one-way hash for authentication purposes
http basic authentication is simple widely supported and will be much easier for you and your partners to implement than ssl client certificates

104095
cassini	iis

cassini is ment to be a light waight test webserver
the idea is that a developer does not need to have iis installed and configured to test his application

104207
equals	gethashcode
if you do implement iequatable however you should also override equals as the iequatable remarks section states if you implement iequatable t you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable t .equals method
if you do override equals object your overridden implementation is also called in calls to the static equals system.object system.object method on your class
this ensures that all invocations of the equals method return consistent results

104628
innodb	myisam

according to the man page if you are dumping innodb tables you can use the --single-transaction option --lock-tables -l lock all tables before dumping them
the tables are locked with read local to allow concurrent inserts in the case of myisam tables

104628
innodb	myisam
the tables are locked with read local to allow concurrent inserts in the case of myisam tables
for transactional tables such as innodb and bdb --single-transaction is a much better option because it does not need to lock the tables at all. for innodb db


105391
ant	maven	ant	maven
maven is an all around build and deployment management tool
it s biggest strength is that it makes build scripts significantly eaiser to maintain than functionally comparable ant files or shell scripts
there are a lot of advantages to using maven the biggest being it s preference of convention over configuration

105419
doc	rtf

it is capable of storing pdfs but your word documents will be converted to the the google doc format
which then can be converted back to word or rtf or pdf etc

105570
maven	cargo	maven	m2e

maven would be just fine for what you want to do
unlike most build tools maven uses conventions wisely well better than many others at least and it has plugins for every area you mentioned unit tests maven surefire plugin eclipse integration m2e deploying war file war plugin and deploy plugin maven can also help you in integration tests on tomcat if you have some since you can start stop or deploy a war using the cargo plugin

105570
maven	cargo	maven	m2e
unlike most build tools maven uses conventions wisely well better than many others at least and it has plugins for every area you mentioned unit tests maven surefire plugin eclipse integration m2e deploying war file war plugin and deploy plugin maven can also help you in integration tests on tomcat if you have some since you can start stop or deploy a war using the cargo plugin
anyway if you re planning to read in your spare time here s a free book pdf format maven the definitive guide hope it helps


105921
postgresql	mysql

i like postgresql maestro
i also use their version for mysql

106334
postgresql	mysql
in your example you would want something like this select o.id o.address o.otherdetails group_concat concat e.firstname e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql - edit postgresql 9.0 is equally simple now that string_agg expression delimiter is built-in
here it is with comma-space between elements select o.id o.address o.otherdetails string_agg e.firstname || || e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql before 9.0 allows you to define your own aggregate functions with create aggregate
slightly more work than mysql but much more flexible

107520
rpm	yum
combined into one example on at least one rh system with rpm v4.8.0 yum v3.2.29 and repoquery v0.0.11 repoquery -l rpm prints nothing
if you are having this issue try adding the --installed flag repoquery --installed -l rpm
dnf update to use dnf instead of yum-utils use the following command

107883
factors	mean
if instead we want to say that a function grows exactly as quickly as some other function we use theta to make that point i ll write t f n to mean theta of f n in markdown
t g n is short hand for being bounded from above and below by g n again up to a scaling factors and asymptotically
that is f n t g n f n o g n and g n o f n

108030
udp	tcp

there are various standard reliable udp protocols out there what experiences do you have with them
i think you really need to prove to yourself that tcp is in fact too slow for your needs if you need reliability in your protocol

108421
vmware	virtualbox
intel-based macintoshes can boot windows and apple provides windows drivers for their various devices as part of a href rel nofollow noreferrer boot camp. a alternately you can buy a href rel nofollow noreferrer parallels a or a href rel nofollow noreferrer vmware fusion a for less than 100
i use vmware fusion
there is also a mac version of a href rel nofollow noreferrer virtualbox a from sun which is free though i have never used it

108451
udp	tcp
tcp is generally as fast as it gets for reliable streaming of data from one host to another
however if your application does a lot of small bursts of traffic and waiting for responses udp may be more appropriate to minimize latency
there is an easy middle ground

108511
spaces	delimiter	spaces	linefeed

the humble for command has accumulated some interesting capabilities over the years note that overwrites the default spaces and tab delimiter so that the output of the date command gets gobbled all at once
to capture multi-line output it can still essentially be a one-liner using the variable linefeed as the delimiter in the resulting variable to capture a piped expression use |

108706
datamapper	activerecord
doctrine 1.2 implements activerecord
doctrine 2+ is a datamapper orm
also check out xyster

108959
multiplication	exponent
it is probably the best you can do as a general method that works for all exponent values but for a specific exponent value there might be a better sequence that needs fewer multiplication
for instance if you want to compute x 15 the method of exponentiation by squaring will give you this is a total of 6 multiplication
it turns out this can be done using just 5 multiplication via addition-chain exponentiation

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
cairngorm just skips over things like event bubbling and instead opts for solutions involving global variable
in short cairngorm is the visualbasic of flex it works but will teach you a lot of bad habits
puremvc isn t so bad it just isn t a very good fit for writing flex applications

109508
lisp	scheme
stalin is a scheme compiler which does ridiculously aggressive optimisation
all common lisp implementations that i know of except clisp compile to native code
whether one ought to consider cl a functional language depends on what is meant by the term functional however. mlton is a highly optimising compiler for standard ml

109979
ubuntu	linux
on linux your choices for server virtualization include vmware server -- it s commercial freeware mature and provides the most hardware device and guest os support of any solution
available with ubuntu
xen -- it s open source

109979
vmware	virtualbox
for myself i stick with vmware workstation 7+ years and vmware server for my linux-hosted virtualization needs
at work it s vmware workstation on windows vmware server on windows and vmware esx on bare metal
i ll probably have another look at xen kvm and virtualbox at some point but for right now compatibility between work and home is paramount

110029
pascal	delphi
this is a series of delphi components free source code you can see an example of this here view markup - it s the staruml projects code and they have among other things a way to get at the history favorites etc using the ie mshtml interfaces
it s written in object pascal but it shouldn t be too hard to figure out what s going on
if you download the embedded web browser components package take a look at the stuff in embeddedwb_d2005 source - there s all sorts of goodies there

110037
jxtable	jtable

look into jxtable
jxtable is an extension of jtable that supports multi-column sorting as well as other functions that jtable doesn t provide

110162
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a pretty popular database lots of tools are available and lots of books
sqlite and postgresql are also quite popular and also free open-source


110296
inherited	properties
if you want to apply the properties in the first set of brackets to .d as well it will need to be specified in the selector list
you also need to separate the selectors with commas so they become a list not an inherited
example

110416
tcpreplay	wireshark
next get yourself a copy of tcpreplay
this should also include a tool called tcprewrite . tcprewrite will allow you to split your previously saved capture files into two - one for each side of the handshake. you can then use tcpreplay to play back one side of the handshake so you have a consistent set of packets to play with
then you use wireshark again to check your responses

110621
accessor	properties

you can use reflection you can get a methodinfo object for the get set accessor and call it s invoke method
the code example assumes you have both a get and set accessor and you really have to add error handling if you want to use this in production code for example to get the value of properties foo of object obj you can write to set it so you can pass obj.gettype .getproperty foo .getaccessors 0 to your method and execute it s invoke method

112138
vbscript	jscript
you need to use jscript but it s close enough
same environment also allows for vbscript
to run a program you can execute something like cscript foo.js the windows system api is a bit weird and frustrating if you expect the same flexibility as with basic js objects but they do have thorough documentation if you can handle digging through the msdn pages and seeing all the examples in vbscript

113128
client-side	server-side
you don t have to use the server-side piece
the client-side create a script piece is generally enough


113397
client-side	server-side

in addition to the above i would like to point out that client-side validation html code javascript etc. is never enough
also check the length server-side or just don t check at all if it s not so important that people can be allowed to get around it then it s not important enough to really warrant any steps to prevent that either

113420
try-catch	exception-handling

i think you can just do an explicit try-catch in your test code instead of relying on the expectedexception attribute to do it for you
then you can come up with some helper method that will read the resource file and compare the error message to the one that comes with the exception-handling that was caught

113675
serializable	deserialization
ensure that you implement the three standard exception constructors
ensure that you mark your exception with the serializable attribute
ensure that you implement the deserialization constructor

113912
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if the collation is case-insensitive you need to explicitly declare the collation mode you want to use when performing a search replace
here s how to construct an update statement to perform a case-sensitive search replace by specifying the collation mode to use this will match and replace thecontent but not thecontent or thecontent


114000
inline	inlining

functions called using virtual dispatch are not inline there is one kind of penalty for virtual functions which is easy to forget about virtual calls are not inline in a common situation where the type of the object is not know compile time
if your function is small and suitable for inlining this penalty may be very significant as you are not only adding a call overhead but the compiler is also limited in how it can optimize the calling function it has to assume the virtual function may have changed some registers or memory locations it cannot propagate constant values between the caller and the callee

114023
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort
you just need to implement the second part of the heapsort algorithm
this should be faster than using quicksort on the heap array
if you are feeling brave you could have a go at implementing smoothsort which is faster than heapsort for nearly-sorted data

114215
datalist	repeater
however to actually show the images you re best bet could be to create a datatable of these images and then use a datalist or repeater to display them
then on your aspx page you would have a datalist control called dlimages defined like


114544
postgresql	mysql
these databases are very different - mysql is speed and simplicity postgresql is robustness and concurrency
it will be easier for you to learn postgresql it is not that hard


114753
mvp	presenter

from your description it s a bit like how i do mvp but with the events going the other way
i usually have a very thin view that hides behind an interface and that knows nothing about the presenter

115590
phpstorm	komodo
they have a free version komodo edit
update from 2015 i ve switched to phpstorm from jetbrains the same folks that built intellij idea and resharper
it s better

115944
getter	setter
therefore if there is no business logic for example when a getter simply returns a value or a setter sets it then there is no point in writing a test
if however there is some logic getter changes the data in some way before returning it then yes you should have a unit test. as a general rule i believe one should not write tests for beans that do not contain any business logic


116066
try-catch	exception-handling
these errors generally happen when an exception-handling in thrown on the webserver and there s no logic to catch it so it spits out an http 500 error
you can usually resolve the problem by placing try-catch blocks in your code


116114
stdout	stderr
backticks use minimal syntax for what can be a heavy command
one reason users might be temped to use backticks instead of system is to hide stdout from the user
this is more easily and flexibly accomplished by redirecting the stdout stream further getting rid of stderr is easily accomplished in situations where it makes sense to use backticks i prefer to use the qx in order to emphasize that there is a heavy-weight command occurring

116730
opera	safari	opera	firefox
tweak it to look right in at least firefox and ie and now you ve covered 90 + of the people that will be using your website
don t get me wrong here - i m not trying to dismiss the users of opera safari or any other browser
but if you want the most results for the least amount of work then there ya go

116873
mouse	keyboard
make it obvious which input box failed validation or formatting rules and tell the user why their input failed
do not steal the mouse pointer focus when providing feedback
keep tab order in mind so that when keyboard oriented users complete a field they can hit tab and go to the next logical input selection field

117741
boost	stl
in particular use stl strings and collections unless you have a very very good reason not to
get to know auto_ptr and the boost smart pointers library very well understand under which circumstances each type of smart pointer is intended to be used and then use smart pointers everywhere you might otherwise have used raw pointers
your code will be just as efficient and a lot less prone to memory leaks

117834
opera	safari	opera	firefox

safari 1.3+ opera 9.2+ konquerer and ie8 all support it at least to some degree
firefox apparently still does not

118325
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

i use firefox with ie tab and google-chrome
firefox with ie tab because those are the two browsers with the most market share and google-chrome because it is one of the few windows browsers that use webkit meaning it should display similarly to safari

118689
rss	feed

the point of rss is to be display agnostic
you should not be putting style attributes on your feed

120052
bazaar	git
difficulty with git has been understanding the implications of the distributed model
i did glance briefly at other dvcses like bazaar and mercurial and they seemed to be somewhat more newbie-friendly
anyway as others have said subversion is probably the easiest way to get used to the version control mindset and get practical experience of the benefits of vcs rollback branches collaborative development easier code review etc

120284
lisp	prolog
random examples of what you can implement as a user library using lisp metaprogramming these are actual examples of common lisp libraries extend the language with delimited continuations hu.dwim.delico implement a js-to-lisp-rpc macro that you can use in javascript which is generated from lisp
it expands into a mixture of js lisp code that automatically posts in the http request all the referenced local variables decodes them on the server side runs the lisp code body on the server and returns back the return value to the javascript side
add prolog like backtracking to the language that very seamlessly integrates with normal lisp code see screamer an xml templating extension to common lisp includes an example of reader macros that are plugins for the lisp parser a ton of small dsl s like loop or iterate for easy looping

120916
inherited	subclassing
if you want to call a superclass constructor with an argument you must use the subclassing s constructor initialization list
unlike java c++ supports multiple inherited for better or worse so the base class must be referred to by name rather than super
more info on the constructor s initialization list here and here

121242
mouse	keyboard
you really do need to touch-and-feel your app on a real device
a ui that works great while pointing and clicking with a mouse might be terrible when used with thumbs and fingers
if there is any text entry you need to feel how painful it is to type using the onscreen keyboard to determine whether it makes sense to provide alternative data-entry methods

121950
exponent	addition
it s a way of thinking of every number as a possibly fixed base raised to an exponent
operations are performed on the exponent alone
this means that you can do multiplication and division by doing addition and subtraction of the logs

122063
gridbaglayout	boxlayout

i ve found that for any non-trivial gui i use multiple layouts with nested sub-panels where the main panel may have a gridbaglayout and each sub-panel typically without a border or indication that it is a panel uses a simpler layout where possible
typically i ll use borderlayout flowlayout and boxlayout for smaller simpler sub-panels

122063
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
typically i ll use borderlayout flowlayout and boxlayout for smaller simpler sub-panels
by dividing small sections of the gui into sub-panels and using the simplest layout possible to control that section of the gui you can create complex well arranged displays without too much headache from gridbaglayout s many options
also by grouping like display functionality into a panel it creates more readable code

122268
spaces	linefeed
it is undefined in css 2.1 what happens if a style sheet does contain a character with unicode codepoint zero. if a character in the range 0-9a-f follows the hexadecimal number the end of the number needs to be made clear
there are two ways to do that with a spaces or other whitespace character 26 b b
in this case user agents should treat a cr linefeed pair u+000d u+000a as a single whitespace character. by providing exactly 6 hexadecimal digits 000026b b in fact these two methods may be combined

122300
sudo	passwd
trying to do complicated unusual things with permissions frequently leads to security holes
more specifically whatever it is the script is trying to do might be better done with setuid instead of sudo
i d also have to wonder why so many people have the root passwd

122300
sudo	passwd
i d also have to wonder why so many people have the root passwd
sudo is there specifically to avoid giving people the root password.


122431
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
under windows using the fat filesystems file and folder names may be up to 255 characters long
under windows using the ntfs filesystems file and folder names may be up to 256 characters long
under window the length of a full path under both systems is 260 characters

123307
lxml	elementtree	lxml	celementtree
it s pythonic comes in the box with python 2.5 including the c version celementtree xml.etree.celementtree which is 20 times faster than the pure python version and is very easy to use
lxml has some perfomance advantages but they are uneven and you should check the benchmarks first for your use case
as i understand it elementtree code can easily be ported to lxml

123574
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
instances of exception should be reserved for cases where a data or processing error has taken place but can be recovered from by user or system intervention
instances of runtimeexception should be reserved for those occasions when no intervention within the confines of your application can resolve the issue
these two types are thusly known as checked and unchecked-exception

123855
redmine	trac

i d also like to add redmine to the list
i started with trac but i found the mercurial support and the administrative interface for everything to be much better in redmine

124133
mvp	presenter

you can try mvp if you want to put the logic of the ui in a separate class
in model view presenter just as martin fowler or michael feathers say the logic of the ui is separated into a class called presenter that handles all the input from the user and that tells the dumb view what and when to display

124248
rsa	aes
here s the real reasons public key crypto operations aren t intended for raw data encryption
algorithms like diffie-hellman and rsa were devised as a way of exchanging keys for block crypto algorithms
so for instance you d use a secure random number generator to generate a 128 bit random key for aes and encrypt those 16 bytes with rsa

124591
inherited	subclassing
this is the item 17 in the book previously mentioned
item 17 design and document for inherited or else prohibit it
see effective of course you may have a car class and tons of subclassing

124956
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
rpm is a horrific hack but as our clients were all running red hat linux by our requirement it made perfect sense
if i had a choice i d go with a system like debian or ubuntu and set up a repository that the systems could all pull from
still it worked well for hundreds of clients with thousands of servers total

124986
profiling	debugging
after spending far far too much time debugging bad char code and memory leaks i suggest that all non-static strings be some type of string object .
until profiling shows that you can and should do something better
-

125162
inherited	subclassing
multiple dispatch allows for subtyping polymorphism of arguments for method calls
single dispatch also allows for a more limited kind of polymorphism using the same method name for objects that implement the same interface or inherited the same base class
it s the classic example of polymorphism where you have methods that are overridden in subclassing

125553
matlab	simulink

you might be surprised at the number of people that use matlab for this and as it could be considered a programming language and certainly manages its own memory with support for huge data sets etc then it should seriously be considered as a solution here
so once you arrive at an algorithm you want to package up you can have it generate the c code to perform the work you originally had in your m script or simulink model

125605
boost	stl

boost is used so extensively because it is open-source and peer-reviewed
it provides a wide range of platform agnostic functionality that stl missed

126003
google-chrome	firefox
or you could fire up firefox in full screen mode in a dedicated vnc server instance and use a screenshot grabber to take the screenshot
fullscreen minimal google-chrome vnc server instance no visible ui + you can choose your resolution
use xinit with xvnc as the x server to do this - you ll need to read all the manpages

126771
lisp	scheme
but i have one misconception about lisp that really shocked me when i read lisp s history specifically history of lisp and the evolution of lisp
lisp is known to be a slow interpreted language my many people but in reality it had a compiler something about less than one year after having its first working interpreter i think and the following history is a long list of work targetted at optimization that resulted in some lisp implementations beating fortran at number crushing
most probable source of the myth is that many people get only to know lisp from a cs course about scheme where they write themselves an interpreter

126771
lisp	scheme
most probable source of the myth is that many people get only to know lisp from a cs course about scheme where they write themselves an interpreter
and probably many of them get to hate the course because it teaches them beautiful but complex concepts about computability or recursion and they then assimilate their issues with the course with their issues with lisp


126773
lisp	scheme
nothing could be farther from the truth
first of all lisp depending on the meaning intended by the speaker isn t really a language at all but a language family
there are a couple of more or less well-known and widespread members of this family scheme common lisp emacs-lisp and autolisp are the traditional ones

126773
lisp	scheme
it s certainly true that schemers seem to favour a functional style and discourage iteration in favour of recursion
however as far as i can tell schemers are actually a minority in the lisp world at least when considering practical usage of lisp as a programming tool as opposed to a research or study subject
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming

126773
lisp	scheme
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming
in fact common lisp features the most powerful class-based object system that i know of incorporating stuff like aspect-oriented programming out of the box
lisp seems to me to actually be the language family that most encourages experiments in new directions and most easily incorporates programming paradigms that aren t supported from the get-go

127576
gmail	hotmail
for best results imagine it s 1999
go back to tables for layout or preferably - don t attempt any complex layout be afraid of background images they break in outlook 2007 and gmail
the style-tag-in-the-body thing is because hotmail used to accept it that way - i m pretty sure they strip it out now though

128317
profiling	debugging
however if you want to debugging profile test your application in a 64-bit environment then you need 64-bit os 64-bit .net vm visual studio can debugging applications running in 64-bit mode
for profiling you re likely to need a 64-bit profiling


128788
ienumerable	ilist

here are a few general tips for you you can use foreach on types that implement ienumerable
ilist is essentially an ienumberable with count and item accessing items using a zero-based index properties

129279
vmware	virtualbox
you can revert to any previous snapshots and name them
3 it has nat support and bridged networking like the vmware and microsoft products
4 there is no server version of virtualbox but i know it shares an engine with qemu so it may be possible to host your vbox images on qemu

129398
inherited	properties

seems like you would not want to have the type inherited from archive. always favor encapsulation containment over inherited
why not create a class called archive and give it a type properties

129398
inherited	properties
why not create a class called archive and give it a type properties
the type can use inherited to specialize for audio video etc
it would seem that you would specialize archive based on some other criteria

130042
serializable	deserialization
it offers full object serializable and deserialization maintaining each reference encountered
in essence it is similar to c# xml serializable for the java platform but offers additional features for interception and manipulation


130332
django	turbogears

pyfacebook is django-centric because it includes a django example
i did not intend to irk but am merely looking for a turbogears example using pyfacebook

131577
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
file format support fmod currently supports a wide range of audio file formats. partial list mp3 - mpeg i ii layer 3 including vbr support ogg - ogg vorbis format wav - microsoft wave files inlcluding compressed wavs
pcm mp3 and ima adpcm compressed wav


132076
actionscript	mxml
you need to define the style like this enclose it in tag if you define it directly in mxml
you then need to add some actionscript to handle this style and apply it to whichever control you need please refer to for more information


132749
inline	inlining

inline code works like macros in essence but it is actual real code which can be optimized
very small functions are often good for inlining because the work needed to set up the function call load the parameters into the proper registers is costly compared to the small amount of actual work the method does

132787
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	struts
struts tiles is the classic example in the java world but it is really getting old and crufty compared to more modern framworks in java and other languages
tapestry and wicket are two more modern ones haven t used them though
for only 3 pages applying a whole web framework is probably overkill though but if your site grows.

133023
super	extends
you cannot constrain a type parameter to extends more than one class or type parameter
further you can t use super here


133160
firefox	safari

afaik there is no difference on the part of browsers as both firefox and ie will incorrectly cache the response from a url with a querystring in the same way they cache the response from a url without a querystring
in the case of safari it respects the spec and doesn t cache urls with querystrings

133954
google-chrome	firefox
if you are creating a firefox plugin place your code in a xul overlay
if you really want to allow any web page to do whatever it is your plugin does you can establish some mechanism through wich the page can ask the plugin to do the operation with its google-chrome privileges and send the result to the page afterwards


133989
move	drag
mentioned by georgiecasey in his her answer below some relevant extracts includes the following search processes simple search ctrl + f search mode normal you can select an eol in the editing window
just move the cursor to the end of the line and type shift + right arrow
or to select eol with the mouse start just at the line end and drag to the start of the next line

134564
hex	binary
the obvious solution to the problem is to change the field to a binary lob
if you want to stick with a characer lob then you ll need to encode in some scheme such as base64 hex or uu


134999
bazaar	git

a href rel nofollow noreferrer bazaar a does what you re asking for in terms of working very well standalone and there was a 2007 summer of code project to build a href rel nofollow noreferrer a visual studio integration plugin a which appears to have a href rel nofollow noreferrer produced an at-least-partially-functional product a
bazaar and other distributed tools such as git mercurial darcs and the like are ideal because you can have your repository stored in multiple places ie

135008
serializable	deserialization
i once made this mistake with storing a custom preferences serializable and then making a change to the preferences definition
suddenly i couldn t read any of the previously serializable information
you might be better off writing clunky per property columns in a table and composing and decomposing the object in this manner instead to avoid this issue with object versions and deserialization

135009
factors	mean
here s it all done that way using a generator does mean you can only iterate over the result once
if you simply want a list like you do in translatefactorslist you will have to wrap the call to factors in list


135226
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	getter	setter
john resig has a good explanation
here s the full version breakdown ie 6-7 support jscript 5 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 ie 8 supports jscript 6 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 - more bug fixes over jscript 5 firefox 1.0 supports javascript 1.5 ecmascript 3 equivalent firefox 1.5 supports javascript 1.6 1.5 + array extras + e4x + misc. firefox 2.0 supports javascript 1.7 1.6 + generator + iterators + let + misc. firefox 3.0 supports javascript 1.8 1.7 + generator expressions + expression closures + misc. the next version of firefox will support javascript 1.9 1.8 + to be determined opera supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc
safari supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc

135367
boost	stl
the library documentation itself gives you an up-front example of what it is there for where produces a function object that when called writes its first argument to the cout stream
this is something you could do with a custom functor class std ostream_iterator or an explicit loop but boost lambda wins in conciseness and probably clarity -- at least if you are used to the functional programming concepts
when you over- use the stl you find yourself gravitating towards boost bind and boost lambda

135367
boost	stl
so use stl algorithms write your own functors and then translate them into inline expressions using boost lambda
from a professional standpoint i believe the best way to get started with boost lambda is to get usage of boost bind understood and accepted
use of placeholders in a boost bind expression looks much less magical than naked boost lambda placeholders and finds easier acceptance during code reviews

137288
prng	random
my guess is that this is unlikely to be faster than dev random where that s available
if you want a prng do something like this securerandom.getinstance sha1prng
what strings are supported depends on the securerandom spi provider but you can enumerate them using security.getproviders and provider.getservice

137288
prng	random
it isn t especially fast as prngs go but prngs will just be crunching numbers not blocking for physical measurement of entropy
the exception is that if you don t call setseed before getting data then the prng will seed itself once the first time you call next or nextbytes
it will usually do this using a fairly small amount of true random data from the system

137344
inherited	subclassing
editors are logical subclassing of viewers but since all viewers are subclassing - textviewer imageviewer etc. editor does not derive from viewer thus allowing the final texteditor imageeditor classes to avoid the diamond
in cases where the diamond is not avoidable using virtual inherited
the biggest caveat however with virtual bases is that the constructor for the virtual base must be called by the most derived class meaning that a class that derives virtually has no control over the constructor parameters

137444
prng	random
the sophisticated big sister of this hashing operation is called an entropy collector and all good oses have one
if you re using the data to seed a prng though and the prng can use arbitrarily large seed input then you don t have to hash because it will do that for you
you still have to estimate entropy if you want to know how random your seed value was - you can use the best prng in the world but its entropy is still limited by the entropy of the seed.

138146
websphere	ibm

having worked with websphere a long time the version of the jdk is very important
websphere 6.1 ships with an ibm jdk 1.5 or is it 5

138146
websphere	ibm	websphere	ibm
websphere 6.1 ships with an ibm jdk 1.5 or is it 5
when you patch the websphere there are equivalent patches for the jdk as well
while it may work with a different version of the jdk even a different vendor i doubt you will get much support from ibm if something goes wrong

138146
websphere	ibm
while it may work with a different version of the jdk even a different vendor i doubt you will get much support from ibm if something goes wrong
if you need a 64 bit jvm i would suggest that there is probably a 64 bit build while i cannot comment on windows specifically i can tell you there is a 64 bit websphere 6.1 build for both aix and linux
the best answer is to check with the vendor and see if they will support your configuration

138242
rss	feed
then you could search for pages that offer their full article text in rss feed
rss because no html tags get in your way
scraping mailing lists and or the usenet has several disatvantages you ll be getting aolbonics and techspeak and that will tilt your corpus badly

139276
gridview	repeater
since you re building the layout by hand listview and repeater require more code
gridview is an updated datagrid so there is hardly any reason to use datagrid
gridview works really well when hooked up to standard asp.net datasources but restricts you to a tabular layout with lots of layout rules

139308
gridview	datalist
datagrid - old version of the gridview
a gridview is a super datagrid
datalist - more customisable version of the gridview

139308
listview	gridview
more manual work as you have to design it yourself
listview - the new datalist
almost a hybrid of the datalist and gridview where you can use paging and build in gridview like functionality but have the freedom of design

139645
jar	war
if the class or the resource is still not found the request is forwarded to the app server which will look in its own classpath
this being said you should remember that a java ee module web-app ejb will always load classes from a jar that is in the nearest scope
for example if you package log4j v1 in the war file log4j v2 at ear level and you put log4j v3 in your app-server s class path the module will use the jar in its own module

139767
daemons	systemd
write a client-side program that can both scrape the above web page and the xml return and redisplays the date in a different format
write a daemons program that monitors an email account
when a strongly-encoded email arrives that decrypts to a valid iso 8601 time the program sets the systemd time to that value

union	distinct
create vw_view_fields6to10 as select id from employees where field6 is not null or field7 is not null or field8 is not null or field 9 is not null or field10 is not null
etc select id from vw_view_fields1to5 union select id from vw_view_fields6to10 ..
etc you d have to take a distinct or something to cut down the rows that fall into more than one view of course

boost	stl

boost thread is great i m not sure whether you can say its part of the language though
it depends if you consider the crt stl boost to be part of c++ or an optional add-on library

141668
centos	linux
most linux stuff is shipped for rhel redhat enterprise linux so you are usually best off using that
centos is a free distribution based on rhel in fact it s almost identical so a given vendor s stuff usually works the same there
it also depends on hardware support

142587
move	drag
by design a detail row only contains records that match the master you cannot for example change an order to belong to a new customer because the detail row does not contain any customer information
if you want to move a detail row to another master you have to create a new detail row for the new master copy the data from the old detail row and delete the old detail row
if you re ambitious you could support cut and paste or drag and drop of detail rows but internally you have to create copy delete

142641
boost	stl
update once you re comfortable with the stl and start needing to do things that require a lot of code with the stl or are just plain tricky then head over to boost
buy a book on boost and read it and understand it well


142657
.htaccess	httpd.conf

the documentroot directive cannot appear in a .htaccess
put it in httpd.conf instead

142738
mvp	presenter
when working on the presenter the view and model are typically defined as interfaces and mocked so your initial focus is on defining how the user is interacting with your objects
i generally like to work in this way even if i m not doing a strict mvp pattern
i find that focusing on user interaction helps me create business objects that are easier to interact with

142778
.htaccess	httpd.conf
also check that .htaccess is readable by the httpd process
check the error_log - it will tell you of any errors in .htaccess if it s being used. putting an intentional syntax error in .htaccess is a good check to make sure the file is being used -- you should get a 500 error on any page in the same directory
lastly you can enable a rewrite log using commands like the following in your httpd.conf rewritelog logs rewritelog rewriteloglevel 7 the log file thus generated will give you the gory detail of which rewrite rules matched and how they were handled

142870
dbcontext	objectcontext
it is hilarious that the object team made a datacontext and the data team made an objectcontext and on to dataquery vs objectquery etc. naming is hard
update for .net 4 with ef4.1 you might also be interested in dbcontext when working with linqtoentities
see also

143221
bitarray	bitvector

bitarray was the best answer i found when i recently had a similar need
it s a c extension so much faster than bitvector which is pure python and stores its data in an actual bitfield so it s eight times more memory efficient than a numpy boolean array which appears to use a byte per element.

143381
lisp	scheme
an introductory course in the scheme programming language a dialect of lisp presented as a text adventure - or to put it another way a scheme interpreter with a wee scrap of text adventure wrapped around it
since it s z-code and the first z-code games were written in another lisp variant there s an odd circularity to it all. - carl muckenhoupt

bmp	tga	bmp	ppm	bmp	ppm
render your font using whatever arrange the characters in a grid and save the image in a simple uncompressed format like ppm bmp or tga
if you want antialiasing make sure to use a format that supports transparency bmp and tga do
ppm does not

144089
ienumerable	icollection
however many linq methods special case for when the object implementing ienumerable actually implements icollection
i ve seen this for ienumerable.contains at least. in practice this means that linq ienumerable.contains calls the fast hashset.contains for example if the ienumerable actually is a hashset
you can use reflector to check exactly how the linq methods are defined that is how i figured this out

144332
fgets	atoi
if you re using a gui the function may already deal with conversion to integer and reporting errors and so in an appropriate manner
if you re working with standard c it is generally easier to read the value into a string perhaps with fgets and then convert
although atoi can be used it is seldom the best choice

144594
avr	microcontroller
i have no experience with programming microcontroller in assembly
if you want to try that the avr might be more suitable because of it s bigger user community
as far as i know the cheapest way to program an avr using atmel s tools is the atmel avr isp mkii for 35

144723
gtk	cairo	kde	gnome

mono does not use qt kde or gtk gnome widgets because they don t match up with the winforms api
mono implements winforms on top of their system.drawing implementation which in turn uses cairo

144890
quicksort	mergesort

all things being equal i d expect most people to use whatever is most conveniently available and that tends to be quicksort 3
other than that quicksort is known to be very fast on arrays just like mergesort is the common choice for lists

144997
inline	inlining
most c++ compilers are smart enough now to inline functions for you
the inline keyword is just a hint to the compiler
some will even do inlining across translation units where they decide it s helpful

145075
glassfish	weblogic

since the netbeans ide is a sun product i would assume that the glassfish application server would be a natural fit
that said one of the pluses of developing a web application in java is that the interface for working with the http is standardized the servlet specification so that you can pick any servlet container you want be it glassfish tomcat jetty or weblogic

145075
glassfish	weblogic
that said one of the pluses of developing a web application in java is that the interface for working with the http is standardized the servlet specification so that you can pick any servlet container you want be it glassfish tomcat jetty or weblogic
since it sounds to me that you re experimenting and you want to use something easy to administer i might go with glassfish
however be open to revisit that decision when you need to actually deploy your web application in a production environment

145127
factors	mean
and by need i mean have a specific case for the performance profile and specific metrics that indicate that any change will address the issue
if you have an application where memory is going to be the limiting factors then ruby may not be the best choice
that said i have found that my rails apps generally consume about 40-60mb of ram per mongrel instance

145200
ironruby	ironpython
i suspect the team will go for language-completeness rather than performance first
this will allow you to run ironruby run most ruby programs when 1.0 ships then they can improve perf as they go
i suspect ironpython has a similar story

145310
profiling	instrumentation

there are quite a few profiling out there
here are some of the ones i know of red gate s ants yourkit s .net profiler jetbrains dottrace if you go on with using system.diagnostics.stopwatch you will be able to instrumentation and measure only particular points of your code where you explicitly put the start stop around

145331
vim	textmate

you may scoff at this but cream is a very un-vimlike offshoot of vim
here is an article written specifically for textmate and e fans who want to try it

145897
nginx	lighttpd
it s similar to linux-vserver so you might want to compare those two when going this route
i ve setup a webserver with a proxy http server nginx which then delegates traffic to different openvz containers based on hostname or requested path
inside each container you can setup apache or any other webserver nginx lighttpd .. . this way you don t have one apache for everything but could create a container for any subset of services per project

145952
inline	inlining	inline	inlining
it slightly breaks your encapsulation 2 c++ inlining is resolved at compile time
which means that should you change the code of the inline function you would need to recompile all the code using it to be sure it will be updated for the same reason i avoid default values for function parameters when used in a header it makes your header file larger and thus will dilute interesting informations like the list of a class methods with code the user don t care about this is the reason that i declare inline functions inside a class but will define it in an header after the class body and never inside the class body
inlining magic the compiler may or may not inline the functions you marked as inline

145952
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
inlining magic the compiler may or may not inline the functions you marked as inline
it may also decide to inline-functions not marked as inline at compilation or linking time
inline works like a copy paste controlled by the compiler which is quite different from a pre-processor macro the macro will be forcibly inlined will pollute all the namespaces and code won t be easily debuggable and will be done even if the compiler would have ruled it as inefficient

146209
factors	mean

factors out common styles
not styles that just happen to be the same styles that are intended to be the same - where changing the style for one selector will likely mean you ll want to change the other as well

146374
inherited	subclassing
but if instances of a class are supposed to be immutable then making it final is one good way of making sure they really are all immutable that there aren t mutable instances of subclassing kicking around which can be used anywhere that the parent class is called for
i don t think the article you referenced should be taken as an instruction that all immutable classes must be final especially if you have a positive reason to design your immutable class for inherited
what it was saying is that protecting immutability is a valid reason for final where imaginary performance concerns which is what it s really talking about at that point are not valid

147112
opera	firefox
addeventlistener input is a direct-user-initiated filtered version of domcontrolvaluechanged
unfortunately domcontrolvaluechanged is only supported by opera currently and input event support is broken in webkit
the input event also has various bugs in firefox and opera

147281
clang	llvm

under development for now but clang does c analysis and is targeted to handle c++ over time
it s part of the llvm project

148265
margin	text-align
i tend to set the container to text-align center
for old browsers margin auto
for modern browsers and leave it like that

149087
decimal	ieee

look in to the relatively recent intelr decimal floating-point math library
it s specifically for finance applications and implements some of the new standards for binary floating point arithmetic ieee 754r

149252
.htaccess	httpd.conf

the documentation says that this can only be set in the php.ini not in .htaccess
you can see this by looking at the table where it says php_ini_system which means - entry can be set in php.ini or httpd.conf

149442
google-chrome	safari

at first i believed it was a built-in feature of the wysiwym markdown editor but shog9 is correct it s not baked-in at all but is courtesy of the jquery plugin textarearesizer i was lead astray by the browser was using to check on the editor demo because google-chrome itself adds the expandable functionality on textareas mdash
much like the safari browser does

149699
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
mri 1.8 have supported them as far as my memory reaches ruby 1.9 yarv does it too so does rubinius
jruby and ironruby don t have continuations and it s quite unlikely they will get them jvm and clr use stack-instrospection for security ruby as a language supports continuations via callcc keyword
they re used for example to implement generator class from standard library

150283
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
so for learning scheme lisp javascript isn t a bad start
note though that functional languages like lisp are quite different from pure functional languages such as haskell
apart from first-class functions meaning that functions are values that can be assigned to variables lexical scope is also an inherent part of what makes a functional language

150593
firefox	safari
safari 3.1 for webkit opera for presto
i m pretty sure firefox will start supporting html5 partially in 3.1 all support is extremely partial
check here for information on what is supported

150835
filesystems	ntfs

please note however that using the default filesystems under both win32 and nix there is no way to guarantee the atomicity of the operation if you check for the existence of files a b and c some other process or thread might have deleted file a after you passed it and while you were looking for b and c
filesystems such as transactional ntfs can overcome this limitation

150879
ssl	https
compare http with https on the same setup
the latency can be mitigated to some extent by ensuring that your server is using http keepalives - this allows the client to reuse ssl sessions which avoids the need for another handshake reducing the number of requests to as few as possible - by combining resources where possible .js include files css and encouraging client-side caching reduce the number of page loads by loading data not required into the page perhaps in a hidden html element and then showing it using client-script


151612
boost	stl
implementing the iterators is the most challenging
i used boost iterator_facade to implement the iterators
using boost iterator_facade you can easy adapt any cached on disk data structures to have a stl container interface

151912
postgresql	mysql

this is the sequence solution for postgresql you d have to do it in a stored procedure or on your application code of course
for mysql the transaction is important not to trip on your own feet in case you re using the same connection for more than one insert

151938
inline	inlining

there are several situations where the compiler is not able to determine categorically whether it is appropriate or beneficial to inline a function
inlining may involve trade-off s that the compiler is unwilling to make but you are e.g code bloat

152516
mbunit	mstest
mstest doesnt have the fetaure set of other os test frameworks
check out xunit and mbunit it just too hard to use and there are many better options


153015
udp	tcp
since ip has become the dominant protocol a port in networking terms has become synonomous with either a udp or tcp port number - which is a portion of the socket address
udp is connection-less - meaning no virtual circuit between the 2 endpoints is ever created
however we still refer to udp sockets as the endpoint

153200
stateless	stateful
object orientation is stateful --you refer to an object and can call methods on it while maintaining state within a session where the object is still in scope
rest is stateless --everything you want to do with a resource is specified in a single message and all you ever need to know regarding that message is sent back in a single response
in object-orientation there is no concept of universal object identity --objects either get identity from their memory address at any particular moment a framework-specific uuid or from a database key

153411
profiling	debugging
lesson initialize your locals
if someone barks performance at you show them this comment and tell them that you d rather spend two weeks running profiling code and fixing bottlenecks rather than having to track down bugs like this
debugging tools and heap checkers have gotten way better since i had to do this but quite frankly they got better to compensate for bugs from poor practices like this

153477
webclient	httpwebrequest	webclient	httpwebrequest
for instance in the httpwebrequest object this method is overloaded to provide the content-type header
i m not sure what instance of webresponse the webclient is using
if you only want html files your best of using the httpwebrequest object directly

153906
profiling	instrumentation
in the kind of applications i ve worked on adding instrumentation often slows the product down so much that it doesn t work anymore true story start app go home come back next day app still initializing
also with non instrumented profiling you can react to live problems
for example with vtune remote date collector i can start up a sampling session against a live server with hundreds of simultaneous connections that is experiencing performance problems and catch issues that happen in production that i d never be able to replicate in a test environment

153935
datamapper	activerecord
in a situation like yours consider delving into patterns of enterprise application architecture by martin fowler
at first sight it looks like you want to create a datamapper
but consider alternatives like activerecord s that might be enough for your needs

154070
client-side	server-side
if you re generating the link on the server we would need to know what server-side language you re using to give more specific advice
if you re generating the tag client-side as a string in javascript don t do that use document.createelement use the string.replace method on the argument string to pick out characters that will break the syntax you re generating and replace them with escaped versions


156413
stdout	fflush

by default if stdout or cout is printing to a console the output is line buffered
this means that every newline that is printed will fflush the output

156466
inline	inlining
whether a function is inlined is at the discretion of your compiler
in my experience most modern compilers are good at determining when to comply with a user s request to inline
in many cases inlining a function will improve its performance

156772
inherited	properties
if the object is an data entity ie
you are binding its values to something in the xaml tree then there is no need to inherited from dependencyobject
if the properties on the object are read-write you may want to implement inotifypropertychanged which will allow bindings to automatically update when the value changes

157456
perforce	svn
it s easier to set up and get running
some of our members really like the ms office plugin for perforce i m on a mac so i can t use it
but the svn clients are better especially the eclipse plugin

157456
perforce	svn
but the svn clients are better especially the eclipse plugin
perforce is more expensive
these are merely opinions so perhaps this is a poor answer if i was already using one or the other i d be very hard pressed to switch since neither seems to offer really significant benefits over the other but the disruption in switching could be large

157551
perforce	svn

i have used both and in my experience perforce makes a lot of sense if you have a big team and or codebase
otherwise i would pick svn - it is easier to set up and maintain

157625
perforce	svn

it has features analogous to those available in perforce but is free foss
either is a great alternative to svn when working with a large team

157718
stdout	stderr
in that case my advice would be to use stderr rather than stdout
it is unbuffered by default and you can redirect it separately from stdout putting your output in one place and your logging in another


157949
client-side	server-side
a form should always have server-side validation
client-side validation is only there as a convenience
a malicious user could easily post data to your form bypassing any client-side validation that you have in place

158824
pdfbox	itextsharp	pdfbox	itext
if you re looking for something a little more diy there s the itextsharp library - a port of java s itext - and pdfbox yes it says java - but they have a .net version by way of ikvm.net
here s some codeproject articles on using itextsharp and pdfbox from c#
and if you re really a masochist you could call into adobe s pdf ifilter with com interop

158905
ssl	https

if you can t get an answer on the rewriterule syntax here are two other options for you write an custom irule on bigip see f5 devcentral that looks for 301 responses and convert them to ssl
let the url pass into your websphere server and do a programmatic redirect that sends out https

158905
ssl	https
let the url pass into your websphere server and do a programmatic redirect that sends out https
however because f5 terminates the ssl connection you have to set a custom header that you configure see pq86347 so the java request.getscheme works as you would expect


158997
actionscript	mxml
actionscript is used to program behaviors components and other things outside or what mxml does
thus if you want to attach an event to a component one would write actionscript code
hope that helps

159489
ssl	https
the redirect will be returned to the client in http mode rather than https causing the ssl session to fail
following is an example of how an http 302 redirect response causes the ssl session to fail to request an ssl session a user types without a trailing slash
the client browser sends an ssl request to the clientssl virtual server which resides on the big-ip ltm system

159489
ssl	https	ssl	https
when the client receives the http 302 redirect response it sends a new request to the big-ip ltm virtual server that specifies http not https
as a result the ssl connection fails
configuring an http profile to rewrite urls in big-ip ltm version 9.x you can configure an http profile to rewrite urls so that redirects from an http server specify the https protocol

159507
swt	swing	swt	swing
as for java both netbeans and eclipse ides are good choices. to design guis in java you can use swt awt or swing widget toolkits
i heard that some people experienced problems with swt projects running on netbeans
however netbeans comes with a built-in gui builder for swing a very powerful widget toolkit. of course there s also a plug-in for eclipse that allows you to build swing guis so it basically comes down to which ide you prefer.

160067
cvs	svn
getting all the branches and tags exactly correct might be a bit more work but if you want to just save revision history for a few branches it should be pretty easy
i m also of the opinion that you won t really gain anything by switching back to cvs but if you want to do so then you ll likely be writing your own script
the svn export command will undoubtedly be useful in this endeavor

160407
accessor	properties
if you do want them in a java file despite the shortcomings already mentioned it s a lot easier to write a program to morph the properties file into a java source file than it is to try and extract the strings from free-form java source
all you then need to do is modify the accessor class to use the in-built strings in the separate class rather than loading them at run time


160899
rss	feed
you could use the fetch page module trim it to just the items inside the news feed loop though each list item and use an item builder module to mangle the relevant bits as a proper rss feed
then in the head of your document you d put in an rss link like so this is of course completely ass-backwards but would work for a quick fix or in situations where you had no control over the body of the page


161358
persistent	transient	persistent	transient
but when you have a transient object there is no session involved
in these cases you need to use merge for updates and persistent for saving
persistent as mentioned above this is used on transient objects

161503
cassini	iis
in this case you need to change the regional settings of the account under which the asp.net app is running
if you are developing with vs2005 or later you re probably running under the cassini web server under the identity of the current user - so just change the current user s settings
if you re using iis you probably want to change the regional settings of the aspnet account - you can do this from regional settings in the control panel by checking the checkbox apply to current user and to the default user profile

161767
ubuntu	centos

ubuntu should get the job done but you might consider a slightly more server oriented distro
in my shop we use centos 5 which is more of an enterprise-oriented distro

161983
struts	stripes
i don t want to start some kind of flame development platform war but in my opinion stripes is a far superior and easier to use framework than struts we migrated from struts a year ago and have never looked back
that said yes you can integrate gwt with struts without too many hassles in fact if you do your entire ui in gwt you don t even need struts you can just rpc straight to your java back end
if you just want to make small components then gwt will work well for that too and i guess you could shudder pass it your struts forms if you wanted to

162664
struts	stripes
servlets is the most basic of the action frameworks and is the basic upon all of the others are built
struts is the most popular action framework but i can t in good conscience recommend it to anyone
struts 2 and stripes are more modern and very similar to each other

162996
perforce	cvs

pretty much any modern version control system will allow this subversion perforce vault git mercurial tfs etc.
the only ones i can think of that won t or that have major caveats are cvs and vss

163277
implements	extends
it is however extremely useful and important to comment the code with references to the records in the defects tracking system or to that extends to any km repository you might have
sometimes a code is changed to implements a workaround to a certain issue with the application behaviour
sometimes the introduced workaround is in no way logical

163395
google-chrome	firefox
after noticing that some of you are still trying to get this to work i decided to try a new approach
my results are far better this time around - at least on google-chrome on linux
i no longer have a windows pc available to me so i can only test on google-chrome firefox on ubuntu

163483
prepare	execute

you should be able to prepare a sql query to validate the syntax and get result set metadata
preparing a query should not execute it

164502
content-length	content-type
first the http headers involved content-type multipart form-data content-length this depends on the sum of the bytes of the contents then you have to build a string with the contents of a post form
lets assume you have the input named file file filename.txt you now add the content of the file after that carriage return you calculate the length of this string and put on the content-length above
ok a complete http request would look like this now some code from the php manual knowing me i ve probably messed the format for the content but this is the general idea

166336
lisp	scheme
on the other hand a c programmer may well consider cl a functional language
most code written in any lisp dialect is certainly much more functional in style than your usual block of c code after all
likewise scheme is very much an imperative language as compared to haskell

167308
inherited	properties
is if you can somehow separate the properties that you want to set .
according the inherited hierarchy of the element you want to set multiple styles on .
you might have a workaround

167434
allocator	stl
but your question seems to be about replacing your containers
i d doubt that is possible except using custom allocator
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost

167434
boost	stl
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost
boost only provides the tr1 containers for those compilers that do not yet include tr1


167536
accessor	properties
moreover simply making all your properties atomic does not make your application thread-safe
also note of course that if you don t specify nonatomic and implement your own accessor methods rather than synthesising them you must implement them in an atomic fashion


168129
scheme	racket

plt scheme features a built-in continuation-based web server
update plt scheme is now called racket

168723
profiling	debugging

sql server profiling is my tool of choice but only for the db end obviously
it should be noted this is for optimizing queries and performance and debugging

169351
ant	maven

forget ant
maven is the way to go if you ask me

169755
boost	allocator
with boost you can pick and choose what you use
we use smart_ptr and boost bind in all of our projects
we write software for cheap cell phones . and if windows ce can run on your hardware i would expect that parts of boost would be applicable. there are parts of boost that have no allocator and you might find them useful

171371
multiplying	multiplication
iir filter
the fir filter works by keeping a series of samples and multiplying each of those samples by a fixed coefficient which is based on the position in the series
the results of each of these multiplication is accumulated and is the output for that sample

171376
lisp	scheme
the make-array definition with examples however if you must be functional that is you want to keep around both the old and new lists you want the old and new to share as much memory as possible
then you should use the common lisp equivalent of hazzen s code this looks slow because it is and that s probably why it s not included in the standard
hazzen s code is the scheme version which is useful is that s what you re using

171443
ubuntu	linux
the three overlay filesystems that i know of in linux are unionfs aufs and minifo
unionfs is included in recent ubuntu kernels


172270
accessor	properties

always use accessor methods
declare accessors using properties you make life much simpler for yourself if you always use accessor methods to assign values to instance variables except in and dealloc methods

172843
memcpy	calloc	memcpy	malloc
or if a boolean variable s default value is true store it s inverse value in the structure the reason for this is that calloc zero-initializes memory for you
while this will involve the overhead for zeroing memory most compilers are likely to have this routine highly-optimized -- more optimized that malloc new with a call to memcpy


172899
wordpress	joomla
you can check out that site at chhobi.net
if you don t have many complex requirements i think wordpress is not a bad idea
if you need to expand the site later on and add different functionality like forums gallery polls etc. you better go for a proper cms solution like joomla drupal and likewise

172929
g++	gcc
as i understand both decide whether to compile a program as c or as c++ based on the filename extension
both are capable of linking against the c++ standard library but only g++ does this by default
so if you have a program written in c++ that doesn t happen to need to link against the standard library gcc will happen to do the right thing

172929
g++	gcc
so if you have a program written in c++ that doesn t happen to need to link against the standard library gcc will happen to do the right thing
but then so would g++
so there s really no reason not to use g++ for general c++ development

173007
g++	gcc	g++	gcc
gcc gnu c compiler g++ gnu c++ compiler the main differences gcc will compile .c .cpp files as c and c++ respectively
g++ will compile .c .cpp files but they will all be treated as c++ files
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this

173090
floating-point	fractions
its only possible purpose for existing is for winning an obfusticated code contest
there s no significance to the long numbers you posted -- they re an artifact of the underlying floating-point implementation filtered through god-knows how many intermediate layers
bit-shifting by a fractions number of bytes is insane and i m surprised it doesn t raise an exception -- but that s javascript always willing to redefine insane

173406
firefox	safari
currently i believe that safari is the only shipping browser to support any of these and i believe it only supports the client side databases and local storage parts
edit olliej correction firefox 3 supports the application cache but alas not the client side db


173419
profiling	benchmarking
into your code allowing you to arbitrarily benchmarking any section of code note only recommended for short sections not things taking dozens of milliseconds or more
its accurate to the clock cycle though in some rare cases it can change how the code in between is compiled in which case you re better off with a profiling though profiling are generally more effort to use for specific sections of code
it only works on x86

174568
spaces	delimiter	spaces	delimiter
the only problem i haven t resolved is the comma delimiter
here is a query on a similar structure that separates the tags using a spaces
edit here is the complete version using your tables and using a comma delimiter i suppose for future reference i should explain a bit about what is going on

174728
boost	stl	boost	allocator
as evan mentioned writing proper allocator can help with this but if you re counting every byte used or concerned with memory fragmentation it may be wiser to hand-roll a solution that s tailored for your specific problem as the stl has been optimized for the most general usage
you may also choose not to use stl for a particular case because more applicable containers exist that are not in the current standard such as boost array or boost unordered_map


175169
ubuntu	opensuse
i used xdg-desktop-menu and then analyzed its output
the correct menu file needs to explicitly name the outer menu applications as follows this worked fine in kubuntu ubuntu and fedora core 9
couldn t make it work on opensuse though

175435
ubuntu	linux
however in my experience and observation more sites running php are running on linux than windows
getting apache and php setup on something like ubuntu or fedora is a cinch and testing everything is pretty simple too
i prefer to do development on the platform it will be running on whenever possible

175905
google-chrome	safari
it is a good idea to read the new web standards and take in account what microsoft prepares for ie8
then you can try to be compatible with google-chrome
finally there should be a very specific customer request to invest the time and money making support for the other browsers like opera safari e.t.c

176071
google-chrome	firefox
if the interface does not rely heavily on javascript then it must degrade gracefully enough to be usable in text based and mobile browsers such as opera mobile links lynx iphone etc this includes any necessary optimisations for the screen size informational non-application sites must be at least tested with a screenreader i will put no significant effort into supporting firefox 1 and ie5.5 or below
new functionality must be tested and at least working with upcoming browsers such as ie8 and google-chrome
it s pointless ignoring these as they are both likely to become very popular in the coming months and years

176144
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	firefox
my support list in order of priority currently looks like this unless a client expresses a need to expand it safari 3 firefox 2 firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 beta public-facing functionality works looks correct in ie 6 google-chrome the reason i take this approach is that first it s best to work in a standards-compliant browser before tweaking to broken engines
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

176144
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also a side effect of targeting safari first ie is likely to be less painful as the webkit team has gone to great lengths to comply with existing practices wherever possible
google-chrome comes last because it s so likely to just work if safari is good to go
edit firefox 2 comes before firefox 3 because its support set is more restricted

176271
client-side	server-side

never never never use javascript or any other client-side technology for the only validation
you can use client-side validation to save some load on your server or make your app seem more responsive by showing the error sooner when validation fails but you should always validate using server-side code

176285
client-side	server-side

depending on the requirements of your project you may or may not want to implement client-side validation
however server-side validation should always be implemented

178368
inherited	properties

consider just using composition instead of trying to simulate multiple inherited
you can use interfaces to define what classes make up the composition eg isteerable implies a properties of type steeringwheel ibrakable implies a properties of type brakepedal etc

179813
verilog	vhdl
for hdl choice verilog is to c as vhdl is to ada
so verilog is easier to get started with but you can make mistakes more easily
check your simulation and compilation warnings to avoid those problems

180462
inherited	properties

i also heavily recommend looking into a component based design using composition rather than inherited
the gist of the idea is to model object based on their underlying properties and allow the properties to do all of the work for you

180634
inherited	subclassing

i ve always used inherited rather than super
probably due to a delphi background and i always make it private to avoid the problem when the inherited is erroneously omitted from a class but a subclassing tries to use it

180872
prepare	execute
then execute select my_column from my_table where search_column in select value from myvalues ugly but a viable alternative if your list of values is very large
this technique has the added advantage of potentially better query plans from the optimizer check a page for multiple values tablescan only once instead once per value etc may save on overhead if your database doesn t cache prepare statements
your inserts would need to be done in batch and the myvalues table may need to be tweaked to have minimal locking or other high-overhead protections

181118
client-side	server-side
you can then use the link button s server-side click event
if you re looking for a client-side click event - just type it into your server control markup asp.net will emit additional attributes in the html markup that generates


181245
bash	zsh

it serves as a good warning to those of us that don t use bash as our shell because we we ll forget that a feature that s in our day-to-day shell isn t going to be available when this code is run at the appointed time
the use of there is perfectly valid zsh but not sbin sh

181372
matlab	simulink
however if one really needs speed than he can choose to implement the tested logic in c c++ etc
for further comparison with python i can say that matlab provides a full package for you to do your work without the need of looking around for external libraries and implementing extra functions
one last point about matlab which i see is not mentioned in the answers here is that it has a very powerful visual modeling simulation environment called simulink

181801
innodb	myisam
i d definitely make sure you are familiar with indexing techniques and the specifics of the database you plan to use
with regards to your slow count on the huge table i would assume you were using the innodb table type in mysql
i have some tables with over 100 million records using myisam under mysql and the count is very quick

181815
firefox	safari

for me both the bbc sites you link to get the proper characters in the window title bar using firefox or ie on windows
i suspect you don t have the right fonts installed though i m not sure entirely what fonts it is that you would be missing to cause this problem particularly not if safari works

182664
ubuntu	linux

the latest versions of ubuntu include an installer called wubi which installs ubuntu as a windows application ie it can be uninstalled from add remove programs and sets up the dual boot for you
it s great for those who want to give linux a try without a system overhaul

182776
getdate	datepart
dateadd datepart number date datediff datepart startdate enddate if you run just the most inner call to datediff you get the current month number since timestamp 0
select datediff m 0 getdate
1327 the next part adds that number of months plus 1 to the 0 timestamp giving you the starting point of the next calendar month

184540
realloc	malloc
the only way i could think that would be beneficial to use malloc would be if you needed to change the size of your buffer of data
the new keyword does not have an analogous way like realloc
the realloc function might be able to extend the size of a chunk of memory for you more efficiently

186107
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
their blurb says email activex com control - create and send html email messages with embedded images and attachments using smtp esmtp protocol
easily add email support to your visual basic 6 vb6 asp asp.net vb.net c++ c# foxpro access powerbuilder or delphi application
we use it a lot to automate our software registration system and it d be no problem to splice it into a bit of excel vba okay so it s email rather than sms but it s a start

186279
inherited	properties
adding a properties to the prototype of a function object will make it available to the constructed object as well as to all of the objects which inherit from it
advantages there may not be a hard and fast rule as to why prototypal inherited is an advantageous form of code-reuse
code reuse itself is advantageous and prototypal inherited is a sensible way of going about it

186632
prng	random
there s no need to test whether the output is random since far more research has been done on the algorithm by others than you are capable of reproducing
if you have invented your own prng algorithm then you have a rather different problem because quite aside from testing your code you also need to test your new algorithm
there are various things to do -- i think the most important are statistical testing on the output and peer review by other cryptographers

186703
inherited	subclassing
at that point you have to decide whether to replace type code with subclassing or replace type code with state strategy
when you have set up the inherited structure you can use replace conditional with polymorphism. here is one approach to using polymorphism in your situation define an abstract method in abstractnode named something like display
then actually implement display in each of the sitenode and sitesubnode classes

186771
prng	random

plesae be aware if you have invented your prng you will probably have got it wrong and produced something that has a less than optimal distribution
the basic test for how random your generator is is the chi-square test

186861
set	bag
instead perhaps it s worth considering mitch s idea and let the character s weapons be help in a property bag
remember that a character has-a set of weapons
to me it seems like composition may be the way to go

187043
ssl	https
http you will need an http server on the windows machine and a page that would allow upload iis plus some asp page should suffice and use libcurl to dialog with it
more complicated scenario when security is a concerm would require the use of scp or sftp over and ssl connection
also the libcurl with https could provide a good enough solution

188108
hmac	md5
i ve blogged about it in detail here and i ll give a quick summary below
hmac is a method of ensuring that a message was generated by someone with access to a shared secret
hmac makes use of some sort of one-way hashing function like md5 or sha-1 to encrypt the secret along with a message

189399
prepare	execute
the suggested options are prepare execute it for each value and union the results client-side
requires only one prepare statement
slow and painful

189447
gif	png

unfortunately there is no easy way to create a transparent gif using a bitmap object
see this kb article you can alternatively use the png format that supports transparency with the code you are using

189593
gridview	sqldatasource
this will minimize the round-trip cost
i don t think you ll be able to sort by the check box in the gridview as you need to specify the sort column
you may be able to do this by making a synthetic data source that basically joins your saved session information with the data from the table but not by using a sqldatasource connected directly to the table

189634
inherited	properties
the lower a style declaration appears in the cascade and the more specific it is in targeting the element the more it will weigh against other styles
this is the css2 standard for style inherited if the cascade results in a value use it
otherwise if the properties is inherited use the value of the parent element generally the computed value

190149
prng	random
on a computer your options are pretty limited to pseudo random number generators prngs and given your constraint that they never repeat then a prng is your best option - real random data will occasionally duplicate a number
in your case i d consider using a large prng 32 bit or larger to shuffle your 10 000 numbers and then send the numbers out in the shuffled order
once they re used up you can shuffle again - since the prng is so large you ll be able to go through the 10k numbers many times before duplicating a sequence

190282
websphere	ibm

websphere mq 7 for windows supports x86 and x64 but not itanium 64bit
it only officially supports visual c++ 2005 for development at the moment but ibm usually issues ptfs for toleration on a regular basis so it shouldn t be too long before c++ 2008 support is there

190303
inherited	properties

there are two main types of inherited you can setup in a db table per entity and table per hierarchy
table per entity is where you have a base entity table that has shared properties of all child classes

190363
imperative	declarative

hi there are 2 extentions that i know about parallel c# homepage check out somasegars msdn blog on ms june ctp for parallel 3.5 extenstions msdn the library is made up of the following components the task parallel library tpl which provides support for imperative data and task parallelism
parallel linq plinq which provides support for declarative data parallelism

190885
dictionary	map
communiti - community create a function which compares each stem to a list of the words that were reduced to that stem and attempts to determine which is most similar
comparing communiti against community and communities in such a way that community will be recognized as the more similar option personally i think the way i would do it would be a dynamic form of #1 building up a custom dictionary database by recording every word examined along with what it stemmed to and then assuming that the most common word is the one that should be used
if my body of source text uses communities more often than community then map communiti - communities. a dictionary-based approach will be more accurate in general and building it based on the stemmer input will provide results customized to your texts with the primary drawback being the space required which is generally not an issue these days

190962
prepare	execute
you can do prepare statements which is similar but different
here is an example the prepare statements are often used to see an execution plan for a given query
since they are execute with the execute command and the sql can be assigned to a variable you can approximate the some of the same behavior as dynamic sql

191069
turbogears	web2py
pylons is built on top of paste see below
turbogears 1.0.4.4 released 2008-03-07 the rapid web development megaframework you ve been looking for. combines cherrypy kid sqlobject and mochikit
after reviewing the website check out quickstart manual web2py currently version 1.43 everything in one package with no dependencies

191706
punctuation	words
then go backwards some fraction of this number of words or to the beginning and forward the remaining number of words to select the rest of the context
in this way you just split the entire corpus on whitespace find the first occurence of the term perhaps using a fuzzy match to find subterms and account for punctuation and apply the above algorithm
you could even be creative about introducing ellipses if the first non-selected term doesn t end in punctuation etc

193299
config	ini
it does have some runtime dependencies but for ini files it should only require commons collections lang and logging
i ve used commons config on projects with their properties and xml config
it is very easy to use and supports some pretty powerful features

193952
superclass	subclassing

call is for calling non-virtual static or superclass methods the target of the call is not subject to overriding
callvirt is for calling virtual methods so that if this is a subclassing that overrides the method the subclassing version is called instead

194143
ant	buildr

some people like ivy which is a dependency managing thingy for ant so i suppose that people coming from an ant background will like it
others like buildr

194248
lxml	elementtree
elementtree as in python 2.5 has only a small feature set compared to full-blown xml libraries but it s enough for many applications
if you need a validating parser or complete xpath support lxml is the way to go
for a long time it used to be quite unstable but i haven t had any problems with it since 2.1

194258
ant	maven
i know people who quite like it and bristle at criticisms that were true for maven 1 it has come a long way
groovy is offering some cool stuff in the build space because they build on ant
gant is used in grails but may be subsumed into gradle

194456
client-side	server-side

edit i ll leave this answer here as a sort of theoretical reference point but it sounds like the autocompleter answer is likely to be more useful to you disclaimer although i work for google which clearly has suggest elements in various uis i haven t looked at any of the code around this area nor even spoken to anyone about the client-side aspect
the server-side language is probably irrelevant here

195206
swt	swing
if you dont like swing its come a long way - metal is dead long live systemdefault l f
there are options like swt or even qt bindings for java qtjambi
for c or c++ go qt its apis are really nice

195398
postgresql	mysql
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
postgresql does comply better with standards so it can be easier to replace later
in the end the choice has so many variables that no matter which way you go you ll find some important issue that makes it the right choice

196328
cruisecontrol	teamcity
however once you passed that hump i feel that cruisecontrol is pretty flexible enough to allow you to do different sort of things to fit different scenarios
besides cruisecontrol documentation its wiki page also has some useful information as well
i do not have a direct experience with teamcity

196580
apache	nginx
from a raw performance perspective nginx is faster but not so much faster that i would include that as a determining factor
apache has the advantage in the area of modules available and the fact that it is pretty much standard
any web host you go with will have it installed and most techs are going to be very familiar with it

196705
postgresql	mysql
you will find more than 500 users there and some of them are development companies building projects for their clients
my impression is that most of them use postgresql that s what i do to and some others use the google app engine
in fact web2py is the only framework that allows you to write code once and the same code will run on gae sqlite mysql postgresql oracle mssql and firebird with the limitations imposed by gae

196705
django	web2py	django	web2py
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and web2py has a configuration file at the app not at the project level like them
webp2y logs all tracebacks server side for the administrator django and pylons do not
web2py programs often run on gae unmodified

196933
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but the savings in transferred bytes can be enormous
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google-chrome
it apparently doesn t work this way in safari 3

197420
pthreads	fork
having said this i would not use this code - i would either be inclined to fork mklink or look at the native library from jruby jpython sorry i cant look it up atm as my network connection is flakey
i seem to recall that jruby has written a library that wraps up various pthreads apis into java thinks like chown that are required for ruby compliance but are not cross platform
this library is being used by the jpython folks who seem very pleased with it

197429
boost	stl
however the stl proposes std for_each but its syntax is a lot less intuitive
here is its prototype it takes two iterators defining a valid range and applies the unary function or functor f to each object in this range. you can rewrite your example using std for_each like this however if you want to stay close to the classical syntax of the for each construct and if you re ok about using boost you can use boost.foreach which will let you write


198325
vb.net	vb6

if you re converting a large application perhaps you should just upgrade to vb.net which will be cheaper
there are some features in vb6 with no exact equivalent in c# the error handling late binding etc

198325
vb.net	vb6
there are some features in vb6 with no exact equivalent in c# the error handling late binding etc
ask yourself why it s worth the manual effort to convert those when you could go to vb.net which does support them
and if you don t believe me and no-one s voted for my answer sob sob

198366
implements	extends

codemirror comes with support for 60+ languages and addons that implements more advanced editing functionality autocompletion code folding configurable key bindings search replace linter integration etc.
a rich programming api and a css theming system are available for customizing codemirror and extends it with new functionality

198607
xna	slimdx

xna provides several math constants including 3d specialists like pi 2 etc. and some advanced math functions with float precision though not the trigonometric functions
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big

199668
division	subtraction	division	multiplication	division	addition
note this catches integer addition subtraction overflows and i realized that your question involves multiplication
in which case division is likely the best approach
this is commonly a way that calloc implementations make sure that the params don t overflow as they are multiplied to get the final size

199754
mouse	keyboard

press release are interaction events not mouse events
if you activate a button or mc with the keyboard by tabbing to it and pressing space it will fire a press event but not a mousedown

199867
bash	zsh	bash	zsh
for a while i was the maintainer of the freebsd port of the bash tab-completion scripts but abandoned it as soon as i tried zsh for the first time
it can do everything bash can do but more easily and more elegantly
it also has the nice property of having extremely bash-like keystrokes so if you re on a system without zsh you ll be able to make do even if it wouldn t feel as nice

200235
ubuntu	linux

i tried the first alpha version current is 3 of the flex builder under ubuntu and it was just okay but not useable for productive just alpha flashdevelop works only under windows maybe with wine.
and in my opinion it s not a good ide fdt is on eye level with the flex builder but also not free and i don t know if it runs innately on linux

200341
jar	war
heck you can store content directly in a war file which is basically a jar file with a few extra bits
yes you may need to write a custom resolver to use classloader.getresourceasstream but basically as you re given the ability to generate the content however you like fetching it from a jar file seems perfectly reasonable
you ll probably want to make sure it only fetches a very specific set of extensions though

200581
jar	war
in a jar or war file and pull them at runtime
to load a resource from your deployment jar use the following code
this.getclass .getclassloader .getresourceasstream filename

200712
hex	binary
bring up the open file dialog in visual studio. click the little triangle on the open button and select open with. now select binary editor
you should be able to edit the hex values at the beginning of the file to include any byte order pattern you need
this wikipedia article describes what you will need to set the byte order markers to be for the different file formats utf-8 or utf-16 for example

200715
xslt	xquery

xslt is an example of a functional programming language for doing transformations of data or documents represented as xml -- admittedly a very verbose and very limited one
if i remember correctly xquery is also purely functional

200861
hex	binary
ie
to unpack you can encode the result back to hex similarly however note that for your example there s probably no need to take the round-trip through a hex representation at all when encoding
just use the md5 binary digest directly

201298
configobj	configparser
the downside here if the file will be hand-edited by a user errors could be hard to catch and debug
ini format i ve been using configobj for this with quite a bit of success
configobj is essentially a replacement for configparser with support for nested sections and much more

201835
ienumerable	ilist
if the underlying code is using yield to generate the ienumerable or is using linq then you ll end up holding open any resources used
you should copy the ienumerable into another ienumerable before returning it
by using ilist you make this a requirement so that nobody can inadvertently return an ienumerable

202192
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
if it turns out you are forced to perform a copy where the first line is replaced and the rest of the data shall be copied as-is i suggest using a and
first use bufferedreader s readline to read the first line
modify it and write it to the bufferedwriter

202362
rss	feed

you can certainly get rss statistics
if you are hosting your own rss feed you can parse the iis or apache logs to find all requests for the feed and then do some processing to aggregate these per machine

202941
django	turbogears

i think django has some of the best documentation of any project i ve worked on
that s the reason we chose it over turbogears two years ago and it s been the best technology choice we ve made

203012
kde	gnome
if there is any example of a nice integrated linux environment please please please show me i really want to use linux
and i know there s qt and other managers like kde etc
i noticed the same thing so it probably isn t gtk or gnome alone you basically just answered your own question - mac os x has one desktop environment centered around cocoa which has a lot of very good programmers and designers spending much time designing discussing and implementing it

203242
inherited	subclassing

in short single table inherited sti is a design pattern that allows a mapping of oop inherited relationships to the database
if you define any subclassing from your activerecord model objects then you should consider sti

203266
django	turbogears	django	web.py

danj here s a pretty good list of all the known python frameworks i would recommend looking at the wikipedia articles for django turbogears pylons etc
i wrote an article on web.py once but it got deleted - they explain the philosophical and component differences between the frameworks pretty well

203428
postgresql	mysql

in postgresql you can do this select whatever from mytable where something ilike match this
i m not sure if there is an equivalent for mysql but you can always do this which is a bit ugly but should work in both mysql and postgresql

203444
prng	random

normally seeding a new state takes quite while for a serious prng and making new ones each time won t really help much. the only case i can think of where you might want more than one prng is for different systems say in a casino game you have one generator for shuffling cards and a separate one to generate comments done by the computer control characters this way really dedicated users can t guess outcomes based on character behaviors
a nice solution for seeding is to use this random.org they supply random numbers generated from the atmospheric noise for free

203550
g++	gcc

use g++ test.cpp instead since this is c++ code
or if you really want to use gcc add -lstdc++ to the command line like so gcc test.cpp -lstdc++ running md5 against the a.out produced under each scenario shows that it s the same output

203550
g++	gcc
or if you really want to use gcc add -lstdc++ to the command line like so gcc test.cpp -lstdc++ running md5 against the a.out produced under each scenario shows that it s the same output
but yeah g++ probably makes your world a simpler place


204203
rsa	3des

sslstream uses schannel that is supplied with the operating system. the suites are listed in the default order in which they are chosen by the microsoft schannel provider for windows vista rsa with aes_128 cbc sha rsa with aes_256 cbc sha rsa with rc4_128 sha .
windows xp rsa with rc4 128 md5 rsa with rc4 128 sha rsa with 3des cbc sha ..

204279
vb.net	vb6

i found vb.net really hard to pick up after working in vb since 1991 - the languages are similar enough to feel familiar but different enough to constantly trip me up
to make it even more confusing i do a lot of work with excel vba which is still vb6

204416
implements	extends
if so you could extends it to include an isobjectderived method with semantics that it returns true iff the class only derives from object
since you are writing the class all you would need to do is implements it in the parent and have it return true if the object is of class parent and false otherwise
you could also do this with reflection by checking the superclass of the current class and make sure it is object

204491
cvs	svn

a basic hosting plan at dreamhost gets you tons of web hosting space bandwidth database jabber chat server cvs subversion repository and more for a little more than 5 bucks a month
beanstalk seems nice svn only but i don t have any experience with it

204777
union	distinct
selectmany - for each element of source selector is invoked and a sequence of values is returned
union - when the object returned by this method is enumerated union enumerates first and second in that order and yields each element that has not already been yielded
edit i ve moved distinct to preserving order based on this implementation

205178
prng	random
as noted by others software systems are only pseudo-random and must maintain state
a compromise is to use a hardware based rng to provide an entropy pool stored state which is made available to seed a prng
this is done quite explicitly in the linux implementation of dev random 3 and dev urandom 4

205216
cassini	iis

when you re running a web site using cassini the account used by the web server process is your own account that you use to log on to your windows machine
that account will be different on iis

205745
accessor	properties

i suppose my biggest gripe about my own code is the explosion of accessor
next design work i do i ve set myself the challenge of using the smallest number of properties

206153
queue	fifo
even though you are saying that you want fifo order you want fifo order with respect to a random set of variables which is essentially random order
if you want to use queue you need to be able to determine order before the message goes in the queue not after it goes in


206333
move	drag
you can use these to drag the relationship arrow up and down
be careful not to move the endpoints though because visio will disassociate that connector from the table object


206371
translation	localization
separate configuration from localization
that way localizers can translation the text and you can deal with different configurations per locale features layout etc
you don t want localizers to have the ability to mess with your app

206904
dreamweaver	aptana

unfortunately the best one i ve used as far as wysiwyg is dreamweaver and i don t like it that much either but it is a standard part of the toolset in many web shops and you just get used to it
i currently use aptana for that sort of prototyping which is not really wysiwyg but has a great preview function and i don t end up having to go back through crappy wysiwyg generated markup and cleaning it up later

206964
soappy	suds
does not work on python 2.5+ zsi very painful to use and development is slow
has a module called soappy which is different than soapy above
newer libraries suds very pythonic and easy to create wsdl-consuming soap clients

207062
google-chrome	firefox
a folder called google-chrome can mean any number of things
google-chrome is a general term for the ui of a browser
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base

207350
accessor	properties

add a private accessor for the class to your test project
use the accessor to set up the private properties of the class in some known way instead of using the classes methods to do so

207937
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock

if a map-type structure is more appropriate you can use a concurrenthashmap
with a list a readwritelock is probably the most effective way

208011
sudo	passwd

the systems i run have a sudo -only policy
the root passwd is disabled and people have to use sudo to get root access

208025
sudo	passwd

while it is a good idea to use a sudo only policy like chris suggested depending on the the size of your system an ldap approach may also be helpful
we complement that by a file that contains all the root passwd but the root passwd are really long and unmemorable

210235
xsl-fo	xslt
when you re talking about formatting xml documents and that s pretty much what you re talking about that s the tool designed to do it
from wiki the general idea behind xsl-fo s use is that the user writes a document not in fo but in an xml language. xhtml docbook and tei are all possibilities but it could be any xml language
then the user obtains an xslt transform either by writing one themselves or by finding one for the document type in question

210462
udp	tcp

have the server listen for broadcast on a specific port on the network must use udp when client starts have it broadcast some ping request on that port
when the server sees a ping it send back a message with the tcp address and port required for the client to connect to it

210652
opera	firefox

you cannot do that in all browsers supposedly ie does allow it but mozilla and opera do not
when you compose a message in gmail the attach files feature is implemented one way for ie and any browser that supports this and then implemented another way for firefox and those browsers that do not

210693
prepare	execute
i understand that this would be useful for debugging but it is not the way prepare statements work
parameters are not combined with a prepare statement on the client-side so pdo should never have access to the query string combined with its parameters
the sql statement is sent to the database server when you do prepare and the parameters are sent separately when you do execute

211049
superclass	subclassing
even a class definition that does not explicitly specify a superclass still has a superclass class cookie end this defines the cookie class with the superclass of object
i ve encountered this error before and it will occur when you have some code trying to reopen a class without specifying the superclass and the programmer s assumption is that the class in this case cookie has already been defined and that he is simply reopening it to add some functionality
but if the reopening and the definition are in reverse order you ll get that error because the class will already have been defined as a subclassing of object but is trying to be redefined or reopened with a different superclass

212095
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort from the selection sort category
this would likely be the most confusing sort next to quicksort but once they understand how it sets them up for understanding the quicksort algorithm
insertion sort as an example of the insertion sort category would be covered as it is also a simple sort that they can get a lot of use out of

212488
factors	mean

it depends on your os cpu compiler and possibly other factors
in general it means the cpu bus could not complete a command or suffered a conflict but that could mean a whole range of things depending on the environment and code being run

212565
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort this will teach how to merge which is important because there are a ton of speedups you can get by merging two sorted lists together as well as how to divide the problem into smaller sub problems important for dealing with hierarchical structures and also used in quick sort
quicksort though faster is much harder to understand
you need two scanning variables a pivot item etc.

213336
haskell	ocaml
f# - basically ocaml on the clr
very nice very clean scala - not a strictly functional language but much better for it than ruby haskell - everybody s favorite
you ll notice that three of these four languages are statically typed

213934
struts	wicket
alternative view technologies like wicket tapestry etc
containers like spring and libraries like struts all can be learnt slowly
the best practices and review posted all over internet definitely help

215473
opera	firefox	webkit	gecko
even if you test with mozilla firefox opera and konqueror from kde 4 on windows you re not even close to covering most of the userbase
that being said if you narrow your focus to browsers with support for modern css you ll find that there s only a few underlying engines trident ie gecko mozilla webkit apple khtml kde and presto opera
taking these individually trident only used by ie in windows you re already testing it

215545
delphi	oxygene
but first a warning you will take at least the total development effort it took to write your current delphi application
in our case this effort was warranted since the old delphi application which in fact it was kylix had an end-of-life because of various reasons. our rewrite consisted of two parts rewrite with limited extra functionality followed by a lot of extra functionality the design of the first part already took the second part into account
back to your choices 1- a total rewrite in c# or vb.net in visual studio 2- a partial reuse of your existing delphi business layer code by using oxygene from remobjecs a visual studio plugin with a syntax that is very similar to the delphi syntax

215575
queue	fifo
implements a circular buffer style fifo queue
could be made more generic by creating a structure containing the queue size queue data and queue indexes in and out which would be passed in with the data to add or remove from the queue
these same routines could then handle several queues

215603
move	drag
a way to track where the cursor is so that when it s close to the midpoint of a line you can prepare to grab and drag the line to split it
the mouse move event will play a role in this
not sure which toolkit you re using or i would be more specific about what the event would be named - it might be onmousemove

215746
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari

opera has native svg support firefox has native svg support internet explorer does not include svg support natively
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1

215746
google-chrome	safari
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers


215749
svg	vml

ie has svg support in ie9 but not in ie8 and below
the alternative is vml mozilla claims to support it on its latest version opera claims to support it since v8.0 safari has experimental support probably incomplete chrome seems to have roughly the same level of svg support as safari konqueror uses the same svg engine as safari and chrome - ksvg claims to be in beta

215749
svg	vml
the alternative is vml mozilla claims to support it on its latest version opera claims to support it since v8.0 safari has experimental support probably incomplete chrome seems to have roughly the same level of svg support as safari konqueror uses the same svg engine as safari and chrome - ksvg claims to be in beta
the fact that they have a todo list implies it s not ready for production camino apparently supports svg as well


216153
haskell	scheme
it s not too widely used but definitely seems like a solid language to use especially considering the robustness of drscheme which in fact compiles scheme programs to native binary code
after that - haskell is incredibly interesting
it s a language which does lazy evaluation right and the consequences are incredible including such things as a one-line definition of the fibonnaci sequence

217119
client-side	server-side
this way you can build helpers on the server-side that sit between your client-side app and any existing controllers
the helper is specific to that functionality and plugin and you do not open up blanket access to your models from the client-side


217361
dictionary	map

can you use dictionary string string instead of namevaluecollection
since dictionary t t implements ienumerable you could use linq as so edit actually you may be able to use dictionary directly as if it doesn t map key value the way you want you can always go back to linq

217672
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties

inherited generally maps to an is-a relationship
since your container is a list but with some other things i would inherit from list and add your additional properties to your subclassing

217688
inherited	properties
i would suggest you call it testsuite and make the list as a properties
has-a is much easier to maintain compared to inherited
in general i d be very careful to inherit something like a list

217708
config	ini
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions centralised location for the sites configuration on each server so easy to keep upto date server doesn t change that oftern updateing the config is simple with an update script
can be generated by the script all my sites have a function that rebuilds the config file useing the config assoc array
updates that effect the config file are as simple as config key new value

217726
ienumerable	ilist
usually you only need a get property here
you can control access to the list by choosing to return a readonly version of the list with .asreadonly or just exposing the list as an ienumerable
in cases where i want tests to be a list i usually implement ilist and call an internal list field for the actual implementations of the ilist

217918
ubuntu	linux
later edit you could also try setting up a linux unix firwall with igd activated
here is a forum post for ubuntu
and there is a miniupnp project too

218749
punctuation	words
it s easier for my brain to tokenise each words and understand its meaning
although because the punctuation characters are harder to read it s still hard going - but maybe that will change given a bit of time to get used to it i ll update this answer again tomorrow assuming i can make it through an entire day like this


218773
mouse	keyboard

if i look at the official document object model events document mouse events fields are defined as read-only
keyboard events are not defined there i suppose mozilla followed this policy for them

219124
fastcgi	scgi
flup is another way to run with wsgi for any webserver that can speak fastcgi scgi or ajp
from my experience only fastcgi really works and it can be used in apache either via mod_fastcgi or if you can run a separate python daemon with mod_proxy_fcgi
wsgi is a protocol much like cgi which defines a set of rules how webserver and python code can interact it is defined as pep333

219490
sqldatasource	objectdatasource

my understanding is that with sqldatasource connection management is performed for you and you have nothing to fear
objectdatasource doesn t talk to the database directly in the first place so it will be safe -- as long as the underlying object performs its connection and reader management correctly

219835
accessor	properties
compare to the same for properties vs fields since properties before the same function as events encapsulation via accessor also - events do not mention anything about fields
they only define the accessor add remove
the delegate backer is an implementation detail

219869
ubuntu	linux
well i know it s not a command and it s unlikely to be found on many unices but linux
in my ubuntu hardy bash_completion is already configured very well and that means not only for files and direcotires
for example if i type i get praise propdel propedit propget proplist propset and even i get automaticaly svn propget svn keywords it works also for ant and make automatically reading the default files or the ones specified on the commandline

219993
hlsl	glsl
these languages opengl s gl shader lang and high level shader lang and directx s equivalents are c style syntax and really easy to use
some examples of hlsl can be found here for xna game studio and direct x
i don t have any decent glsl references but i m sure there are a lot around

220089
jboss	glassfish
jboss from redhat should work just fine on linux windows for sure
community a much much bigger community around jboss
glassfish still forming its community

220799
icmp	tcp

the site may be behind a firewall that blocks icmp requests ping
http requests that your browser sends out goes over tcp ip

220901
inherited	properties
but as a consequence you can t bind to type for real
the system.componentmodel code is identical between simple bindings and list bindings give or take a currency manager so simple bindings also inherited this behaviour
equally you can t bind to properties of a class that implements ilist ilistsource since this is interpreted in a special way

222573
allocator	stl

it s useful if you want to separate allocator from initialization
stl uses placement new to create container elements

223113
inherited	subclassing
yes any constructors you change in foo that bar or bah depend on will require you to modify bar and bah accordingly
no there is no way in .net to inherited constructors
but you can achieve code reuse by calling a base class s constructor inside the subclassing s constructor or by calling a virtual method you define like initialize

223288
client-side	server-side
if javascript validation didn t work for any reason regular server-side validation scenario page reload with error informations takes place using the same server-side script
this solution isn t as responsive as pure client-side validation needs time to send receive data between client and server but is quite simple and you don t need to translate validation rules to javascript


223414
union	distinct
if you have setup your class to override equals you or have an iequalitycomparer you can directly call the distinct extension method to return the unique results from the list
as an added bonus you can also use the union and intersect methods to merge or filtering between two lists
another option would be to grouping by the id and then select the first element

223582
expression-blend	silverlight
now there is an eclipse plug-in available for you to use silverlight with eclispe
so you will be able to use expression-blend to design your ui and use java for the backend coding future plan i think
check out this link for more details

223887
profiling	debugging
xdebug is the most popular due to it s extra features beyond that of what you ve even described
xdebug will do profiling tracing into the valgrind format that you can use programs like kcachegrind and wincachegrind to evaluate
your only other real alternative to the debugging facilities xdebug provides is zend debugger which is a part of the zend platform again available as an extension

224067
hash-collision	key
i guess the only way around that would be to pre-exchange digital signature key or to have a trusted communication hub
possible attacks include if i can generate a hash-collision then i have two secret numbers with the same hash
so once i know everyone else s secret numbers i can choose which of my secret numbers to reveal thus selecting one of two possible results

224357
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
i can think of one bad one its the one mysql gives for why their table names are case sensitive
each table is a file on disk your filesystem is case-sensitive and the mysql devs forgot to
this is heaps of fun when you move a mysql schema to a case-insensitive filesystem

224866
vb6	vba
i think this originates from the old vba access jet currency data type being the first fixed point decimal type in the language
decimal only came in version 1.0 style not fully implemented in vb6 vba6 jet 4.0
the rule of thumb for storage of fixed point decimal values is to store at least one more decimal place than you actually require to allow for rounding

225360
spaces	delimiter
this groups all white spaces as a delimiter
so if i have the string this should yield the strings hello and world and omit the empty spaces between the and the
as vonc pointed out the backslash should be escaped because java would first try to escape the string to a special character and send that to be parsed

226422
innodb	myisam
optimum server settings are going to be different to a mainly myisam db
make sure the size of the innodb file is big enough to hold all your data or you ll be crucified by constant reallocation when you change the engines of the tables


226519
division	multiplication
i m guessing though that the choice of multiplication vs
division isn t going to have a big performance impact in your application


226546
vb.net	vb6
support for vb6 has ended but vb.net is still very much alive and gaining new features
vb.net compiles to msil bytecode that depends on some of the the .net libraries depending on which .net framework classes you use
some of those libraries are not written in pure .net or are just wrappers around the windows api

227544
try-catch	exception-handling
because it is easier the code will on average be better written and less buggy
to me that programmer and quality overhead is the primary argument against using try-catch for process flow
the computer overhead of exception-handling is insignificant in comparison and usually tiny in terms of the application s ability to meet real-world performance requirements

228349
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar

i believe the uinavigationcontroller assumes that your controller view frames don t include the area beneath the navigation bar
uibarstyleblacktranslucent is more often used for uitoolbar so apple probably didn t make it easy to use it nicely with uinavigationbar

228349
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
uibarstyleblacktranslucent is more often used for uitoolbar so apple probably didn t make it easy to use it nicely with uinavigationbar
you ll probably need to abandon the uinavigationcontroller or start hacking the frames careful with rotations if you want to reliably render under the bar area
also if your intention is to hide the navigation bar after a few seconds you ll have a much easier time if you make it fade out like the photos app instead of trying to slide it up like mobile safari

229451
gif	png
note also that irfanview does an awful job of converting 32bit png image to 256 allowing only one transparent color which looks bad if full color was dithered
i see that the gimp manual states his png8 format like gif uses only one bit for transparency
only two transparency levels are possible transparent or opaque

230208
daemons	systemd
so far we ve had zero issues as a result of this process except when the build server kicks in while our source control systemd also known as the daemons spawn see so many of my recent remarks performs a large multi-file check-in
as daemons spawn doesn t support transacted check-ins. however this is a very rare occurrence -- perhaps once every 5 or 6 weeks
and a force rebuild immediately afterward takes care of it

230561
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
i actually use it on linux
on debian ubuntu sudo aptitude install winpdb then just put this in your code where you want it to break import rpdb2
rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger_interactive_password then start winpdb and attach to your running script

231171
multiplying	subtract

this will work for you basically it finds the flooy by multiplying by one with zero precision
then it can do ceil round by subtract that from the total calling the built in functions then adding the result back on edit fixed for -ve numbers

231216
stdout	fflush
it would mean that the program would potentially behave incorrectly if the user invoked the script without the -u option
i usually use a custom stdout like this .
now all your print calls which use sys.stdout implicitly will be automatically fflush ed

231706
ssl	https

as far as ssl goes you can buy separate certificates for the domain and subdomain or a single wildcard .foo.com cert that covers them both naturally the wildcard cert will be more expensive
if you have an https page that requests items from other domains all will be well as long as everything is https

231706
ssl	https
you can do ssl cross-domain ajax using iframes as long as everything is https and the https scheme is used in the iframe src
summarizing short answer no true cross-domain xhr not allowed workaround with iframes more efficient need 2 ssl certs or wildcard cert somewhat complicated workaround with proxy less efficient can do with 1 or 2 ssl certs 1 with backend request to bar.foo.com via http somewhat complicated


232382
subtraction	modulo	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	modulo	addition	multiplication
by quick calculations in sample programs showed so you want to use as little division as possible in favor of multiplication or modulo
not shown are subtraction addition and comparison operators cause they blow all of these out of the water
also using final as much as possible allows the jvm to do certain optimizations

234867
bazaar	git
for more technical people git could be good it has been developed by linux kernel people after all
bazaar or mercurial are probably better for those looking for ease of use


235176
perforce	svn

perforce
commercial software and it s not free like svn but it s great

235529
multiplying	subtract
then you use subtractive blending look up glblendequation to subtract your minimum value
then you use additive blending to multiplying everything up by 1 max-min which may need multiple passes
if you really want to do this please post back the gl_vendor and gl_renderer for your graphics-card

235672
fgets	fseek
check out flock
if you are certain that the new line will be the same length as the old line you can open the file in read write mode use r+ as the second argument to fopen and call ftell to save the position the line starts at each time before you call fgets to read a line
once you find the line that you want to overwrite you can use fseek to go back to the beginning of the line and fwrite the new data

235727
nemerle	boo

a key factor for linq is the ability of the compiler to generate expression trees. i am using a macro in nemerle that converts a given nemerle expression into an expression tree object. i can then pass this to the where select etc extension methods on iqueryables. it s not quite the syntax of c# and vb but it s close enough for me
i got the nemerle macro via a link on this post it should be possible to create a similar macro for boo

236253
lisp	scheme
in functional languages this kind of situation never arises as i wouldn t be rebound
however with python and also as you ve seen with lisp this is no longer true
the difference with your scheme example is to do with the semantics of the do loop

237216
dictionary	map
there are many different collection types like linked list array map set etc
is the container associative storing key-value pairs like a dictionary
memory footprint and layout

237298
try-catch	exception-handling
if you follow my religion as well and the second statement is true then you are not repeating code unnecessarily
unless you have other requirements my recommendations to improve your code would be 1 put the try-catch in each method not around each method call
2 have the catches within each method catch only the exception-handling you know about

237319
uiview	subviews	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when you re done with your prefs you can animate it out and then remove it as a subviews
you can switch to a uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller based hierarchy and hook your current opengl uiview to a uiviewcontroller s view outlet
then you can use all the regular uinavigationcontroller based navigation stuff

237356
boost	stl	boost	allocator

templates i regulary consume are a multitude of container classes boost smart pointers scopeguards a few stl algorithms
scenarios in which i have written templates custom containers memory management implementing type safety and ctor dtor invocation on top of void allocator common implementation for overloads wiht different types bool containsnan float int bool containsnan double int which both just call a local hidden helper function specific algorithms that are independent of the type as long as the type has certain properties binary serialization

237472
vim	emacs
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth
if you like vim then get steve oualline s vim book


237861
ant	maven
i tend to roll my own repo without maven maven is fine but it doesn t click with me
i run something similar to the bsd ports system that is one big structured tree that contains little ant build files
these build files either checkout the source of a project pull its dependencies from somewhere else in the tree and build it these are for the projects i want to build- mine or pull binaries from somewhere else which might be an external source or my own binaries repository

238937
serializable	deserialization

i use it in a class tree which serializable to a xml file
on the deserialization the parser class returns a pointer to the base class which has a enumeration for the type of the subclass because you don t know which type it is until you parse it

239066
prng	random	prng	random
if you use a so-called true random number generator that uses properties of entropy or noise in its generation then it would be very difficult to produce the same values given some input unless you re able to duplicate the entropic state for both calls into the function - which of course would defeat the purpose of using such a generator.
in the case of remote keyless entry systems they very likely use a prng function that is deterministic in order to take advantage of this feature
there are many ics that provide this sort of functionality to produce random numbers for electronic circuits

239112
lisp	scheme

i hear of others who have used common lisp and clojure
you should use whatever language most motivates you but 99 of folks working through sicp are going to use scheme

240406
fseek	fread
every time you added a new block you would also add it to this vector the correspondent information and save it
now if you wanted to to read a specific block you could do a search on this vector position yourself on the real file with fseek or whatever to the correspondent offset and read x bytes this offset to the start of the other or to the end of the file and do a cast to something depending on the cblocktype examples read some bytes..
fread cbuffer 1 itotalbytes p_file

241506
spaces	delimiter
edit2 added character literals since they could contain quotes that would otherwise be recognized as string delimiter
edit3 fixed the case where a legal expression would become which would not compile by replacing the comment with a spaces rather then an empty string


241908
octal	hex	octal	binary
even a simple task for a human in binary is long winded simple second grade math is still a lot of ones and zeros
so octal became popular because it allowed you to think in groups of three bits and you could use symbols we are familiar with as numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
but groups of four which is another power of 2 gives the humans a lot more mental computing power than octal hex is based on 4 bits which is also a power of 2

multiplying	subtract
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software
take the worst case multiplying for a four bit system 1111 1111 11100001 so it takes 8 bits to store the result of a 4 bit multiplying you will quickly find that if you had a 4 bit system most of the multiplies you want to do will result a number that cannot be stored in 4 bits
so when i saw you taking 64 bit integers the unsigned long long is often 64 bits and multiplying four times that means you need 64 5 or a 320 bit integer to store your answer you were trying to put that answer in a 64 big result which quite often depending on the compiler and computer will happily do and will truncate the upper bits leaving you with the lower 64 bits of the result which can easily look smaller than any of your operands which is what i had thought you might have done at first

profiling	debugging
it s great for forensics and debugging
profiling quantifies that it tells you how much time your code spent in each area or how many times a body of code was executed
it helps you improve your code s performance

242348
innodb	myisam
otoh if you were looking to re-code your application to be transaction aware then deciding this setting will be part of the general performance review needed of the innodb settings
the other major thing to watch out for is that innodb does not support fulltext indices nor insert delayed
but then myisam doesn t support referential integrity

242991
rss	feed
try to avoid cdata blocks any time you know html or otherwise won t be used otherwise use it
that said i do agree with jamesh in that you should always prefer atom over rss
i produce a feed reader and when scraping feed always prefer atom over rss

243197
redmine	bugzilla

redmine
it is open source ajax enabled email interface scm integration integrated wiki configurable trackers workflow and roles rss and email notifications i have used jira too hard bugzilla too rubbish and fogbugz too expensive and i think redmine is fantastic

244233
octal	hex
hex maps 4 bits to one hex nibble 0-f so a byte is stored in two nibbles 00-ff
octal was popular on digital equipment dec and other older machines but one octal digit maps to three bits so it doesn t cross byte boundaries as nicely
overall the choice of radix is a way to make your programming easier - use the one that matches the domain best

244294
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	shellsort	heapsort	shellsort
quite apart from the various books on algorithms - sedgewick is one such but there are many others - you could also take a look at jon bentley s programming pearls or more programming pearls books
this would be good anyway - they are excellent - but more programming pearls also includes a library of simple algorithms written in awk including insertion sort heapsort and quicksort
it misses out bubble sort shellsort and bogosort

245207
matlab	simulink

contributing there might be more productive than building your own matlab alternative
if your project requires the functionality of matlab s symbolic then take a look at from my quick google search i didn t find anything comparable to matlab s simulink

245207
matlab	simulink
if your project requires the functionality of matlab s symbolic then take a look at from my quick google search i didn t find anything comparable to matlab s simulink
also python and scipy do have most of the functionality of matlab and i guess scilab s conversion utility would be useful in porting your own m-files into scilab code
your question seems to imply you want to port over matlab toolboxes the only thing about symbolic toolbox i ve found is this.

245210
prepare	execute
i ve pasted the relevant text below
here s a forum post showing an example of prepare statements letting you assign a variable value to the limit clause however i think this bug should get some attention because i can t imagine that prepare statements within a procedure will allow for any procedure-compile-time optimizations
i have a feeling that prepare statements are compiled and execute at the runtime of the procedure which probaby has a negative impact on efficiency

246165
gif	png
you can generate jpeg and png files from c using libjpeg and libpng respectively
yes i m dodging your gif question on purpose
you don t need to do that

246649
vb.net	vb6

imho i would suggest not moving to vb.net at all but instead utilizing your c background and making the move to c#
the reason for this is you already know the syntax and that vb.net is not enough like vb6 to make it as easy a move as you might expect

247038
realloc	malloc
make sure you malloc and free the memory correctly using something like - an alternative is to make data just be a pointer to the elements
you can then realloc data to the correct size as required
of course if you were asking about c++ either of these would be bad practice

247229
lisp	scheme
i got on the functional train and now believe that if you have a lazy language or a good syntax for lambda even that isn t necessary so macros are not all that useful in a purely functional style
so i d recommend practical common lisp and on lisp
if you want to use plt scheme i think most of their defmacro macros will work with define-macro

247229
lisp	scheme
if you want to use plt scheme i think most of their defmacro macros will work with define-macro
or just use common lisp


247869
coalesce	isnull
note though that nz is the same as the t-sql isnull function
it can not take an arbitary number of parameters like coalesce can


247984
cobertura	eclemma

i use a combination of cobertura checkstyle ecl emma and findbugs
eclemma is an awesome eclipse plugin that shows the code coverage by coloring the java source in the editor screenshot - the coverage is generated by running a junit test

248757
sudo	passwd

i would not run the application full time as root but you might want to explore making your application setuid root or setuid to some id that can become root using something like sudo for particular applications
you might be able to set up an account that cannot login use setuid to change your program s id temporarily when needed and have sudo set up to not prompt for passwd but always allow access to that account for specific tasks

248757
sudo	passwd	sudo	passwd
you might be able to set up an account that cannot login use setuid to change your program s id temporarily when needed and have sudo set up to not prompt for passwd but always allow access to that account for specific tasks
this way your program has no special privileges when running normally only elevates it s privileges when needed and is restricted by sudo to only running certain programs
it s been awhile since i ve done much unix development so i m not really sure whether it s possible to set up sudo to not prompt for a passwd or even if there is an api for it but as a fallback you could enable setuid to root only when needed

248757
sudo	passwd
it s been awhile since i ve done much unix development so i m not really sure whether it s possible to set up sudo to not prompt for a passwd or even if there is an api for it but as a fallback you could enable setuid to root only when needed
edit looks like sudo has a nopasswd mode so i think it should work since you re running the programs as external commands


248786
serializable	deserialization

you can t serializable read-only properties
you must have a getter and a setter even if you never intend to use deserialization to turn xml into an object

248786
serializable	deserialization
you must have a getter and a setter even if you never intend to use deserialization to turn xml into an object
for the same reason you can t serializable properties that return interfaces the deserializer wouldn t know what concrete class to instantiate


249381
division	subtract

you can do it with long division
calculate a single digit at a time and subtract to get a remainder which you multiply by 10 to get the numerator for the next step

249589
perforce	svn	perforce	cvs

i agree with the previous yuval - having worked with perforce and svn both in gui and command-line mode i prefer svn
however the company i worked for at the time switched from the free cvs it was using to perforce

249603
perforce	svn
it does not however require locking for ordinary source files those can be opened for editing by multiple users at the same time and then merged back into the depot
i find perforce s system with changelists that group changes to multiple files and treat them as a unit nice
i m sure you can do something similiar with svn but it s not as easy out of the box

251002
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs

try a dvcs like git or bazaar
they are incredibly easy to set up easy to use and offer all the important features of subversion cvs etc

251023
cvs	svn
they would have to access code via our svn and would be unlikely to get paid without meeting unit testing and code review requirements
if contracting i d make sure to have solid experience of both vss check-in out and cvs merge conflict models
working on your own you have a great opportunity to play and learn with the latest - i d be trying out git

251619
equals	gethashcode
by providing a more unique gethashcode function it excerises the equals function far less often
i also optimised the equals function to compare the more unique values before the less unqiue keys
86 000 11 items with 10 000 unique properties runs in 0.34 seconds using the comparer object below without the comparer object it takes 9 minutes 22 seconds hope this helps edit if it was just one string instead of a keyvaluepair where string name+value it would be approx twice as fast

253390
cvs	svn

for cvs pycvs may be worth a look
for svn there is pysvn which is pretty good

253463
redmine	trac

if you plan to do multi-project management in the future choose redmine
with trac you can have multi-project setups as well having a separate environment for each project but in the end it s a workaround

253463
redmine	trac	redmine	trac
with trac you can have multi-project setups as well having a separate environment for each project but in the end it s a workaround
redmine has builtin support for multi-project environments
i previously used trac to manage my projects but i switched to redmine

253463
redmine	trac
redmine uses textile markup but trac uses markdown so i had a couple of troubles there
finally i heard that redmine has some some issues on windows
i haven t tried running redmine on that platform so you d better give it a try or google around

253908
inherited	subclassing
that means that what we are getting here is not overloading it s hiding
the difference between these is crucial to understanding methods in inherited
if your runnable was declared as a subclassing then the run method would hide the run int method in the parent

254005
ubuntu	debian	emacs	textmate

if you are on ubuntu debian plain old emacs with ruby-elisp package isn t bad
it s no textmate but it s not bad

254130
mouse	keyboard

i think adobe needs to drop the focus when the mouse goes out of its client area or provide an option to do so
however i think most flash developers and especially those who make games rely on the fact that keyboard input is caught by the flash application regardless of where the mouse is

255630
dictionary	map

as everyone else has said there s no mapping within a dictionary from value to key
i ve just noticed you wanted to map to from value to multiple keys - i m leaving this solution here for the single value version but i ll then add another answer for a multi-entry bidirectional map

255630
dictionary	map
i ve just noticed you wanted to map to from value to multiple keys - i m leaving this solution here for the single value version but i ll then add another answer for a multi-entry bidirectional map
the normal approach to take here is to have two dictionary - one mapping one way and one the other
encapsulate them in a separate class and work out what you want to do when you have duplicate key or value throw an exception overwrite the existing entry or ignore the new entry

255743
inherited	subclassing
to create a new subclassing within a class cluster you must implement its primitive methods
if what you want is to inherited the behavior of an array it s usually a better idea to do that with a has-a relationship rather than an is-a
that is to write a class that has an nsarray instance variable and simply forwards the relevant messages to it

255786
vim	textmate
fuzzyfinder and fuzzyfinder - textmate - allows you to quickly find files based on portins of a file name
ctags bufexplorer dbext for executing sql commands and getting the results in a vim buffer
ack and the ack plugin for a better grepping experience from within vim

256099
client-side	server-side
but the server-side part is pretty simple
the client-side part is trickier i think
i found this article helpful he s writing things in php but the client side work is pretty much the same

256521
skip-lists	tree

from the wikipedia article you quoted θ n operations which force us to visit every node in ascending order such as printing the entire list provide the opportunity to perform a behind-the-scenes derandomization of the level structure of the skip-lists in an optimal way bringing the skip-lists to o log n search time
... a skip-lists upon which we have not recently performed any such θ n operations does not provide the same absolute worst-case performance guarantees as more traditional balanced tree data structures because it is always possible though with very low probability that the coin-flips used to build the skip-lists will produce a badly balanced structure edit so it s a trade-off skip lists use less memory at the risk that they might degenerate into an unbalanced tree

256670
ubuntu	linux
this allowed my to run the stuff on linux but display it on my windows desktop
1 i used to run ubuntu in 64-bit mode but i had no end of trouble
mixing 64-bit and 32-bit is something mac os x does much better. 7.04 worked fine running 32-bit applications on the 64-bit kernel

256843
stateless	stateful
stateful database connections can t be maintained easily as they could fail at any moment the application needs to remember what it was in the middle of doing it and redo it
stateless ones can just be reconnected and have the atomic command re-issued without in most cases breaking state


257043
des	aes
it s been widely in use for a long time but since it was originally specified with only a 56 bit key it s questionable whether it s secure enough for any important uses at this point
triple des is generally better but there are some known theoretical attacks
if you have a choice of cipher you might want to look at aes instead

257790
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	struts
but no one seems to like struts anymore
the ex-jakarta menu on the apache jakarta page shows a number of web application frameworks that they ve incubated including tapestry turbine and velocity
there s also wicket a very decent comparison of wicket and tapestry is available here

257989
filesystems	fat
allocate a large file then create a filesystems structure in it
there are several options for the filesystems available for both berkeley ufs and linux ext2 ext3 there are user-mode libraries available
it might also be possible that you find a fat implementation somewhere

258049
accessor	properties
only provide accessor mutator functions if the accessor mutator methods are a sensible and useful part of the class s interface api
don t think of these methods as accessor or mutators
instead think of them as methods that access or mutate a certain abstract properties of the object that happens to be represented by a single member today but may be computed in a more complex manner tomorrow

258093
awt	swing	swt	swing
i don t think that awt is capable of restyling native component peers in a reliable fashion
i know for certain that swt can t and it s a far more sophisticated toolkit than awt
this is part of why it was essentially deprecated in favor of swing back in java 1.2

258148
vim	emacs
if anything you re gonna be more comfortable using emacs on colemak than on qwerty at least i was
in vim it s a lot trickier since hjkl will be completely messed-up
then again i ve always felt that hlkl was broken and should have instead been jkj

258297
inherited	properties
interfaces cannot have constructors neither properties fields function bodies etc
interfaces cannot be inherited they are implemented again technically it might be true that implementing an interface is actually inheriting it in specific languages but that s not my point. interfaces are more like contracts as they do not define any behaviour whatsoever like classes
now if this is a homework then you shouldn t really argue about these sort of stuff with the teacher

258675
codeigniter	cakephp
it is more a library than a monolithic framework like cakephp or ror you don t like zend_db you could use zf + doctrine
you don t like zend_controller you could try codeigniter + doctrine + zf you can use zend_openid without using zf s mvc solution
you can also start to use zend in your current application without rewriting everything

258697
implements	extends
you could extends the form class
the code to do this for a usb mass storage device would be something like it might give you an idea how to implements it


260148
lxml	elementtree	lxml	libxml2

if you have libxml2 and libxslt installed then also install lxml
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree

260148
lxml	elementtree	lxml	libxml2
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well


260277
skip-lists	tree
the rebalance operation can affect large portions of the tree which would require a mutex lock on many of the tree nodes
inserting a node into a skip-lists is far more localized only nodes directly linked to the affected node need to be locked
update from jon harrops comments i read fraser and harris s latest paper concurrent programming without locks

260485
direct3d	directx

if you re looking for a managed way to do direct3d programming i would recommend slimdx
it s an open source .net wrapper over directx

260972
strcpy	memmove	strcpy	strncpy
standard c provides strcpy strcat strncat strncpy memmove memcpy etc
it makes sense to use strncpy over strcpy for safety if you don t know the source string will fit inside the destination buffer
however strncpy has a major performance issue in that it always writes the amount of bytes specified for the size

261179
grouplayout	miglayout

although this is not a true answer to your question you may as well look at alternative solutions in terms of layout management matisse and grouplayout are neither the only way nor the best one to define your gui forms
i would suggest you take a look at miglayout very powerful and quite simple and designgridlayout quite powerful and very simple both are open source and have a friendly license not gpl . a quick search on google will give you the links immediately

261277
boost	stl

boost has a utility called next and its inverse prior for just that purpose
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out

262706
bash	zsh

it s probably best to stick with bash simply because it s the most widely used as a shell and any tutorials or help you may receive from someone will most likely use bash
however i have started using zsh for all of my scripts and i have found it to be far superior to bash in terms of scripting

262916
scheme	racket

the standard name for timing the execution of expressions in most scheme implementations is time
here is an example from within racket

263226
kerberos	ntlm
in ntlm you are not allowed to authenticate to remote services
as you said you ll need kerberos to delegate credentials to other services
options you may try switch to kerberos

264473
innodb	myisam
sqlite runs in-process with the client application no network capability very low query overhead because of this potentially rather fast for easy queries because there is less ipc system calls and data copying to do
very limited concurrency i think it s either one writer or multiple readers per database file mysql far more features choice of engines innodb provides good features for many workloads much more control of storage backup restore etc network-capable - which allows its use in large scale applications better concurrency - the innodb engine has mvcc which means that readers do not block writers nor do writers block readers
even the old myisam engine has table-level locking rather than for the whole database as sqlite

265372
client-side	server-side
asp.net validation controls also provide two ways of validation server-side or client-side
the nice thing about these validation controls is that it will preform client-side validation when it detects the browser is able unless client-side validation has been disabled
thus reducing roundtrips

266257
hex	binary
time it was programmers coded in the 1 and 0 s of binary
hex was considered an advance over this
that was before assembly which uses the code s names and separates the parts of an instruction into its parts

267096
implements	extends

if your abstract class is the only class that will ever implements the interface then you can always just check for instances of the abstract class you don t need the interface
but if you want to be future-compatible with new classes not yet written which will not extends the abstract class but could use the interface then keep using the interface now

267099
g++	gcc

to add to what others have said g++ is the gnu c++ compiler
gcc is the gnu compiler collection not the gnu c compiler as many people assume

267839
octal	decimal	octal	decimal
you mask and shift would look something like #define mask 0x0038 #define shift 3 masks are often assigned in hexadecimal because it is easier to work with bits in the data type in that base as opposed to decimal
historically octal has also been used for bit masks
if i have a variable var that contains data that the mask is relevant to then i can isolate the bits like this i can isolate all the other bits like this i can clear the bits like this i can clear all the other bits like this i can set all the bits like this i can set all the other bits like this i can extract the decimal value of the bits like this i can assign a new value to the bits like this

268287
inherited	subclassing

classes should either be designed for inherited or prohibit it
there is a cost to designing for inherited it can pin down your implementation you have to declare which methods are going to call which other methods in case a user overrides one but not the other it reveals your implementation rather than just the effects it means you have to think of more possibilities when designing things like equals are hard to design in an inherited tree it requires more documentation an immutable type which is subclassing may become mutable ick item 17 of effective java goes into more details on this - regardless of the fact that it s written in the context of java the advice applies to .net as well

268335
ssd	sata
so it will as you see be more than twice as bad as the simple read case
to improve the speed the first thing i d try is a faster hard drive or an ssd
sata is pretty much the easiest fastest option

269015
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
actually only ie gives this information which isn t important for the server in most cases
neither firefox nor opera at least provide this info
update also tried with safari still no path.

269015
google-chrome	safari
update also tried with safari still no path.
somebody reported that google-chrome might provide the info although being a beta that might change.
perhaps you might need them in some intranet cases

270104
skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	tree
a binary tree allows for more rapid searching and insertion by being inherently sorted and navigable
an alternative that i ve used successfully in the past is a skip-lists
this provides something akin to a linked list but with extra references to allow search performance comparable to a binary tree

270687
profiling	debugging
one java app i was working on a while ago had dismal performance
so we cracked out the profiling to see where the bottlenecks were
turned out that it was mostly due to string concatenation operations incurred by assembling debugging level logging statements that occurred all the time inside nested inner loops etc hah and to think they got added in the first place to figure out why the performance was so bad

271590
cpython	ironpython
speaking for python ironpython c# is probably the easiest optimization path
cpython with c++ is doable but i find c a lot easier to handle but not all that easy being c
two tools that ease this are cython pyrex for c and shedskin for c++

271644
boost	stl

move to boost smart pointers
in the meantime you may want to extract a working auto_ptr implementation from an old another stl so you have working code

272261
postgresql	greenplum	postgresql	mysql
see this posting for a bit of fan-out on this topic
i m not sure off the top of my head if mysql does this but postgresql certainly does
iirc some of the variants greenplum i think also directly support bitmap indexes and there was some talk of incorporating it in the main db engine

273855
punctuation	words
for your particular case i think comparing the search to real words sounds like the way to go with a words list like that
the alternative styles punctuation require a bit more work but i doubt users will use that often enough to be an issue


274773
dns	spf

in my experience most anti-spam systems will score html s hamminess slightly below plaintext but there are much more important things to consider that affect deliverability make sure you have a valid reverse dns configuration for your mail server or you will be undeliverable to many domains
investigate adding an spf record to your dns zone file

274830
vbscript	vba

you mean like this createoutline function which actually copy all headings from a source word document into a new word document i believe the astrheadings function is the key in this program and should allow you to retrieve what you are asking for update by kol on march 6 2018 although astrheadings is an array isarray returns true and typename returns string i get a type mismatch error when i try to access its elements in vbscript v5.8.16384 on windows 10 pro 1709 16299.248
this must be a vbscript-specific problem because i can access the elements if i run the same code in word s vba editor

274830
vbscript	vba
this must be a vbscript-specific problem because i can access the elements if i run the same code in word s vba editor
i ended up iterating the lines of the toc because it works even from vbscript for each paragraph in doc.tablesofcontents 1 .range.paragraphs wscript.echo paragraph.range.text next


275465
ssl	https
some certificate authorities will allow you to do this without extra cost
everything else would only happen after the ssl connection is established and therefor after the error is encountered by the user
with https the ssl connection is negotiated before any of the http headers are sent to the server including the host -header that tells the server for which virtual host the request is actually intended

276065
prepare	execute

since version 5.1 php is shipped with the pdo driver which gives a class for prepare statements
see pdo driver at php.net note that this way with prepare statements will automatically escape all that needs to be and is one of the safest ways to execute mysql queries as long as you use binbparam or bindvalue

276137
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
there are a myriad of other factors that go into this and as was suggested in another response at some point you get a bad implementation of tcp
that being said if you want to achieve low latency and can tolerate loss using udp with an overall packet size set to the path mtu be sure to set the payload size to account for headers is likely the optimal solution esp
if you can ensure that udp can get from one end to the other

276151
ssl	https
if supporting older browsers is important you may have to take that into consideration
------ previous answer ------------ ssl hosts must be tied to a unique ip address port combination thus you cannot use virtual hosting or at least it can only have one ssl host per ip address
this is due to the fact that https begins encryption before the host parameter is sent in http and thus it cannot determine which cipher to use from the hostname - all it has is the ip address

276151
ssl	https
this is due to the fact that https begins encryption before the host parameter is sent in http and thus it cannot determine which cipher to use from the hostname - all it has is the ip address
this would be silly easy to fix if http had a tls command so it could start ssl after asking for the hostname but no one asked me
for the definitive answer see

276255
inherited	properties

okay given the extra information - i believe the problem is that getproperty is going up the inherited change
if you change your call to getproperty to then prop will be null if the properties isn t overridden

276262
redmine	trac

i installed redmine a week ago
it s quite similar to trac but written in ruby on rails and with a better theme and with some nice ajax features right clicking issues brings up an menu where you can change a bunch of things for that specific issue. it integrates perfectly with subversion and you can configure it to react to keywords issues in a svn-commit and connect those commits to a specific issue id

276285
redmine	bugzilla	redmine	mantis	redmine	trac

we use redmine beanstalk at my company and we re happy with them so far
we evaluated trac bugzilla mantis lighthouse and redmine fogbugz wasn t an option due to the incredibly high price and decided that we like redmine the best

276972
haskell	scheme
it might be even clearer to define repeated this way you don t have to use a let-loop this way and the lambdas make it obvious that you expect your arguments in two stages. note recur is not built in to scheme as it is in clojure i just like the name the cool functional feature you want here is currying not composition
here s the haskell with implicit currying i hope this isn t a homework problem


277082
inherited	properties
of course by that rule there is no such thing as object oriented programming on a conventional machine architecture since there is no run time class object with attributes and methods at the machine-code level
or at least there isn t except for specialized architectures like the old system 38 or as 400 . what object oriented means was settled long ago as being three things abstract data types with inherited and polymorphism
the wikipedia article linked confuses the properties of oo with the benefits to some extent

277233
g++	gcc
the example you gave actually compiles c code where it is not an error to fail to declare function prototypes
if you meant to compile this as c++ code you would need the following command line g++ -o test test.cpp -framework opengl in that case you most certainly would get an error for not including gl.h and your code would fail to compile
when executing gcc from the command line g++ is the c++ compiler while gcc is the general c compiler

277445
innodb	myisam
there are numerous other differences however the common one s i am aware of are myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not innodb supports referential integrity whilst myisam does not innodb handles indexes a bit differently storing the primary key as part of every index making indexes take up more room on the disk but also making a covering index more likely myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking different memory buffer index settings are used in the mysql configuration files innodb is typically said to have better crash recovery as mentioned in another answer the data is store on disk differently
i believe innodb is configurable in this area and can have one file per table etc
if required i m sure a google search or the mysql site will bring up numerous other differences in more detail

277452
innodb	myisam
myisam uses a data file and an index file for each table stored in a directory named after the database
innodb seems to lump everything together in a file called ibdata1


277489
operands	scalar
in scalar context or if the left operands is not enclosed in parentheses it returns a string consisting of the left operands repeated the number of times specified by the right operands
in list context if the left operands is enclosed in parentheses or is a list formed by qw string it repeats the list
if the right operands is zero or negative it returns an empty string or an empty list depending on the context

277511
innodb	myisam
myisam locks the whole table for reading while inserts updates are executing
innodb can do row-level locking thus allowing multiple concurrent writes and read on the table


277839
required	placeholder
i then go to the content pages and add new placeholder for the plaintext equivalents and add text as required
to make my life easier i then overloaded my sendmail method to get the response for the required page passing and and creating alternateview s as appropriate
in summary so in short the views seperate the actual views of the content html and text

278194
dictionary	map
there is often a convenience class whose members are the map from identifiers to localized messages
the dictionary are typically stored in separate files and in a format targeted to human translators
more here

278572
inherited	subclassing
c++ and ruby permit multiple inherited for your implementation and your interface
that said one should use multiple inherited with caution keep your abstract-class virtual and or stateless
that said as you note there are too many real-life class hierarchies where the subclassing inherit from the superclass out of convenience rather than bearing a true is-a relationship

278739
jboss	glassfish	jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic
from a technical perspective i would choose glassfish because it has support for more recent innovations
i do not think jboss is bad in anyway it simply isn t as up-to-date
most of my experience is on weblogic but i have used jboss and glassfish

278739
glassfish	weblogic
most of my experience is on weblogic but i have used jboss and glassfish
i just released a new site on a complete sun open source stack opensolaris glassfish mysql and it was a great experience with only minor frustrations


280085
equals	compareto
inventing a working efficient and effective hashing algorithm is not
assuming i do then implement a standard cookbook recipe effective java including all related requirements if a.equals b then a.hashcode b.hashcode if you have two instances of an object that need to be compared for equality then you probably need to provide an implementation for equals
if you have multiple instances of an object that need to be sorted then you probably need to provide an implementation for compareto

280587
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect for example stderr to the file foo do this first before you execute the code above it will open the file and duplicate its file-descriptor to 2 closing the original file descriptor afterwards
now if you have your stdout closed in your parent then if the child calls open it will get 1 since that s if stdin is already opened the next free file-descriptor
only solution i see is to just use dup2 and duplicate something into that in the parent like the above code

280881
phpunit	simpletest	phpunit	simpletest
simpletest is maintained by a small but involved group of people
phpunit seems to have a bigger userbase which may count as an argument for switching
i m quite happy with simpletest though

280900
vbscript	vba

vbscript works quite well with the jet engine
however i do not see why you say it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access. sub transfercsv docmd.transfertext acexportdelim putnameofqueryhere c putpathand filenamehere.csv true end sub is the usual way in vba

280900
vbscript	vba
however i do not see why you say it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access. sub transfercsv docmd.transfertext acexportdelim putnameofqueryhere c putpathand filenamehere.csv true end sub is the usual way in vba
edit it is possible to run a vbscript file .vbs from the command line
here is some sample vbscript to output a tab delimited file

281024
ubuntu	centos

fedora and ubuntu use totally different package managers so you won t be able to easily do it in any sort of generic way
in centos which is redhat enterprise edition with the serial numbers filed off and so therefore pretty close to fedora we did this using kickstart files

281142
getter	setter
the setter foo attr
the getter in java it is common practice to prefix get set. i ll have to say the best practice is to go with what s standard in your language
in java people expect to see get set prefixes so omitting them might confuse people even though they re not strictly necessary

281346
vsto	add-in
one of the team system versions of visual studio 2005
the vsto development story is somewhat simpler in visual studio 2008
in this release all of the vsto projects add-in and the document-level projects are now available in visual studio 2008 professional as well as the team system versions

281421
swt	swing

right now i m either using swt or qt jambi
swing didn t evolve in the last say 10 years bugs aren t fixed the development has stopped in favor of javafx so you won t ever see any new features too

281479
swt	swing	swt	swing
the components themselves are a lot simpler than swing s in terms of extensibility and similar which means that the api can be proportionally simpler
i can actually remember how to create and populate a table in swt
whereas i don t think i have ever handled that in swing without google s assistance

281479
swt	swing
whereas i don t think i have ever handled that in swing without google s assistance
swt s biggest problem right now is the stable version depends on carbon on mac os x
this means that swt apps can only run 32bit on java 5 or 32bit on soylatte

281479
swt	swing
if it s a flashy custom-styled application with tons of custom controls and complex compositing swing is the only game in town
however if a simpler api is more important to you or if your users demand the ultimate in platform laf fidelity swt is the best choice


281685
cassini	iis
the constantly changing port is also rather disconcerting to me
also for each web project in your solution it fires up another instance of a cassini server and each one takes anywhere from 20 to 50 mb of memory
i use iis all the time it s pretty easy to setup and you guys are already doing that.

281812
inline-functions	inlining

there are two kinds of memory usage that inline-functions will affect code size mdash
in general inlining code will increase how much memory is used to load your program

281812
inline	inlining
if you call a function out-of-line the stack for that function is used until it returns when it s released again
if you inline the function then that stack space will remain used for the whole life of the uber-function
inlining won t affect heap usage as the same allocations and deallocations would occur for the inlined code as would occur for the non-inlined version

282008
implements	extends

i ran into this when trying to implements a custom control and discovered that it s a remarkably hard problem
there s no built-in functionality within the windows.forms model to support controls whose display area extends outside the client area of their container

282162
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest and phpunit which i prefer
read the tutorials on how to write and run tests on the homepage of phpunit
it is quite easy and well described

282698
ssl	https

you re not going to be able to do what you re talking about simply because the postback which is what the login control uses is going to be whatever the page s security is ssl or non-ssl
your best bet in this scenario is to use an iframe which contains an https ssl page that just contains thelogin control

283151
coalesce	isnull

the preferable way is to use ansi compatible function coalesce select coalesce column_name default_value from table_name
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull

283405
jboss	glassfish
jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand
but i agree that the documentation and the market share is better for jboss
the various commercial j2ee app servers are more suited for large production environments and they are overkill during development for a j2ee app that should be app server independent

284711
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller is a distinct object that is very different from a uitabbarcontroller
in general your application should have a tab controller one of who s tab s loads a uinavigationcontroller which in turn loads it s views - not that both maintain management over the different views
it is also improper to refer to the display of a uiviewcontroller as such an object doesn t have a visual representation

284851
junit	testng	ant	maven
which are useful because maven will not execute the post-integration-test if any of the integration tests fail
not a problem with ant so i just use junit out of preference with it
in either case segmenting out the tests as both testng and junit do is helpful with integration tests too

285627
cvs	svn
when you tag it with svn cp you re just making a copy of that particular revision with a longer name
and unlike a cvs tag you or other developers could continue doing ongoing development on that tag
it isn t a static entity like a cvs tag is well to be fair you can move a tag on individual cvs files which effectively changes it

285809
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
if the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialversionuid than that of the corresponding sender s class then deserialization will result in an invalidclassexception
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

285809
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization
therefore to guarantee a consistent serialversionuid value across different java compiler implementations a serializable class must declare an explicit serialversionuid value
it is also strongly advised that explicit serialversionuid declarations use the private modifier where possible since such declarations apply only to the immediately declaring class serialversionuid fields are not useful as inherited members

286303
swt	swing

it depends with eclipse 3.4 swt 3.4 is quite supported with macos
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java

286396
ssl	https

there are a whole number of things that could be complicating things as far as inconsistencies with the ssl certs etc
try both unsecured http and secured https -- did you try connecting from another computer or from another network

286617
inline	inlining
however inlining opens the door to more optimizations if you have v a + b + c your wrapper class forces the generation of stack variables whereas for inline calls the majority of the data can be kept in the fpu stack
also inline code allows simplifying instructions considering constant values and more
so while the measure before you invest rule holds true i would expect some room for improvements here

287317
profiling	instrumentation
the profiler approach is overkill
maybe the use of profiling is worth the trouble if you absolutely have no clue where the bottleneck is
i would rather spend a little time analyzing the problem up front and putting a few strategic print statements than figure out how to instrumentation your app for profiling then pour over gargantuan reports where every executable line of code is timed

287493
profiling	instrumentation

it is worth considering investing in a good commercial profiling particularly if you ever expect to have to do this a second time
the one i use jprofiler works in the java world and can attach to an already-running application so no special instrumentation is required at least with the more recent jvms

288928
shadowing	named
the problem is that because the method is in a different method table slot it doesn t actually have any direct relationship to the method it is shadowing
so what we re actually saying is does the base type have any method which meets the criteria for shadowing which varies depending on whether the method is hidebysig or hide-by-name
for the former we need to check whether the base class has any method which matches the signature exactly whereas for the latter we need to check whether it has any method with the same named so continuing the code from above i think this is most of the way there but i still don t think it s exactly right

289163
cassini	iis

as i stated here your developers need to be aware that cassini runs as the local user which is typically an admin account for developers
the development will be able to access any file or resource that their account can which is quite different from what they will see on an iis 6 server

289412
mri	rubinius
since approximately two years ago it is also possible to extend jruby in java and there is actually since last month a port of rcov for jruby
however this requires both a knowledge of ruby and c and a pretty deep knowledge at that because fiddling around with the internals of mri is not for the faint at heart
but only with rubinius will it be possible to write dynamic analysis tools such as code coverage tools in ruby itself making tool writing accessible to a much larger portion of the ruby community

289524
inline	inlining
it can therefore only do so with functions that it has the body of
this means that if a function in the cpp file calls another function which is not implemented in the same cpp file or in a header file that is included then it doesn t have the actual body of the function and can therefore not inline it
but if you use ltcg it s the linker that does the inlining and it has all the functions in all the of the cpp files of the entire project minus referenced lib files that were not built with ltcg

290547
django	turbogears	django	web.py
there are many fine options but it can be daunting to a newcomer
if you are looking for something that comes prepackaged with web db templating integration i d suggest looking at django turbogears or pylons
if you want to have more control over the individual components look at cherrypy colubrid or web.py

290553
inherited	properties

was its support for mixin inherited - the methods from any other classes could be reused in your class
as long as your class provided the properties that these methods used it worked just fine and there was no diamond problem or other multiple-inheritance gotchas to worry about

290557
glassfish	weblogic
a simple redeploy of the same application to weblogic reduced the memory consumption and cpu consumption by about 30
sunone is a reference implementation server and shouldn t be used for production don t know about glassfish
i know this answer doesn t really helps but i ve noticed considerable pauses even in a very simple operations such as getting a bean instance from a pool

290643
haskell	scheme
inspired by lex augusteijn s sorting morphisms 3 ph.d
haskell programmer ate so many bananas that his eyes bugged out now he needs new lenses
post-doc haskell programmer from uustalu vene and pardo s recursion scheme from comonads 4 tenured professor teaching haskell to freshmen

290894
rss	feed
there s no reason to have multiple formats for a site available and any modern feed client can now parse atom feed
atom has quite a few technical advantages over rss and is being widely supported and utilized by major companies such as google and microsoft
as for branding i don t really care what acronym is used

292360
git-merge	git-rebase

git-pull - fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch synopsis git pull description runs git-fetch with the given parameters and calls git-merge to merge the retrieved head s into the current branch
with --rebase calls git-rebase instead of git-merge. note that you can use

292360
git-merge	git-rebase
with --rebase calls git-rebase instead of git-merge. note that you can use
current directory as the repository to pull from the local repository this is useful when merging local branches into the current branch. also note that options meant for git-pull itself and underlying git-merge must be given before the options meant for git-fetch. you would pull if you want the histories merged you d fetch if you just want the codez as some person has been tagging some articles around here


292421
treemap	linkedhashmap
in this case there two potential standard implementations you mights want linkedhashmap can retain the order that the entries were added
treemap a sortedmap navigablemap will sort the results order of which can be determined by a comparator
alternatively you might want a form of map that fire events or also provides a tablemodel

293400
emacs	jedit

i tried for long to find a good editor for my scheme code besides emacs but even with emacs tringer foubles it was still the best
jedit was the second best but its kind of like saying that the choices between cake sawdust and dirt the sawdust was second best

293400
emacs	jedit
jedit was the second best but its kind of like saying that the choices between cake sawdust and dirt the sawdust was second best
emacs with paredit mode just owns for structured editing of s expressions
add to that the highlight parens mode and it gets even better

293971
required	placeholder

change it to this the binder required the int argument
so you have to give it a placeholder which stands for the integer argument that the generated function object needs

294744
cassini	iis
here s a link to how this is accomplished debugging asp.net is a bit different though and i m not sure if this will work for you
if you are debugging locally using the light weight web server cassini you can apply this trick to cassini itself
if you are debuggin directly on a web server though inside of iis i don t know how to get this trick to work but hopefully it will lead you in the right direction

294747
super	implements

i m not sure of the best way but can think of a few none are super great though
use iis windowsauthentication with basic security and implements the validation method and then mark the rss action with an authorize filter

294983
vsts	tfs
if you re logging into the machine with an account which is on a different domain note local users are also on a different domain you will not get single-sign-on
as far as i m aware there isn t a way around the authentication model which vsts uses
you could write your own vsts-style extensions using the existing vs api which say uses a config file for the authentication credentials as the tfs api does support authentication through a manually-created user we have an external application at work which authenticates against our tfs server and is used by employees of our many offices on different domains

295032
move	drag

dreamweaver allows you to move the elements around to any part of the page without being constrained
when you drag elements around the page it automatically creates css code for absolute positioning and custom coordinates

295036
lisp	scheme
i m not sure how useful the bare source code will be as it was meant to go with the book but it s a fine book that covers the basics of implementing lisp in a lower-level language including garbage collection etc
that s not the focus of the book which is programming languages in general but it is covered. lisp in small pieces goes into more depth but that s both good and bad for your case
there s a lot of material on compiling and such that won t be relevant to you and its simpler interpreters are in scheme not c++

296057
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
cli is super powerful much more than the command prompt on windows i know about powershell... from a gui perspective i typically have the terminal cli running anyway from a debian ubuntu perspective start stop processes sudo etc init.d apache stop or sudo etc init.d apache start text editors gedit gui - gnome kate gui - kde vim cli or nano cli processes running ps -aux terminate process add a package sudo apt-get install php5-cli upgrade patch a system there is a whole lot of information here and a large variety of options to choose from
i would recommend going with a linux distro that has a friendly community ubuntu centos debranded free rhel or rhel you pay them to help you
there is definitely going to be a lot of value for you to play around with a distribution over a weekend on a virtual machine or spare machine at home work

297123
dictionary	map
abstract data types are not specific to any one programming language and the map adt can also be known as a hash or a dictionary or an associative array others at
notice we re making a distinction between the dictionary class and the dictionary adt. the dictionary class has been marked as obsolete so it s best not to use it


297552
implements	extends
his is actually very good but i think the best solution would involve sub-classing each of the control types you might be adding before adding them to the gui
have them all implements an interface clearable or something like that i m a java programmer but the concept should be there then iterate over it as a collection of clearable objects calling the only method .clear on each this is how guis really should be done in an oo system
this will make your code easy to extends in the future--almost too easy you ll be shocked

298996
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing

create a superclass s and make a and b inherited from it
then declare an abstract method on s that every subclassing needs to implement

299256
firefox	safari
a short tutorial that demonstrates mixing xul javascript and other technologies to update a website
lastly here s a good lifehacker tutorial on firefox extensions add-ons which shows you much of the above for a simple example and then how to package it as an .xpi so others can easily add it to and manage it from their firefox
i don t have any insight into safari but it s based on webkit and there should be some resources on customizing it similar to how you d use xul on firefox

299292
profiling	debugging
we discovered this by enabling the cache debugging which puts a small comment in the html about what cache is being used
after changing the setting allow writers to view cached content in the authenticated cache profiling we are seeing what this does for editors but for regular viewers the anecdotal evidence is that it is having a big impact


299385
multiplying	subtract

on mostly old processors multiplying by 31 can be relatively cheap
on an arm for instance it is only one instruction most other processors would require a separate shift and subtract instruction

299848
filesystems	ntfs
it is possible to format usb keys using another filesystems for example ntfs which does support security
in that case if the accounts in windows at least it must be a domain account or similar just naming two accounts the same will not do it do not exist on the target computer only a user who can ignore filesystems permissions such as root on nix or administrator on windows will be able to access the file
for the second i m not 100 sure but i believe it depends on how you copy it

299849
firefox	safari
i see this behaviour on firefox for example not safari for what that s worth
you can reload the page and bypass the cache on firefox using ctrl - shift - r and you ll see the check value doesn t carry a normal ctrl - r will grab the info from the cache however edit i was able to disable this server side on firefox setting a cache control header cache-control no-store this seems to disable the remember form values feature of firefox


300016
dictionary	map
it s exactly identical to a map
when i need to perform value-to-key lookups in a collection i do something like this if you use something other than a multimap like a hashmap or dictionary as your reverse-lookup table you run the risk of losing some of your v- k mappings unless you can guarantee that all keys and all values in your collection are unique
edit oops

300122
cvs	svn

with cvs it s a lot easier to tag and deal with branches only when you need to make the changes - that seems to be the best practice
here s a site i found helpful back before we switched to svn

300680
stdout	stderr

in real shells meaning not sea shells - i mean not in c shell or its derivatives then this runs program with the given arguments and redirects the stdout to tmp log.file
the notation hieroglyph at the end sends stderr file descriptor 2 to the same place that stdout file descriptor 1 is going

301140
postgresql	mysql

you should have a look at c preprocessors that exists traditionaly with databases ecpg for postgresql pro c for oracle .
which lets you embed straight sql directly in your source files or an orginal system for mysql

301746
cpython	ironpython

everyone else seems to have the cpython - sql server side covered
if you want to use ironpython you can use the standard ado.net api to talk to the database if you ve already got ironpython you don t need to install anything else

302073
jquery	scriptaculous

stackoverflow uses the jquery library and it uses the fadeout effect for what you are describing
i have never used jquery but i have used the scriptaculous library to do this same thing in the past

302128
filesystems	fat

this depends on the filesystems which you re using
old file systems like fat allow only files up to 2gb

302686
django	turbogears

there are of course other projects out there that specifically implement single parts of django
turbogears for example is a collection of several projects that can work by themselves and together form a complete web development framework

304007
ant	maven
if those are what you need then maven is the right tool
if you re just looking for a tool for dependency management you may want to look into ant s ivy too
it has been used in most of the projects that i worked on and

304143
accessor	properties
for convenience you can write an addthearrayobject accessor
this accessor would call one of the real array accessor described above you can and should fill in the proper class for the objects in the array in place of nsobject . then instead of you write
sadly and its counterpart are last i checked only recognized by kvo for set as in nsset properties not array properties so you don t get free kvo notifications with them unless you implement them on top of accessor it does recognize

304143
accessor	properties
sadly and its counterpart are last i checked only recognized by kvo for set as in nsset properties not array properties so you don t get free kvo notifications with them unless you implement them on top of accessors it does recognize
i filed a bug about this x-radar problem 6407437 i have a list of all the accessor selector formats on my blog


304798
opera	firefox
i did some testing with strings a while ago with ie7 opera and firefox
opera took only 0.4s to perform the test but ie7 hadn t finished after 20 minutes
no i am not kidding

304880
maven	m2e
however more recently i had a chance to revisit maven and i would say it has improved
one of my main issues has been the lack of good documentation but after reading maven the definitive guide i would say its much easier to fathom
along with the m2e plugin for eclipse managing dependencies becomes a doddle - it has an excellent dependency visualisation tool

304880
maven	m2e
along with the m2e plugin for eclipse managing dependencies becomes a doddle - it has an excellent dependency visualisation tool
overall i would say maven is a great tool starting out on a project but may start to lose its way once your build begins to gain complexity


305216
ant	maven
there is a set of ant tasks for publishing to a maven repository
so if you want to continue using ant to build your project you can do but still satisfy your maven-using users


305596
vbscript	vba
the code is as follows and then the c# code changing the vba to read aclink rather than acimport should allow linking
edit re comments i cannot help with c# but here is some vbscript that links a table from one mdb to another
it is modified from

306053
ostream	ostringstream	ostream	ostringstream
that difficulties here are that we are playing with a temporary ostringstream object so taking addresses is contra-indicated
because it s a temporary we cannot trivially convert to an ostream object through casting
both the constructor obviously and str are class ostringstream methods. yes we need to use .str

306053
ostream	ostringstream
so to pull this off we need to allocate a temporary ostringstream
convert it to an ostream
append data

307156
lxml	elementtree	lxml.html	elementtree
of course a third option is given a concrete representation of the xml using elementtree or lxml you can build your own custom model around that
lxml.html is an example of that extending the base interface of lxml with some html-specific functionality


307288
ant	maven
other options are pax construct m2eclipse maven bnd for ant gant eclipse pde buil d ant4eclipse for command line or both the above buckminster
at my current clients we use buckminster which wraps pde-build and call it from ant cruisecontrol
we ve got code coming in from multiple repositories all being built into a single rcp product

308186
vb.net	vb6
there is a much-commented tendency for vb6 developers to keep writing vb6 in .net
even just a brief look at c# might help you think about vb.net as a .net language rather than a visual studio 6 ancestor
of course you might find as i did that you don t want to go back to vb.net after c#

310677
avr	microcontroller

i would suggest avr
it has far surpassed pic as the microcontroller platform of choice for general hobbyist projects

310677
avr	microcontroller
it has far surpassed pic as the microcontroller platform of choice for general hobbyist projects
most notably consider the arduino and other duino platform which provides a high end avr in an easy to interface and popular form factor


310913
vb.net	vb6
problem i want to cast data of one type to another type
in my vb.net code i would use ctype to do this
however when i try to use ctype in vb6 i get a sub or function not defined error

311673
serializable	deserialization
this exposes methods for serialization and deserialization so you can fill the private members of complextype in these methods
check out msdn here for an example showing an implementation of the ixmlserializable interface that serializable a private field


312468
firefox	safari

document.body.offsetwidth returns the innerwidth value from left hand side to the left side of the vertical scrollbar in firefox
not for me it doesn t it returns the same value as ie opera konqueror and safari

312882
dictionary	map

in addition to superjoe30 s answer you can use two levels of mapping two dictionary key command string command string function i think this would make it easier to allow user-defined mappings
so users can map their keys to commands rather than the name of a function

313022
innodb	myisam
it wasn t
lesson learned in production despite the fact we like to use innodb tables in mysql for many many reasons.
be sure you haven t managed to find one of the few myisam tables that doesn t respect transactions and you can t roll back on

313119
cvs	svn

personally i would ignore cvs for a new product
my feeling would be that the enormous extra effort to coerce it into looking like svn would be better spent on other other stuff

313631
decoder	encoder
json encoder decoder this object uses good practices to encode decoder every kind of json compatible variable quickly and a bit safer
it provides a decoder function that returns either an object or undefined


313881
http.sys	httplistener

to implement a minimal web server you can use http.sys the core component of iis deployed with windows xp sp2 or higher
in .net this can be done by using the httplistener class in the system.net namespace

314719
inherited	subclassing
this is necessary for the foreignkey anyway and also ensures that dog and cat will have disjunct primary key sets
now django implements inherited using a onetoonefield
because of this an instance of a base class that has a subclassing instance gets a reference to that instance named appropriately

314865
komodo	notepad++

i just downloaded and started using komodo edit
i ve been using notepad++ for awhile

314865
komodo	notepad++	komodo	notepad++
i ve been using notepad++ for awhile
here is what i think about some of the features komodo edit pros you can jump to a function definition even if it s in another file i love this there is a plugin that displays the list of classes functions and such for the current file on the side
notepad++ used to have a plugin like this but it no longer works with the current version and hasn t been updated in a while

316491
vbscript	jscript
one of which is the ability to include external script files of both the vbscript and jscript flavors
i never got very deep into it but i think it would do what you re wanting to do. you can include javascript vbscript or modules of other wscript script languages
example wsf file if the above file is called iis-scriptmaps.wsf run it this way with cscript.exe cscript.exe iis-scriptmaps.wsf

316797
division	subtraction	division	multiplication	division	addition
262 if you use only addition subtraction and multiplication and keep everything to integers within this range then you should see no loss of precision
i d be very wary of division or more complex operations however


318829
jsf	seam
its always possible to use any orm framework with it because jsf doesn t play directly with the database it doesn t even know about it
hibernate + jsf is a very common combination
but if you are asking about using jsf managed beans with a jpa framework have a look at seam

318882
ant	maven

since what you re wanting to do is add dependency management to an existing ant project that s precisely what ivy s designed to do
dependency management is a big part of maven but far from all of it

319028
fgets	getchar
if there is no terminating n before the ending 0 it may be that there is more data or that the next request will report end-of-file
you ll have to do another fgets to determine which is which
in this regard looping with getchar is easier. in the updated example code above if line sizeof line -1 0 after successful fgets you know that the buffer was filled completely

319796
ant	maven
once you have your project built using maven all that is required for someone who wants to build from source is to run mvn install
fwiw the same can be accomplished using ant ivy to some degree


320181
inherited	subclassing
i mark all my classes with sealed unless i specifically want to enable inherited and in those few cases i only make the required methods virtual
it is easy to remove the sealed tag if the class needs to change to allow inherited in the future
however if you want to change a class which is already being used as a base class for some other type you risk breaking the subclassing when you change the base class

320820
awt	swing
however awt and swing objects allocate some amount of native resources that need to be freed
furthermore the awt thread treats the windows as top-level objects preventing them from being garbage collected and the jvm from terminating
thus when you are done with your window you need to dispose of it which frees the native resources that it has allocated

321217
innodb	myisam
i ve never used a whole disk as a table file but it can be done
instead of pointing to a file i believe you point your innodb table files at the un-formatted unmounted device
innodb_file_per_table makes innodb tables act like myisam tables

321628
innodb	myisam
i m not as familiar with myisam intricacies but with innodb it is true that statistics can get out of date
the database keeps estimated statistics on how your data is distributed for a given index and it s possible for those to get out-of-date but mysql innodb has some built in functionality to try to keep statistics current
you usually don t have to worry about it

321628
innodb	myisam
you usually don t have to worry about it
so if you are using innodb the answer is no you typically don t need to actively do anything to keep your indexes performing well
i m not as sure with myisam i think it s more common to need to optimize those tables regularly

321807
getter	setter	getter	setter
the compiler will pick up the bindable metadata tag and will create a getter and setter for each property you marked as bindable
the getter will just return the value of the property
the setter will check if the new value differs from the original value and will dispatch a propertychange event if it does

322081
getter	setter

the dbkey property getter is virtual in the il because it is in an interface
the setter is not virtual because it is not part of the interface but part of the concrete class

322088
serializable	deserialization

the way to test object serializable is to create an instance of the object serializable it deserialize it into a new object and compare the two objects
when you make a change that breaks serializable or deserialization this test will fail

322088
serializable	deserialization
when you make a change that breaks serialization or deserialization this test will fail
the only thing checking the xml data is going to find for you is if your serializable is emitting a superset of what the deserializer requires and the deserializer silently ignores stuff it doesn t expect
of course if something else is going to be consuming the serialized data that s another matter

322330
prepare	execute
php is a shared nothing architecture so every resource associated with one request one page view is discarded at the end of that request
prepare queries are not available to a subsequent database connections
the scenario in which you would get benefit from a prepare query is when you prepare it and execute it many times during the same php request

322875
floating-point	fixed-point
these parts are combined to produce a double representation of a value
source wikipedia double precision for a detailed description of how floating point values are handled in java see the section 4.2.3 floating-point types formats and values of the java language specification
the byte char int long types are fixed-point numbers which are exact representions of numbers

323221
inherited	properties

to talk to the same instance between appdomains it must inherited from marshalbyrefobject
done this way every method call to the object including properties etc is actually a remoting call to the other app-domain

323388
udp	tcp
it would probably be another protocol over tcp but i see no reason why you cannot stream over udp
if you do you have to take into account that there is no certainty that your data will arrive at the other end but i can take it that you know about udp
to answer you question no http does not use udp. for what you talk about though mp3 video streaming could happen over udp and in my opinion should never happen over http

323764
sudo	passwd
this will install git into the default place usr local - so git will be in usr local bin git it will prompt you to enter your passwd for sudo this is so it can write to the usr local directory which can only be accessed by the root user so sudo is required
if you with to install it somewhere separate so git s files aren t mixed in with other tools use --prefix with the configure command this will install the git binary into usr local bin gitpath bin git - so you don t have to type that every time you you should add into your by adding the following line into your .profile if you do not have sudo access you can use and install into your home directory
remember to add bin to the script x-git-update-to-latest-version automates a lot of this this script updates my local clone of the git repo localy at work track git and then configures installs at usr local git - git describe and updates the usr local git symlink

323809
firefox	safari

as the others said you can use firebug and that will sort you out no worries on firefox
chrome safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to firebug s console so your code should be portable across those browsers

323893
mantis	bugzilla
it s not as feature rich as bugzilla but i remember fighting with bugzilla a lot more
mantis is the kind of thing you can setup once then leave


324030
profiling	debugging
including tracking down of and prevention of leaks
a profiling testing scenario where we would like to see how our software behaves under leaky circumstances
writing a leaky application to test debugging a profiling application with

324087
filesystems	ntfs

if i were you i would never rely on any version of any filesystems driver be it microsoft s be it another os s to be consistent about the algorithm it uses to generate short file names
the exact behavior of the microsoft fastfat and ntfs drivers is not officially documented except as somewhat high level overviews thus are not part of the api contract

324355
lxml	libxml2
also libxml2 has more features
lxml is mostly api compatible with xml.etree.elementtree
and there is good documentation in its web site

324542
hex	binary	octal	decimal	octal	hex	octal	binary
for some reason it is still on my bookshelf 23 years later
as a hint convert octal and hex to binary perform the operations convert back to binary
or you can perform decimal operations and perform the conversions to octal hex binary afterward

325769
imperative	declarative

orchestration languages are in fact imperative scripting languages with conditionals looping and other traditionally imperative constructs typically expressed through a flowchart-based user interface
they certainly do not in my experience implement tail-recursive functional programming backward chaining or any other paradigm that might reasonably described as declarative in the generally accepted sense

326083
mvp	presenter
martin fowler s page on the application controller
in the case of an mvp winforms app which seems to be what the question topic is about i think
you can put all the logic for what form do i show now into the presenter but as your application grows you re going to be duplicating a lot of code between presenter

326218
spweb	spsite
i ll assume that your field allows a single user group selection and you already has the following objects spsite site
spweb web
splistitem item

326440
bufferedreader	ioexception
this approach is lossy because the line separators are stripped from the end of each line
in java 8 bufferedreader added a new method lines to produce a
if an ioexception is encountered while reading the file it is wrapped in an uncheckedioexception since stream doesn t accept lambdas that throw checked exceptions

326637
gridview	objectdatasource

all of the datakey values will always be passed to the delete method because the fields named by datakeynames are intended to be the field or fields that uniquely identify that item in the gridview
they re often used for more than that to easily maintain extra fields on a per-row basis in viewstate as you are here but doing so has the side-effect that you re seeing with the objectdatasource methods

326688
qevent	qobject
if you you just want to catch the event coming into your widget you can use qobject installeventfilter it let s you catch any kind of events
for some odd reason the developers of trolltech decided to propagate ui events via two avenues signals slots and qevent


326953
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
mysql exempts schema modifications from transactions
i have a postgresql background so that s an obvious thing to do begin a transaction do some stuff commit or rollback -- postgresql isn t picky about what do some stuff is
you can find a few bugs on this if you look through mysql s bug base

326969
gmail	hotmail
i don t use hotmail so don t know if it will or not but it should be something like smtp.hotmail.com and your credentials
my primary account is a gmail account so i can use it via smtp.gmail.com and of course my credentials


327402
prng	random
what you want to do is to have an uniform random generated but restricted to a certain range in this case an entropy of 4
if your prng has say an entropy of 32-bit you cannot be certain that computing the output mod 4 will work as expected
this require a bit more work

327972
innodb	myisam
another thing is that i think you use myisam table engine which locks the entire table on update.i suggest you use innodb instead
innodb is slower on select -queries but faster on insert and update because it only locks the row it s working on and not the entire table


328508
multiplying	subtract
if you subtract two x s you always get a dx
if you multiplying a dy by a scalar you always get a dy
and so on

328660
stderr	fflush
there is a light version of logging header i use so wherever i need to log something i just add line like log log_err i o error s occured while opening file s strerror errno filename
during program initialisation you need to specify values for dbgstream usually defaults to stderr and debug_level
for real projects instead of calling fprintf many times i just call my function from log macro and pass __file__ __line__ and __va_args_ as argument - that function also prints date time and pid in log line and don t do fflush every time - only when buffering counter exceeds preset value - itsignificantly increases logging performance

328797
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
comparing the collections available in system.collections and system.collections.generic you get the following migration non-generic generic equivalent ------------------------------------------------------------ arraylist list t bitarray n a caseinsensitivecomparer n a collectionbase collection t comparer comparer t dictionarybase dictionary tkey tvalue hashtable dictionary tkey tvalue queue queue t readonlycollectionbase readonlycollection t sortedlist sortedlist tkey tvalue stack stack t dictionaryentry keyvaluepair tkey tvalue icollection n a use ienumerable t or anything that extends it icomparer icomparer t idictionary idictionary tkey tvalue ienumerable ienumerable t ienumerator ienumerator t iequalitycomparer iequalitycomparer t ilist ilist t icollection is immutable no members to change the contents of the collection while icollection t is mutable
this makes the interfaces similar in name only while icollection and ienumerable t differ by very little
from this list the only non-generic classes that don t have a generic counterpart are bitarray and caseinsensitivecomparer

328942
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it s the thing you tap on to select a tab
since it s a button it shouldn t own the uiviewcontroller that it displays
instead it sends a message to the uitabbarcontroller to switch to the uiviewcontroller as indicated by the selected tab bar item

329066
serializable	deserialization
this approach gives good performance for repeated serializable deserialization but traditionally shockingly awful performance for the first run to help mitigate the shocking performance from vs2005 onwards and earlier using less well known techniques you can explicitly create the serializable assembly at build time and ship it with your main assembly
if you don t create ship the serializable assembly then the framework tends to throw an exception when it s looking for it though normally it catches the exception builds the assembly on the fly and gets on with things
if you re running under a debugger with break-on-throw set though it can be a bit alarming to have the filenotfound exception being thrown deep in the bowels of the framework

329243
division	multiplication	division	addition

i d just like to add a couple of finer points division is special
since most processors can do an addition comparison or multiplication in a single cycle those are all counted as one flop

329243
division	multiplication	division	addition
since most processors can do an addition comparison or multiplication in a single cycle those are all counted as one flop
but division always takes longer
how much longer depends on the processor but there s sort of a defacto standard in the hpc community to count one division as 4 flops

330016
hmac	md5
so you should add a little randomized salt to all your password hashes and just store it in plaintext next to the hashed password value
use hmac - it s a good standard and it s more secure than concatenating the password and salt
use sha1 md5 is broken

330280
prepare	execute
a sensible habit to get into is always use prepare statements even if you think it s not really necessary. neglect will come and bite you or your customers
re-using the same prepare statement multiple times with different parameter values is more efficient than sending multiple full sql strings to the database because the database only needs to compile the statement once and can re-use it as well
only parameter values are sent to the database on execute so less data needs to go over the wire when used repeatedly

330280
prepare	execute
only parameter values are sent to the database on execute so less data needs to go over the wire when used repeatedly
in longer loops the execution time difference between using a prepare statement and sending plain sql will become noticeable


330385
subtraction	multiplication
they don t do 64 bit addititions directly but use the carry flag and a special add-instruction to build a 64 bit add from two 32 bit adds
the same extension exists for subtraction as well the carry is called borrow in these cases
longword multiplication and divisions can be built from smaller multiplication without the help of carry-flags

330491
lisp	scheme
this might be easier than writing everything yourself
disclaimer i m not a lisp expert
i m mostly interested in programming languages and have been playing with lisp clos scheme erlang python and a bit of ruby

330989
cvs	svn
there s less of a conceptual move from one traditional scm to svn
in particular it s a natural migration path from cvs
subversion has been out for longer

330999
cvs	svn

cvs used to be the default it was pretty much the only answer
svn was designed explicitly to be a better cvs

331349
serializable	deserialization

an alternative to adding xml serializable attributes to all of your classes is to implement the ixmlserializable interface on the root element container class
the readxml and writexml methods of this interface will be used by the xmlserializer allowing you to have more fine grained control over the serializable deserialization process

332294
accessor	properties
so you could run into problems trying to concurrently run code like and since the objects in your array are not locked you could run into race conditions or readers writers-type problems
on a different note for kvc-compliance i d advise implementing objectinwidgetsatindex and countofwidgets instead of a widgets accessor
remember kvc models relationships not array properties

332815
inherited	subclassing
if you wanted to subclassing the list type in python code you were out of luck and so various workarounds were used instead such as subclassing the pure python implementation of lists in the userlist module instead
this was a fairly ugly so in 2.2 there was a move to unify python and builtin types including the ability to inherited from them
the result is new style classes

332975
profiling	instrumentation

aqtime is an instrumenting profiling
instrumenting profilers often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured

332975
profiling	instrumentation
instrumenting profiling often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured
instrumenting profiling on the other hand excel at profiling memory and other resource usage
sampling profiling which periodically check the location of the cpu are usually better for measuring code time

332978
inherited	subclassing
classes in other packages will not have access unless they subclassing this original class
see this similar question for more specific information on inherited markers
personally i almost never use protected

333011
hash-collision	key
however there is a problem as hash_function pet returns 18 which is the same hash for the name key
therefore we ll need to resolve this hash-collision
let s suppose that the hash-collision resolving function we used found that the new empty element is 29 since there was a hash-collision in this insertion our performance was not quite o 1

333305
icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
it allows for tcp pings like the standard ruby ping but also udp http and icmp pings
an icmp ping requires root privileges but the others do not


333631
webkit	gecko

with gecko-engined browsers you get in terms of other browsers implementing these features i m only aware of webkit implementing array extras but it s actually quite easy to monkeypatch support for those in all browsers since they re just additional methods
gecko opera and webkit also support the canvas element which although being a new html element is used via javascript so i m not sure if that fits your criteria

333723
opera	safari	opera	firefox

lets starts with javascript ecmascript today you have to make one version for mozilla opera safari and another version for ie
both opera and firefox support some css3

334178
super	extends	super	implements
given that you will need to implements a sqldialect for the given database type you are using
eg class postgressqldialect extends org.hibernate.dialect.postgresqldialect postgressqldialect super registerfunction rand new noargsqlfunction random hibernate.double
then you will need to define that dialect in the config hibernate dialect com.mycompany.sql.postgressqldialect

334225
client-side	server-side
use the craxdrt.dll for any client-side application that does not contain the embeddable designer or use it for any server-side application
craxddrt.dll is apartment-model threaded but is not thread safe and can only be used in a client-side application
although the craxddrt.dll is a fully functional automation server for the rdc and can work in any client-side application it will increase the install size. therefore it is recommended that you only use craxddrt.dll with the embeddable crystal reports designer control

334357
superclass	subclassing

first i will create the superclass and add the necessary annotations
you have to decide between table per class strategy single table per class hierarchy strategy joined subclassing strategy i think the joined subclassing will work here

334357
superclass	subclassing
you have to decide between table per class strategy single table per class hierarchy strategy joined subclassing strategy i think the joined subclassing will work here
you add the annotation to the superclass
second i will create the table s that represent the sub classes

334357
inherited	subclassing
then select the rows from the super class table that belong in each subclassing and move the data
this article explains inherited with hibernate


334929
sudo	passwd
and still it doesn t address the possibility that unauthorized people who have access to the server can just read your passwd file
i think you have to rely on file permissions and trust that unauthorized people don t have the ability to sudo to your php application uid or to root


335041
unixodbc	iodbc
this may get you started a lot faster
there are at least two options unixodbc is licensed under lgpl which means if you modify the code you have to make your modifications open-source
iodbc is licensed under either lgpl or new bsd at your choice

335122
pascal	delphi

i don t think there are any machine code decompilers that produce pascal code
most delphi decompilers parse form and rtti data but do not actually decompile the machine code

335379
filesystems	ntfs

10 gb is not quite a huge amount of data so you can probably use the database to store it and have no big issues but of course it s best performance wise to use the filesystems and safety-management wise it s better to use the db backups and consistency
happily sql server 2008 allows you to have your cake and eat it too with the filestream attribute in sql server 2008 you can apply the filestream attribute to a varbinary column and sql server then stores the data for that column on the local ntfs file system

335379
filesystems	ntfs
happily sql server 2008 allows you to have your cake and eat it too with the filestream attribute in sql server 2008 you can apply the filestream attribute to a varbinary column and sql server then stores the data for that column on the local ntfs filesystems
storing the data on the filesystems brings two key benefits performance matches the streaming performance of the filesystems
blob size is limited only by the filesystems volume size

338290
stdout	fflush

your problem is that printf and anything else that uses the stdio library to write to stdout standard output is buffered - line buffered if it goes to the console and size buffered if it goes to a file
if you do a fflush stdout

338295
stdout	fflush

printf writes to stdout the default output stream which is usually line buffered
the buffer isn t fflush by the time sleep is called so nothing is displayed when the program exits all streams are automatically fflush which is why it prints right before exiting

338778
client-side	server-side

when i used tfs 2005 the client-side nature of the custom check-in policy was a real hassle
what you re requesting would quite obviously work best if it were server-side

338821
wordpress	joomla
however using joomla can be difficult at first as its content organization is rather complex
if the site would consist of basic blog-like webpages then wordpress is the way to go
wordpress is a very simple blogging cms with a huge user community

338821
wordpress	joomla
wordpress is a very simple blogging cms with a huge user community
it s very easy to use has many plugins for it and the newest version of wordpress even has auto-updating features
wordpress isn t as good as joomla when it comes to user management though

338821
wordpress	joomla
however the wordpress sites i ve worked with that require more than the standard blogging features e-commerce image galleries forums usually involve integrating wordpress with a separate software application while joomla more often than not has those plugins available for it
the end result is a website with several applications on it installed wordpress coppermine phpbb each with separate logins and admin screens
for a simple and easy website with basic features i would suggest wordpress

340220
cpython	ironpython

the usual implementation of what you want in python would be this i wrote a test to prove that this behaves as expected this executes on cpython without any assert throwing an exception
ironpython should be equivalent otherwise it s broken and this test should be added to its unit test suite

340682
accessor	properties
calling initanint on the properties raises an error
you shouldn t create public fields variables on classes you never know when you ll want to change it to have get set accessor and then you don t know what code you re going to break especially if you have clients that program against your api
also you can have different access modifiers for the get set get

341049
translation	transliteration
hebrew transliteration of english is not trivial because of the ambiguities in english rather than hebrew the hebrew is actually well defined
even if you want to translation phonetic sounds to hebrew you ll still have some issues to contend with taf vs
tet heh vs chet vs chaf khaf

341177
jboss	glassfish
as far as i can see there is nothing in the ejb persistence spec that specifies what the behaviour should be under these circumstances
i ve also experienced this in jboss
i ll also give it a try in glassfish and let you know the results

342056
realloc	malloc
setting a to null works because realloc treats this as if the user called malloc size
keep in mind that with this change the prototype to addvalue needs to change to and that the code needs to handle the case of realloc failing
for example i would expect that most implementations of realloc will internally allocate twice as much memory if the current buffer needs resizing making the original code s unnecessary

342137
cassini	iis

probably not relevant to this discussion but be careful testing debugging on cassini
its threading model is different from iis

342764
getchar	fgetc
it is the value that getchar or fgetc getc returns if the stream is at end-of-file or a read error occurs
it is merely a special value outside the range of character values that getchar will return that indicates the condition of error or end-of-file
it is defined by the c standard as being negative whereas getchar returns characters as an unsigned char converted to int

344654
vbscript	jscript

you can achieve this in vbscript by using the getref function - will send thing has been tested to the client
so here is your validate requirement using getref - having provided this i have to say though that if you are familiar with php then jscript would be a better choice on the server

344756
interpolation	splines
in this example you are interpolating between points p i-1 and p i using control points on either side p i-2 and p i+1
u is the interpolation factor ranging from zero to one
τ is defined as the tension on the splines and will affect how tightly your splined surface conforms to your control points

344794
innodb	myisam
when you make changes to a table that uses myisam the changes are effectively committed immediately regardless of your explicit requests to begin and finish transactions and regardless of the state of autocommit
so you won t be able to roll back no matter what unless you created your tables using the innodb storage engine or other transaction-safe storage engines such as bdb
it s unnecessary to disable autocommit mode to use transactions in mysql

345640
uiview	subviews

uiactionsheet is a uiview
you should be able to add in other views into its subviews

346065
xna	slimdx
well for vb you are stuck with mdx 1.1 comes with directx sdk or slimdx or other 3rd party managed directx wrapper
the latest xna replacement for mdx 1.1 2.0b is only available for c# coder
you can try some workaround but it s not recommended and you won t get much community support

348516
filesystems	ntfs
one other note if you are using ntfs based storage windows server etc you might consider finding a way around putting thousands and thousands of files in one directory
i am not sure why but sometimes the filesystems does not cope well with that situation
if anyone knows more about this i would love to hear it

349365
implements	extends
probably you would need to extends all the controls you would be using
the easiest solution would be to implements the getfocus method for all your controls and the form
you could reset your counter there

349968
postgresql	mysql
you can certainly make a case against mysql since some of the most important features in regard to data safety have been added only recently
if you re concerned about that use postgresql instead
as for the language you write your app in php has definitely proven to be able to run extremely large and complex systems

350023
inherited	properties

if the purpose of the class is to add additional functionality to a standard collection then i would inherited from the collection
if the collection is just one part of a bigger picture then that sounds more like a properties

350084
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve worked with all of the major php framework s you ve listed except zend and this is what i can quickly tell you cakephp enforces oop gets you up and running quickly has a great community and relatively good documentation comes packed with all the features you d come to expect
codeigniter gives you the most elbowroom of the first three
doesn t exactly enforce oop it leaves it up to you

352407
textmate	kate

i m using textmate on mac os x it s the uber most awesomest editor on any platform but it s not an ide
on x11 based systems i think i preferred kate if i recall correctly

inherited	properties
but the plug-in comes with downloadable source code so you can modify it yourself to support validationgroup
in asp.net 2.0 validators should inherited from basevalidator and implement ivalidator which means you should change the recaptchacontrol type to inherited from basevalidator instead of webcontrol
you will then have to modify the code a bit to implement all methods and properties defined in basevalidator

352860
try-catch	exception-handling
... a method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of error that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught since these errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur
as the specification mentions an error is only thrown in circumstances that are chances are when an error occurs there is very little the application can do and in some circumstances the java virtual machine itself may be in an unstable state such as virtualmachineerror although an error is a subclass of throwable which means that it can be caught by a try-catch clause but it probably isn t really needed as the application will be in an abnormal state when an error is thrown by the jvm
there s also a short section on this topic in section 11.5 the exception-handling hierarchy of the java language specification 2nd edition

353563
cassini	iis
you will also need to add a script mapping in the application configuration for .jss to the aspnet_isapi.dll in windows microsoft.net framework vxxxx directory
iis6 doesn t do the intergrated pipeline that is intrinsic to cassini and is default in iis7
edit details in iis manager open application properties

354067
inherited	properties

i wouldn t create a publisher class to inherited book since publisher isn t a book it is metadata information about a book. the bible though would inherited book
my advice would be to create a publisher properties on the book. this publisher could be of type ipublishinformation and the string publisher could use a namedpublisher string name class implementing ipublishinformation

354253
mergesort	timsort

a galloping mergesort such as python s built-in sort c.f
timsort has good expected performance when there are large runs of already-sorted data like in your example identical objects -- you ll skip o log n work per merge

354253
mergesort	timsort
timsort has good expected performance when there are large runs of already-sorted data like in your example identical objects -- you ll skip o log n work per merge
you can also distribute a mergesort across multiple cpu s and disks if your dataset is extremely large this is called an external sort
however it will be worst case o nlog n

354405
implements	extends

i agree with jeebee consider implements your helper methods somewhere other than an abstract base class
if your helper method commony only exists in abstract base class b all classes which implement interface a will have to also extends base class b in order to take advantage of that implementation of commony

354420
listview	gridview

you can use headertemplate property to setup the head programatically or use listview instead if you are using .net 3.5
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html

354481
allocator	stl
you can stick with your stl containers but change the second parameter of for example std vector to give it your custom allocator which allocates from a stack-buffer
the chromium authors wrote an allocator just for this it works by allocator a buffer where you say how big it is
you create the container and call container.reserve buffer_size

354800
octal	decimal
varchar 20 should be well sufficient
note that if you were to store phone numbers as integers many systems will assume that a number starting with 0 is an octal base 8 number
therefore the perfectly valid phone number 0731602412 would get put into your database as the decimal number 124192010

355064
trie	tree

to store a word like stackoverflow insert into trie path values s st sta stac stack stacko stackov stackove stackover stackover stackoverf stackoverflo stackoverflow
the materialized path in the tree is the prefixed sequence of characters itself

355552
haskell	scheme
the example defines two infinite lists of even and odd numbers. a dead language with a similar scoping rule was modula-3
but haskell is a bit trickier in that you can attempt to redefine a variable within the same scope but instead you just introduce another recursion equation
this is a pitfall for people who learned ml or scheme first this is perfectly good ml or scheme let but haskel has scheme letrec semantics without the restriction to lambda values

355768
inherited	subclassing
no you have spotted a problem with using inherited - that subclassing get tightly coupled to superclasses and their internals so it can be fragile
that is why effective java and others say you should favour delegation before inherited if possible
i think krosenvold s solution sounds clean

356920
google-chrome	safari

google-chrome uses webkit a fairly standard rendering engine
safari uses it also and it doesn t sound like webkit is going away

358610
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties	getter	setter

first of all it s usually better practice to use getter setter methods than accessing properties directly especially if you re going to be doing a lot of complicated inherited
as for the generics problem you could try defining the cardbox getter in the superclass or top-level interface abstract class as that way you can ovverride it in subclassing and have them return a list of any type of subclassing of card

358887
rational-numbers	base
common lisp has the sanest number handling that i ve seen in any programming language
most notably it has integers of arbitrary size bignums as well as rational-numbers
it also has input in arbitrary number base and bitwise functions for bignums

359795
mktime	strtotime

you should look at the mktime function
couple that with either regular expressions or strtotime and you ll have it

360276
ssl	https	ftp	telnet
libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side url transfer library supporting ftp ftps http https scp sftp tftp telnet dict ldap ldaps and file
libcurl supports ssl certificates http post http put ftp uploading http form based upload proxies cookies user+password authentication basic digest ntlm negotiate kerberos4 file transfer resume http proxy tunneling and more
libcurl is highly portable it builds and works identically on numerous platforms including solaris netbsd freebsd openbsd darwin hpux irix aix tru64 linux unixware hurd windows amiga os 2 beos mac os x ultrix qnx openvms risc os novell netware dos and more.

360653
profiling	benchmarking

have you run the program with a profiling and determined that the lookup takes a significant part of the total runtime
also remember to benchmarking

361157
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller

because the view owned by a uiviewcontroller fills the available space in its parent
its parent will be either a uiwindow or the view controlled by something like a uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

361367
emacs	jedit
in terms of software a nice gui editor along the lines of notepad++ or jedit would be good
emacs vi text-based editors always seems quaint and antiquated for serious development


361549
kde	gnome

for kde and windows qt is the best option
qt is fine for gnome windows too but in that case you might prefer wxwidgets

361949
udp	tcp

udp is often used for various types of realtime traffic that doesn t need strict ordering to be useful
this is because tcp enforces an ordering before passing data to an application by default you can get around this by setting the urg pointer but no one seems to ever do this and that can be highly undesirable in an environment where you d rather get current realtime data than get old data reliably

362024
quicksort	heapsort

unless you ve hit one of quicksort s pathological cases often a list that is already sorted quicksort should be o n log n substantially faster than insertion sort s o n 2 as n increases
you may want to use merge sort or heapsort instead

362147
client-side	server-side
this is because asp.net validation is usually done both client and server-side
this means for every validation control you put on the page asp.net generates some client-side javascript that does the validation and renders the error on the client without going back to the server
so you re stuck with both the success message and the error message at the same time

362315
equals	icomparable

do you mean this works with for else falls back to equals
there is also for inequality comparisons greater less this uses or t icomparable otherwise

362315
equals	icomparable
there is also for inequality comparisons greater less this uses or t icomparable otherwise
by the way type should just use the regular reference compare provided by equals so it should just work fine with the above


362433
trie	tree

for exact matching generally the way to implement something like this is to store your corpus in a trie
the idea is that you store each letter as a node in the tree linking to the next letter in a word

362841
memcpy	realloc
for example it might be able to copy 4 bytes in the time it takes you to copy 1 byte
many memcpy implementations are written in assembly using optimized instructions that can copy multiple elements at a time which is usually faster than copying data one byte at a time
i don t quite understand this question if you use realloc to decrease the size of memory and it succeeds returns non-null the new location will contain the same data as the old location up to the size of the new request

364931
haskell	ocaml

it s not quite what you asked for and it s not directly related to haskell but bruce mcadam s paper that about wraps it up goes into this topic in substantial breadth and depth
bruce s basic idea is to use an explicit knot-tying operator called wrap instead of the implicit knot-tying that is done automatically in haskell ocaml and some other languages

365122
profiling	debugging
uiq 3 communicators also can be debugged the same way
by the way it the latest phones by se it is even possible to monitor memory consumption and cpu profiling
so if you wanna debugging your apps on real phones i would suggest also using se phones they are really good at it

365834
innodb	myisam	innodb	myisam
in innodb however primary keys are clustered meaning they stay attached to the data pages and ensure that the row contents remain in physically sorted order on disk according to the primary key but only within single data pages which themselves could be scattered in any order. this being the case i would expect that innodb might have an advantage in that myisam would essentially have to do double work -- write the integer once in the data pages and then write it again in the index pages
innodb wouldn t do this the primary key index would be identical to the data pages and would only have to write once
it would only have to manage the data in one place where myisam would needlessly have to manage two copies

366086
getter	setter
in firefox opera 9.5+ and safari 3+ chrome and ie tested with v11 you can define getter and setter properties
if you only define a getter it effectively creates a read-only property
you can define them in an object literal or by calling a method on an object

366626
pascal	delphi
there are several very capable 3rd-party scripting engines both commercial and free and most of them allow you to exchange delphi objects with the script
some of these libraries support only pascal as the scripting language others will let you use basic perhaps better for beginner users or other languages
see for example remobjects pascal script free at

366732
factors	mean
by class hierarchy i suppose you mean do you always have to end up with some inheritance in your object model then the answer is no
but chances are you can often find some common code factors it out and create a base class to contain the common code
if you agree with me on the point that business logic should not be in the database but should be in the application then i recommend you look into the mvc design pattern to guide your design

366741
inherited	subclassing
some languages like java have a fairly limited set of language features available meaning that subclassing is fairly often used because it s a convenient method for re-use technical inherited
closures and lambdas of c# make inherited for technical reasons much less relevant
so normally inherited is used for semantic reasons like cat extends animal

367881
ubuntu	linux
on an old server windows 2000 iirc i had to administer the core of windows would consume anywhere from 100-200 megs of ram
my current ubuntu server eats 40megs
i m not sure how much ram you have to play with on your server but if it s a lower amount you re going to fit a lot more on a linux host

371319
inherited	properties
if the normal
operator inherited from object is being used this can never happen
a constructor always returns an object reference and as you have pointed out if an exception was thrown in the constructor the execution point would leave the properties entirely

371348
equals	gethashcode
the rules are if two things are equal then they must return the same value for gethashcode if the gethashcode is equal it is not necessary for them to be the same
this is a collision and equals will be called to see if it is a real equality or not
in this case it looks like return fooid

371350
equals	gethashcode

by overriding equals you re basically stating that you are the one who knows better how to compare two instances of a given type so you re likely to be the best candidate to provide the best hash code
this is an example of how resharper writes a gethashcode function for you as you can see it just tries to guess a good hash code based on all the fields in the class but since you know your object s domain or value ranges you could still provide a better one

371946
stringbuilder	stringwriter

i suspect it s because it s writing to a stringbuilder which is inherently utf-16
an alternative to get round this is to create a class derived from stringwriter but which overrides the encoding property

372121
inherited	subclassing
and the difference between abstract and interface is a hairsplitting thing when you have duck typing
java uses interfaces because it doesn t have multiple inherited
because python has multiple inherited you may also see something like this class someabstraction object pass # lots of stuff - but missing something class mixin1 object def something self pass # one implementation class mixin2 object def something self pass # another class concrete1 someabstraction mixin1 pass class concrete2 someabstraction mixin2 pass this uses a kind of abstract superclass with mixins to create concrete subclassing that are disjoint

372207
boost	allocator
i previously used localhost network programming to do that and used manual shared memory allocator before i knew about boost
damn if i would need to rewrite the app i would immediately pick boost
boost.interprocess makes this more easy for you

372418
rss	feed
using arduino to control a little array of red and green leds so that everyone on his team can look up at it and see if the build is broken and who broke it
but really unless that s a road you re interested in going down in your case i d write a simple winforms app that used a filesystemwatcher to check for changes in the rss file an xslt transform to turn it into html and a webbrowser to display it
if you know xslt and understand the contents of your rss feed that s about 2-3 hours of work tops

373316
equals	icomparable
implement iequatable icomparable and whatever may be the case
overload equals
overload and override tostring

373446
bluecloth	rdiscount
the guts are implemented in c
see also moving past bluecloth on ryan tomayko s blog
ryan s post includes the following benchmark of 100 iterations of a markdown test bluecloth 13.029987s total time 00.130300s average maruku 08.424132s total time 00.084241s average rdiscount 00.082019s total time 00.000820s average update august 2009 bluecloth2 was released it s speed is on par with rdiscount because it is based on rdiscount - it is not pure ruby

373684
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

safari uses mac fonts but google-chrome would use windows fonts
i ve noticed that there can sometimes be problems where using a font like arial it shows up fine in firefox google-chrome ie but on safari it can cause a line to wrap because the font is slightly bigger

374428
equals	compareto
if b is a subtype of a and a s equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof a and b s equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof b it is quite likely that the equivalence relation defined by these methods is not symmetric
this is only for classes implementing comparable and allows for an implementation of equals which is always the same
all comparison logics to be located into one place only the compareto function

374809
try-catch	exception-handling
i just want to put in a warning about how not to do it
don t wrap the single test for id pid in a try-catch block
it s wasteful and would involve the introduction of exception-handling checking to catch a non-exceptional condition

375694
vbscript	vb6

rc1 i tested this with your code from vbscript and from within office 2007 s excel everything works fine
since your able to create the com object from within a vb6 form we should assume that your .net framework is ok

376065
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
then apply ie-specific fixes
hopefully it ll render ok in google-chrome and safari
the reason is that there are fixes available to make ie work properly but not many to make firefox behave badly

376828
haskell	scheme
examples the programming language scheme is dynamically typed aka duck-typed and it has many dozens of interpreted implementations but also some fine native-code compilers including larceny gambit and plt scheme which includes both an interpreter and a jit compiler making seamless transitions
the programming language haskell is statically typed
the two most famous implementations are the interpreter hugs and the compiler ghc

376913
try-catch	exception-handling

for complex production-grade scenarios it is a horrible practice to have multiple try-catch statements and it is highly inflexible practice to have these statements within the business logic at all
windows cloud computing team their code has to be efficient and reliable seems to stick with the exception-handling handling action policies instead

377533
inherited	subclassing
there is a precedence issue - the overridden method is defined in the base-class so for best method purposes the overload even with an implicit cast is preferable since it is defined in the most-specific type the subclassing
if you re-declared the method new then it would get precedence but you can t override and new a method with the same name and signature in the same type - you d have to add an extra level of inherited to achieve this
the exact logic for this is detailed in 14.5.5 and 14.4.2 of ecma 334 v4

377567
persistent	transient
they reflect the state of being of some object
for model objects they re serious business because they re often persistent
for gui objects they re what s being displayed right now which is often transient

378139
mouse	keyboard
there is msdn documentation on some of this but it isn t as helpful as you may like it to be
the listviewdesigner in system.design.dll provides the column sizing by turning mouse operations in the designer into windows messages that manipulate the underlying list view
your designer for the textbox will need to do something similar with keyboard events

379142
inherited	subclassing
its whether actionread actionwrite need to be subclassing of action at all
since you are going to end up with one concrete class that will be an action anyways you could just inherited actionread and actionwrite without them being actions in themselves
though you could invent code that would require them to be actions

379443
inherited	properties

if your boss is hostile to inherited try aggregation
has-a relationships rather than inherited s is-a relationship. assuming you interface with the api in question via an object maybe you can just keep that object in a properties of your framework main class so you d interact with it like

379494
emacs	textmate

like most questions of this sort the one true answer is emacs
however textmate bbedit and subethaedit do nicely too

379575
inherited	subclassing

with out knowing more of what you are doing i would probably reorganize things a bit. instead of multiple inherited with all these versions of action i would make polymorphic reading and writing and writing classes instanciated as delegates
something like the following which has no diamond inherited here i present one of many ways implementing optional delay and assume the delay methodology is the same for all readers. each subclassing might have their own implementation of delay in which case you would pass down to read and instance of the respective derived delay class

379611
inherited	properties	inherited	properties
so in case you would have to access your properties from inside your class i would put that way you can only read result and message and can still write to it from inside the class
in case you use inherited you could put the set protected if needed
edit after reading the code i made based on what was given in the question there is some bug where the class name result will probably throw an error with the properties result and also the fact the we are receiving a bool as result and a string as message in constructor but trying to send them in a int this will definatly don t work

379644
metaphone	soundex
sometimes it can generate the same code for two really different words
double metaphone was created to help take care of that problem
stolen from wikipedia as a response to deficiencies in the soundex algorithm lawrence philips developed the metaphone algorithm for the same purpose

379644
metaphone	soundex
stolen from wikipedia as a response to deficiencies in the soundex algorithm lawrence philips developed the metaphone algorithm for the same purpose
philips later developed an improvement to metaphone which he called double-metaphone. double-metaphone includes a much larger encoding rule set than its predecessor handles a subset of non-latin characters and returns a primary and a secondary encoding to account for different pronunciations of a single word in english
at the bottom of the double metaphone page they have the implementations of it for all kinds of programming languages python mysql implementation

381385
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
but as others point out it has the drawback that the caller may need to enumerate if he needs any other info for example count
the .net 3.5 extension method ienumerable t .count will enumerate behind the scenes if the return value does not implement icollection t which may be undesirable
i often return ilist t or icollection t when the result is a collection - internally your method can use a list t and either return it as-is or return list t .asreadonly if you want to protect against modification if you re caching the list internally

381853
factors	matrix
be careful be very very careful.
check out jama tnt -- it s got the nist stamp-of-approval on it and they ve already handled some of the simpler linear algebra math various factors algorithms
linear algebra involves lots of tricky issues with numerical precision hilbert matrix and as much as i like doing my own thing this is one of those areas where you might want to use a good solid foundation that s already been well-tested

382960
rss	feed
from experimentation google reader seems to pass through certain styles unharmed
the philosophy of rss is indeed that the reader is responsible for presentation
many people think that rss should be plain text and that css in rss feed is inappropriate

383652
filesystems	ntfs

ok so if i can figure out how to get your application to write a file to the filesystems because you granted read write to the entire application s virtual directory i can now write an aspx file you your website invoke it and run arbitrary code including cool things like wmi calls and com interop
why not just preclude the possibility when it is so cheap timewise to set ntfs permissions

383740
udp	tcp
messages are sent with tcp to all known peers
when a node starts up it sends out an udp broadcast to discover other nodes
when a node receives a discovery broadcast it sends itself to the source of the broadcast in order to make it self known

384041
bazaar	svn
hm the most popular is easily svn which an old-fashioned centralized system but it s a bit of a pain to set up imo
requires special software on the server. i personally am quite fond of bazaar which is distributed and a server repository only requires ftp access and nothing else on the server


384468
websphere	ibm

websphere community edition is geronimo
so ibm chose it as a platform of choice

384966
dotnetzip	sharpziplib

i ve found the dotnetzip library to be this easiest way to work with zip files
sharpziplib is a far more powerful and flexible solution

385433
ant	maven

i m fond of using ant with ivy
ivy uses maven repositories to fetch library dependencies without forcing you to change your entire build system to suit maven

385823
profiling	debugging
scott guthrie has a nice blogpost about this linq to sql debugging visualizer
another application that can give you valuable information is the sql profiling
check the introduction introduction to sql profiling it should get you started

387060
vim	emacs
same environment will work on solaris as well but this is of course force you to use vim as editor i pretty sure that emacs can work with both ctags and cscope as well
you might want give a try to vim it s a bit hard at first but soon you can t work another way
the most efficient editor imho

387542
client-side	server-side

for extra credit once you know how to do it in php and javascript from riho and annakata s answers then build a way of defining a field constraint in a single form that can both be rendered as javascript for client-side validation and run on the server
since you need both client-side for user convenience server-side because we re really very much past trusting the client at this point it seems like quite a decent idea to support both from a single infrastructure

388090
memcpy	memmove

memcpy should have that behavior
memmove doesn t by design if the blocks of memory overlap it copies the contents starting at the ends of the buffers to avoid that sort of behavior

389002
innodb	myisam
if you re doing a lot of lookups by pk or indeed range scans etc this is a good thing because it means that it won t need to fetch as many blocks from the disc
a non-pk unique index will never be clustered in innodb
on the other hand some other engines myisam in particular don t cluster the pk so the primary key is just like a normal unique index

389824
innodb	myisam
in mysql they use the term storage engine
there are bunch of subtle differences between these two storage engines but the chief ones are innodb supports transactions so you can choose to roll back or commit changes
myisam is effectively always autocommit

389824
innodb	myisam	innodb	myisam
myisam is effectively always autocommit
innodb enforces foreign key constraints
myisam doesn t enforce or even store foreign key constraints

389824
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t enforce or even store foreign key constraints
if these features are things you need in your application then you should use innodb
to respond to your comment it s not that simple

390005
decimal	ieee
the double type complies with the iec 60559 1989 ieee 754 standard for binary floating-point arithmetic
edit the reason why decimal has a getbits and double does not is that decimal preserves significant digits
3.0000m 3.00m but the exponents mantissas are actually different

390630
apache	nginx
it is possible to run other load balancers but nginx is the default
2 several application server images are available running apache tomcat rails
you setup your application here be it php perl python java ruby whatever

391098
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if you re a jquery fan you re probably using it already to do much of what you do with asp.net ajax so if you can consider getting rid of scriptmanager completely
if you can t do that or if you use updatepanel then link the jquery download to google this way for ver 1.2.6 google promotes linking this way to minimize the necessity to download jquery again and again
if most websites link from google the way google promotes it then the user won t have to download new copies of jquery every time they access a website that uses it

391773
webkit	gecko
it supported by at least webkit and gecko
according to the w3c spec webkit and firefox do not interpret the specs the same way
in webkit the size is limited to the width and height set

392646
gif	png
png does allow for 8-bits of transparency but if you have to support ie you ll find that they continually refuse to support that correctly
they do support a single bit of transparency in an 8-bit image essentially the same as gif as far as i know
there are also numerous hacks to get 8-bit transparency to work in ie

393043
maven	m2e

you can use tycho to build your eclipse plugins with maven
this is how the m2e plugin is built

393188
testdriven.net	xunit.net	testdriven.net	xunit.net
i can t really talk about the pros cons due to lack of experience but i use xunit.net now because a i know that there is a working asp.net mvc template since version 1.1 and b assert.throws is just sexy
i use the free personal version of testdriven.net as my test runner within visual studio
there is a how to get started guide for xunit.net again i can t really compare them due to lack of experience with nunit and mbunit but i believe that all three are quite stable and usable

393695
inherited	properties
note if you are using propertygrid then you can t set the properties by hand but you can write a typeconverter which is a bit less work than a full typedescriptionprovider
just inherited from expandableobjectconverter and override getproperties
you ll still need a shim propertydescriptor so still not trivial.

393838
filesystems	ntfs

there is no limit other than the size of your disk and your filesystems limitations on a file
for example file size limits ntfs 16 tib - 64 kib ext4 16 tbs fat32 4gb - 1 on disk there is no difference between a text file and any other type of file

394333
inherited	subclassing

your classes that inherited from wxwidgets wxpython data types should not implement any business logic
wxwidgets is a gui library so any subclassing of wxapp or wxframe should remain focused on gui that is on displaying the interface and being responsive to user actions

394632
kde	gnome

here are some good alternatives to poedit translation editors lokalize for kde users kbabel is now obsolete
gtranslator for gnome users

395751
inherited	properties
the complications in the code caused by attempts to make it more declarative generally make the codebase harder to maintain harder to read and less pythonic in my opinion
it also normally requires a lot of copy.copy ing to maintain inherited and to copy from class to instance and means you have to look in many places to see whats going on always looking from metaclass up which goes against the python grain also. i have been picking through formencode and sqlalchemy code to see if such a declarative style was worth it and its clearly not
such style should be left to descriptors such as properties and methods and immutable data. ruby has better support for such declarative styles and i am glad the core python language is not going down that route

396114
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this was useful to know
if you want to do case-sensitive compare on strings then you could use a switch statement as it is faster than performing a string.compare in an if else
for some actual performance tests however if you wanted to do a case-insensitive then it is better using a if else as the resulting code is not pretty

397615
sudo	passwd

you could consider sudo
although not passwordless it doesn t require the user to be given the root passwd

398295
ienumerable	ilist

however i wonder with the late evaluation of the ienumerable generic type if that is a good idea
ilist

398766
ssl	https

in the past i ve done flex- db using asp.net web services over ssl for login etc
flash should be able to talk to any web page over https whether it s asp.net php or any other application server

399731
webclient	webrequest
namespace system.net assembly system in system.dll you can alternatively use the system.net.webclient class webclient class provides common methods for sending data to and receiving data from a resource identified by a uri
namespace system.net assembly system in system.dll this class simplifies some common tasks like downloading a file method downloadfile the webclient class provides common methods for sending data to or receiving data from any local intranet or internet resource identified by a uri
the webclient class uses the webrequest class to provide access to resources

coldfusion	railo

i would look at memcached - there is an open source project for integrating it in coldfusion here cfmemcached
if you happen to be using railo i ve heard that it also has a cluster scope

402759
rss	feed
you simply need to connect to the remote website and parse the html regular expressions are your friend here to generate the feed data
i d be inclined to have this output as rss to then fire into your joomla site
drawbacks for parsing the html include adding a whopping great dependency on their website layout -- this could be mitigated by giving them the php that generates rss for them to host as it would add value to their website as well as transferring ownership of maintenance to them

402883
google-chrome	firefox

for a basic extension you would place your code in the google-chrome content directory of the extension
you would hook this content into firefox using an overlay

402918
g++	gcc
mostly with the exception of gcc based compilers that are ported to windows
it works on my g++ 4.3.2 under linux and i used unicode api on win32 since visual c++ 6
on c c++ it s a character type written wchar_t which is larger than the simple char character type

403627
implements	extends
take a look at the following example as you see the class extends is adding a method named average to class extended
to get the average you call average method as it belongs to extended class reference as regards performance i think you can see an improvement with extension methods since they are never dispatched dynamically but it all depends on how the dynamic method is implements


405285
factors	mean
however quantum computers cannot are not believed to i mean solve np-complete problems in polynomial time and more importantly no one has built a quantum computer yet and it is not even clear if it will be possible to build one -- avoiding decoherence etc
there have been claims of quantum computers with a limited number of qubits -- 5 to 10 but clearly they are not useful for anything much. well there s a quantum computer that can factors 15 so those of you using 4-bit rsa should worry. -- bruce schneier there is also the idea of quantum cryptography which is cryptography over a quantum channel and is something quite different from quantum computation.


405310
lisp	smalltalk

both ruby and python are fairly distant from the lisp traditions of immutable data programs as data and macros
but ruby is very nearly a clone of smalltalk and i hope will grow more like smalltalk as the perlish cruft is deprecated and smalltalk like lisp is a language that takes one idea to extremes

405361
superclass	subclassing

test every single method individually for each implementation class in particular failure to override a superclass method properly is a common bug
the author of the subclassing makes assumptions about the superclass

405484
webkit	gecko

soypunk already mentioned the ua style sheet for webkit
the ua style sheet for gecko in standards mode consists of ua.css forms.css and html.css

406300
getter	setter

to put it simple you need getter for all fields that must be read from the outside
you need setter for all fields that must be written from the outside

406353
concave	angle
edit a common extension to this technique is to weed weak triangles on the hull where the longest edge or smallest internal angle exceeds a given value
this will form a better concave hull


406455
lisp	prolog
if you want to create large rule sets as a part of your application prolog is designed for this sort of thing
various people have written about the lisp ephiphany that influences the way you think about programming but i can t really vouch for this from experience - i ve only really used autolisp for writing automation scripts on autocad


406477
ubuntu	linux
scite is currently available for intel win32 and linux compatible operating systems with gtk+
it has been run on windows xp and on fedora 8 and ubuntu 7.10 with gtk+ 2.12 scintilla is a free source code editing component
it comes with complete source code and a license that permits use in any free project or commercial product

406479
lisp	smalltalk
smalltalk is oo language with message pass instead method calls
lisp is lisp
- it means truly functional language with powerful macro system oo support which never seen in other language in cl and many more features

406977
lisp	smalltalk
iow you enter the smalltalk vm and work inside it rather than just writing text that is source code
lisp - much closer to functional programming although with imperative overtones
the prefix notation is the first barrier to most people who like other languages but the concept and use of macros is a much more substantial one

407475
google-chrome	firefox
now that gmail suggests people switch from ie to firefox and google-chrome i m guessing we ll see ie lose more and more market share to those browsers
google-chrome doesn t have much of a user-base now but i can imagine that will change


407493
swt	swing
yed is written in java probably swing
a number of p2p softwares are written in java including frostwire i see no trace of swt there but i can just miss it
and this list is far from exhaustive

408146
django	turbogears
and then there is django and turbogears etc. which is guided by the same just-the-tools-needed philosophy as rails it can be argued who got there first or who did it better
a lot of people would probably agree that the django rails cakephp approach is better than the older approaches but as the older language python has a lot more legacy frameworks that are still trying to evolve and stay relevant
these frameworks will hang on because there is already developer buy-in for them

408830
awt	swing
features of widgets that aren t the same on every platform might not be supported or worse they might work differently on each platform
people used to invest lots of effort to get their awt applications to work consistently across platforms - for instance they may try to make calls into native code from java
because awt uses native gui widgets your os knows about them and handles putting them in front of each other etc. whereas swing widgets are meaningless pixels within a window from your os s point of view

409042
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

i m sure i ll get flamed for saying this but--you could just ignore opera
if you like how things look in the other browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome then i d say you ve got 99 of your bases covered

409042
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
if you like how things look in the other browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome then i d say you ve got 99 of your bases covered
you may want to file a bug against opera of course
though i guess it could be jquery--it may have a different code path for opera

409235
client-side	server-side

if i understand correctly the i think you should use a client-side javascript timer instead
you can not use a server-side timer for this

409743
union	distinct
the structure your dealing with is occasionally referred to as a partitioned table although it s usually done to separate the dataset into distinct files as well rather than to just split the dataset arbitrarily
if you re in charge of the database structure and there s no good reason to partition the data then i d build one big table with an extra origin field that contains a country code but you re probably doing it for legitimate performance reason. either use a union to join the tables you re interested in or by using the merge database engine


410095
queue	fifo
fifo pipes are like regular pipes so you can read and write with minimal code changes
system v message queue require putting the data into a structure and invoking msgsnd
either approach would be fine however

410373
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
the zlibstream does rfc 1950 compression
dotnetzip does zip64 passwords aes encryption streams sfx and unicode
everyone who uses it says it is much simpler to use than sharpziplib

410598
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
while these new ordinalignorecase string comparison algorithms are great for your local ntfs drive they might not yield the right answer on your fat drive or a network share
when possible let the filesystems tell you
createfile can tell you if a given filename exists

411958
fgets	fgetc
you don t need to use fgetc
you should probably read the stdio man page but the canonical thing would be to open the file with fopen 3 then read using fgets 3 to read a line at a time
that would look something like you could also look at libini at sourceforge

411970
dictionary	map
according to msdn - nullable types are also supported and map to json in the same way as non-nullable types
nonetheless i think it s worth looking at in a similar manner to as i have suggested as this is where your problem is occurring hope this helps edit 3 - it seems strange why a dictionary with a dictionary value would not be possible to represent in a json string
consider that a dictionary looks like this in json a dictionary with a dictionary value would therefore look like so i believe which is valid json according to jsonlint - the json validator

412091
postgresql	mysql

for any application that wants to use an open source database the hands-down answer is postgresql
it s a lot more enterprise-ready than mysql not to mention that it follows the sql standard a lot better

412098
uiview	calayer	uiview	calayer
my assertion that the calayer associated with a uiview shares the same coordinate system could in fact be entirely erroneous
it could also be that calayers use the same coordinate system as uiview they re never flipped vertically but i thought they were since coregraphics uses a flipped coordinate system relative to uikit
a simple way to test would be to add a screen-sized calayer as the sublayer of a view s layer then add another small calayer as a sublayer of that

412549
inherited	properties
a mixin can of course be implemented as you like complete with private fields properties methods etc
if your class also needs to express is-a relationships with the mixins then you need to do the following this is also the standard way how multiple inherited is emulated in c#. of course the mixin interfaces as well as the mixin classes can be generics with a most-derived class parameter or whatever


412880
emacs	textmate
ruby development on mac textmate - ok so not exactly free but its cheap
python development eclipse with pydev plugin or emacs everything else emacs


413093
equals	icomparable	equals	gethashcode

the system.object class equals and gethashcode - not all classes are comparable or hashable should be moved to an interface
iequatable or icomparable or similar comes to mind

413125
prepare	execute

always use prepare there will be an equivalent to preparestatement but the exact function name will depend on your database and driver combination
the advantages of a prepared statement over an execute string are many - the statement is parsed and an access plan determind only once when the prepare statement is execute

413338
mouse	keyboard
you can also use and to select the file tab to the left or right of the current one
it is possible to re-arrange the file tabs by using the mouse to drag-sort them click and hold the mouse button on a tab and then drag it to the new location
this should make it possible to arrange them so that keyboard switching is more natural

413743
tortoisegit	svn
start now don t delay
git is moving really fast and there s already a tortoisegit being developed
svn is still a great standard to work with

413855
apache	nginx	ssl	https
it does not support ssl https
you ll have to run it using apache nginx or some other web server that supports ssl in order to test


413862
vmware	bootcamp

i ve run it in vmware fusion and parallels previously on several macs with 2 gig of ram without any issues
i generally install with bootcamp because that lets you boot into native windows if you need more umph or if you want to game and the more recent versions of vmware and parallels both allow booting the vm directly from the bootcamp partition

414597
mouse	keyboard
a different twitch could be tied to another macro or insert an html template etc
my productivity was improved greatly by this device - i never had to move my hands away from the home row to use a mouse or to execute a gesture and i could still use regular old ctrl-alt-shift-foo key combos if i needed to which of course one does in emacs
i miss the touchstream greatly but unfortunately the mechanical design of the thing was fragile and after the company disappeared i opted to sell the keyboard for significantly more than i paid for it - the touchstream enthusiast community is still out there rather than put up with an unplanned breakage

414919
wordpress	elgg	wordpress	joomla	joomla	elgg
i would try elgg www.elgg.org - it s open source and pretty mature at this point
there are also various modules plugins for various cmss drupal plone joomla wordpress etc. that you can use to add socnet functionality to a site


414934
innodb	myisam
because innodb provides row-locking rather than table-locking your select s can be concurrent not just with each other but also with many insert s
however unless you are intending to use sql transactions set the innodb commit flush to 2 innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit
this gives you back a lot of raw performance that you would otherwise lose when moving tables from myisam to innodb

415091
multiplying	addition
in addition programmable calculator can store short sequences of keystrokes as a program which later can be replayed with a single keypress
say you set this sequence as a program one instruction per line now you have a custom operation pressing the program key or which one you ve assigned to it will run the sequence without your further assistance and will multiplying the content of the display with 2 and will add 1 - this is a program
later you can try more enhanced techniques storing temporary results to memory branch on result

415444
bash	zsh
bash complicates this in that .bashrc is only read by a shell that s both interactive and non-login so you ll find most people end up telling their .bash_profile to also read .bashrc with something like other shells behave differently - eg with zsh .zshrc is always read for an interactive shell whether it s a login one or not
the manual page for bash explains the circumstances under which each file is read
yes behaviour is generally consistent between machines

415748
bash	subshell

it can be done in bash itself if you have control of the configuration file format
you just need to source . the configuration file rather than subshell it

416093
boost	stl
the only minor pita was serialization - the mfc containers carray clist cstringarray etc. support carchive serialization but when using stl containers you have to roll your own code
in the end i switched to using boost serialization and dumped the mfc carchive stuff


416189
firefox	safari

using mod_wsgi made the problem go away for firefox
limiting my research to an interaction problem between apache and safari i stumbled upon this bug report for apache that describes something very similar to what is happening and it is apparently still open

416274
try-catch	exception-handling
if you are pretty sure that all your strings are valid ints then int32.parse is the way to go
if you suspect that any more than a negligible few are going to be valid then it is much quicker to use int32.tryparse rather than a try-catch in your loop
typically if your try-catch is outside the loop use int32.parse - you ll get an exception-handling and stop the first time you get an invalid value

416274
try-catch	exception-handling
typically if your try-catch is outside the loop use int32.parse - you ll get an exception-handling and stop the first time you get an invalid value
if your try-catch is inside the loop use int32.tryparse instead
both int32.parse and int32.tryparse are pretty highly optimised and are relatively mature - i d expect them to be very tough to improve on unless you have specialist circumstances

416374
profiling	debugging

i do this with both a dev profiling loaded and an ad hoc provisioning profiling loaded on my main phone - no issues so far
edit one thing i don t do is debugging code remotely on the phone

416798
websphere	ibm

the actual websphere ant tasks are defined in wsanttasks.jar
a possible path for linux systems is opt ibm websphere appserver lib wsanttasks.jar however i doubt that you will be successfull just by including that as i do remember trying it once and it failed because of dependecies

416917
boost	allocator

replacing your containers with boost containers is not a good idea
the work to make appropriate custom allocator wouldn t be that bad but you d be violating the spirit of your allocate at startup rule

417001
comparator	comparable
however you ll probably have to have your domain class implement comparable
i don t think you can do it using a comparator
edit it seems like i misunderstood the question

417007
vb.net	vb6
the other issue is the availability of class libraries
the full bcl includes the microsoft.visualbasic namespace which is automatically referenced by the vb.net compiler
this contains vb6 compatibility functions the my namespace features as well as some compiler helper functions and is commonly referred to as the vb.net runtime

417012
awt	swing
this allowed the awt to rely heavily on the paint subsystem in each native platform
... with the introduction of lightweight components in jdk 1.1 a lightweight component is one that reuses the native window of its closest heavyweight ancestor the awt needed to implement the paint processing for lightweight components in the shared java code
as swing is implemented in java it does have some performance disadvantage however i hear that performance has improved in recent releases of java

417454
equals	gethashcode

here s my set of tuples they re autogenerated by a python script so i ve perhaps gone a bit overboard link to subversion repository you ll need a username password they re both guest they are based on inheritance but will not compare equals to even if they happen to have the same values for the two first members
they also implement gethashcode and tostring and so forth and lots of smallish helper methods

417912
gridview	repeater
but and here s the big thing learn standards compliant html too
most of the drag and drop controls in visual studio do horrible horrible things to html gridview i m looking at you
if you follow proper html standards you ll also use learn what controls are more useful repeater than others when developing clean websites

418080
uilabel	nsstring
keep a reference to the text fields and when a button is pressed update the field s text property with a new nsstring to change its contents
if the text fields are not directly editable by the user you may want to use uilabel instead which is basically just a non-editable text field and which also has a read write text property


418145
vb.net	vb6
if you were a mac os programmer in the 80s and 90s you d probably be a bit annoyed too if not quite in the same boat as vb6 programmers
.net and vb.net c# are a viable proposition in the long term
they are in a different situation to stuff like classic vb and foxpro in that they run in a virtual machine that has use to lots of different languages

418252
boost	allocator
no need for animal to define a copy constructor
cons requires either boost or tr1 libraries or another smart-pointer implementation
track all animal allocator in animallister pros ideal for situations where you need a bunch of animal s for a limited amount of time and plan to release them all at once

418411
listview	gridview
if you need the built in sorting paging then the gridview can be very helpful
if you want the best of both worlds upgrade to asp.net 3.5 and use the listview


418434
listview	gridview

i think the repeater or the newer listview is the way to go if you don t need sorting and or paging
the repeater and listview allow you to control the html the gridview is a total black box in this regard and generates atrocious html while avoiding the tedious server-side code that comes with the control ok new row

418592
haskell	scheme
i just use this naming scheme for small functions otherwise i don t know what the f refers to
however if you do want to export your helper function because it might be useful to others i would call it reverseaccumulator like haskell s zip and zipwith . but i wouldn t call those helper functions zipwith is just a generic function and zip is the default implementation probably the one thats used the most


419600
tiff	png
tiff remains widely accepted as a photograph file standard in the printing business
the tiff can handle device-specific colour spaces such as the cmyk defined by a particular set of printing press inks
png the png portable network graphics file format was created as the free open-source successor to the gif

419602
gif	bmp	gif	png
as there is no loss of information in lossless compression it is not able to achieve as high a compression as lossy compression in most cases
examples of lossless image compression is png and gif
gif only allows 8-bit images. tiff and bmp are both wrapper formats as the data inside can depend upon the compression technique that is used

419619
allocator	stl
i assume that c is being used over c++ for performance reasons and hence stl is not an option
edit as per request from filip s comment a simple strcat implementation based on a fixed size char buffer using dynamic allocator in this case you have to free your buffer manually when you are finished with it
handled by destructors in c++ equivalents addendum pax okay since you didn t actually explain why you had to create here it is

419668
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
for instance the array might be subdivided into chunks of a size that will fit easily in ram say a few thousand elements the chunks sorted using an efficient algorithm such as quicksort or heapsort and the results merged as per mergesort
this is less efficient than just doing mergesort in the first place but it requires less physical ram to be practical than a full quicksort on the whole array
techniques can also be combined

419869
freebsd	linux

not really a comparison but here are what big projects are using centralized vcses subversion apache gcc ruby mplayer zope plone xiph freebsd webkit .
cvs cvs distributed vcses git linux kernel kde perl ruby on rails android wine fedora x.org mediawiki django vlc mono gnome samba cups gnupg emacs elpa.

420228
comparator	comparable
the comparable interface is used to impose a natural ordering on the objects of the implementing class
the comparator method is called the natural comparison method
the comparator interface is used to impose a total ordering on the objects of the implementing class

420240
comparator	comparable
use case contexts comparable interface the equals method and and operators test for equality inequality but do not provide a way to test for relative values
some classes eg string and other classes with a natural ordering implement the interface which defines a comparator method
you will want to implement in your class if you want to use it with collections.sort or arrays.sort methods

420242
comparator	comparable	comparator	comparable
compareto is a method of the interface comparable so it is used to compare this instance to another one
compare is a method of the interface comparator so it is used to compare two different instances of another class with each other
if you will implementing comparable means that instances of the class can be easily compared

420242
comparator	comparable
if you will implementing comparable means that instances of the class can be easily compared
implementing comparator means that instances are suited to compare different objects of other classes


422420
kerberos	ntlm
edit looks like firefox has some support for this too and safari on macos edit for details on apache google modules for ntlm authentication
kerberos modules also exist
as per other answers this really only works on an intranet - not just because the browser needs to be in an intranet zone only applies to ie but because any intervening firewall will typically stop this working and because the necessary interdomain trusts will probably not exist

422511
kerberos	ntlm
i don t know which browsers support this off hand but my assumption would be that most do
from my experience kerberos is more of a prefered method but i have not worked with it much so unfortunately i don t have much advise as far as that goes
on a side note i recall reading somewhere that the jre also has ways of tying into ntlm on your web server in order to obtain identity information for the authenticated user

423733
rss	feed
you can generate these feed using apple s itunes music store rss generator
furthermore this really isn t the type of thing rss is designed to do
the list of podcasts in itunes is enormous and wrapping each podcast in xml tags would create an even more enormous file

424308
accessor	properties
if you re not entirely comfortable with that write a properties accessor on the page that acts as a facade to retrieve the value from the viewstate
later if you feel compelled to convert it to a hidden field the accessor can handle that switch seemlessly for the rest of the code
just be sure you document your reasons for doing so

424936
bitwise-and	modulo
however in my experience calling the modulo costs more than the benefit one gets so i use bit tricks involving 255 2 8-1 to compute the residue
for better or worse i am not using the trick of reading individual bytes out of a word only bitwise-and and shifts. to actually check if the residue is a square i look up the answer in a precomputed table. finally try to compute the square root using a method similar to hensel s lemma
i don t think it s applicable directly but it works with some modifications. before doing that i divide out all powers of 2 with a binary search at this point for our number to be a square it must be 1 mod 8. the basic structure of hensel s lemma is the following

426058
bazaar	git

take a look at bazaar
it s rather less daunting than git and has a useful-looking interface to subversion repositories via bzr-svn

426823
ubuntu	linux
it s available on cpan or you can probably get it through your package manager if you re using linux or another unix-like os
in ubuntu the package is called libtext-csv-perl
it can handle cases like fields that are quoted because they contain a comma something that a simple split command can t handle

426861
jsf	seam
spring mvc seam struts are not suitable here
jsf is a good choice but it has quite a learning curve
i don t find it too difficult though but folks usually complain this alot and i have seen developers doesn t really understand the philosophy soon enough

427015
cdr	cons
when you define list 1 and list 2 it is like then when you append basically a cons cell consists of two parts
a value the car and a pointer the cdr
append is defined to not change the first list so that is copied but then the last cdr normally nil is changed to point at the second list not a copy of the second list

427231
getter	setter

your second example won t compile as the getter s value variable doesn t exist
also the setter would result in the eponymous stackoverflow exception

427463
cassini	iis

i assume you re talking about cassini the one visual studio comes with for development - if so then you re out of luck because you can t change the default document it uses or not in any way i know of anyway
to work around it you can set your project to use a local iis installation instead - that will give you more control over directory browsing default documents etc

427490
bash	zsh	bash	zsh
this autocompletion is a shell feature either bash or zsh whatever you use
see for example an introduction to bash autocompletion also part 2
for zsh see for example this guide

428444
grouplayout	miglayout
miglayout comes to mind check the example form at the bottom of the linked page or jgoodies formlayout which is especially good at formslike these
the standard layout managers are good but whoefully inadequate for frequent use for screens like these the new grouplayout used by the matisse designer in netbeans wasn t built for nothing
the linked layout managers are a lot easier to use and maintain imho

429159
inherited	subclassing

one way to solve this is to use composition instead of inherited
you could pass the jpanel into your subclassing of the jtable

429192
websphere	ibm

i assume by websphere you mean the regular j2ee application server and not something like community edition
websphere is a brand name applied to a number of ibm products

429284
jar	war
this can be done by placing the xerces jar in the root of the ear file if you have one or prepare the ear file with xerces.jar and your war file in the root
the xmlparserv2 jar should then be placed in web-inf lib
you could also attempt creating an xerces shared library for usage by your application

430014
serializable	deserialization

i use it in a binary serializable protobuf-net
i use reflection only to build the model - when it is used during deserialization it is using delegates etc for maximum performance

430323
bash	tcsh
this is the distinction in tcsh of limit vs limit -h
or in bash of ulimit -sa vs ulimit -ha
or programmatically of rlim_cur vs rlim_max in struct rlimit

430476
base	fractions
on average then a brute force attack will find a successful password in about n k 2 or n k-1 trials
for convenience and because of some information-theoretic considerations i m not going to go into we usually express that as a number of bits which is lg n k where lg denotes the logarithm base 2
because we re used to thinking of bits as discrete things we actually usually take the ceiling of that number ie the least integer greater than lg n k but in fact the fractions value is perfectly legitimate

430810
filesystems	fat

keep in mind that you might have multiple filesystems with different casing rules
for example the root filesystem could be case-sensitive but you can have a case-insensitive filesystem an usb stick with a fat filesystem on it mounted somewhere

430810
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this works on the original case-insensitive file system but not on the case-sensitive system
thus i would suggest that you avoid depending on whether the file system is case-sensitive or not if you can
do not generate file names that differ only by case use the standard file picker dialogs be prepared that the case might change etc

431657
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
as for an ide well i believe the only thing half way stable that will work right now on mac os x is monodevelop i mean you could run parallels and develop your code on a windows vm with visual studio and as long as you follow certain guidelines about portability you could use vs to develop your mono apps
although you probably might as well get familiar with monodevelop
it would be interesting to see if sharpdevelop ever gets ported

432214
equals	gethashcode

i prefer not to override equals just to enable testing
don t forget that if you do override equals you really should override gethashcode also or you may get unexpected results if you are using your objects in a dictionary for example

432306
ocaml	scheme
if you do choose a lisp variant i recommend scheme
i have not used ocaml or ruby but some of my friends swear by them though one could argue how functional they are
on the other hand their multi-paradigm nature makes them very convenient in practice

multiplying	multiplication
however intel and presumably other manufacturers publish a list of instruction throughput and latency timings the throughput is the number of clock cycles actually needed on the relevant execution unit s the latency is a worst case number of clock cycles required once an instruction starts executing before the result of that execution is available as input to another instruction so for example if say floating point add and multiplying instructions each have a throughput of 2 and a latency of 5 actually for multiplying it s a bit greater i think that means that adding a register to itself or multiplying it by itself will likely take two clock cycles since there are no other dependent values whereas adding it the result of a previous multiplication will take something like or a bit less than 2+5 clock cycles depending where you start finish timing and on all sorts of other things
during some of those clock cycles another add multiplying operation could be taking place so it s arguable how many cycles you actually attribute to the individual add mutliply instructions anyway... oh and just as a concrete example
for following java code hotspot 1.6.12 jit-compiles the inner loop sequence to the following intel code consisting of a load-add-store for each position in the array with randomval being held in xmm0a in this case each group of load-add-store appears to take 5 clock cycles

ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection

ilist only implements ienumerable by associaton
it implements ienumerable precisely because it inherits icollection which is ienumerable

434697
ienumerable	icollection	implements	extends

i assume you want to know why it declares that it implements icollection as well as ienumerable when the first implies the second
i suspect the main reason is clarity it means people don t need to look back to icollection to check that that already extends ienumerable

434697
implements	extends
i suspect the main reason is clarity it means people don t need to look back to icollection to check that that already extends ienumerable
there are other times when you need to redeclare an interface implementation if you want to re-implement an interface method which was previously explicitly implements in a base class - but i don t think that s the reason in this case
edit i ve been assuming that the source code that the docs are built from has the declaration including both interfaces

434951
octal	decimal

a numeric literal that starts with a zero is interpreted as octal so writing 01004 is exactly the same as writing 516
some other answers suggesting using parseint inside the function to convert the octal value to decimal

435609
mouse	keyboard
we actually added keyboard hook support to the latest version of the sdf if you re after something pre-built or for code
mouse events however are not hookable in ce unless you write a new touch panel driver


435831
vb.net	vb6
if costs are a constraint you could try this there is a wizard in visual studio that will attempt to upgrade vb6 to vb.net
it s not 100 accurate and you will have to write code for things vb.net does not support such as control arrays etc
once the code is in vb.net you can use a tool like sharpdevelop to convert the vb.net to c#

436417
firefox	safari
normal or break-word. this is currently supported in ie safari and firefox 3.1 alpha
with older and current versions of firefox there is no standard way google was my friend of doing it
some suggest using a small script that adds in the middle of the word

436535
division	multiplication
in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine
on the other hand if your compiler is a very good one and knows the trick how to optimize integer division by a constant latest gcc does i just checked it will generate the code above anyway gcc will create exactly this code for 3 if you enable at least optimization level 1
for other compilers.

436754
inherited	subclassing

accessor methods themselves getdee are inherited but instance variables are not
if instance variables could be overridden in subclassing like you re trying to do here it would cause many more problems than it would fix

bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
one of factors you might want to consider is the support for inetracting with svn
git has git-svn bazaar has bzr-svn and mercurial has hgsubversion extension

cvs	svn

i ve never really been a cvs user so i do not know what common use-cases the solved wanted to... by using check-out hooks actually i haven t known them
svn provides pre-commit and post-commit hooks among some others which should be able to do whatever one wants to be done per-change on the source

439744
firefox	safari
on the plus side it s trivial to just use the constructor that takes a string instead
you don t even have to convert the numeric month into a string on firefox at least so i was hoping a naive implementation would work
however after trying it out it works successfully in firefox chrome and opera but fails in konqueror invalid date safari invalid date and ie nan

inherited	properties	inherited	properties
the style collection properties itself is read-only you can t replace it but you can an element to it to reflect setting that style properties
table.style.add display none or the same is true for table rows as the style collection is inherited from htmlgenericcontrol
edit the html control needs to be runat server for this to work which i m assuming yours is since you are able to set the visible properties

440822
client-side	server-side
telerik s unique advantage is that you can render both client-side and server-side meaning you can support clients that do not have javascript enabled
for many telerik controls you can either a eliminate extra code on the page by disabling features due to internal load-as-needed script logic or b significantly reduce the impact of client-side code by using provide script combiners and compressors
being a long time web developer though i always encourage people to use the right tool for the job

441315
actionscript	mxml

technically speaking int main is analagous to the constructor of the application class in actionscript 3
what this means for flex is that whatever is the root node of the application mxml file generally mx application the constructor for that class is your int main

441406
vb6	vba
if i had to put money on one outcome and i wouldn t want to bet much even then i d be looking at the dynamic language runtime and the fact that several languages are in various states of preparedness to run on it
suppose the dlr with some suitable replacement or wrapper for the office app com model were to replace the vb6 runtime
further suppose vba were implemented as a dlr language

441936
mouse	keyboard
maybe the keyboard is the most efficient interface for entering in complex relationships and symbols
there are more alternatives than just a mouse or a touch screens or a tablet
zillions of ways of interacting with a computer- we have just all settled on one or two rather ordinary ways

442233
google-chrome	firefox
values are normalized after the fastest result per browser to make it easier to compare which method is faster conclusion when i did this test 3 years ago -a was fastest but now math.abs x is faster in firefox
in google-chrome abs a and -a got the same time and it was only 3 ms difference to the slowest method when i tested it with 10 000 000 numbers
my recommendation use math.abs a

442707
client-side	server-side

most of the answers so far have been client-side
on the server-side you can generate a hidden field with a guid when you first produce the form and then record that guid as a submitted form when the post is received

443665
debian	linux
the 3ds2pov program is quite old so i don t know how compatible it is with current 3ds files
the archive comes with source code so ought to build without too much difficulty on debian
pov-ray itself runs easily on linux

client-side	server-side

if the vbscript is client-side you have a problem
if it runs server-side then it s easy as long as the web server has read rights

444369
firefox	safari
for best results use opera 9.2x- not 9.5+ safari or konqueror on this page
it partially works in firefox nested functions are not tidied meaning that most scripts you want to tidy still end up unreadable and fails to reformat code in ie and icab 3-
since you can always keep a copy of opera 9.2 on your computer as well as whatever the current version is i recommend you use opera and keep a copy of it around for use with jstidy

444692
try-catch	exception-handling
2 things
put the try-catch blocks where they make sense
if you re interested in exception-handling from mycall as well as i s value then use throw objects of different classes for different errors

445982
uiview	calayer
the problem was that drawrect inside a uiimageview subclass was not being called by the calayer for the drawing
so when i switched the parent of this subclass to uiview implemented my own property for the image and also adjusted the animation - everything came together
the animation s containerview in the code above was changed to be a vanilla uiview instance

webclient	webrequest
update webclient is simpler to use than webrequest
normally you could stick to using just webclient unless you need to manipulate requests responses in an advanced way
see this article where both are used

inherited	properties

it s all tied to how inherited works in javascript
check this link for a detailed explanation basically constructor is just another properties of the prototype

449955
inherited	properties
check this link for a detailed explanation basically constructor is just another properties of the prototype
edit also if you want real prototypical inherited you have to use some sort of clone function eg then you can do things like this and you ll still get true two times on document.writeln obj instanceof sub
document.writeln obj instanceof base

450070
selecteditem	selectedindex
you have selecteditem or selectedindex
if you have the objects you used to fill the combo box then you can use selecteditem
if not you can get the collection of items property items and iterate that until you get the value you want and use that with the other properties

450456
division	modulo
so the definition of modulo will nearly always depend on the definition of integer division
there are two choices for integer division by negative numbers 2 -18 0 or 2 -18 -1
depending on which one is true for your language will usually change the operator

450963
inherited	properties
i ran into the same snag and solved the problem in the following manner
i inherited from the authorizeattribute class and added a method override for the authorizecore method
the functionality of the method had a call to isinrole and passes in the static string properties

451335
vb.net	vb6

my is a feature added in visual studio 2005 for vb.net
the intention of the feature is to give users more of the api feel they were accustomed to with vb6

rss	feed

you could validate the rss with a relaxng schema
schemas for all the different feed formats should be available online.

udp	tcp
by default only the default instance runs on tcp 1433
if the client can t connect on the default port it queries the sql browser at udp 1434 to locate the correct port to use for a given named instance


453041
prepare	execute

say you have multiple controls that prepare some data in the load event
if you want to take action on that data in the load step of the asp.net lifecycle you need to have a way to execute after all the other load s have run

453149
matlab	simulink
it contains highly optimised matrix and other mathematical functions so it s not as slow as you might think if used properly
i believe that there is a compiler that can compile a matlab program into an equivalent c program which can then be compiled to an executable
i m not sure what simulink is exactly

453429
inline	inlining
it may decide than your stand-alone function is a good candidate for inline expansion
in many cases the compiler is in a much better position to determine if a function should be inline than you are so there is no point in second-guessing it
i like to use implicit inlining when a class has many small functions only because it s convenient to have the implementation right there in the class

453721
punctuation	words
in particular most screen readers have a number of punctuation settings such as some most and all
so it depends which category the screen reader puts the ellipses character into which punctuation setting the user has selected and what action the user is taking
for example in the jaws for windows screen reader www.freedomscientific.com the ellipses isn t read when reading the document but is read when navigating by letter or words

453751
kerberos	ntlm

there are 3 authentication protocols that can be used to perform authentication between java and active directory on linux or any other platform and these are not just specific to http services kerberos - kerberos provides single sign-on sso and delegation but web servers also need spnego support to accept sso through ie
ntlm - ntlm supports sso through ie and other browsers if they are properly configured

453751
kerberos	ldap	kerberos	ntlm
note that when mentioning kerberos and ntlm in the same breath i have to also mention spengo and integrated windows authentication iwa
iwa is a simple term that basically means kerberos or ntlm or spnego to negotiate kerberos or ntlm
using an ldap bind as a way to validate credentials is not efficient and requires ssl

453751
kerberos	ntlm
but i haven t tried it
the sun implementation of kerberos has been a comedy of errors over the years so based on sun s track record in this area i wouldn t make any promises about their spengo implementation until you have that bird in hand
for ntlm there is a free oss project called jcifs that has an ntlm http authentication servlet filter

454010
inherited	properties
my suggestion is to enhance your is a has a heuristic with the liskov substitution principle
to check whether an inherited relationship complies with the liskov substitution principle ask whether clients of a base class can operate on the sub class without knowing that it is operating on a sub class
of course all the properties of the sub class must be preserved

454575
matlab	simulink

there is also a subset of the matlab language called embedded matlab eml which will allow you to convert your m code to c code for embedded targets
as well as simulation and generating c c++ code simulink allows you to do verification and validation of your model

455166
redmine	mantis	redmine	trac	trac	mantis

our bitnami project website provides free one-click installers for a number of open source projects that include integration with subversion and all the dependencies that are needed to run ruby on rails in the case of redmine python in the case of trac and so on
the installers are self-contained they won t touch your system and take literally minutes to install or uninstall so you can easily test-drive redmine mantis trac etc

455222
wordpress	joomla
google sites are free and easy to set up use but they re damn ugly
set up a free blogger or wordpress account or run a hosted wordpress installation
engines like joomla tend to be a bit technical on the admin back-end but are also easy to edit from a front end editor s point of view - their wysiwyg editor allows you to edit content from the front end which i ve found useful for non-technical types

455242
emacs	aquamacs

emacs carbon with slime and clojure-mode works like a charm
i tried aquamacs before and it feels too different from the command line emacs for me

455257
trie	tree

i would suggest using a trie
basically you have a tree with 1 node per unique character

455776
haskell	ocaml
this syntactic form defining a function using patterns on arguments is not often too useful in practice for the exact reason you described
i think haskell did a number of things better than ml when it comes to syntactic forms but f# s roots are in ml
the benefit is that a good subset of f# cross-compiles with ocaml which helped bootstrap the f# language and user community

456313
spweb	spsite
as to why this is the case stefan goßner provides a great summary here each spweb and spsite object holds a reference to an sprequest object which holds a reference to a sharepoint com object that is responsible to communicate with the backend sql server
disposing a spweb object will not actually remove the spweb object from memory actually the .net framework does not allow to remove any object from memory in a deterministic way but it will call a method of the spweb object which causes the com object to close the connection to the sql server and to release its allocated memory
that means the connection to the backend sql server will remain open from the moment the sprequest object has been created till the spweb object is disposed

457056
httphandler	httpmodule

from my experience ireadonlysessionstate and irequiressessionstate only apply to httphandler
iis httpmodule unable to set session

457325
innodb	myisam
important to note in mysql count is very fast on myisam tables for or not-null columns since the row count is cached
innodb has no row count caching so there is no difference in performance for count or count column_name regardless if the column can be null or not
you can read more on the differences on this post at the mysql performance blog

458776
awt	swing
i think a swing awt component must have focus for this to work
you ll want to hook in the java awt event queue to be absolutely sure you can get a global jvm wide keypress
use i think there may be other ways to accomplish global key presses with action maps

458986
pascal	delphi
it certainly requires some fundamental msi knowledge which i find really hard to obtain through the general lack of easy tutorials
inno setup allows you to create quite powerful exe installers with an easy largely .ini-file based syntax but it forces you to learn pascal if you need custom coding
as a long-time delphi coder i d always go inno setup though that s probably very biased i m an inno setup fan since around 1996

459061
perforce	cvs

one option is to use perforce as if you were disconnected from the server and reconcile your changes later rather than telling perforce everything you do before you do it
this is roughly equivalent to the workflow in cvs or subversion. you would synchronize your working copy go off and develop and then ask perforce to figure out what you did while it wasn t watching

459061
perforce	cvs
this is roughly equivalent to the workflow in cvs or subversion. you would synchronize your working copy go off and develop and then ask perforce to figure out what you did while it wasn t watching
perforce has a nice document describing the process working disconnected from the perforce server one thing the document doesn t mention is the allwrite clientspec attribute which marks all files in your working directory as writable instead of only the files you have checked out


459582
cvs	svn

i ve never tried what you want but i m doing something similar with cvs
basically i d suggest create a new git repository with the history from svn in this new repository git fetch everything from the git repository there ll be no commits in common then git branch remote branch branch-last and git rebase --onto svn-last remote branch-first branch-last where remote branch-first is the first commit of your imported git repository etc

profiling	instrumentation
the instrumentation approach can give you all the precision and data you might want but will slow down the program and that will change its performance characteristics
by contrast with sampling based approaches you can tune the performance impact against the length of time you need to run the program against the accuracy of the profiling data you obtain


460764
profiling	instrumentation
sampling is done by the profiling and it looks into the binary code
the profiling can also techniques like hooks or trap windows events messages for the purpose of profiling
both instrumentation and sampling methods have their own overheads

460764
profiling	instrumentation	profiling	instrumentation
both instrumentation and sampling methods have their own overheads
the amount of overhead depends - if the sampling frequency is set to high values then the profiling itself can contribute significantly to the performance being reported
instrumentation vs sampling it is not like one is better than the other approach

461483
listview	gridview

i dont think there is a way to do it on a listview without overriding the paint event
however if you are able to switch to a gridview you can do it like so ref

461661
xslt	xquery
a variant of this technique uses the new xslt 3.0 xslt iterate instruction to iterate over the records in place of xslt for-each. this allows working data to be maintained as the records are processed this makes it possible for example to output totals or averages at the end of the run or to make the processing of one record dependent on what came before it in the file
the xslt iterate instruction also allows early exit from the loop which makes it possible for a transformation to process data from the beginning of a large file without actually reading the whole file
burst-mode streaming is available in both xslt and xquery but there is no equivalent in xquery to the xslt iterate construct

461661
xslt	xquery
burst-mode streaming is available in both xslt and xquery but there is no equivalent in xquery to the xsl iterate construct
streaming templates this approach follows the traditional xslt processing pattern of performing a recursive descent of the input xml hierarchy by matching template rules to the nodes at each level but does so one element at a time without building the tree in memory
every template belongs to a mode perhaps the default unnamed mode and streaming is a property of the mode that can be specified using the new xsl mode declaration

461754
cvs	svn
i use svn with the tortoisesvn shell add-on and i m quite happy with it
cvs is alright too but gets very slow as projects get large


461797
ant	maven
cargo is not only a maven plugin it also has a java api and an ant task
so you could probably call the cargo ant task from your ant mojo i think you ll just need the cargo jars in your plugin s classpath
rewrite your ant mojo in java and invoke the cargo api you d want to look at the sources of the cargo plugin

462013
listview	gridview
for example the panel in 1 1.1 render to a table while in later versions it s a div
but overall for 2 3 here goes panel - div panel -- groupingtext ### is fieldset legend label - span button - input type button link button - href with js postback script hyperlink - standard href image button - input type image textbox -- default is input type text textbox -- mode password is input type password textbox -- mode multiline is textarea dropdownlistfor - select listbox - select radiobutton - input radio with groupname checkbox - input checkbox repeater listview --complex
gridview - table table - table file - input type file that s the basics

462454
cassini	iis

you can try the cassini web server
edit and now 6 1 2 years later i d recommend iis express instead

462567
equals	gethashcode
then this means that all your objects should be immutable or the gethashcode method should be based on properties of your object that are immutable. suppose for instance that you have this class naive implementation this implementation already violates the rules that can be found in msdn. suppose you have 2 instances of this class
the name property of instance1 is set to pol and the name property of instance2 is set to piet . both instances return a different hashcode and they re also not equal. now suppose that i change the name of instance2 to pol then according to my equals method both instances should be equals and according to one of the rules of msdn they should return the same hashcode
however this cannot be done since the hashcode of instance2 will change and msdn states that this is not allowed

nsis	uninstaller
it doesn t put any uninstaller info into add remove
we re using nullsoft s nsis and not the visual studio installer btw...


463769
stateless	stateful
however doing so on a singleton is not a reliable way to capture process or appdomain tear-down
at the risk of offering subjective design advice if the object is truly stateless make it a static class
if it is stateful question why it is a singleton you re creating a mutable global variable

463954
firefox	safari	profiling	debugging
each profile can have separate preferences themes and plugins
start firefox on windows this way firefox.exe -profilemanager to create or manage profiling
i use firefox and webkit for web debugging and safari for regular web browsing however

464096
kerberos	ntlm
as i eluded to earlier ntlm is only one of several windows security support providers ssp
there s also a digest ssp kerberos ssp etc
but the negotiate ssp which is also known as spnego is usually the provider that ms uses in their own protocol clients

464432
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	perforce

bazaar is a good option
its simpler to install than subversion perforce or cvs and no server component is required

464661
prepare	execute
instead just prepare a query
the prepare will fail if mysterytable does not exist
there is no need to actually execute the prepared statement

465681
cvs	svn
cvs is file oriented not snapshot changeset oriented which makes merging beween branches rather painful
branches are painful with cvs anyway
as for resources for cvs see cvs home if you want to talk about svn i d suggest the svn book itself and this question

465871
actionscript	mxml
kind of but only for actionscript and you have to test it yourself.
there is a prototype of an actionscript 3 version but it is not even in beta yet and i admit that i haven t had the time to test it
i haven t found anything similar for xml let alone mxml

466397
cvs	svn

you should leave cvs
cvs is old and not very fast in terms of branching tagging branch tag creation depends linearly on number of files in a project you should think of your branching strategy first do you want to have a stable trunk feature branches developer branches unstable trunk release branches platform branches this heavily depends on your project and development philosophy if you want to use svn you really have to think of your repository layout because nearly all softwareprojects are module-based and you should find a structure in which you can easily tag all needed modules

466571
ubuntu	debian
there s a really good article at debian package a day about it
it does require kernel patching although ubuntu already has the patch applied i m not sure about any other distributions.


467183
getdate	datepart
a much cleaner way of doing this is defining a calculated column create table #t d datetime d2 as cast datepart year d as varchar 4 + - + right 0 + cast datepart month d as varchar 2 2 + - + right 0 + cast datepart day d as varchar 2 2 -- notice a lot of care need to be taken to ensure the format is comparable
zero padding insert #t values getdate create index idx on #t d2 select d2 count d2 from #t where d2 between 2008-01-01 and 2009-01-22 group by d2 -- index seek is used this way you can directly check the d2 column and an index will be used and you dont have to muck around with conversions


467432
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari

according to w3schools window.top is supported in ie since v4 firefox v1 and opera v9
i can personally vouch for it working in safari as i just tried their example code in my own browser

468012
profiling	instrumentation

my music composition software see my profiling for the link uses notes as the primary unit with properties like starting position length volume balance release duration etc.
notes are grouped into patterns which have their own starting positions and repetition properties which are grouped into tracks which have their own instrumentation or instrumentation

468379
grouplayout	miglayout
i ve switched to using miglayout and doing most of the coding by hand now
having said that netbeans overall is pretty good and perhaps i should have spent more time learning the grouplayout
if you are doing team development make sure you are all using the same tool if relying on a gui builder

469024
ant	maven
but what i have done in the past for a project where i needed to copy configuration files is use the maven antrun plugin
what i did is execute the plugin in the process-resources phase and copied my configuration files to the specified directory using the ant copy task
the assembler plugin executes in the package phase so it should pick up your configuration files if you put it in the right place

470325
client-side	server-side

no there s no way to get rid of the http headers in client-side javascript
for that you need to set up a server-side script which will then make the actual connection to the printer port

470352
daemons	systemd

an important point might be that rather than having a cron job run once every second have a always-running daemons that s automatically restarted on exit - or something like that
one reason is just as you describe it yourself if a lot of users request emails to be sent out and the queue builds up one cronjob won t have time to finnish before the ext one stats and you risk having your systemd flooded with processes

472148
freebsd	linux

if your main concern is java i suggest staying away from freebsd
getting a java development setup up and running is much easier on linux opensolaris

mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg

naudio is an open source .net audio library that can play back wav mp3 wma aac and aiff files making use of acm or media foundation codecs installed on your computer for decompression purposes
for ogg support there is an add-on nuget package you can use

473009
jar	war
you need to ensure that the cxf jar is in the web-inf lib directory of your war
so in fact sticking the cxf jar in web-inf lib isn t going to work
you will either need to stick the jar in the top-level of your ear or in some lib shared by all classloaders of oc4j

473503
super	self

it also looks like you have a bug in this method you are essentially discarding the results from super init while it may not be a problem in this instance it could cause serious problems in others
you should always structure you init methods like this if you are not going to return self from an init method for instance it is a factory or something odd like that you should remember to release self

metaphone	soundex
it s more accurate than soundex as it knows the basic rules of english pronunciation
the metaphone generated keys are of variable length
similar_text similar to levenshtein but it can return a percent value instead

473813
inline	inlining
function inlining is a compiler optimization which has no impact on the semantics
a function behaves the same whether it s inline or not
on the other hand lambda functions are purely a semantic concept

473918
tiff	png

quicktime should work but keep in mind that tiff files are usually not optimized for size and are often much larger than jpeg resp
png renderings of the same image

473974
allocator	stl
crt core os and stl guys spend a lot of time thinking about memory management
there s a good chance that your code will perform quite fine under existing allocator with no changes needed
there s certainly a better chance of that than there is of you getting a memory allocator right the first time

474081
implements	extends
they should only be used to extends class functionality
if you have access to the base class code and the functionality you re trying to implements is logically part of the inheritance heirarchy then you should put it in the abstract class
my point is just because you can doesn t mean you should

474577
implements	extends
extends number
implements
implements equals and hashcode

474768
implements	extends
i d also recommend that you have it extends the number class
i d probably look at the double class since you re probably going to want to implements many of the same methods
you should probably also implements comparable and serializable since this behavior will probably be expected

474768
comparator	comparable
you should probably also implement comparable and serializable since this behavior will probably be expected
thus you will need to implement comparator
you will also need to override equals and i cannot stress strongly enough that you also override hashcode

474834
comparator	comparable

you have a comparator function already .
i would implement the comparable interface

475526
mvp	presenter
upon receiving a event for update from model it can update the view
even you can decouple view from controller using one more subject observer-pattern between controller and view third solution use mvp pattern
model view presenter

475953
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython	cpython	ironpython
ironpython is quickly becoming one of the best in this respect though and there is a lot of traffic on planet python about it
the main thing that will encourage developers to write code that s different from what they would write in cpython is the lack of c extension modules like numpy this is a problem in jython and pypy as well
an interesting project to keep your eye on is ironclad which will let you call c extension modules from within ironpython

475953
cpython	ironpython
the advantage of ironpython et al existing is that they provide alternative implementations of the language which are sometimes useful for spotting bugs in cpython
they also provide alternative methods for deploying your python applications if for some reason you find yourself in a situation like silverlight where distributing the cpython implementation with your application is not appropriate


476026
accessor	properties

i think its a good idea to always use the accessor
then if you need any special logic when getting or setting the properties you know that everything is performing that logic

476079
accessor	properties

aside from the point made by others whether to use an accessor or a field directly may need to be informed by semantics
some times the semantics of an external consumer accessing a properties is different from the mechanical necessity of accessing its value by internal code

476331
directx	gdi
it s definately way faster than standard gdi gdi+ and is still 2d
or perhaps you could do a tricky workaround with directx - use it for drawing 2d shapes you define yourself


476412
stateless	stateful
the transition wasn t easy
but i can say learning c# for web development particularly if you don t already sort of grok oo can be daunting -- mainly because oo is so much about creating and managing state and statefulness and the web is inherently stateless
believe it or not i learned more about oo writing ajax apps with javascript and flex apps in actionscript -- building stateful clients -- than i ever did trying to force c# into my brain because ajax apps and flex apps force you to think about things in terms of state

476769
google-chrome	firefox

mozilla google-chrome urls refer to actual files located in a .jar file in some fairly well-defined places
the main browser google-chrome browser content ... itself firefox add-ons where on windows xp at least is

476921
cpython	ironpython

string concatenation + has an optimized implementation on cpython
but this may not be the case on other architectures like jython or ironpython

477317
client-side	server-side
by the far the most popular attractive part of these server-side javascript solutions is in regards to data validation
you can use the same code that you use to validate forms client-side again on the server to ensure their integrity
this comes really useful in simply being dry and not getting rules out of sync when something changes

478193
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
this can be thought of as a special case of dijkstra s algorithm in which no vertex can have its distance estimate revised
the floyd-warshall algorithm takes o v 3 time is very easy to code and is still the fastest for dense graphs those graphs where vertices are typically connected to many other vertices
but it s not the right choice for the op s task which involves very sparse graphs

478717
lisp	prolog
if you are just starting in ai there are a couple of directions
the classic ai problems - logic puzzles - are solved with a mechanical theorem prover usually written in lisp - see here for the classic text on solving logical puzzles
if you don t want to create your own you can pick up a copy of prolog it is essentially the same thing

478796
jtable	jlabel
in your case you may want to subclass a jlabel which implements tablecellrenderer and will set the contents of the label to reflect the contents of your cell object
as for editing a cell the tablecelleditor receives the object from the tablemodel when you want to edit a cell with in the jtable
the tablecelleditor will return a component which is used to edit the cell contents the object using the gettablecelleditorcomponent method

479522
cassini	iis

cassini the build in debugging webserver uses high ports when you fire an app up
either way you need to configure either wamp or iis to listen on a port other than port 80 then you can access one on and one on

480078
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

safari and google-chrome have a built in web inspector right click and select inspect element
firefox has the firebug plugin

480496
implements	extends
double dispatch is the same thing extended to work with two objects - usually the this parameter and a second parameter
you can implements this without too much difficulty using the vistor pattern
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard

480496
implements	extends
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard
some languages implements this ability right out of the box
in .net the tostring function is an example of single dispatch

481432
awt	swing
you can however catch when the jvm is terminating by adding a shutdown hook
awt s windowadapter also has a windowclosing event that you can override and hook to a window that you want to monitor
swing inherits this

481432
swt	swing
swing inherits this
i believe swt does as well
be aware that you must manually dispose of the window if you override this event

483323
superclass	subclassing
this seems to be the case in the sample code
but it is not a very good example as the concrete superclass already implements a default functionality for foo
when there is an abstract subclassing that redefines it to be purely virtual it is a sign for me that the class hierarchy is flawed because a subclassing and the callers of foo usually should be able to fall back to the default implementation

483441
i2c	spi
if you have more than 3 spi devices consider using an hc138 as a decoder to produce the individual device cs lines from a set of address bits and a master chip select line from the microprocessor
since only one cs line is supposed to be low at a time i2c is a pain
its main advantage is that you can do everything in 2 wires + power and ground shared among a bunch of peripherals

483708
octal	hex

my preferred way is quoting from man perlfunc oct expr oct interprets expr as an octal string and returns the corresponding value
if expr happens to start off with 0x interprets it as a hex string

483842
daemons	systemd
i don t remember the exact systemd calls for dropping permissions. you ll have to do this anyway if you want to bind to tcp port 80 or any port below 1024
create a subdirectory like var log mydaemon having the daemons s user ownership as wisetechi said
files under var log aren t automatically rotated

484308
expression-blend	silverlight
there was a silverlight grid released back in october
there are some links and such to get it to show up in expression-blend too
one has to assume it will also be included in the new ides as well

484501
client-side	server-side
since php is server-side scripting it has to be processed before a page is loaded
javascript is a language which works on client-side and thus can not activate the re-processing of php code


484745
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
mysql is easy to set up fast for oltp and generally takes the approach of doing few things and doing them well
postgresql is kind of the opposite -- it s a database researcher s favorite playground which means it has a dozen different join strategies storage engines advanced optional packages and all kinds of stuff
it s slower than mysql when doing things mysql does well and blows it out of the water when doing things mysql just doesn t know how to do see above with hash joins

484840
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
for example if the only reason your method could throw a classnotfoundexception is because a configuration file is missing you could rethrow a missingresourceexception which is an unchecked-exception but gives more information about why you are throwing it
other good runtimeexception s to use if they describe the problem you are rethrowing are illegalstateexception typenotpresentexception and unsupportedoperationexception
also note that it is always a good idea for your threads to catch runtimeexception and at a minimum log it

486094
erlang	lisp	erlang	lisp
this is referred to as homoiconicity and it usually only true for languages that are lisp dialects or something close to it
haskell erlang and scala are not homoiconic clojure is
clojure s fundamental differentiators are it has a software transactional memory system which makes shared state concurrent programming easier it is a lisp unlike haskell or erlang therefore all code is data which allows you to make what look likes changes to the language itself at runtime through the macro system it runs on the jvm which means you have direct access to all java libraries clojure data structures implement java interfaces such as collection list map runnable and callable where appropriate

487489
multiplying	multiplication
in order to multiplying matrix a with matrix b you need to multiplying the numbers in each row if matrix a with each column in matrix b
this means that if you multiplying an a x b matrix with a c x d matrix b and c must be equal and the resulting matrix is a x d as you can see with matrixes a x b differs from b x a
matrix scalar multiplication you can multiplying a matrix with a scalar

487489
division	multiplication
matrix scalar multiplication you can multiply a matrix with a scalar
in that case each cell is multiplied with that number inverting a matrix matrix division is not possible but you can create an inversion of a matrix such that a x a-inv is a matrix with all zero s except for that main diagonal inverting a matrix can only be done with square matrices and it is a complex job that does not neccesary have a result
start with matrix a we add 3 extra columns and fill them with the unit matrix now we start with the first column

488104
move	drag
if on the other hand dragging one of the items elsewhere causes them both to move it s easy to drag the item s back to where they came from
yes but just as with the files move them first and make sure the subdirectories you d like to keep are unaffected before deleting them


488668
vmware	virtualbox

vmware requires you to submit your contact information to download vmware server
sun s virtualbox gets the job done and you can just download the application without registration or hassles

488978
mockito	jmock
- powermockito extends both easymock and mockito with the ability to mock static methods final and even private methods
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work
we are planning to add jmock support as well

489056
rss	feed
this should safely remove the headers footers sidebars widgets ads though may leave embedded objects etc
it should also be fairly easy tm to segment the page into article metadata text comments etc etc and put it into fairly sensible rss atom item
this would be the basis of taking an rss feed non-full text and turning it into a full text one by following the permalinks given in the official rss

489070
actionscript	mxml
there s good general info in the livedocs here although you can create custom components in mxml and in actionscript i would recommend implementing them in actionscript
in short this is what you need to do when you create a custom component in actionscript you have to override the methods of the uicomponent class
you implement the basic component structure the constructor and the createchildren commitproperties measure layoutchrome and updatedisplaylist methods

489290
filesystems	ntfs
app that would run chkntfs and then set the error level based on the result write a c c++ vb etc
app that would use win32 apis to determine the filesystems write a plug-in for nsis that would use win32 apis to determine the filesystems edit borzio updated his before i finished mine you might need to add something i found on the winamp forums execwait with file redirection without the it was not working on my system to generate a redirected file
i ve tested the above and it does work 0 for ntfs and 1 for non ntfs

489733
inherited	properties
.net offers you all you need to load an assembly and query all interfaces types methods and properties in the system.reflection namespace
this way you don t have to worry about parsing the source code yourself using sed awk perl which is not trivial since you need to resolve namespaces and inherited
note what you would not get directly using reflection are assembly dependencies to dynamically loaded assemblies loaded though assembly.load

489910
helpers	actioncontroller

just change the first line as follows include actionview helpers that will make it works
update for rails 3 use actioncontroller base.helpers.sanitize str credit goes to lornc s answer

490444
implements	extends

the typical behavior is to subclass an existing component mainly because so much of the work of implements the functionality of so many of the most typical kinds of components is already done for you -- you just have to know which component most resembles the one you want to create
a challenge in its own right given how many there are. if you like though you can create a pretty bare-bones uicomponent from scratch simply by extends uicomponent which ll give you all the baseline stuff or i suppose if you re really going for minimalism and you re up for a challenge you can just implement iuicomponent and define each interface method manually

491583
mouse	keyboard

thw windows ce os itself doesn t support mouse hooks at all
it supports keyboard hooks unofficially but it s been there since 1.0

491583
mouse	keyboard
it supports keyboard hooks unofficially but it s been there since 1.0
the only way to get all mouse events is to write a custom touchpanel driver and that is no small feat especially when you have no information about the hardware
maybe if you give us a better idea why you need this ability we can offer alternatives

493199
bazaar	svn

a very important missing thing in bazaar is cp
you cannot have multiple files sharing the same history as you have in svn see for example here and here

493868
queue	fifo
the only reason to use the container adaptor queue instead of the container deque is to make it clear that you are performing only queue operations and no other operations
from the sgi page on queue so when using a queue all you can do is push pop elements
clearing the queue can be seen as a violation of the fifo concept

493868
queue	fifo
clearing the queue can be seen as a violation of the fifo concept
consequently if you need to clear your queue maybe it s not really a queue and you should better use a deque
however this conception of things is a little narrow-minded and i think clearing the queue as you do is fair enough

493983
profiling	instrumentation
i tried codeanalyst once but as far as i could see it was doing polling rather than instrumentation and hence gave fairly crude results
haven t found any free profiling for windows that i liked better than that


494379
vbscript	vba
i d recommend using a c-friendly format csvs instead of xls or using the new xml formats take your pick on xml and zip libraries
still for a quick fix you could export to quoted csv and then import using vbscript
something like this although i d try to get it to work in vba first

495136
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing actually hides the variable var
when you cast to automobile you re getting the superclass version of the var variable
however the tostring method is still looking at the instance s version of the var variable

495539
accessor	properties

of course that means access to x y z r g b needs to be by accessor forwarding to the appropriate rather than direct to the member
you d need c# s properties for that

495951
udp	tcp
it looks like you can enable tcp keepalive in windows sockets by setting sio_keepalive_vals using the wsaioctl function
if you re using udp sockets over ip you ll need to build your own heartbeat into your protocol


497148
case-sensitive	case-insensitive

the database default collation determines whether objects within the database are treated in a case-sensitive way in queries - this applies to all object name tables columns etc
if your application code comes from a case-insensitive collation database it may not run on a case-sensitive collation database if a object is misreferenced you would get a message when you attempted to run the statement or create the stored procedure or in a stored-proc architecture you would catch all these pretty quickly unless you had a significant amount of dynamic sql

497332
haskell	sml

haskell is extreme lazy pure has active users lots of documentation and makes runnable applications
sml is less extreme strict impure has active users formal specification many implementations sml nj mlton moscow ml etc.

497933
quicksort	mergesort
you can see both of these behaviors in your example implementations
as a result for relatively small datasets quicksort is more likely to get cache hits and therefore just tends to run faster on most hardware
mergesort is still a pretty good solution for large data sets or other data structures like linked lists as your experiments confirm

498135
filesystems	ntfs
since you mention nesting directories also keep in mind that there are limits to the length of fully qualified with drive designator and path filenames see wikipedia filename entry
this will vary with the operating system filesystems see wikipedia comparison on filesystems entry
for windows ntfs it is supposed to be 255 however i have encountered problems with commands and api functions with fully qualified filenames at about 120 characters

498271
debian	linux	debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
if you really want to run a server on that machine you have though thus saving 20 month i would recommend installing some form of linux
i would suggest debian or ubuntu
if you want to learn a bit more about some linux fundamentals like building a kernel and tweaking .conf files could be useful at some point try a distribution like gentoo

499390
decimal	ieee
they use the same ieee binary representation so there is no possible data loss when translating to and from the database format
the max precision of the .net decimal is 28 so there is no use defining an oracle number with a higher precision


499502
jsf	wicket	struts	wicket
for example if you use wicket java files and webpages co-exist in the same directory while in most other frameworks pages .jsp files or whatever is your presentation engine and code-behind stuff java files are completely separate
so read the documentation that comes with your framework spring mvc struts jsf e.t.c
another good proposal is to use maven archetypes to generate a skeleton for your specific framework
