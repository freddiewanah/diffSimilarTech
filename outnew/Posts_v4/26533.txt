extjs	gxt
for more information on gwt extjs for more information on extjs gwt gxt
i m working on a project right now that uses extjs gwt gxt not to be confused with gwt extjs

extjs	gxt
i m working on a project right now that uses extjs gwt gxt not to be confused with gwt extjs
there is a difference extjs gwt is the one that is actually produced by the company that wrote extjs the javascript library

google-chrome	safari
because google-chrome uses the webkit to render html you can be assured if it works in safari it ll work under google-chrome however it s rendering engine isn t up to scratch quite yet
i think writing applications that take advantage of it is similar to writing iphone applications remember google-chrome is expected to be adopted by android to make it similar to iphone

104095
cassini	iis
cassini is ment to be a light waight test webserver
the idea is that a developer does not need to have iis installed and configured to test his application

104264
cassini	iis
all the previous responses are great answers - here s one gottcha with cassini that might require iis on the destkop
cassini runs in the context of the developer not as the iis user iusr_ iwam or in winxp x64 the w3wp process

104530
allocator	stl
stl containers with default allocator don t do anything fancy they all end up allocator via standard new delete operators somehow
in stl map s case it will throw exception and will otherwise behave as if it was not called

104855
move	drag
if that is not an option there are a couple of other methods at your disposal if you re using flex you can have other objects move along with the map by listening to moveevent .move events on it and moving themselves accordingly you can implement the drag functionality yourself so that you ll have more control over it see below
here s an example that implements drag functionality for an object that will also move a bunch of sibling objects along with it

106553
queue	fifo
if you were to use a fifo queue for the semaphore the kernel would have to traverse the queue of tasks waiting for the mutex to find the one with the highest priority
this operation is not deterministic as the time to traverse the queue changes as the number of tasks queued changes

svg	vml
w3schools has a good reference for learning using svg
vml is microsoft s answer to svg and surprise is natively supported by ie although svg is not

107131
svg	vml
vml is microsoft s answer to svg and surprise is natively supported by ie although svg is not
msdn has the best reference for vml

108451
udp	tcp
if you need the reliable in-order delivery of tcp and also the fast response of udp and don t need to worry about congestion from sending large streams of data you can disable nagle s algorithm
as others have pointed out your question is very general and whether or not something is faster than tcp depends a lot on the type of application

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
this is more true of cairngorm than puremvc but both are pretty bad
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t
cairngorm is full of anti-patterns like heavy use of global variables puremvc hides the worst parts of itself

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
cairngorm is full of anti-patterns like heavy use of global variables puremvc hides the worst parts of itself
puremvc is anti-flex cairngorm just doesn t use many of the good parts of flex

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
puremvc is anti-flex cairngorm just doesn t use many of the good parts of flex
by this i mean that puremvc reinvents many things that flex already have because it wants to be platform agnostic and because of its architecture specifically the mediators it makes it harder to use bindings to their full power

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
in short cairngorm is the visualbasic of flex it works but will teach you a lot of bad habits
puremvc isn t so bad it just isn t a very good fit for writing flex applications

110037
jxtable	jtable
look into jxtable
jxtable is an extension of jtable that supports multi-column sorting as well as other functions that jtable doesn t provide

110453
vmware	bootcamp
i strongly recommend vmware over parallels as vmware supports 2 virtual cpu s i think it s up to 4 virtual cpu s in v2
it s a lot easier to have a really large virtual disk which is not using it all where as bootcamp will take the space

110492
client-side	server-side
one rule of thumb you should follow is not to trust client-side javascript to do this for you since it s easy to go around it
always do it server-side first

112266
gif	png
i wanted to read the type version height and width of a gif image but couldn t find anything useful online
fortunately in case of gif all the required information was in the first 10 bytes type bytes 0-2 version bytes 3-5 height bytes 6-7 width bytes 8-9 png are slightly more complex width and height are 4-bytes each width bytes 16-19 height bytes 20-23 as mentioned above wotsit is a good site for detailed specs on image and data formats though the png specs at pnglib are much more detailed

113397
client-side	server-side
in addition to the above i would like to point out that client-side validation html code javascript etc. is never enough
also check the length server-side or just don t check at all if it s not so important that people can be allowed to get around it then it s not important enough to really warrant any steps to prevent that either

113912
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
here s how to construct an update statement to perform a case-sensitive search replace by specifying the collation mode to use this will match and replace thecontent but not thecontent or thecontent
determine whether the default collation is case-sensitive like this select charindex result if the result is 0 you are in a case-sensitive collation mode a result of 0 indicates you are in a case-sensitive collation mode 8 indicates it is case-insensitive

114000
inline	inlining
functions called using virtual dispatch are not inline there is one kind of penalty for virtual functions which is easy to forget about virtual calls are not inline in a common situation where the type of the object is not know compile time
if your function is small and suitable for inlining this penalty may be very significant as you are not only adding a call overhead but the compiler is also limited in how it can optimize the calling function it has to assume the virtual function may have changed some registers or memory locations it cannot propagate constant values between the caller and the callee

115825
xfce	kde	xfce	gnome
xfce ratpoison fluxbox awesome -1 cannot handle minimize to tray xmonad dwm fvwm codebase for another wms icewm englightenment wmii openbox pekwm
the window managers listed below all subscribe to the lightweight and fast approach. they are faster than fully fledged window managers like kde or gnome and trim down on most visual distractions

115838
gif	png
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

115838
gif	png
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry
it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png that may indeed be due to the encoding tool you use

116302
komodo	notepad++
i d recommend komodo 4.4 though i used the trial version since it was awesome
better than notepad++ but not free.

116586
google-chrome	safari
not that any browser in the world uses this yet not even google-chrome but if all you re worried about is standards then that s your best bet - it passes acid3 something no browser on the market can do yet
safari using the latest webkit nightly build

116730
firefox	safari
tweak it to look right in at least firefox and ie and now you ve covered 90 + of the people that will be using your website
don t get me wrong here - i m not trying to dismiss the users of opera safari or any other browser

116741
inline	inlining
you have inline everything in cppclass.cpp not good header-inlining should be the exception and then you declare your class in main.cpp again which is a double declaration in c++
the inlining in the class body leads to code reduplication everytime you use a method this only sounds insane

117834
firefox	safari
firefox apparently still does not
safari 1.3+ opera 9.2+ konquerer and ie8 all support it at least to some degree

118680
cpython	ironpython
if beautifulsoup doesn t work on ironpython it s because ironpython doesn t implement the whole python language the same way cpython does
beautifulsoup is pure-python no c-extensions so the only problem is the compatibility of ironpython with cpython in terms of python source code.there shouldn t be one but if there is the error will be obvious no module named ... no method named ... etc.

jsf	wicket	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket	wicket	seam
after many painful experiences with struts tapestry 3 4 jsf seam gwt i will stick with wicket for now
wicket bench for eclipse is handy but not 100 complete still useful though

124248
rsa	aes
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation
so in addition to storing and managing keys properly you have to be extremely careful with the way you format your rsa plaintext blocks or you end up with vulnerabilities

126773
lisp	scheme
first of all lisp depending on the meaning intended by the speaker isn t really a language at all but a language family
there are a couple of more or less well-known and widespread members of this family scheme common lisp emacs-lisp and autolisp are the traditional ones

126773
lisp	scheme
however as far as i can tell schemers are actually a minority in the lisp world at least when considering practical usage of lisp as a programming tool as opposed to a research or study subject
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming

126773
lisp	scheme
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming
in fact common lisp features the most powerful class-based object system that i know of incorporating stuff like aspect-oriented programming out of the box

127198
boost	stl
if not you may want to look into using boost s iterator facades and adaptors where you can define your own iterators or adapt other objects into iterators
i want to think there should be a way to do this through straight stl similar to what you are trying to do

127892
swt	swing
this akin to asking the difference between tk and win32 or swing vs .net forms not to say that swt is .net
there are a lot of discussions out there discussing swt vs swing--i don t know enough about swt to summarize the differences

128390
gif	png
this link gives an example and contains many more links with further explanation gif images are not subject to this problem
be careful of color shifts when using png

131883
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
something on http url scheme from rfc 2616 3.2.3 uri comparison when comparing two uris to decide if they match or not a client should use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire uris with these exceptions - a port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default port for that uri-reference
- comparisons of host names must be case-insensitive

133160
firefox	safari
afaik there is no difference on the part of browsers as both firefox and ie will incorrectly cache the response from a url with a querystring in the same way they cache the response from a url without a querystring
in the case of safari it respects the spec and doesn t cache urls with querystrings

134152
jboss	weblogic
i m not sure why jboss has it but i don t expect other servers have something similar
weblogic afaik may be very wrong only jdbc drivers can be used with lro and it s a purely administrative task

134203
interpolation	splines
the best summary sentence is catmull-rom splines have c1 continuity local control and interpolation but do not lie within the convex hull of their control points
said another way if the points indicate a sharp bend to the right the splines will bank left before turning to the right there s an example picture in that document

135008
serializable	deserialization
suddenly i couldn t read any of the previously serializable information
you might be better off writing clunky per property columns in a table and composing and decomposing the object in this manner instead to avoid this issue with object versions and deserialization

138585
cpython	pypy
use cpython which is a python- like language that is compiled into a python c extension use pypy which has a translator from rpython a restricted subset of python that does not support some of the most dynamic features of python to c or llvm
pypy is still highly experimental not all extensions will be present after that you can use one of the existing packages freeze py2exe pyinstaller to put everything into one binary

140719
boost	stl
boost thread is great i m not sure whether you can say its part of the language though
it depends if you consider the crt stl boost to be part of c++ or an optional add-on library

140921
daemons	systemd
the rng-tools package includes a daemons which will feed hardware generated entropy into dev random
if a hrng is not available on your systemd and you are willing to sacrifice entropy strength for performance you will want to seed a good prng with data from dev random and let the prng do the bulk of the work

141225
google-chrome	firefox
since the bookmarklet is positioned outside of any page this area is generally called the browser google-chrome - which is confusing since there s now a browser with that name it s not possible to detect javascript-related events there
that being said if you created this as a firefox extension then you would have access to event information javascript and keyboard modifiers

143163
bazaar	svn
depending on your ide and if you can change scm you might want to have a look at other fully distributed scms think mercurial bazaar git ... which support distributed development out of the box
it is possible but not necessarily simple the problem you are trying to solve is dangerously close to setting up a distributed development environment which is not exactly what svn is designed for

143846
bmp	ppm
if you want antialiasing make sure to use a format that supports transparency bmp and tga do
ppm does not

144178
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
here s a bit of info i scrounged up on the main vms ruby mri ruby 1.9 yarv jruby xruby rubinius and ironruby there was a performance benchmark last year that compared the major vms but with how quickly vm development has been it probably is not as relevant today
ruby 1.9 was generally the fastest and still has the edge over jruby for now i believe

144723
gtk	cairo
mono does not use qt kde or gtk gnome widgets because they don t match up with the winforms api
mono implements winforms on top of their system.drawing implementation which in turn uses cairo

145424
textmate	gedit
i searched for textmate e-text editor like text editor for linux
i found out gedit is not a bad one

145952
inline	inlining
which means that should you change the code of the inline function you would need to recompile all the code using it to be sure it will be updated for the same reason i avoid default values for function parameters when used in a header it makes your header file larger and thus will dilute interesting informations like the list of a class methods with code the user don t care about this is the reason that i declare inline functions inside a class but will define it in an header after the class body and never inside the class body
inlining magic the compiler may or may not inline the functions you marked as inline

145952
inline	inlining
inlining magic the compiler may or may not inline the functions you marked as inline
it may also decide to inline functions not marked as inline at compilation or linking time

146209
factors	mean
factors out common styles
not styles that just happen to be the same styles that are intended to be the same - where changing the style for one selector will likely mean you ll want to change the other as well

147337
innodb	myisam
the difference really only matters for myisam other storage engines do not care about the difference. edit many users commented that innodb does care link 1 by steampowered link 2 by kaan
with myisam with fixed width rows there are a few advantages no row fragmentation it is possible with variable width rows to get single rows split into multiple sections across the data file

147392
vim	emacs
i have no doubt that anything you can get done in emacs you can also get done in vim just not standard
try emacs

147589
boost	allocator
if you use something like boost s scoped_ptr template your class could look more like and you would have no memory leaks and the default dtor would also clean up the dynamic memory allocator
to sum up and hopefully this also answers the question about the statement when an exception is thrown inside a constructor there are several things that you should take note of in terms of properly handling resource allocator that may have occured in the aborted construction of the object the destructor for the object being constructed will not be called

149865
irrlicht	ogre3d
ogre and irrlicht both are said to have a cleaner design than crystalspace so i wouldn t worry to much about problems with the latter
ogre3d is typically named together with crystalspace and irrlicht

150283
lisp	scheme
so for learning scheme lisp javascript isn t a bad start
note though that functional languages like lisp are quite different from pure functional languages such as haskell

151912
postgresql	mysql
this is the sequence solution for postgresql you d have to do it in a stored procedure or on your application code of course
for mysql the transaction is important not to trip on your own feet in case you re using the same connection for more than one insert

151938
inline	inlining
there are several situations where the compiler is not able to determine categorically whether it is appropriate or beneficial to inline a function
inlining may involve trade-off s that the compiler is unwilling to make but you are e.g code bloat

154416
spaces	delimiter
this is microsoft sql server nonstandard syntax for delimiter identifiers. sql supports delimiter for identifiers to allow table names column names or other metadata objects to contain the following sql reserved words order words containing spaces order qty words containing punctuation order-qty words containing international characters column names that are case-sensitive order vs
order microsoft sql server uses the square brackets but this is not the syntax standard sql uses for delimiter identifiers

154849
vsts	tfs
this is especially important for servicing purposes - making sure that when a service pack for vsts is applied to the client machine then the tfs api s get upgraded as well
there are no re-distribution rights to the tfs api s therefore they should not be shipped with your application

154976
g++	gcc
also use the correct gcc frontend executable g++ will treat .c files like c++ files unless you explicitly tell it not too
so if you are compiling real c then use gcc not g++

154976
g++	gcc
so if you are compiling real c then use gcc not g++
gcc -pedantic -wall -werror .c g++ -pedantic -wall -werror .cpp to help with your specific problem it may be nice to see line 43

157025
inline	inlining
although the greatest loss is that a virtual function when called polymorphically cannot be inline
and inlining will in a lot of situations represent some real gain in performance

157134
factors	mean
physical distance whilst a factors does not always mean that latency automatically goes up
another factors is if is direct peering agreements with transit carriers based in other countries

157785
vbscript	vba
the on error goto label syntax is supported by visual basic and visual basic for applications vba but vbscript doesn t support this language feature so you have to use on error resume next as described above
vbscript has no notion of throwing or catching exceptions but the runtime provides a global err object that contains the results of the last operation performed

159131
udp	tcp
if the messages you are sending need to be reliable udp is probably not a good basis
tcp tries very hard to prevent congestion in the network

159819
nginx	lighttpd
possible problems nginx is buggy
at least lighttpd has horrible fastcgi bugs i wouldn t wonder if nginx has some too django is dying with a traceback in an internal system that is not properly catched and closes the fastcgi server which you can t see from the client

159999
cvs	svn
remember that active development of cvs stopped a while ago so there are probably no tools for you from the cvs developers
and since one of the main goals of svn was to be a better cvs those developers will probably not have expected anyone to move backwards either

161568
bazaar	svn
although i tested not thouroughly on windows as i no longer use this system i m quite confident that all the major vcs svn git mercurial bazaar have proper windows-implementation now
this advantage for svn is gone

163483
prepare	execute
you should be able to prepare a sql query to validate the syntax and get result set metadata
preparing a query should not execute it

167434
allocator	stl
i d doubt that is possible except using custom allocator
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost

167681
trac	bugzilla
of course trac doesn t have support for blocking blockedby tickets out of the box so if you want to import this data too you ll have to use the masterticketsplugin and then modify the script yourself which is what we did when we migrated
for bugzilla trac has a script bugzilla2trac.py that will automate the process of importing bugzilla bugs to trac tickets for you

167805
vmware	virtualbox
vmware virtual server is not really designed for use as a desktop and you will get very tired of it with any prolonged use
sun s virtualbox is another option competing with virtual pc

168366
onclick	onsubmit
if i attach an onclick handler to the submit button i can see that the button is being clicked - but if i attach an onsubmit handler to the form i get nothing
if i make the button onclick handler submit the form through javascript it works fine - it s just the direct submission that s not working

168539
vb.net	vb6
you may also like to take a look at these links this has an example of how to do what you want zipping using windows built-in zip capabilities from vb.net it shouldn t be much different from vba or vb6 transparent zip with dll call this one has a sample application on vb6 using windows built-in capabilities to zip in zip rather than gzip format of course using windows xp compressed folder shell extension to work with .zip files found both thru googling you should be able to find more better examples
vba which is really a dialect of vb6 is slow for these kind of applications

169614
strcpy	strncpy
some safer alternatives to strcpy strcat that you might want to look into you may need to track down implementations for some of these - they re not all standard strncpy - includes the target buffer size to avoid overruns
has the drawback of not always terminating the result string strncat strlcpy - similar to strncpy but intended to be simpler to use and more robust strlcat strcpy_s - microsoft variants of these functions strncat_s and the api you should strive to use if you can use c++ the std string class

172177
apache	lighttpd
the idea is of splitting your site into static content css js images etc and dynamic code that flows through apache
i m not saying you can t do a lot with lighttpd on its own

172750
expressionengine	joomla
which is kinda cool also you can try expressionengine whch also have some nice features for multi-domain users with one setup. anyhow the best solution is to build a custom solution for this but of course you won t be only a hosting company anymore d
no joomla is huge and heavy is not a reliable solution

172929
g++	gcc
both are capable of linking against the c++ standard library but only g++ does this by default
so if you have a program written in c++ that doesn t happen to need to link against the standard library gcc will happen to do the right thing

173007
g++	gcc
g++ will compile .c .cpp files but they will all be treated as c++ files
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this

173007
g++	gcc
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this
gcc compiling c files has fewer predefined macros

173090
floating-point	fractions
there s no significance to the long numbers you posted -- they re an artifact of the underlying floating-point implementation filtered through god-knows how many intermediate layers
bit-shifting by a fractions number of bytes is insane and i m surprised it doesn t raise an exception -- but that s javascript always willing to redefine insane

174521
allocator	stl
even if you do not share stl objects across threads many implementations use non-thread safe constructs like ++ for reference counting instead of an interlocked increment style or having non-thread-safe allocator
in each of these cases i still opted to use stl and fix the problems there are enough hooks to get what you want

174728
boost	stl
you may also choose not to use stl for a particular case because more applicable containers exist that are not in the current standard such as boost array or boost unordered_map
projects with strict memory requirements such as for embedded systems may not be suited for the stl as it can be difficult to control and manage what s taken from and returned to the heap

176071
opera	firefox	firefox	safari
here s my testing bugfixing priority list absolutely essential to fully support firefox 3 and ie7 highly recommended to fully support opera and safari no missing functionality slightly degraded interfaces are acceptable but only if absolutely necessary interface degradation is acceptable with ie6 and firefox 2 as long as it is still usable i consider these as end of life browsers and frankly rarely worth the effort also here are older versions of opera and safari but i rarely see significant problems with these
if the interface does not rely heavily on javascript then it must degrade gracefully enough to be usable in text based and mobile browsers such as opera mobile links lynx iphone etc this includes any necessary optimisations for the screen size informational non-application sites must be at least tested with a screenreader i will put no significant effort into supporting firefox 1 and ie5.5 or below

176071
opera	google-chrome
if the interface does not rely heavily on javascript then it must degrade gracefully enough to be usable in text based and mobile browsers such as opera mobile links lynx iphone etc this includes any necessary optimisations for the screen size informational non-application sites must be at least tested with a screenreader i will put no significant effort into supporting firefox 1 and ie5.5 or below
new functionality must be tested and at least working with upcoming browsers such as ie8 and google-chrome

176144
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
my support list in order of priority currently looks like this unless a client expresses a need to expand it safari 3 firefox 2 firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 beta public-facing functionality works looks correct in ie 6 google-chrome the reason i take this approach is that first it s best to work in a standards-compliant browser before tweaking to broken engines
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons

176144
opera	safari	opera	firefox
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

176285
client-side	server-side
depending on the requirements of your project you may or may not want to implement client-side validation
however server-side validation should always be implemented

176501
udp	tcp
if the data that you re sending cannot tolerate dropped packets and you re trying to scale to high utilisation of your network then perhaps udp is not the best protocol to use
implementing a series of tcp proxies where each node retransmits unicast to all other connected nodes - similar to your flooding idea would be a more reliable mechanism

176700
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the contenteditable property is what you want -- it s supported by ie safari and by google-chrome as a byproduct and i think firefox 3 alas not ffx2
and hey it s also part of html5 d firefox 2 supports designmode but that is restricted to individual frames whereas the contenteditable property applies applies to individual elements so you can have your editable content play more nicely with your page d edit olliej removed example as contenteditable attribute doesn t get past so s output filters despite working in the preview edit olliej i ve banged up a very simple demo to illustrate how it behaves edit olliej so yes the contenteditable attribute in the linked demo works fine in ie firefox and safari

179782
awt	swing
if it s a gui app switch from swing to awt or maybe eclipse s toolkit it s supposed to be pretty quick
this is more important on older vms i ve been working embedded for a while and we are actually in a 1.0.x vm swing isn t even available i know this isn t specific to java exactly but not allocating objects--this includes string concatenation in a loop outside a loop it s pretty acceptable

180906
dictionary	map
it s not identical but vbscript has a dictionary object which behaves like java s map or hashtable
you can use this almost like a hashset by just looking up the item as a key in the dictionary and finding if there is any value there

181118
client-side	server-side
if you re looking for a client-side click event - just type it into your server control markup asp.net will emit additional attributes in the html markup that generates
your question doesn t specify if you mean to raise the click event on the server vb or c# or the client javascript. if you re looking for a server-side event you should use a link button with css that makes the link appear as a label

181245
bash	zsh
it serves as a good warning to those of us that don t use bash as our shell because we we ll forget that a feature that s in our day-to-day shell isn t going to be available when this code is run at the appointed time
the use of there is perfectly valid zsh but not sbin sh

181372
matlab	simulink
for further comparison with python i can say that matlab provides a full package for you to do your work without the need of looking around for external libraries and implementing extra functions
one last point about matlab which i see is not mentioned in the answers here is that it has a very powerful visual modeling simulation environment called simulink

181372
matlab	simulink
one last point about matlab which i see is not mentioned in the answers here is that it has a very powerful visual modeling simulation environment called simulink
it s easier to design and simulate larger systems with simulink

firefox	safari
for me both the bbc sites you link to get the proper characters in the window title bar using firefox or ie on windows
i suspect you don t have the right fonts installed though i m not sure entirely what fonts it is that you would be missing to cause this problem particularly not if safari works

184540
realloc	malloc
the realloc function might be able to extend the size of a chunk of memory for you more efficiently
it is worth mentioning that you cannot mix new free and malloc delete

185631
apache	lighttpd
i probably could come up with a nightmare configuration for apache that would make it actually slower serving static files than proxying those requests to a backend lighttpd but it would involve enabling expensive features like .htaccess in apache that are disabled in lighttpd so it wouldn t really be fair
running lighttpd behind apache to serve static files certainly seems braindead to me

186645
perforce	svn
i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it
on the perforce website they have a paper comparing the two p4 vs svn obviously given the source you have to realise that it stresses the advantages of perforce over svn but it is still a useful read

189162
inline	inlining
declaring it inline makes it a candidate for inlining it does not mean a lot nowadays in c++ as the compiler will inline or not sometimes ignoring the fact the keyword inline is present or absent a function declaration 8.3.5 9.3 11.3 with an inline specifier declares an inline-functions
the inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the point of call is to be preferred to the usual function call mechanism

190745
factors	mean
applications differ in how they scale depending on a large number of variables including types of problem solving approach to solution and other factors
100 concurrent users consuming 10 cpu does not mean 500 concurrent at 50 it could be 20 or it could be 100

191706
punctuation	words
you could even be creative about introducing ellipses if the first non-selected term doesn t end in punctuation etc
i think instead of trying to find sentences i d think about the amount of context around the search term i would need in words

193248
mvp	presenter
now it s up to you to determine whether you think this is worth the time but it is expected in almost any real software that you will have some kind of separation of these components whether it s mvp or something more enterprisey like n-tier
i m in agreement with chills42--the goal of mvp is not to make the presenter so generic that it could be used with any ui technology

195398
postgresql	mysql
but if you do a lot of heavy updates to a table as often as other threads have to read then the default locking in mysql is not the best and postgresql can be a better choice performance-wise
iow postgresql scales better regarding to db writes

195398
postgresql	mysql
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195398
postgresql	mysql
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
postgresql does comply better with standards so it can be easier to replace later

196328
cruisecontrol	teamcity
besides cruisecontrol documentation its wiki page also has some useful information as well
i do not have a direct experience with teamcity

196705
django	web2py
the django orm does not do migrations natively see south web2py does
the django orm does not allow partial sums count field and group by web2py does

196705
django	web2py
the django orm does not allow partial sums count field and group by web2py does
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and web2py has a configuration file at the app not at the project level like them

196705
django	web2py
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and web2py has a configuration file at the app not at the project level like them
webp2y logs all tracebacks server side for the administrator django and pylons do not

196705
django	web2py
webp2y logs all tracebacks server side for the administrator django and pylons do not
web2py programs often run on gae unmodified

196705
django	web2py
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails
you will also notice that web2py is hosted on both google code and launchpad and there are not open tickets

196798
django	web2py
web2py is 265kbytes of source code and 1.2mb all inclusive compare with 4.6mb of django
yet web2py will do everything you need manage session cookies request response cache internationalization errors tickets database abstraction for gae sqlite mssql mysql postgres oracle firebird etc. it does not need installation - just unzip and click on it - and you can do development in your browser

196933
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google-chrome
it apparently doesn t work this way in safari 3

198607
xna	slimdx
xna provides several math constants including 3d specialists like pi 2 etc. and some advanced math functions with float precision though not the trigonometric functions
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big

199038
dns	spf
if that is not the case then all you need is a simple mta like postfix as long as all the necessary dns records listed above are configured properly you should have no trouble sending emails
to my experience when email providers check for spams they check 5 main things other than content when i say domain i m referring to the domain of the sender s email address. a record ip of the domain name exists mx records of the domain name exist ptr record reverse lookup of the sender s ip address exists sometimes i think it is also checked to see if the ptr record has the same a record as the original domain spf record of that domain matches the ip number this is a list of ip numbers allowed to send emails of that domain

199222
awt	swing
awt is thread-safe is theory but not in practice - also restrict usage to the edt
it does look like mixing lightweight usually swing and heavyweight awt components together

199741
bash	tcsh
it s a bit more consistent than bash because it does not try to support any csh constructs
tcsh in my experience is least compatible with other shells and i avoid it

199867
bash	zsh
it can do everything bash can do but more easily and more elegantly
it also has the nice property of having extremely bash-like keystrokes so if you re on a system without zsh you ll be able to make do even if it wouldn t feel as nice

200235
ubuntu	linux
i tried the first alpha version current is 3 of the flex builder under ubuntu and it was just okay but not useable for productive just alpha flashdevelop works only under windows maybe with wine.
and in my opinion it s not a good ide fdt is on eye level with the flex builder but also not free and i don t know if it runs innately on linux

202137
daemons	systemd
admittedly this syncing does not happen until after the daemons starts so keeping your hardware clock in sync also helps between the power up and the point the time daemons syncs against the time server
i would also like to point out the hardware clock is only accurate to a point i have seen systemd that will loose gain a couple of seconds a day

202187
bazaar	git
i know with bazaar the repository is simply a hidden folder added to the directory
this might not be a viable option but perhaps you could use a distributed system like bazaar git or mercurial

203012
kde	gnome
and i know there s qt and other managers like kde etc
i noticed the same thing so it probably isn t gtk or gnome alone you basically just answered your own question - mac os x has one desktop environment centered around cocoa which has a lot of very good programmers and designers spending much time designing discussing and implementing it

204203
3des	aes	rsa	aes
windows xp rsa with rc4 128 md5 rsa with rc4 128 sha rsa with 3des cbc sha ..
you can also modify the list of cipher suites by configuring the ssl cipher suite order group policy settings using the group policy object snap-in in microsoft management console windows vista but the issue is that windows xp doesn t include aes in the list of ciphers available for sslstream

205884
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome etc now appears to support onerror
original post as far as i know webkit safari does not support the onerror event

206153
queue	fifo
if you want to use queue you need to be able to determine order before the message goes in the queue not after it goes in
queue are for fifo order not random access order

206153
queue	fifo
queue are for fifo order not random access order
even though you are saying that you want fifo order you want fifo order with respect to a random set of variables which is essentially random order

206904
dreamweaver	aptana
unfortunately the best one i ve used as far as wysiwyg is dreamweaver and i don t like it that much either but it is a standard part of the toolset in many web shops and you just get used to it
i currently use aptana for that sort of prototyping which is not really wysiwyg but has a great preview function and i don t end up having to go back through crappy wysiwyg generated markup and cleaning it up later

207062
google-chrome	firefox
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base
google google-chrome is an application not a window or a directx which you can create as a control

209569
profiling	instrumentation
assuming you want to profiling a whole app not just a snippet of code and that your app is written in c c++ objective-c not ruby and that you re using xcode 3.0 or higher you should also check out the instrumentation application
the sampler instrumentation will give you very similar information to shark though without shark s sometimes very helpful tips on improving performance

210081
tabcontrol	tabitem
note that the visibility of our tabitem will not be affected while that tabcontrol is in view so we can apply styles only when the tabcontrol visibility changes
private void breadcrumb_isvisiblechanged object sender dependencypropertychangedeventargs e if bool e.newvalue if sender is tabcontrol tabcontrol tabcontrol tabcontrol sender

210235
xsl-fo	xslt
from wiki the general idea behind xsl-fo s use is that the user writes a document not in fo but in an xml language. xhtml docbook and tei are all possibilities but it could be any xml language
then the user obtains an xslt transform either by writing one themselves or by finding one for the document type in question

210652
opera	firefox
you cannot do that in all browsers supposedly ie does allow it but mozilla and opera do not
when you compose a message in gmail the attach files feature is implemented one way for ie and any browser that supports this and then implemented another way for firefox and those browsers that do not

210667
hex	binary
offset 0 two bytes jpeg soi marker ffd8 hex offset 2 two bytes image width in pixels offset 4 two bytes image height in pixels offset 6 byte number of components 1 grayscale 3 rgb there are a couple other things after that but those aren t important
you can open the file using a binary stream and read this initial data and make sure that offset 0 is 0 and offset 6 is either 1 2 or 3

210693
prepare	execute
parameters are not combined with a prepare statement on the client-side so pdo should never have access to the query string combined with its parameters
the sql statement is sent to the database server when you do prepare and the parameters are sent separately when you do execute

210693
prepare	execute
this is not a true prepare query
you will circumvent the benefits of prepare queries by interpolating variables into the sql string before execute

210997
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the comparison is performed by looking for a case-sensitive match first
if this match is not found a subsequent search is occurs for a case-insensitive match

212488
factors	mean
it depends on your os cpu compiler and possibly other factors
in general it means the cpu bus could not complete a command or suffered a conflict but that could mean a whole range of things depending on the environment and code being run

215288
daemons	systemd
the port was fairly easy and one benefit was it s very easy to create a gui using pylons so i was able to throw a status page on top of what s basically a daemons process
i would summarize pylons this way it s similar to ruby on rails in that it aims to be very easy to deploy web apps it s default templating language mako is very nice to work with it uses a systemd of routing urls that s very convenient for us performance is not an issue so i can t guarantee that pylons would perform adequately for your needs you can use it with apache lighthttpd though i ve not tried this we also run an app with twisted and are happy with it

215473
opera	firefox
even if you test with mozilla firefox opera and konqueror from kde 4 on windows you re not even close to covering most of the userbase
that being said if you narrow your focus to browsers with support for modern css you ll find that there s only a few underlying engines trident ie gecko mozilla webkit apple khtml kde and presto opera

215746
google-chrome	firefox
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers
opera has native svg support firefox has native svg support internet explorer does not include svg support natively

215746
opera	safari	firefox	safari
opera has native svg support firefox has native svg support internet explorer does not include svg support natively
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1

215749
svg	vml
ie has svg support in ie9 but not in ie8 and below
the alternative is vml mozilla claims to support it on its latest version opera claims to support it since v8.0 safari has experimental support probably incomplete chrome seems to have roughly the same level of svg support as safari konqueror uses the same svg engine as safari and chrome - ksvg claims to be in beta

216108
serializable	deserialization
xml serializable is a little easier than returning an xelement because all you have to do is mark properties with attributes and the serializable does all the xml generation for you
plus you get deserialization for free assuming you have a parameterless constructor and well a bunch of other things. on the other hand a you have to create an xmlserializer to do it b dealing with collection properties isn t quite the no-brainer you might like it to be and c xml serializable is pretty dumb

217119
client-side	server-side
i often suggest this include it when needed approach because simulating mvc client-side means exactly what you said it means -- you have two mvc frameworks now to maintain
not only that -- with most client-side models they have direct access to your server-side model which defeats the purpose of your server-side mvc

217361
dictionary	map
can you use dictionary string string instead of namevaluecollection
since dictionary t t implements ienumerable you could use linq as so edit actually you may be able to use dictionary directly as if it doesn t map key value the way you want you can always go back to linq

217708
config	ini
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions centralised location for the sites config on each server so easy to keep upto date server doesn t change that oftern updateing the config is simple with an update script
can be generated by the script all my sites have a function that rebuilds the config file useing the config assoc array

219311
postgresql	mysql
database considerations for your database server you will want something that is fast microsoft sql server ibm s db2 postgresql or oracle
mysql might be useful too but i have not experience with large databases with it

219490
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
my understanding is that with sqldatasource connection management is performed for you and you have nothing to fear
objectdatasource doesn t talk to the database directly in the first place so it will be safe -- as long as the underlying object performs its connection and reader management correctly

220089
jboss	glassfish
books and other 3rd party products are available for jboss but not for glassfish
if something is mission critical and you need to get it up and running right now you will not go wrong going with jboss

220089
jboss	glassfish
if something is mission critical and you need to get it up and running right now you will not go wrong going with jboss
however if you have some time in the long run glassfish will not hurt you

220164
xslt	xquery
i think i heard all those limitations were adressed in the xslt 2.0 specification sadly ms decided not to implement it and promote xquery instead
i think that xslt would still have a good chance of becoming as popular as css became for html

220563
cvs	svn
cvs - svn import is pretty shaky really it s a one-off thing probably not that many individual people work on it enough to really care about making it perfect
going from another scm system to cvs and then to svn sounds like a recipe for useless history data and frustration

220801
icmp	tcp
the webserver can choose to ignore it and not respond instead of responding with an icmp response
the web brower uses http which means it opens a tcp connection on port 80 by using a syn synack ack exchange

223288
client-side	server-side
this solution isn t as responsive as pure client-side validation needs time to send receive data between client and server but is quite simple and you don t need to translate validation rules to javascript
to keep validation rules in one place i use only server-side validation

224409
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar are distributed control systems that operate of the idea that you aren t always connected to the net and that there need not be one central version of the repository
if you re doing a lot of detached work sometimes called airplane mode as in you re on an airplane and can t commit take a look at bazaar

226519
division	multiplication
division isn t going to have a big performance impact in your application
floating-point division is generally especially slow so while floating-point multiplication is also relatively slow it s probably faster than floating-point division

226519
division	multiplication
floating-point division is generally especially slow so while floating-point multiplication is also relatively slow it s probably faster than floating-point division

multiplication

226754
implements	extends
microsoft offers entity framework as its cross-database-platform orm solution and other orm solutions are implements linq providers too
microsoft has no plans to extends linq to sql beyond sql server and it wouldn t make much sense to do so

228254
kerberos	ntlm
search ms support for kerberos hotfix to turn off kerberos for the site cscript adsutil.vbs set w3svc ### ntauthenticationproviders ntlm where ### is the siteid from the metabase
typically if you see an issue with authentication where it works in ie 6 but not ie 7 i d check to make sure kerberos is configured correctly

230208
daemons	systemd
so far we ve had zero issues as a result of this process except when the build server kicks in while our source control systemd also known as the daemons spawn see so many of my recent remarks performs a large multi-file check-in
as daemons spawn doesn t support transacted check-ins. however this is a very rare occurrence -- perhaps once every 5 or 6 weeks

232382
division	subtraction	division	addition
by quick calculations in sample programs showed so you want to use as little division as possible in favor of multiplication or modulo
not shown are subtraction addition and comparison operators cause they blow all of these out of the water

232666
ienumerable	iqueryable
a jagged array is an array of arrays and is declared like so versus a rectangular array being defined as a single array that holds multiple dimensions because of this a jagged array is iqueryable ienumerable because you can iterate over it to receive an array at each iteration
whereas a rectangular array is not iqueryable ienumerable because elements are addressed in full dimension 0 0 0 1..etc so you won t have the ability to use linq or any predefined functions created for array in that case

235176
perforce	svn
perforce
commercial software and it s not free like svn but it s great

235727
nemerle	boo
a key factor for linq is the ability of the compiler to generate expression trees. i am using a macro in nemerle that converts a given nemerle expression into an expression tree object. i can then pass this to the where select etc extension methods on iqueryables. it s not quite the syntax of c# and vb but it s close enough for me
i got the nemerle macro via a link on this post it should be possible to create a similar macro for boo

235760
inline	inlining
however in many cases that s just not possible and therefore it becomes impossible to inline
early versions of javascript did not allow named function expressions and because of that we could not make a recursive function expression to get around this arguments.callee was added so we could do however this was actually a really bad solution as this in conjunction with other arguments callee and caller issues make inlining and tail recursion impossible in the general case you can achieve it in select cases through tracing etc but even the best code is sub optimal due to checks that would not otherwise be necessary

241908
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
octal is rarely if ever used you can tell someones age if they think octal instead of hex
i am from the hex generation but have worked with those from the octal generation that struggle with hex because they cannot get from octal to binary to hex in their mind

241908
hex	binary	octal	hex
i am from the hex generation but have worked with those from the octal generation that struggle with hex because they cannot get from octal to binary to hex in their mind
base 10 in a computer is like the average human thinking in hex

241908
multiplying	subtract
the problem is multiplying and divide which even today many processors do not support yes many have no fpu and only do add and subtract sometimes multiplying but divide is rare
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software

241908
multiplying	subtract
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software
take the worst case multiplying for a four bit system 1111 1111 11100001 so it takes 8 bits to store the result of a 4 bit multiplying you will quickly find that if you had a 4 bit system most of the multiplies you want to do will result a number that cannot be stored in 4 bits

242348
innodb	myisam
the other major thing to watch out for is that innodb does not support fulltext indices nor insert delayed
but then myisam doesn t support referential integrity

243772
octal	decimal
there s a direct mapping between hex or octal for that matter digits and the underlying bit patterns which is not the case with decimal
a decimal 9 represents something different with respect to bit patterns depending on what column it is in and what numbers surround it - it doesn t have a direct relationship to a bit pattern

245264
apache	lighttpd
not to mention the multiprocess nature of apache tends to eat up more ram as each process grows to the size of it s most intensive request
lighttpd with fastcgi will be nominally faster but really the time it takes to run your python code and any database hits it does is going to absolutely dwarf any performance benefit you get between web servers

245323
cvs	svn
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs
call me old fashioned but i much preferred the branching tagging model under cvs

245335
hex	binary
some subsidiary problems your strings were hex but you needed a x per character to actually get that hex byte at that position in the string which i suspect was what you wanted
you were trying to hash 40 bytes from data which wasn t that long actual effect you d end up partly hashing your result string your expected result was as far as i can tell incorrect you would print out random characters to the terminal since the hmac function will produce 32 bytes of random binary data not printable stuff

245361
ienumerable	iqueryable
basically you should usually not have to care one way or the other if it is an iqueryable or an ienumerable
iqueryable implements ienumerable so right off the bat with iqueryable you can do everything that you can do with ienumerable

245546
cvs	svn
subversion has some substantial wins over cvs good remote options http https svn vs pserver atomic commits ubiquitous tool support rename directory versioning however it has serious shortcomings
the biggest by far is that branches and tags are not first class citizens in svn they are just directories that adhere to a convention

246649
vb.net	vb6
imho i would suggest not moving to vb.net at all but instead utilizing your c background and making the move to c#
the reason for this is you already know the syntax and that vb.net is not enough like vb6 to make it as easy a move as you might expect

248757
sudo	passwd
i would not run the application full time as root but you might want to explore making your application setuid root or setuid to some id that can become root using something like sudo for particular applications
you might be able to set up an account that cannot login use setuid to change your program s id temporarily when needed and have sudo set up to not prompt for passwd but always allow access to that account for specific tasks

248757
sudo	passwd
you might be able to set up an account that cannot login use setuid to change your program s id temporarily when needed and have sudo set up to not prompt for passwd but always allow access to that account for specific tasks
this way your program has no special privileges when running normally only elevates it s privileges when needed and is restricted by sudo to only running certain programs

248757
sudo	passwd
this way your program has no special privileges when running normally only elevates it s privileges when needed and is restricted by sudo to only running certain programs
it s been awhile since i ve done much unix development so i m not really sure whether it s possible to set up sudo to not prompt for a passwd or even if there is an api for it but as a fallback you could enable setuid to root only when needed

254250
union	distinct
you must write them as the names of union and enumerations are also tags rather than types
in c tags are distinct from all other names for functions types variables and enumeration constants . c compilers maintain tags in a symbol table that s conceptually if not physically separate from the table that holds all other names

256398
textmate	aptana
if you want something more minimalistic there is e text editor which supports textmate bundles not free though
i ve been using aptana it s quite good with lots of features even in the free version you probably don t need pro

256521
skip-lists	tree
... a skip-lists upon which we have not recently performed any such θ n operations does not provide the same absolute worst-case performance guarantees as more traditional balanced tree data structures because it is always possible though with very low probability that the coin-flips used to build the skip-lists will produce a badly balanced structure edit so it s a trade-off skip lists use less memory at the risk that they might degenerate into an unbalanced tree
from the wikipedia article you quoted θ n operations which force us to visit every node in ascending order such as printing the entire list provide the opportunity to perform a behind-the-scenes derandomization of the level structure of the skip-list in an optimal way bringing the skip-lists to o log n search time

257952
vsts	tfs
see also vsts 2008 test edition home btw there s a link to a trial vpc w tfs vsts suite on the right-hand side visual studio 2008 training kit - not a lot on vsts in here but there are a few demos and resources that touch on the test features and it s a good general resource to have anyway
videos for team system asp.net s learn section video tutorials at teamsystemrocks.com plenty of videos between those sites on the various vsts test edition features

258785
debian	centos
i don t know how well it s supported on debian
if it s not just install a centos 5.2 with selinux enabled in a vm

259083
multiplication	exponent
this takes advantage of the fact that if exp is even and will only require about log2 exp multiplication
is exp times it doesn t handle negative exponent though

259460
postgresql	mysql
you can do all your testing and development on sqlite so you don t need to have an instance of postgresql running on your dev machine
if you aren t sure if you want to use mysql or postgresql i suggest trying them both out

260932
realloc	malloc
if you want to dynamically resize the array in order to keep a low memory footprint for your program it may be better to not do too many realloc s
if you want to dynamically allocate arrays you can use malloc from stdlib.h

261179
grouplayout	miglayout
although this is not a true answer to your question you may as well look at alternative solutions in terms of layout management matisse and grouplayout are neither the only way nor the best one to define your gui forms
i would suggest you take a look at miglayout very powerful and quite simple and designgridlayout quite powerful and very simple both are open source and have a friendly license not gpl . a quick search on google will give you the links immediately

261277
boost	stl
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out
boost has a utility called next and its inverse prior for just that purpose

263797
gridview	objectdatasource
the old gridview instance and the data table you bound to have been thrown away
when you are using an objectdatasource or any other datasource you set the datasourceid for your gridview not the datasource

263797
gridview	objectdatasource
when you are using an objectdatasource or any other datasource you set the datasourceid for your gridview not the datasource
the datasourceid should be whatever the id of your objectdatasource is

264473
innodb	myisam
very limited concurrency i think it s either one writer or multiple readers per database file mysql far more features choice of engines innodb provides good features for many workloads much more control of storage backup restore etc network-capable - which allows its use in large scale applications better concurrency - the innodb engine has mvcc which means that readers do not block writers nor do writers block readers
even the old myisam engine has table-level locking rather than for the whole database as sqlite

264581
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i ve some experience with using star team for continous integration - though using teamcity not cruisecontrol
in our case the regular connections from teamcity to starteam barely register as a blip on our performance monitoring

264770
ssl	https
some ssl accelerators will also have parameters allowing you to tune the time the session is cached
another impact to consider is that static content served over https will not be cached by proxies and this may reduce performance across multiple users accessing the site over the same proxy

267099
g++	gcc
to add to what others have said g++ is the gnu c++ compiler
gcc is the gnu compiler collection not the gnu c compiler as many people assume

267333
dictionary	map
in java the hashmap implements the map interface while the dictionary does not
that makes the dictionary obsolete according to the api docs

269117
swt	swing
i suggest to check these criteria swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui swing is older and you can find more components if you also use jface you will find many powerful widgets that work out of the box where you would need a lot of additional configuration in swing
swing is available anywhere swt is not swt is developed actively you have the source and bugs are fixed quickly

269117
swt	swing
swing is available anywhere swt is not swt is developed actively you have the source and bugs are fixed quickly
swing hasn t been touched in years then there was suddenly a big update for java 6

270619
lisp	scheme
lisp has been mentioned but i think scheme in particular plt-scheme is in some respects as good a choice as ruby python perl php
it doesn t have as many good libraries as some of those which is a minus but most scheme have excellent ffi foreign function interface which makes it trivial to integrate external c code libraries

272261
postgresql	greenplum
i m not sure off the top of my head if mysql does this but postgresql certainly does
iirc some of the variants greenplum i think also directly support bitmap indexes and there was some talk of incorporating it in the main db engine

276151
ssl	https
------ previous answer ------------ ssl hosts must be tied to a unique ip address port combination thus you cannot use virtual hosting or at least it can only have one ssl host per ip address
this is due to the fact that https begins encryption before the host parameter is sent in http and thus it cannot determine which cipher to use from the hostname - all it has is the ip address

277253
nunit	mstest
as a recommendation i suggest using vs2008 with nunit free and testdriven.net not free
it takes away all the pain allowing you to just write simple things like then just right-click on the class on the method on the project on the solution and use the test options that testdriven.net provides including if you have mstest test with - team coverage which runs your nunit tests with the mstest coverage tools including giving the colorization back into the ide to show which lines executed

277445
innodb	myisam
the main difference is that innodb supports transactions while myisam does not
there are numerous other differences however the common one s i am aware of are myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not innodb supports referential integrity whilst myisam does not innodb handles indexes a bit differently storing the primary key as part of every index making indexes take up more room on the disk but also making a covering index more likely myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking different memory buffer index settings are used in the mysql configuration files innodb is typically said to have better crash recovery as mentioned in another answer the data is store on disk differently

i believe innodb is configurable in this area and can have one file per table etc

operands	scalar
in scalar context or if the left operands is not enclosed in parentheses it returns a string consisting of the left operands repeated the number of times specified by the right operands
in list context if the left operands is enclosed in parentheses or is a list formed by qw string it repeats the list

277568
hex	binary
if the first four bytes are hex ff fe 00 00 the file is tentatively utf-32 le
if through the above checks you have determined a tentative encoding then check only for the corresponding encoding below to ensure that the file is not a binary file which happens to match a byte-order mark

278739
jboss	weblogic
i do not think jboss is bad in anyway it simply isn t as up-to-date
most of my experience is on weblogic but i have used jboss and glassfish

280900
vbscript	vba
vbscript works quite well with the jet engine
however i do not see why you say it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access. sub transfercsv docmd.transfertext acexportdelim putnameofqueryhere c putpathand filenamehere.csv true end sub is the usual way in vba

281035
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
i m considering a virtualization host and multiple client os ubuntu and centos being the top 2 candidates - that way once i get the client configured as i want it i can save it off for reloading as needed
doesn t get around the original setup issue but does limit the rebuild my linux box yet again problem

281421
swt	swing
right now i m either using swt or qt jambi
swing didn t evolve in the last say 10 years bugs aren t fixed the development has stopped in favor of javafx so you won t ever see any new features too

281688
cassini	iis
the xp version of iis has limitation that are not present in the server version that cassini side-steps
the only argument i know against is that there are a couple very rare edge cases where the cassini built-in server doesn t exactly mimic iis because you re using odd port numbers

281688
cassini	iis
the only argument i know against is that there are a couple very rare edge cases where the cassini built-in server doesn t exactly mimic iis because you re using odd port numbers
i doubt you ll ever run into them and using cassini as the primary dev environment does not preclude developers from also having access to iis on the machine

281688
cassini	iis
i doubt you ll ever run into them and using cassini as the primary dev environment does not preclude developers from also having access to iis on the machine
in fact my preferred setup is cassini first for most small work then deploy to my local iis for more in-depth testing before moving code back to the shared source repository

282421
emacs	aquamacs
not sure if you re totally married to using emacs from the terminal but another option is to use carbon emacs my favorite and aquamacs very mac-like
carbon emacs uses the command key for meta this is nice because you can do control-meta commands just by holding control and command down instead of first hitting escape then the control key sequence

282698
ssl	https
you re not going to be able to do what you re talking about simply because the postback which is what the login control uses is going to be whatever the page s security is ssl or non-ssl
your best bet in this scenario is to use an iframe which contains an https ssl page that just contains thelogin control

283248
strcpy	strncpy
i wouldn t recommend you to learn it the hard way - just develop a habit to check target buffer before strcpy and strcat
edit good suggestion from healthcarel - use strncpy rather than strcpy

284711
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller is a distinct object that is very different from a uitabbarcontroller
in general your application should have a tab controller one of who s tab s loads a uinavigationcontroller which in turn loads it s views - not that both maintain management over the different views

284711
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it is also improper to refer to the display of a uiviewcontroller as such an object doesn t have a visual representation
in the case of a uinavigationcontroller the navigation controller object is responsible for displaying a navigation bar and a table view in the most common case and for managing the display of all the views in the navigation hierarchy

285627
cvs	svn
it isn t a static entity like a cvs tag is well to be fair you can move a tag on individual cvs files which effectively changes it
most svn users treat tags the way cvs presented them

285809
serializable	deserialization
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

286068
decimal	ieee
please read what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic other options besides a decimal class are using common lisp or python 2.6 or another language with exact rationals converting the doubles to close rationals using frap
ieee floating point is binary not decimal

286303
swt	swing
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java
it depends with eclipse 3.4 swt 3.4 is quite supported with macos

287270
vb.net	vb6
here is the equivalent vb.net code
it s not exactly the converted version of the vb6 code but does the same thing

287883
hmac	pbkdf2
a good way to apply the salt when hashing is to use hmac with your favorite hash algorithm using the password as the hmac key and the salt as the text to hash see this section of the document
example implementation in python using sha-256 as the secure hash edit as mentioned by eli collins this is not a pbkdf2 implementation

287942
configobj	configparser
edit if you don t mind the extra dependency you could check out configobj which natively supports lists as a value type
configparser isn t designed to handle such conditions

289412
jruby	mri
since approximately two years ago it is also possible to extend jruby in java and there is actually since last month a port of rcov for jruby
however this requires both a knowledge of ruby and c and a pretty deep knowledge at that because fiddling around with the internals of mri is not for the faint at heart

289412
mri	rubinius
however this requires both a knowledge of ruby and c and a pretty deep knowledge at that because fiddling around with the internals of mri is not for the faint at heart
but only with rubinius will it be possible to write dynamic analysis tools such as code coverage tools in ruby itself making tool writing accessible to a much larger portion of the ruby community

289524
inline	inlining
this means that if a function in the cpp file calls another function which is not implemented in the same cpp file or in a header file that is included then it doesn t have the actual body of the function and can therefore not inline it
but if you use ltcg it s the linker that does the inlining and it has all the functions in all the of the cpp files of the entire project minus referenced lib files that were not built with ltcg

292209
decimal	ieee
it has the lua 5.1 arithmetic operators and more full control over rounding modes and working precision up to 69 decimal digits
though not arbitrary precision lua decnumber a lua 5.1 wrapper for ibm decnumber implements the proposed general decimal arithmetic standard ieee 754r

292931
boost	allocator
alternatively you can use boost ptr_map or a map that contains a share_ptr
the gc allocator is allocator and looking after objects of this type just because this object has a pointer in it does not mean it the allocator will call delete on it

294747
super	implements
i m not sure of the best way but can think of a few none are super great though
use iis windowsauthentication with basic security and implements the validation method and then mark the rss action with an authorize filter

295036
lisp	scheme
that s not the focus of the book which is programming languages in general but it is covered. lisp in small pieces goes into more depth but that s both good and bad for your case
there s a lot of material on compiling and such that won t be relevant to you and its simpler interpreters are in scheme not c++

295048
boost	allocator
here s what the boost docs say about the deleter custom deallocators allow a factory function returning a shared_ptr to insulate the user from its memory allocator strategy
since the deallocator is not part of the type changing the allocator strategy does not break source or binary compatibility and does not require a client recompilation

297123
dictionary	map
notice we re making a distinction between the dictionary class and the dictionary adt. the dictionary class has been marked as obsolete so it s best not to use it
in terms of java both the class hashmap and the class dictionary are implementations of the map abstract data type

297123
dictionary	map
in terms of java both the class hashmap and the class dictionary are implementations of the map abstract data type
abstract data types are not specific to any one programming language and the map adt can also be known as a hash or a dictionary or an associative array others at

299121
division	multiplication
do multiplication first as long as they re not likely to overflow and division second
3 4 0 in integer math integer math doesn t round on division it truncates

299541
tostring	string.format
maintainability readability for me is using string concatenation without any tostring calls if you re after performance make the tostring calls yourself to avoid boxing i m somewhat biased towards readability - same as first option in your question if you re showing localized strings to the user not the case here string.format has an edge
my initial preference coming from a c++ background was for string.format

306053
ostream	ostringstream
because it s a temporary we cannot trivially convert to an ostream object through casting
both the constructor obviously and str are class ostringstream methods. yes we need to use .str

306360
cvs	svn
svn has some important features over cvs vss like atomic commits cheap copies more efficient storage on the server side
svn is however not the only revison control system out there.

306967
cassini	iis
it requires using the visual studio development server cassini during development instead of your local iis see the properties box on the project
when using iis as your development server edit and continue is not currently available for visual studio for asp.net

308170
translation	localization
for example there is a lot to be said about determining the locale the translation adapter will use
i d suggest you read the following in the zend framework manual because localization can be a complex issue and zend_translate can not be described entirely in here 53.4.1.13

310338
komodo	notepad++
i have worked a bit with python programming for google app engine which i started out in notepad++ and then recently shifted over to komodo using two excellent startup tutorials - both of which are conveniently linked from this blog post direct here and here
komodo supports the basic organization of your work into projects which notepad++ does not apart from physical folder organization

310913
vb.net	vb6
in my vb.net code i would use ctype to do this
however when i try to use ctype in vb6 i get a sub or function not defined error

310913
vb.net	vb6
solution as you may have discovered vb6 does not have a ctype function like vb.net does
however the other conversion functions those that have names beginning with c which you may have encountered in vb.net code such as cint and cstr do exist in vb6 and you can use them to convert to and from non-object types

310913
vb.net	vb6
keep in mind that vb6 unlike vb.net does not support inheritance
a class in vb6 can implement one or more interfaces but it cannot inherit from another class

312056
profiling	debugging
profiling however are better tools for guesstimating
the reason why hitting the pause button in debugging mode may not give a real picture of application behavior is because debuggers introduce additional executable code that can slowdown certain parts of the application

312468
firefox	safari
document.body.offsetwidth returns the innerwidth value from left hand side to the left side of the vertical scrollbar in firefox
not for me it doesn t it returns the same value as ie opera konqueror and safari

313022
innodb	myisam
lesson learned in production despite the fact we like to use innodb tables in mysql for many many reasons.
be sure you haven t managed to find one of the few myisam tables that doesn t respect transactions and you can t roll back on

319433
gif	png
the comment by paul fisher reminded me that i also probably wouldn t recommend using gif either
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

321054
mvp	presenter
since you are probably using webforms it would be hard to migrate to asp.net mvc but you could implement mvp pretty easily into existing apps
on a basic level you would move all the business logic into a presenter class that has a view that represents some sort of interface you would define your interface to hold the atomic types you want to display once those are defined you can now simply implement the interface in your form as you can see your code behind is now extremely simple so code duplication is not a big deal

321552
redmine	trac
redmine is another good pick - i don t love it quite as well as trac but it s much easier to set up on the shared host where i keep my project management tools
trac and mediawiki would be my top two picks depending on whether or not you wanted ticketing integrated

321628
innodb	myisam
i m not as familiar with myisam intricacies but with innodb it is true that statistics can get out of date
the database keeps estimated statistics on how your data is distributed for a given index and it s possible for those to get out-of-date but mysql innodb has some built in functionality to try to keep statistics current

udp	tcp
for udp you send datagrams over the internet using ip
udp doesn t provide the safety that tcp does but doesn t require a response but such responses are part of their protocols not yours

322241
udp	tcp
udp doesn t provide the safety that tcp does but doesn t require a response but such responses are part of their protocols not yours
i would suggest using tcp to save you some headache

323092
hmac	md5
to verify a token simply recompute the hmac with the supplied value of c and see if it matches the supplied hmac value
also as vinko mentioned you should not use md5

323388
udp	tcp
it would probably be another protocol over tcp but i see no reason why you cannot stream over udp
if you do you have to take into account that there is no certainty that your data will arrive at the other end but i can take it that you know about udp

323764
sudo	passwd
this will install git into the default place usr local - so git will be in usr local bin git it will prompt you to enter your passwd for sudo this is so it can write to the usr local directory which can only be accessed by the root user so sudo is required
if you with to install it somewhere separate so git s files aren t mixed in with other tools use --prefix with the configure command this will install the git binary into usr local bin gitpath bin git - so you don t have to type that every time you you should add into your by adding the following line into your .profile if you do not have sudo access you can use and install into your home directory

325769
imperative	declarative
orchestration languages are in fact imperative scripting languages with conditionals looping and other traditionally imperative constructs typically expressed through a flowchart-based user interface
they certainly do not in my experience implement tail-recursive functional programming backward chaining or any other paradigm that might reasonably described as declarative in the generally accepted sense

326440
bufferedreader	ioexception
in java 8 bufferedreader added a new method lines to produce a
if an ioexception is encountered while reading the file it is wrapped in an uncheckedioexception since stream doesn t accept lambdas that throw checked exceptions

327551
decimal	ieee
thus when printed out with full precision as a decimal fraction they won t match the original value
the most common storage for floating-point values in programming languages - ieee singles and doubles - does not have exact representations for most decimal fractions

327551
floating-point	fractions	decimal	ieee
the most common storage for floating-point values in programming languages - ieee singles and doubles - does not have exact representations for most decimal fractions
the reason is that they store values in binary floating-point format rather than decimal floating-point format

328942
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
since it s a button it shouldn t own the uiviewcontroller that it displays
instead it sends a message to the uitabbarcontroller to switch to the uiviewcontroller as indicated by the selected tab bar item

330109
bash	tcsh
so in your shell script a bash shell script here the contents would be
i am not sure about the function to generate a random number in tcsh

lisp	scheme
disclaimer i m not a lisp expert
i m mostly interested in programming languages and have been playing with lisp clos scheme erlang python and a bit of ruby

330617
vim	emacs
in the vim help see he text-objects for more
i m a regular vim user but not an emacs user and haven t used vimpulse to confirm this

332756
automake	autotools
the main difference between this automake example and your example seems to be that automake touches the stamp file while in your example it is not even a real file
this seems similar to what autotools does for its config.h header

332975
profiling	instrumentation
aqtime is an instrumenting profiling
instrumenting profilers often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured

332975
profiling	instrumentation
instrumenting profiling often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured
instrumenting profiling on the other hand excel at profiling memory and other resource usage

333011
hash-collision	key
let s suppose that the hash-collision resolving function we used found that the new empty element is 29 since there was a hash-collision in this insertion our performance was not quite o 1
this problem will also crop up when we try to search for the pet key as trying to find the element containing the pet key by performing hash_function pet will always return 18 initially

333631
webkit	gecko
with gecko-engined browsers you get in terms of other browsers implementing these features i m only aware of webkit implementing array extras but it s actually quite easy to monkeypatch support for those in all browsers since they re just additional methods
gecko opera and webkit also support the canvas element which although being a new html element is used via javascript so i m not sure if that fits your criteria

334225
client-side	server-side
use the craxdrt.dll for any client-side application that does not contain the embeddable designer or use it for any server-side application
craxddrt.dll is apartment-model threaded but is not thread safe and can only be used in a client-side application

335122
pascal	delphi
i don t think there are any machine code decompilers that produce pascal code
most delphi decompilers parse form and rtti data but do not actually decompile the machine code

336282
union	distinct
the below query by itself will only provide distinct values select col from table1 union select col from table2 if you did want duplicates you would have to do select col from table1 union all select col from table2
select unique is not valid syntax for what you are trying to do you want to use either select distinct or select distinctrow and actually you don t even need distinct distinctrow in what you are trying to do

338821
wordpress	joomla
it s very easy to use has many plugins for it and the newest version of wordpress even has auto-updating features
wordpress isn t as good as joomla when it comes to user management though

wordpress	joomla

for example joomla can specify exactly what content users and user groups have access to

338821
wordpress	joomla
joomla typically requires having a sit-down with the client to go over the basic features of how to use the software while wordpress is easy enough for the client to figure out without any assistance
however the wordpress sites i ve worked with that require more than the standard blogging features e-commerce image galleries forums usually involve integrating wordpress with a separate software application while joomla more often than not has those plugins available for it

338821
wordpress	joomla
however the wordpress sites i ve worked with that require more than the standard blogging features e-commerce image galleries forums usually involve integrating wordpress with a separate software application while joomla more often than not has those plugins available for it
the end result is a website with several applications on it installed wordpress coppermine phpbb each with separate logins and admin screens

339544
vmware	virtualbox
to second eric s comment about virtualbox not only is it free but it doesn t load processes bloat to your host os as vmware does
vmware slowed down my bootup even in a day in which i wasn t going to launch it at all

339734
vsts	tfs
note if you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2005 you ll need to do the compile yourself see the notes at the bottom of the home page buck hodges has a post why this wasn t built into 2005 and isn t the default action in 2008
if that is the case and you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2008 then using the get latest version on checkout setting of both is probably your answer if you aren t then the checkout and get latest version is what you investigate

341435
implements	extends
that said i don t really know why hashmap values would not implements equals itself
both abstractlist and abstractset extends abstractcollection and they have different behaviors for their equals methods specified by the interfaces list and set

342137
cassini	iis
i ve had problems with security thread.currentprincipal etc on cassini that just disappeared when i started debugging against iis
probably not relevant to this discussion but be careful testing debugging on cassini

342137
cassini	iis
probably not relevant to this discussion but be careful testing debugging on cassini
its threading model is different from iis

343478
ienumerable	icollection
the key difference between the icollection family and the ienumerable family is the absence of certainty as to the count of items present quite often the items will be generated loaded hydrated as needed - in some cases an enumerable may not ever finish generating results which is why the count is missing
deriving and adding a count is possible depending on your requirements but it goes against this spirit which is the purpose of icollection - a collection of stuff that s all there

343797
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools
having automatically generated id tags that show a sensible version number is impossible to do with dscm tools like bazaar because everybody s line of development can be different from all others

346117
cvs	svn
working with cvs without write access is a real pain - with git there is not a big different how get get your patches in. this is not only a technical advantage but also saves complicated discussions whether this noobie should really get write access
number of commands while svn and other modern vcs like hg or others are nice and useful tools git is a shop full of machine tools

348558
prng	random
the prng solution doesn t permit you to obtain only part of the solar system you have to make the whole thing. just how much detail is there anyway that you need to save
a random seed for each solar system is a viable solution but i have a feeling you re barking up the wrong tree here

349207
subtraction	multiplication
both have one if and one subtraction but the first one has a multiplication in some cases the last one has not
some cpus have a swap sign operation and the compiler recognizes what does it just swaps the sign so instead of a multiplication it will issue a swap sign operation for cpus that offer it and this operation is as fast as a cpu operation can get usually one clock cycle

350167
gridview	repeater
if you don t need any of the features of a gridview why not use a repeater
a repeater keeps it simple for implementation but also allows you to have full control over the generated source

351629
dictionary	map
i recommend the map str args instead of just args because some of your arguments could potentially not be strings and would cause a typeerror for example with an int argument in your list when you get into dictionary objects you will probably want to comma-separate the values of the dictionary presumably because the values are what you want to pass into this function
if you do the join method on the dictionary object itself you will get the keys separated like so what you want is the following note the new problem you encounter however

351894
udp	tcp
in addition when using udp it s not necessary for all the fragments to arrive at the destination so preventing fragmentation means the message either arrives or doesn t arrive - there is no possibility that only a bit of the udp datagram will reach the destination
i can t recall how long the tcp ip stack held on to unassembled ip packets waiting for missing fragments but use of the df flag meant there were no unnecessary resources tied up during that time

352132
jboss	glassfish
not sure if it was worth the 3+ year effort but the release notes are here group_id 22866 as with any big rewrite of an app server i would tread carefully on jboss 5
if you are programming simply to java ee specs then glassfish will probably suit your needs fine

cassini	iis
iis6 doesn t do the intergrated pipeline that is intrinsic to cassini and is default in iis7
edit details in iis manager open application properties

354405
implements	extends
if your helper method commony only exists in abstract base class b all classes which implements interface a will have to also extends base class b in order to take advantage of that implementation of commony
but you might not always want to be forced to extends class b

354818
boost	allocator
i m not a fan of this technique but i ll let you decide for yourself if it s what you want then there s boost array which has none of the dynamic sizing behavior of the first two but gives you more of the vector interface than just using pointers as iterators that you get with built-in arrays ie. you get begin end size etc.
some options you may want to look at stlsoft by matthew wilson author of imperfect c++ has an auto_buffer template class that puts a default array on the stack but if it grows larger than the stack allocator will grab the memory from the heap

355790
setinterval	settimeout
well the first thing to say is that if you re calling settimeout but not changing the interval you should be using setinterval
edit update from comment you can keep a reference from the closure if used as a class and setinterval clearinterval don t require re-referencing

356920
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses webkit a fairly standard rendering engine
safari uses it also and it doesn t sound like webkit is going away

359079
udp	tcp
this is to ensure that the udp checksum takes into account these fields
from the tcp or udp point of view the packet does not contain ip addresses

359671
cassini	iis
despite the fact that i am in fact deploying to an iis 7 server i have been debugging using the vs 2008 built in web server cassini
cassini passes all requests through the asp.net pipeline iis does not

360203
hash-collision	key
to get to an item your hashtable will do something like this get the hash of the key get the bucket number for that hash usually the map function looks like this bucket hash bucketscount traverse the items chain basically it s a list of items that share the same bucket most hashtables use this method of handling bucket hash-collision that starts at that bucket and compare each key with the one of the item you are trying to add delete update check if contained
lookup times depend on how good how sparse is the output and fast is your hash function the number of buckets you are using and how fast is the key comparer it s not always the best solution

361956
udp	tcp
so udp is the obvious choice in cases such as this
rtp is fairly insensitive to packet loss so it doesn t require the reliability of tcp

362013
udp	tcp
udp does not care about reliability of the communication and will not slow down or re-transmit data
if your application needs a reliable data stream for example to retrieve a file from a webserver you choose tcp

362013
udp	tcp
if your application doesn t care about corrupted or lost packets and you don t need to incur the additional overhead to provide the additional reliability you can choose udp instead
voip is not significantly improved by reliable packet transmission and in fact in some cases things in tcp like retransmission and exponential backoff can actually hurt voip quality

364931
haskell	ocaml
it s not quite what you asked for and it s not directly related to haskell but bruce mcadam s paper that about wraps it up goes into this topic in substantial breadth and depth
bruce s basic idea is to use an explicit knot-tying operator called wrap instead of the implicit knot-tying that is done automatically in haskell ocaml and some other languages

365834
innodb	myisam
in innodb however primary keys are clustered meaning they stay attached to the data pages and ensure that the row contents remain in physically sorted order on disk according to the primary key but only within single data pages which themselves could be scattered in any order. this being the case i would expect that innodb might have an advantage in that myisam would essentially have to do double work -- write the int once in the data pages and then write it again in the index pages
innodb wouldn t do this the primary key index would be identical to the data pages and would only have to write once

365834
innodb	myisam
innodb wouldn t do this the primary key index would be identical to the data pages and would only have to write once
it would only have to manage the data in one place where myisam would needlessly have to manage two copies

367296
inline	inlining
using the stl will increase your binary size for two basic reasons inlining by default the compiler treats template code as inline
therefore if you use in several different compilation units and the compiler inlines that code they ll each have their own local inline definitions of functions which probably isn t a big deal since the compiler will only inline very small definitions by default

367303
inline	inlining
but it is up to the compiler if the method is actually inline or not
the compiler inlining is sophisticated enough to only in-line if this will help in the optimization stratergy being used

367881
ubuntu	linux
my current ubuntu server eats 40megs
i m not sure how much ram you have to play with on your server but if it s a lower amount you re going to fit a lot more on a linux host

369354
erd	diagram
a single erd or set of erd s are not sufficient to document a system of this complexity any more than a class diagram would be adequate to document an oo system
you ll have to write a document using the erd s as illustrations

369379
entity-relationship	diagram
in my experience entity-relationship or uml diagram aren t the most useful artifact - with a large number of tables diagram especially reverse engineered ones are often a big convoluted mess that nobody learns anything from
for my money some good human-readable documentation perhaps supplemented with diagram of smaller portions of the system will give you the most mileage

370337
inline	constexpr
in the meantime your best bet is to follow the pattern also used by std numeric_limits it will not return a constant expression value is not known at compile time but that only matters theoretical since practical the value will be inline anyway
see the constexpr proposal

370378
opera	firefox
in opera the only browser i found where you could replace it in you only get the function back
you can however add a new function will work in firefox google-chrome and opera but not in ie since ie don t have the constructor property update by reading your description here i see your error you get a reference to the object called myinnercontent you remove that object from the dom when you replace the content of the outer tag

371111
pascal	delphi
the only problem is that you will have to learn pascal but it should not be a problem
delphi is compiled and very fast similar to c++

371348
equals	gethashcode
if the hash-code for two items does not match they may never be considered equals equals will simply never be called
the gethashcode method should reflect the equals logic

371348
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method should reflect the equals logic
the rules are if two things are equal then they must return the same value for gethashcode if the gethashcode is equal it is not necessary for them to be the same

371348
equals	gethashcode
the rules are if two things are equals then they must return the same value for gethashcode if the gethashcode is equals it is not necessary for them to be the same
this is a collision and equals will be called to see if it is a real equality or not

371743
octree	quadtree
the reason to use a quadtree is because you can then split on x- and y-coordinates an octree on x y and z making collision detection trivial
quadtree if an element is not in the topleft it wont collide with one in topright bottomleft or bottomright

373446
bluecloth	rdiscount
see also moving past bluecloth on ryan tomayko s blog
ryan s post includes the following benchmark of 100 iterations of a markdown test bluecloth 13.029987s total time 00.130300s average maruku 08.424132s total time 00.084241s average rdiscount 00.082019s total time 00.000820s average update august 2009 bluecloth2 was released it s speed is on par with rdiscount because it is based on rdiscount - it is not pure ruby

375484
mvp	presenter
the presenter or the controller depending if you do mvc or mvp should know about it not the domain the domain will assert defensive coding is as all needed values ok or throw an exception not ask for it
so let say you don t supply the number your model throw a authorizationnumberrequiredexception then your presenter handle it from there

375708
multiplying	division
it would multiplying 2 32-bit integers and split the results across 2 registers but not division as far as i recall
more than likely the division limitation stems from the fact that you re compiling for 32-bit instead of 64-bit

376065
google-chrome	firefox
hopefully it ll render ok in google-chrome and safari
the reason is that there are fixes available to make ie work properly but not many to make firefox behave badly

381385
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist
the .net 3.5 extension method ienumerable t .count will enumerate behind the scenes if the return value does not implement icollection t which may be undesirable
i often return ilist t or icollection t when the result is a collection - internally your method can use a list t and either return it as-is or return list t .asreadonly if you want to protect against modification if you re caching the list internally

382528
rsa	3des	rsa	dsa	rsa	aes
for some reason when i use that short-cut i can t decode the data correctly but if i use the rsa long way it works.
now this application was never fully finished so i don t support things like dsa key-pairs but i do support rsa key pairs with sha1 md5 using idea aes i think my 3des code does not work correctly but i may have fixed that since

384087
stringbuilder	stringwriter
all of these concrete classes implement the appendable interface bufferedwriter chararraywriter charbuffer filewriter filterwriter logstream outputstreamwriter pipedwriter printstream printwriter stringbuffer stringbuilder stringwriter writer
in java these concrete classes all implement the charsequence interface charbuffer string stringbuffer stringbuilder these concrete classes do not have a common parent class other than object so there is nothing that relates them other than the fact they each have something to do with arrays of characters representing such or manipulating such

384640
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools
as i ve written before having automatically generated id tags that show a sensible version number is impossible to do with dscm tools like bazaar because everybody s line of development can be different from all others

388090
memcpy	memmove
memcpy should have that behavior
memmove doesn t by design if the blocks of memory overlap it copies the contents starting at the ends of the buffers to avoid that sort of behavior

388658
google-chrome	safari
since you are on windows anyway you could try using the inbuilt javascript debugger of google-chrome which is a browser very similar to safari although the javascript engine is different
well apart from the error console that can be opened from the develop menu which in turn can be enabled in prefences advanced show develop menu in menu bar there aren t many javascript debugging options in safari afaik

389824
innodb	myisam
innodb enforces foreign key constraints
myisam doesn t enforce or even store foreign key constraints

392646
gif	png
a png is almost always smaller than the equivalent gif and will not lose quality like a jpeg file
a png equivalent of a jpeg will typically be a lot larger assuming it s photorealistic

393924
profiling	debugging
there still doesn t seem to be a good answer to these just do lots of profiling and keep trying to figure it out
a couple of years ago when i did this i had to use a combination of printf debugging and quickcheck

395725
firefox	safari
for stuff that works in firefox but not in ie i debug in visual studio
i ve also got the developer toolbar installed in ie and have the develop menu turned on in safari

396114
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you want to do case-sensitive compare on strings then you could use a switch statement as it is faster than performing a string.compare in an if else
for some actual performance tests however if you wanted to do a case-insensitive then it is better using a if else as the resulting code is not pretty

396805
firefox	safari
firefox still doesn t have a large enough market share to be the targeted browser
it s not realistic that your site is 100 perfect in every browser but targetting the big ones should always be done ie6+ firefox 2+ safari 3 any good javascript library should work or at least degrade nicely over the three major browsers

397615
sudo	passwd
you could consider sudo
although not passwordless it doesn t require the user to be given the root passwd

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
data normalization is utterly irrelevant to entity-relationship diagramming
a well built entity-relationship diagram will have very little harmful redundancy in it but that s largely serendipity and not the result of careful planning

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
a well built entity-relationship diagram will have very little harmful redundancy in it but that s largely serendipity and not the result of careful planning
the entities and relationships in a stakeholder oriented entity-relationship diagram should only include entities that are understood by the subject matter experts and not include entities or relationships that are added in the course of logical database design

403971
client-side	server-side
if you have a client-side method that uses xslt to dynamically render an element in the page make sure it s not loading and compiling the xslt every time it s called
if you re using server-side xslt cache the xslt processor object in whatever collection your server environment supports

404857
innodb	myisam
any data you need transactions for must be in an innodb table and you manage the transactions using whatever access library you are using or with manual sql commands
given that you can t have transactions in myisam tables i am not sure what the actual problem is

405021
postgresql	mysql
see the mysql 5.1 faq if you plan to use postgresql it is possible look here
if you plan to use mysql 5.1 it is not possible to pass in an array

407474
google-chrome	safari
if it s working fine on safari it will probably work on google-chrome as well
the only difference is the javascript engine but i ve yet to see a real world example of some legitim javascript code not working on google-chrome

407475
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome doesn t have much of a user-base now but i can imagine that will change
theoretically because google google-chrome uses the same engine as safari webkit you ve already tested

408828
awt	swing
any serious java ui work is done in swing not awt which was primarily used for applets
swing vs awt

409235
client-side	server-side
if i understand correctly the i think you should use a client-side javascript timer instead
you can not use a server-side timer for this

411996
postgresql	mysql
enterprisedb is a company that provides supported commercial versions of postgresql with some value-added software
mysql 5.x has a feature set that supports a reasonable cross section of capabilities but it is not as feature-rich as postgresql

412091
postgresql	mysql
for any application that wants to use an open source database the hands-down answer is postgresql
it s a lot more enterprise-ready than mysql not to mention that it follows the sql standard a lot better

412589
pthreads	fork
i m assuming you re working on a mac application so the links are to apple s documentation for these functions but they re all pthreads so you should be to use them on any posix-compliant system
fork exec and wait should work if you re not really looking for a objective-c specific way

413093
equals	icomparable
the system.object class equals and gethashcode - not all classes are comparable or hashable should be moved to an interface
iequatable or icomparable or similar comes to mind

414143
vsto	add-in
requires code-access security on installation vsto 3 - can only be used for excel 2007 add-in
does not require code-access security excel 2003 - can install add-in for all users or per-user

415444
bash	zsh
bash complicates this in that .bashrc is only read by a shell that s both interactive and non-login so you ll find most people end up telling their .bash_profile to also read .bashrc with something like other shells behave differently - eg with zsh .zshrc is always read for an interactive shell whether it s a login one or not
the manual page for bash explains the circumstances under which each file is read

416917
boost	allocator
replacing your containers with boost containers is not a good idea
the work to make appropriate custom allocator wouldn t be that bad but you d be violating the spirit of your allocate at startup rule

417126
profiler	perf
for instance if your application hits a database and the disk is slow causing queries to take longer that might not be apparent in a profiler since the application will be running slower in general
for the client side if your app does not require administrative access on install i might make perf counters part of a diagnostics mode since installing them requires admin access

417454
equals	gethashcode
here s my set of tuples they re autogenerated by a python script so i ve perhaps gone a bit overboard link to subversion repository you ll need a username password they re both guest they are based on inheritance but will not compare equals to even if they happen to have the same values for the two first members
they also implement gethashcode and tostring and so forth and lots of smallish helper methods

418080
uilabel	nsstring
if the text fields are not directly editable by the user you may want to use uilabel instead which is basically just a non-editable text field and which also has a read write text property
uitextfield objects have a text property of type nsstring that can be read and written

418903
config	ini
here s a piece of code that probably does the job disclaimer i don t know anything about the config format for kerberos the code is based on what you posted here
edit parsing the ini format is not difficult either

419869
freebsd	linux
not really a comparison but here are what big projects are using centralized vcses subversion apache gcc ruby mplayer zope plone xiph freebsd webkit .
cvs cvs distributed vcses git linux kernel kde perl ruby on rails android wine fedora x.org mediawiki django vlc mono gnome samba cups gnupg emacs elpa.

420240
equals	compareto
use case contexts comparable interface the equals method and and operators test for equality inequality but do not provide a way to test for relative values
some classes eg string and other classes with a natural ordering implement the interface which defines a compareto method

420251
comparator	comparable
if you are implementing your own classes which you know you want to compare at some stage you may have them implement the comparable interface and implement the comparator method accordingly
if you are using some classes from an api which do not implement the comparable interface but you still want to compare them

421386
union	distinct
a union can be deceptive with respect to result set ordering because a database will sometimes use a sort method to provide the distinct that is implicit in union which makes it look like the rows are deliberately ordered -- this doesn t apply to union all for which there is no implicit distinct of course
however there are algorithms for the implicit distinct such as oracle s hash method in 10g+ for which no ordering will be applied

422019
union	distinct
you can get a list of rows with the team_id and whether or not the game was played at home or away select case ha.home when 0 then g.away_team_id else g.home_team_id end as team_id case ha.home when 0 then 0 else 1 end as home_games case ha.home when 0 then 1 else 0 end as away_games from game as g select 0 as home union select 1 as home as ha from there you can simply sum up the games at home and away for each team select t.team_id sum t.home_games as home_games sum t.away_games as away_games from select case ha.home when 0 then g.away_team_id else g.home_team_id end as team_id case ha.home when 0 then 0 else 1 end as home_games case ha.home when 0 then 1 else 0 end as away_games from game as g select 0 as home union select 1 as home as ha as t group by t.team_id this will result in a single table scan
if you want the distinct list of teams you have to select from the game table twice unioning the home and the away teams theoretically one team could play all its games on the road or at home if you have logic that prevents that then you could adjust this query select home_team_id as team_id from game union select away_team_id as team_id from game the union operator will make sure you only get distinct elements in the return set unless you use union all from there you can use left outer joins to aggregate your data if you want to reduce your table scans even further the above will produce four you can add more code but it will cost you

422511
kerberos	ntlm
from my experience kerberos is more of a prefered method but i have not worked with it much so unfortunately i don t have much advise as far as that goes
on a side note i recall reading somewhere that the jre also has ways of tying into ntlm on your web server in order to obtain identity information for the authenticated user

422849
implements	extends
and since you want to avoid code duplication the symmetric operators can be implements in terms of the compound assignment ones as in your code example although convention recommends making the temporary inside the function
the big thing to consider when writing any operator is that member operators do not undergo conversions on the left parameter this is because conversion never applies to this for member functions and this extends to operators

423284
udp	tcp
just a heads up i would recommend first working with tcp rather than udp
udp doesn t automatically redeliver lost packets like tcp so it will add another element to the equation that will probably just confuse you as you re just starting out

424827
centos	linux
i couldn t stand to use rhel centos without it
fedora generates missing but compatible packages for rhel and they host them in a repository called epel extra packages for enterprise linux

425058
tiff	png
lzw-compressed tiff always wins hand over jpeg both in viewable quality and file size i think because tiff can take advantages of rle encoding for whitespace
i m not sure whether png can do this too or whether rle can be extended for multicolor images not just black white

427015
cdr	cons
what a future destructive function does setf cdr though is not the responsibility of the first non-destructive function
you have to think of lists in terms of cons cells

427737
stringbuilder	stringwriter
unfortunately stringwriter doesn t let you specify the encoding directly so you need a class like this this question is similar but not quite a duplicate. edit to answer the comment pass the stringwriterwithencoding to xmlwriter.create instead of the stringbuilder then call tostring on it at the end
you need to use a stringwriter with the appropriate encoding

430451
division	addition
for example addition is closed over the integers but division isn t 4 2 is integral but 5 2 isn t
so addition of integers is somehow complete in a sense that division isn t

430476
base	fractions
for convenience and because of some information-theoretic considerations i m not going to go into we usually express that as a number of bits which is lg n k where lg denotes the logarithm base 2
because we re used to thinking of bits as discrete things we actually usually take the ceiling of that number ie the least integer greater than lg n k but in fact the fractions value is perfectly legitimate

430810
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this works on the original case-insensitive file system but not on the case-sensitive system
thus i would suggest that you avoid depending on whether the file system is case-sensitive or not if you can

432214
equals	gethashcode
i prefer not to override equals just to enable testing
don t forget that if you do override equals you really should override gethashcode also or you may get unexpected results if you are using your objects in a dictionary for example

434740
floating-point	fixed-point
you can learn more about floating point comparisons here what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic
also when processing currency there is no reason you cannot simply store an integer representing cents instead of dollars so that you effectively have a fixed-point representation

435556
queue	fifo
in particular you can set each asp.net application pool with a max number of queue requests and max worker processes
each process has multiple threads up to a maximum not configurable afaik i may be wrong and incoming requests are processed on a fifo basis

435605
boost	stl
boost is full of great code you can t help but learn from
maybe not the sort of tip you were looking for but i have to say that my experience after a few years of moving from c++ stl to c++ boost stl is that i now spend a lot less time in gdb than i used to

435605
boost	stl
maybe not the sort of tip you were looking for but i have to say that my experience after a few years of moving from c++ stl to c++ boost stl is that i now spend a lot less time in gdb than i used to
i put this down to a number of things boost smart pointers particularly shared pointer and the pointer containers when performance is needed

435831
vb.net	vb6
if costs are a constraint you could try this there is a wizard in visual studio that will attempt to upgrade vb6 to vb.net
it s not 100 accurate and you will have to write code for things vb.net does not support such as control arrays etc

436114
spaces	linefeed
note that a single spaces is not enough though perhaps multiple spaces would help i don t know.
you can also insert a tab character at the end of the line just before the cr linefeed

439146
cvs	svn
i ve never really been a cvs user so i do not know what common use-cases the solved wanted to... by using check-out hooks actually i haven t known them
svn provides pre-commit and post-commit hooks among some others which should be able to do whatever one wants to be done per-change on the source

439925
equals	icomparable
unless you re using a dictionary which actually sorts the keys you should be more interested in and - you don t need to be able to say that one object is greater or less than another just whether or not they re equals and what one object s hash code is in a manner consistent with equals
implementing iequatable is like implementing icomparable - it means that an object can compare itself with another object of the specified type usually the same type

441809
nunit	mstest
mstest is essentially nunit slightly reworked with a few new features such as assembly setup and teardown not just fixture and test level and missing some of the best bits such as the new 2.4 constraint syntax
nunit is more mature and there is more support for it from other vendors

442181
postgresql	mysql
in-query variable modification doesn t work in postgresql for instance this will work in mysql but not in postgresql i haven t tested this recently maybe it does work now. set a 1 select id a a+1 from some_table
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

443397
cassini	iis
i d imagine the stack is immense though i would expect cassini to replicate iis as closely as possible
it s surprising that something that runs in vs wouldn t run in iis and i d even consider filing a vs bug with microsoft since it seems that the whole point of cassini is to replicate the functionality of iis and provide an ideal debugging environment since any web projects you write in vs will inherently be deployed against iis

444369
opera	firefox
for best results use opera 9.2x- not 9.5+ safari or konqueror on this page
it partially works in firefox nested functions are not tidied meaning that most scripts you want to tidy still end up unreadable and fails to reformat code in ie and icab 3-

445001
postgresql	mysql
standard sql specifies this optional syntax for insert this is legal sql syntax supported for example by microsoft sql server postgresql and sqlite but not by oracle ibm db2 or mysql
mysql supports other syntax that achieve the same result in hibernate you should configure the sql dialect properly and it s up to hibernate to generate valid sql for the target rdbms brand

445325
mvp	presenter
the conclusion that i ve very recently come to is that in many cases it might be impossible to apply the mvp pattern at both the window and user control levels without breaking the pattern
my thought on it is that the user control is part of the view implementation and the presenter should not know what is going on inside the view implementation which means that the window-level presenter by extension should not know about the user control s presenter and hence there should be no communication between them including instantiation of the latter by the former

450703
cvs	svn
i already do through svn hg git and cvs
as long as you can make others scm ignore eachothers through a .cvsignore .hgignore kind of file or make them cooperate like git svn i do not see why you should not be able to do that

450746
sudo	passwd
i d advise in looking at sudo 1 instead
well the best way to do that would be a setuid-root binary that ask for the passwd then execute whatever command is needed but it requires knowledge you say not to possess

451130
coalesce	isnull
suggests to select where is null and build from here db2 - coalesce
sql server isnull or coalesce sybase isnull function postgres i couldn t find one though haven t fully checked

453721
punctuation	words
so it depends which category the screen reader puts the ellipses character into which punctuation setting the user has selected and what action the user is taking
for example in the jaws for windows screen reader www.freedomscientific.com the ellipses isn t read when reading the document but is read when navigating by letter or words

453751
kerberos	ntlm
there are 3 authentication protocols that can be used to perform authentication between java and active directory on linux or any other platform and these are not just specific to http services kerberos - kerberos provides single sign-on sso and delegation but web servers also need spnego support to accept sso through ie
ntlm - ntlm supports sso through ie and other browsers if they are properly configured

453751
kerberos	ntlm
first authentication between two windows machines favors kerberos because servers do not need to communicate with the dc and clients can cache kerberos tickets which reduces load on the dcs and because kerberos supports delegation
but if the authenticating parties do not both have domain accounts or if the client cannot communicate with the dc ntlm is required

453751
kerberos	ldap
iwa is a simple term that basically means kerberos or ntlm or spnego to negotiate kerberos or ntlm
using an ldap bind as a way to validate credentials is not efficient and requires ssl

453751
kerberos	ntlm
the sun implementation of kerberos has been a comedy of errors over the years so based on sun s track record in this area i wouldn t make any promises about their spengo implementation until you have that bird in hand
for ntlm there is a free oss project called jcifs that has an ntlm http authentication servlet filter

459194
selecteditem	selectedindex
the selecteditem property can only be read. using the selectedtext and selectedvalue properties will change the text and value not which one is selected
you are gonna want to use the selectedindex attribute

459381
scheme	racket
it may not be as fast as sbcl but it does have excellent libraries and documentation as well as an integrated environment that s designed to get you developing and running scheme programs right out of the gate
what i really like about racket s ide racket is what you don t have to do you don t have to learn emacs you don t have to learn slime you don t have to worry about hunting down third-party libraries as virtually all libraries meant for racket can be found in packages

460764
profiling	instrumentation
the amount of overhead depends - if the sampling frequency is set to high values then the profiling itself can contribute significantly to the performance being reported
instrumentation vs sampling it is not like one is better than the other approach

461778
super	implements
it s not super safe but gives much shorter urls than for instance sha256 and also it s completely collision free
i thought about a similar problem some time ago and ended up implements blowfish in the url

462389
bazaar	svn
there are ways around this but with git bazaar mercurial this simply doesn t happen - they realize whether the commits have already been merged because they id each commit across the merging paths it takes
svn s merging capabilities are decent and the simple merging scenarios work fine - release branch and trunk where trunk tracks the commits on the rb

462486
equals	gethashcode
from msdn if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

462486
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

462567
equals	gethashcode
msdn a hash function must have the following properties if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

462567
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

464096
kerberos	ntlm
note that kerberos can only be used if both the server and client have accounts in the target domain and the client can communicate with the domain controller sufficiently to acquire a kerberos ticket
if these conditions are not satisfied the ntlm ssp is used directly

464605
fastcgi	scgi
since fastcgi scgi and wsgi are all based on the cgi specs django developpers choosed to stick to this convention fwiw the modpythonrequest class do the same rewrite for consistency
so it seems that your problem is that something in the cherokee scgi chain doesn t rewrite the headers correctly

465871
actionscript	mxml
there is a prototype of an actionscript 3 version but it is not even in beta yet and i admit that i haven t had the time to test it
i haven t found anything similar for xml let alone mxml

466397
cvs	svn
you should leave cvs
cvs is old and not very fast in terms of branching tagging branch tag creation depends linearly on number of files in a project you should think of your branching strategy first do you want to have a stable trunk feature branches developer branches unstable trunk release branches platform branches this heavily depends on your project and development philosophy if you want to use svn you really have to think of your repository layout because nearly all softwareprojects are module-based and you should find a structure in which you can easily tag all needed modules

466397
cvs	svn

svn with its folderbased approach of branches tags is not easy to achieve this requirement

467363
backtracking	greedy
but although spirit will backtracking it won t backtracking to the middle of what a sub-parser would otherwise greedy match
it will backtracking to the next choice point but your grammar doesn t have any

470102
google-chrome	firefox
speedwise you re not going to find significant gains choosing one over the other unless you re doing specific tasks that play towards their strengths look at the range in benchmarking for instance some google tests have google-chrome hundreds of times faster where as others have firefox beating google-chrome
ideally you d want it to be agnostic but if you had to choose one though i would go with firefox as it s a more mature browser

472222
freebsd	linux
if you are going to deploy on freebsd then it might make sense to also run it locally at least in a virtual machine
browser testing of course is a different issue. do keep in mind that while all development tools you can run on bsd are also available on linux the opposite is certainly not true especially since linux has gained more commercial traction

472312
cpython	ironpython
are always integrated in cpython first and you have to wait until they are implemented in ironpython
licensing some people argue this is a timebomb nobody knows how the licensing of ironpython mono might change in near future extensions one of the strengths of python are the thousands of extensions which are all usable by cpython as you mentioned mathematical problems numpy might be a suitable fast package for you which might not run as expected under ironpython although ironclad especially under windows you have a native gui-toolkit with wxpython which also looks great under several other platforms and there are pyqt and a lot of other toolkits

473009
jar	war
you need to ensure that the cxf jar is in the web-inf lib directory of your war
so in fact sticking the cxf jar in web-inf lib isn t going to work

473503
super	self
it also looks like you have a bug in this method you are essentially discarding the results from super init while it may not be a problem in this instance it could cause serious problems in others
you should always structure you init methods like this if you are not going to return self from an init method for instance it is a factory or something odd like that you should remember to release self

473918
tiff	png
quicktime should work but keep in mind that tiff files are usually not optimized for size and are often much larger than jpeg resp
png renderings of the same image

475953
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
they also provide alternative methods for deploying your python applications if for some reason you find yourself in a situation like silverlight where distributing the cpython implementation with your application is not appropriate
i can t say anything about ironruby but most python implementations like ironpython jython and pypy try to be as true to the cpython implementation as possible

476412
stateless	stateful
but i can say learning c# for web development particularly if you don t already sort of grok oo can be daunting -- mainly because oo is so much about creating and managing state and statefulness and the web is inherently stateless
believe it or not i learned more about oo writing ajax apps with javascript and flex apps in actionscript -- building stateful clients -- than i ever did trying to force c# into my brain because ajax apps and flex apps force you to think about things in terms of state

476567
postgresql	mysql
however postgresql until recently was unix-based and i ve never found it particularly reliable installing on windows
personally i would not recommend mysql for your scenario - although the latest edition can finally be described as a rdbms having evolved from what really was a collection of flat files with a limited sql query interface it s peculiarities probably mitigate against it s use as a learning tool unless you are actually focused on mysql

476921
cpython	ironpython
string concatenation + has an optimized implementation on cpython
but this may not be the case on other architectures like jython or ironpython

478619
division	multiplication
rounding down is implicit for integer division and as such does not require compensation
if you re using a lot of these on a relatively slow platform you may eliminate the multiplication by using a variant of t m + n - 1

480496
implements	extends
you can implements this without too much difficulty using the vistor pattern
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard

480496
implements	extends
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard
some languages implements this ability right out of the box

482703
division	subtract
here s an excerpt you cannot synthesize a general n-bit m-bit division operation using the div and idiv instructions
such an operation must be performed using a sequence of shift and subtract instructions and is extremely messy

484517
google-chrome	firefox
i was not able to duplicate it in webkit-based browsers google-chrome and safari
antonio i m afraid that the problem is in firefox it self

484538
xslt	xquery
for example a left outer join between suppliers and parts might return information about suppliers that have no matching parts. do note that xquery does not have a standard document function it is an xslt function and instead has the doc function which is part of the xquery 1.0 and xpath 2.0 functions and operators
there are at least two errors in the answer by chris xquery is case sensitive -- the capitalised keywords used in chris example will not be allowed by a conforming xquery processor

484619
implements	extends
say for instance i have w extends x a implements w b extends a c extends b implements y d extends c implements z suppose i am processing an instance of d the object d
computing d instanceof x requires to take d.getclass loop through the interfaces it implements to know whether one is to x and if not do so again recursively for all of their ancestors... in our case if you do a breadth first exploration of that tree yields at least 8 comparisons supposing y and z don t extends anything.

484745
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is kind of the opposite -- it s a database researcher s favorite playground which means it has a dozen different join strategies storage engines advanced optional packages and all kinds of stuff
it s slower than mysql when doing things mysql does well and blows it out of the water when doing things mysql just doesn t know how to do see above with hash joins

486094
erlang	lisp
haskell erlang and scala are not homoiconic clojure is
clojure s fundamental differentiators are it has a software transactional memory system which makes shared state concurrent programming easier it is a lisp unlike haskell or erlang therefore all code is data which allows you to make what look likes changes to the language itself at runtime through the macro system it runs on the jvm which means you have direct access to all java libraries clojure data structures implement java interfaces such as collection list map runnable and callable where appropriate

486569
google-chrome	safari
if it s worth anything google-chrome doesn t set the cookies either if you use the appending method but if you have a hidden with the same source google-chrome works in addition to the rest of the browsers except again safari
from the safari developer faq safari ships with a conservative cookie policy which limits cookie writes to only the pages chosen navigated to by the user

487489
multiplying	division
matrix scalar multiplication you can multiplying a matrix with a scalar
in that case each cell is multiplied with that number inverting a matrix matrix division is not possible but you can create an inversion of a matrix such that a x a-inv is a matrix with all zero s except for that main diagonal inverting a matrix can only be done with square matrices and it is a complex job that does not neccesary have a result

488151
implements	extends
so i made my own voila all my objects regardless of implements type and whether or not i wrote it or someone else did now have a foreach method by adding an appropriate using statement in my code
some of the best uses i had for extension methods is the ability to extends functionality on third party objects whether commercial or internal to my company but managed by a separate group which in many cases will be marked as sealed

488309
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
what many folks probably don t know is that this rule is already supported in opera 9.5 shipping versions of safari for the mac windows and iphone os and is promised for firefox 3.1. and well as ie6 and later
sadly while support for font-face was hinted at for opera 9.5 and firefox 3.1 see my comments at #4 below this is in fact not the case sadly

493199
bazaar	svn
a very important missing thing in bazaar is cp
you cannot have multiple files sharing the same history as you have in svn see for example here and here

493868
queue	fifo
clearing the queue can be seen as a violation of the fifo concept
consequently if you need to clear your queue maybe it s not really a queue and you should better use a deque

495290
asterisk	ivr
freepbx makes it really easy to set up an ivr - got a decent web-based front end and supports some cool asterisk tools out of the box
edit freepbx isn t asterisk - it is a pretty interface that generates the configs for you

497148
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the database default collation determines whether objects within the database are treated in a case-sensitive way in queries - this applies to all object name tables columns etc
if your application code comes from a case-insensitive collation database it may not run on a case-sensitive collation database if a object is misreferenced you would get a message when you attempted to run the statement or create the stored procedure or in a stored-proc architecture you would catch all these pretty quickly unless you had a significant amount of dynamic sql

497230
actionscript	mxml
you can access the property in actionscript only
it is not settable in mxml

497967
quicksort	mergesort
i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway
i would note that the choice of pivot values is a monster factor -- my initial version used a random node as the pivot and when i refined it a bit to take a mean of two random nodes the exectution time for 1000000 records went from over 4 minutes to less than 10 seconds putting it right on par with mergesort

497967
quicksort	mergesort
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great
this is because ties or already sorted segments streamline straight through mergesort

501191
nfa	dfa
then convert the nfa into a dfa
if the start state is not the accept state and the accept state is reachable then the two regular expressions are not orthogonal. since their intersection is non-empty. there are know procedures for converting a regular expression to a dfa and converting an nfa to a dfa

502213
comparator	comparable
obviously invoking comparator on null will raise a nullpointerexception
as its mentioned in java docs that all elements in the array must be mutually comparable that is e1.compareto e2 must not throw a classcastexception for any elements e1 and e2 in the array of course here its not about classcastexception but invocation of comapreto is obvious

504058
sdl	xlib
sdl is not a hardware interface in its own right but rather a portability layer that works well on top of many other display layers including directx opengl directfb and xlib so you get very good portability and its a very thin layer on top of those technologies so you pay very little performance overhead on top of those
if you re trying to dump pixels to screen you ll probably want to make use of sdl s surface facuility

504412
implements	extends
it has examples of how to implements the majority if not all of the adobe flex components
if you want something more complex you may need to extends legend and create you own component

506463
vb.net	vb6
if you aren t aware of this then your visual basic arrays end up being 1 element longer than you expected vb.net c# the reason why microsoft designed vb.net to size arrays based on upper bound rather than array length is to make it easier to port code from vb6 to vb.net
the initial index of a vb6 array is 1 unless you declare option base 0

509721
division	modulo
by that i presume you mean doing a regular floating point division
modulo is performed in the integer context not fractional remainders are integers

509836
division	modulo
as i expected 1 2 0.5 etc . that s the result of division
not modulo

511012
firefox	safari
this solution works using css in firefox and the other gecko browsers and css expressions in ie
the header and footer do not stay fixed in opera or safari chrome but the whole table is scrollable so it is usable

512358
fancybox	thickbox
fancybox is also another option
works similarly to thickbox edit it appears after some playing around that the plugin does not natively support closing the fancybox through an child iframe element

512358
fancybox	thickbox
works similarly to thickbox edit it appears after some playing around that the plugin does not natively support closing the fancybox through an child iframe element
i think that this is certainly achievable with a little effort i started hacking together something here although i stress that this was simply a poc and does not work as the button within the iframe removes the fancybox div wrapper from the dom and therefore does not display when you click the google image again .i am wondering however if an iframe is the right lines to go down

512542
opera	safari	firefox	safari
tested on ie6 and up firefox 2 opera 8 netscape 9 seamonkey and safari
unfortunately on safari it does not work in combination with the onfocus event

513052
uiview	subviews
it shouldn t be much harder to place any number of buttons according to the parent uiview s bounds and orientation
august i took your advice and added the uibuttons as subviews of the uiview rather than look further into the uitable

513542
komodo	scite
komodo edit seems to be most similar to ultra edit
scite is something i ve used before and lua is not that difficult

513964
translation	localization
to expand correct on the first answer above it s not translation that string.format would help with actually
what string.format will help with is when you re printing a date time or a numeric format etc where there are localization l10n differences ie some countries will print 04feb2009 and others will print feb042009

514695
lisp	scheme
this is something languages like lisp are really good at
it is much easier to do in a language that supports real macros not c++ macros but rather ones that can manipulate the code they output such as ruby lisp scheme etc

515088
xna	slimdx
the xna game studio stuff is focused around solving game centric problems though i would question any poster that says the performance of the xna game studio stuff is any worse than managed direct x without seeing some decent metrics
an independent group outside of ms have created a project called slimdx - if you are writing an application rather than a game which i expect you are not by the other questions then that might be worth considering

515501
union	distinct
so there is no need to use select distinct combined with a union
probably better for performance to not use distinct too

515998
junit	testng
you should be able to collate the xml files from the two runs and combine it into a single html report using the ant junit report task
if you aren t happy with the output you get from this it could be because testng organises its junit xml output oddly

515998
junit	testng
if you aren t happy with the output you get from this it could be because testng organises its junit xml output oddly
you get better results in my opinion if you use the junitxmlreporter from my reportng project and run junit report on that

518902
emacs	textmate
textmate works like emacs but has fewer features
i try not to use my mouse so the eyecandy and os x integration don t buy me much. netbeans and eclipse are nice for managing java projects but on the rare occasion that i have to do java i still find emacs easier to use

518902
vim	emacs
no viper is not a vim clone
it s emacs with modal editing. anyway jmho

519090
cvs	svn
an important thing to remember with svn compared to other version control systems like cvs or git is that svn doesn t really have a concept or branching or tagging
as far as svn is concerned it s all just a bunch of folders and files

519191
emacs	jedit
emacs is all right
it doesn t quite do everything i like jedit to do but i m not interested in spending time writing macros and plug-ins for my editor - i like getting stuff done instead

522572
actionscript	mxml
take this example of two identical login panels in mxml and in actionscript seven lines of code vs 62
that s a pretty simple example but hopefully you can see how you might benefit by laying out many portions of your application in mxml whether you re using the design mode in flex builder or not

525661
jsf	seam
seam combines jsf and hibernate
what is it providing for you that the seam stack doesn t

525745
des	aes
des is extremely easy to crack nowadays
please use aes or at least 3des if aes is not available

527416
nginx	lighttpd
i d recommend switching to nginx or apache+mod_wsgi
i don t use lighttpd or flup so this isn t an answer as much as it is hints

528363
super	implements
before i learned about design patterns i was pretty much in the dark about how to use objects effectively other than as a super type structure
remember that implements interfaces is just as important if not more important than inheritance

528848
uiview	calayer
basically the presentation layer is core animation s closest approximation to where the actual layer is at any given time so its frame is the frame of your uiview at that instant
i m not sure that touch events will find their way to the view as it s moving across the screen so if you need to have the uiimageview respond to touches you may need to replace it with a calayer insert it as a sublayer of your main uiview s layer and call the hittest method on the presentationlayer of that main layer

528908
decimal	ieee
all have their limitations and this includes both the standard ieee floating point and signed decimal
the ieee floating point is more accurate per bit used but that doesn t matter here

529344
profiling	instrumentation
now profiling
the general rule is that if you don t tell aqtime to instrumentation the routine it will not be instrumented

530759
lisp	prolog
some older lisp do not
plain vanilla prolog does not support objects and i can t name a logic oriented language that does i don t do logic oriented programming it is on my list of things to do when i have some copious spare time

531083
swt	swing
i ve developed both with swing and with swt but not with qt
with swing your code will be automatically cross-platform

531083
swt	swing
familiar look-and-feel. the disadvantage of swt is that it uses all native widgets
not as many widgets as swing has whether this is more an advantage or a disadvantage depends on what you are doing and what your goals are

531083
swt	swing
however there are a few things that swt does that swing doesn t do as well or at all -- such as launch the system s native browser and execute javascript scripts in this browser
if you consider swt consider it carefully

531083
swt	swing
with swt there is a smaller community supporting it
with swing a larger community but this does not mean that fixes will get more quickly into a development release

535826
implements	extends
with poco you have to use the runnable interface and the usage is close to what you would get with java threads if you implements runnable not extends thread boost threads recommended are a little different
instead of implementing extends an interface it depends on the operator being defined

535933
apache	nginx
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content
i typically use nginx as a frontend and apache passenger as a backend

537334
dxcore	coderush
dxcore is the framework on which refactorpro and coderush are built which should give you an idea of what sort of graphical capability they are capable of
that said you do not need either of these tools to use the dxcore

537920
prepare	execute
i m not familiar with pdo but i d bet it provides a mechanism for running parametrized queries with the values given in the same function call if you don t want to prepare then run as a separate step
something like or similar. also if you look under the hood most db abstraction layers will prepare the query then run it even if you just tell it to execute a static sql statement

538931
vmware	virtualbox
trying to figure out what vmware products i was allowed to use and how i was allowed to use them would have taken more time than getting everything set up in virtualbox did
sorry it doesn t really answer your question but i personally chose to use virtualbox instead of vmware partially because of the exact issue you ve run into

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
in expression-blend 2 the toolbox is called the asset library and it can be accessed by left clicking the double right arrow at the bottom of the list on the left of the screen once the asset library is open a good tip if you can t find the control you are looking for you mention you cannot find the button control in expression-blend 2 is to type it s name in the search area at the top left or click the show all... checkbox as shown above
this blog post is a good place to start for a first look at using expression-blend with silverlight 2 with plenty of screenshots

540108
memcpy	memmove
be careful not to use memcpy - its behaviour is undefined in this situation since source and destination usually overlap
use memmove to move the tail then put 0 at the new end position

540373
postgresql	mysql
you might like to look at the chapters in the mysql manual and postgresql manual on indexing
do not worry about what mysql is doing internally to locate records quickly

540486
daemons	systemd
it goes on to describe when a program exits in execution - program exit 12.8 a program terminates all its activity and exits when one of two things happens all the threads that are not daemons threads terminate
some thread invokes the exit method of class runtime or class systemd and the exit operation is not forbidden by the security manager

541075
tapestry	wicket
tapestry doesn t separate markup and code properly in a manner which could be easily validated between the two which will cause problems in the future
my opinions are quite heavily biased towards wicket because i ve been using it for a while after tripping over jsp mines far too many times

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
in some cases maybe xslt is not right for the job you could then consider using code to generate xsl-fo
i have used xsl-fo a lot professionally both from java and .net environments. it indeed gives you total control over the printed document pdf. i myself have generated very complex pdf s ready for mass-printing brochures and papers . they included complex structures like text floated in columns graphs using embedded svg and tables

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo is definitely way to go when generating pdf s or printed documents
edit i only answered part of your question i guess. xsl-fo is not natively supported within any common browser as of today. i don t think there any plans for implementing native support in ie i d be very surprised if it was. xsl-fo is just xml so you won t need any further xsl-fo support by the .net framework then as of today. typically xsl-fo is generated using xslt and then the transformation result is passed to a formatting objects processor such as fop. in some cases xslt at least not 1.0 is not enough if your xsl-fo document is very complex

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
edit i only answered part of your question i guess. xsl-fo is not natively supported within any common browser as of today. i don t think there any plans for implementing native support in ie i d be very surprised if it was. xsl-fo is just xml so you won t need any further xsl-fo support by the .net framework then as of today. typically xsl-fo is generated using xslt and then the transformation result is passed to a formatting objects processor such as fop. in some cases xslt at least not 1.0 is not enough if your xsl-fo document is very complex
you might then consider using xslt extensions written in languages such as c#

541500
implements	extends
edit this originally said implements an interface requires less resources. as well but you need to create a new thread instance either way so this was wrong
i m not an expert but i can think of one reason to implement runnable instead of extends thread java only supports single inheritance so you can only extends one class

542257
ssl	https
the telnet client is not going to know to send a properly constructed request to initiate an https handshake so i imagine the ssl secured server is just waiting for more data
the telnet client is certainly not going to know what to do with the response from a ssl secured server it s certainly not going to prompt you for data to send along

542257
ssl	https
the telnet client is certainly not going to know what to do with the response from a ssl secured server it s certainly not going to prompt you for data to send along
communication can only happen once the https handshake has completed

543581
actionscript	mxml
good to know is that mxml is compiled down to actionscript so it is perfectly possible to write everything in actionscript and avoid mxml although i wouldn t recommend that in most cases
it is just a layer on top of actionscript

543905
cvs	svn
you can almost entirely scrub the my usb flash drive was lost broken stolen excuse for students who do not hand in assignments since students should be doing regular commits to the repository in some subjects marks are allocated to correct use of cvs
the downside is that you cannot assume that students will know how to use cvs svn at the beginning of the semester

543905
cvs	svn
the downside is that you cannot assume that students will know how to use cvs svn at the beginning of the semester
most subjects here dedicate the first week s practical to a cvs tutorial so people can make sure that a the sysadmins have setup their accounts correctly and b that they can add and commit files correctly

546316
vbscript	jscript
you can call vbscript from jscript and the other way around
try to do what you want to do in a cmd-file it that doesn t cut it use windows scripting host to call a wsh-file with jscript and or vbscript in it

546316
vbscript	jscript
try to do what you want to do in a cmd-file it that doesn t cut it use windows scripting host to call a wsh-file with jscript and or vbscript in it
if you prefer the jscript-look use that as your primary language and use vbscript for things you copy from the net or cannot find a jscript solution to

546987
union	distinct
that should not be the case if you use union only if you use union all
select distinct ans from select right as ans from answers union select wrong1 as ans from answers union select wrong2 as ans from answers union select wrong3 as ans from answers union select wrong4 as ans from answers as temp the distinct is superfluous because the union will not return rows that are identical for all columns

546987
union	distinct
select distinct ans from select right as ans from answers union select wrong1 as ans from answers union select wrong2 as ans from answers union select wrong3 as ans from answers union select wrong4 as ans from answers as temp the distinct is superfluous because the union will not return rows that are identical for all columns
when you want duplicated or if you know that no duplicates exist use union all for faster performance this will give you a single list containing all the answers

delphi	oxygene
delphi prism aka rem objects oxygene formerly chrome provides the gc version of delphi that those who need it are looking for along with asp.net and wpf silverlight ce with the readability and lack of curly braces of delphi
for those like me for which unicode support isn t a major factor delphi 2007 provides asp.net and vcl.net as well as native win32 support

548779
boost	stl
if there s functionality provided by the stl but not boost concentrate on learning those bits of the stl
it depends entirely on whether you re going to be able to use boost in all your work

548781
boost	stl
mastering all the boost is really hard check with boost for any library that is not available with c++ out of box.like parsing library graph library
first go with stl because that is what you will be using most of the time

548859
boost	stl
if you understand them then moving right on to boost may be of use to you
if not i would start with the stl

548909
boost	stl
boost provides many powerful features is widely used and has a good reputation
most of the things it provides share the same generic-programming concepts with which the stl was designed so in that sense it should not be very confusing

548921
g++	gcc
libstdc++ for that reason is tightly coupled with gcc and code compiled with one version of g++ will in general only work with the libstdc++ from with this or a very similar version of g++
as you will surely notice if you ever try to build a program with gcc 4 with any non-trivial library on your system that was built with gcc 3 this is not just libstdc++

549212
ienumerable	icollection
here s a small function i m using to determine if an object is a collection which will be enumerable as well since icollection is also ienumerable
i ve tried to use a similar technique as darren suggested however just beware that not just collections implement ienumerable

549572
swt	swing
swt could also be an option but so far i ve been happy with swing
people like to bash swing for being old slow and ugly but it s just not true

549817
equals	compareto
linkedlist.contains uses equals so you have to make sure that the method has been implemented correctly
equals should also be consistent with compareto though this is not strictly necessary

550468
multiplying	multiplication
the combination of the them would transform a point from space a to space b hence this is a transformation matrix m_ab now the location of the camera is in space a and so it is not the valid transformation for space b so you need to multiplying this location with the rotation transform
well if you write the 3 dots on a paper you d discover that 3 dots with x y and z is exactly like multiplication with a rotation matrix

551301
vim	emacs
vim does only text editing and that very well without plugins
its up to you if you like emacs or not

551394
emacs	textmate
but this isn t necessarily an argument for emacs specifically
on os x for example textmate is an awesome editor for these tasks

551877
vmware	virtualbox
however there are some hacks that allow installing os x under vmware
it might be also possible to install it under virtualbox or virtual pc although i have not seen specific instructions

553601
stretchblt	bitblt
that is exactly what stretchblt is for and stretchblt compared to any other graphics resizing operation is insanely fast as in most cases it can use the graphics card to accelerate its performance
bitblt will only perform mathmatic operations or xor etc on the individual pixels in question it will not resize the image in any way

555072
implements	extends
the original class would be class myclass object implements isomething def do_something self return foo then imagine interface isomethingelse has a method do_something_else
an adapter could look like this you then would register that adapter with the component registry and you could then use it like this what that gives you is the ability to extends the original class with functionality which the class does not provide directly

555179
ssl	https
that line tells apache to include the ssl variables in the environment for your scripts php
_server https isn t there switched on or not no matter if you re looking at the site via ssl or non-ssl

555179
ssl	https
_server https isn t there switched on or not no matter if you re looking at the site via ssl or non-ssl
for some reason the hosting has chosen to serve all the https requests encrypted but down port 80

556131
serializable	deserialization
option 1 is suited if you can ensure that the client always sends serializable representations of data contracts to the server
however if you need some flexibility in the serialization deserialization logic and not get tightly coupled with datacontracts then option 2 looks good

557079
soappy	suds
soappy has support for attachments on its todo list
suds does not mention the word attachments anywhere

558159
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
just because apache is widely used doesn t mean other products are just optimization
in my experience lighttpd and nginx are easy enough to configure and you can use fcgi bindings for most programming languages

562510
bash	zsh
it works ok when i start it under bash
maybe there s something in your zsh configuration that s mucking it up or it s not sourcing your zsh s startup files

563472
lisp	scheme
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp
lisp s biggest problem is that there s no overriding standard everyone sticks to

565891
division	multiplication
the result in step 3 will be exactly 1000 though so the inexactness of the division isn t important
the inexactness of the multiplication in step 4 is though

567812
wav	caf
the iphone only supports the following codecs amr adaptive multi-rate a speech codec ilbc internet low bitrate codec also a speech codec ima adpcm also known as ima-4 linear pcm µlaw and alaw your wav files may contain audio that is in a different format so even though the iphone supports wav files it might not support your specific wav file
the best option is normally to use the command line program afconvert to convert everything to caf files which is apple s default format

568356
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
when wxhaskell was first announced at the haskell workshop the development of the native haskell api looked extremely promising but was still incomplete
it looks as if the haskellized api for wxhaskell is still being worked on whereas the gtk2hs project doesn t mention this issue at all

568612
ubuntu	linux
i d stick with ubuntu if it was more compatible with windows programs
.net development while in school typically isn t done on a linux distribution

569361
boost	stl
quite frankly for beginners i think boost isn t that well-suited
i think a beginner is better off understanding how the basics work before moving up the food chain using higher level tool libs like boost or even stl

569648
actionscript	mxml
if correct imports are missing java.lang.nullpointerexception missing of a code formatter or automatic get setter but there are solutions with other eclipse plugins like monkey scripts cfeclipse flexformatter flexprettyprintcommand ... sometimes a bit sluggish if background tasks in eclipse are working no package explorer as2 and as3 only - no haxe flashdevelop pros free and open source developed with c# lightweight and snappy best available code assist for actionscript supports all flash languages - as2 as3 haxe auto code for automatic getter setter variables code for event handlers code snippets with integrated snippet editor extendible with plug-ins support for asdoc comments package explorer show classes symbols from a swc file basic refactoring multiple source code folders per project useful plugins ant integration swc creation mini map quick navigate cons only for windows no visual designer for mxml no support of virtual folders files inside the project weak refactoring changing classpaths must be done manually plug-ins often not working in newer versions and many plug-ins are only rarely updated limited support for debugging haxe applications common pros projects for full range of flash apps websites air desktop mobile debugging of fp air apps with breakpoints and stepping debugging with watch windows and locals support for asdoc comments automatic adding of imports and organizing of imports class wizard svg git integration cons no editing of graphics or animation use flash ide for that summary for debugging visual design of mxml forms flash builder for coding as2 as3 haxe projects under windows flashdevelop
flash builder pros better debugging and profiling visual designer for mxml because of eclipse support for other languages eg

569854
floating-point	fixed-point
be aware that this fpu mode rounding is applied to floating-point operations in situations that might not be obvious when thinking in terms of the currency type which is a fixed-point type scaled 64-bit integer
a small imprecision in intermediate floating-point calculations such as 82.000000000000001 will end up rounding up even when the value as currency is anticipated to be 82.00

570495
serializable	deserialization
also the serializable events are covered in programming wcf services 2nd ed by juval lowy in chapter 3 pgs 107-110
i m not sure if you can completely short-circuit deserialization though.

570707
boost	stl
clarification boost did not boost up my ood skills
stl boost is a tool for the job

571801
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
oh and google-chrome
google-chrome still doesn t know what it wants to be safari or firefox

572748
ssms	sqlcmd
you can not automate it in ssms or use an environment variable the code the job the alerts etc all must exist on the server
you can put the scripted trace into a batch file and run it via osql sqlcmd but it has to be invoked manually

573582
required	placeholder
that is our quite simple bind object would not fit into the small buffer and would required operator new to be stored
if the bind object above would use a compressed_pair it can actually reduce its size to 8 bytes or 4 bytes for non-member function pointer often because the placeholder is nothing more than an empty object

574640
profiling	debugging
but in reality you shouldn t normally be running the service from a project s bin folder anyway - the files should be put somewhere project and profiling independent for example under program files
for debugging purposes when it will be in the bin folder you can detect whether it is a service in main and if it is being run interactively just run the service code directly rather than the usual service-start setup

574741
opera	google-chrome
it is tested with ff3 ie7 opera 9.6 and google-chrome 1
but as i said since google-chrome does return the real source code for most functions it isn t useful to test it in that browser

575830
jtable	jlayeredpane
as you say the basic jtable rendering mechanism does not support this a cellrenderer is used to paint a cell or part of a cell as necessary and won t allow repaints it draws on demand
method 1 - jlayeredpane if i needed to do this i would use a jlayeredpane to draw my animated renderers on top of the the jtable

575958
google-chrome	firefox
i consider google-chrome browser to be a great first run experience because it is simple installs nicely and is super fast
for some others especially many reading stackoverflow.com it might be flawed because their expectation is that google-chrome can also seamlessly import their firefox or whatever other plugins which was not part of google-chrome s original features

576667
cpython	ironpython
in addition to that ironpython doesn t have the gil an issue that prevents cpython threads from taking full advantage of multi-core architectures
if you want to code in python and get great threading support you might want to check out ironpython or jython

577436
notepad++	jedit
it seams notepad++ is not capable of highlighting columns
for jedit i found some possibilities but not finished yet the plugin columnruler version 1.0.2 author brad mace but it is shown in all file modes

578733
bash	tcsh
one of your comments betrays that you are not using bash
you re using csh or tcsh

580634
innodb	myisam
for tables with ratios lower than about 5 1 you will probably benefit from innodb because then inserts won t block selects
but if you aren t using transactions you should change innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit to 1 to get performance back over myisam

580881
implements	extends
if you need random access to the values then implements an indexer may be a good idea but i don t see what benefit this would give you without more context on the question
have a read of the liskov substitution principle your collection is a very poor candidate to extends list it is not even a great candidate to implement ilist

581896
freebsd	centos	centos	linux
it may not be a bad first step to deploy into a lx branded zone think freebsd jails or linux vserver for a comparison as the lx branded zones can run linux binaries and are explicitly centos rhel based
other than that opensolaris is a xen dom0 since b77 or something and putting centos rhel into a domu is dead simple if that s an option

582585
portrait	landscape
when users are on devices with hardware keyboards or game pads a la the droid 1-4 xperia play or the nvidia shield forcing portrait can make your app a giant usability hassle especially on the shield
if your app doesn t have an extremely specific use case that would lead to an outright negative experience for supporting other orientations you should probably not force landscape

582585
portrait	landscape
this forces landscape on most tablets and portrait on most phones but i still wouldn t recommend this for most normal apps some users just like to type in the landscape softkeyboard on their phones and many tablet users read in portrait - and you should let them
if you still need to force portrait for some reason sensorportrait may be better than portrait for android 2.3+

582823
google-chrome	safari
for some reason safari runs a combo of border-radius with box-shadow just fine but google-chrome doesn t render the combination correctly
so it would be nice to find a way to detect google-chrome even though it is webkit to disable the combination

583239
sudo	passwd
or you can configure sudo to not need a passwd for etc init.d postfix
sudo configuration via visudo allows nopasswd to allow the command without a passwd

584796
tapestry	struts
i ve used both and i would strongly recommend that you try to keep tapestry from having to deal with struts urls
with struts you can pretty much hand-code the url so it shouldn t be a problem to link to tapestry pages but if you want tapestry to link back to struts urls you may have trouble using it the standard way

587914
xslt	xquery
and the xslt version from .net is 1.0 as well not 2.0 yet
fn lower-case is defined in xquery 1.0 and xpath 2.0

588060
imperative	declarative
t-sql is not designed to be an imperative language
its designed to be declarative

588253
apache	lighttpd
as has been said assuming prefork apache - maxclients max processes at once
if you find you are getting hammered with real traffic and not a mis-configured startservers min maxspareservers there are some other things you can do set up a separate lightweight apache process or lighttpd for your static content

588874
clang	llvm
you can find the llvm clang static analyzer here llvm clang static analyzer
it s not a 100 solution but the llvm clang static analyzer can be a big help in tracking down incorrect manual memory management usage

590309
firefox	safari
ie and firefox fire the onmouseover event just fine
i m doing something similar dragging from the parent doc to drop targets in the iframe and can see the onmouseover events fire for the targets in ie and firefox but not safari

590698
serializable	deserialization
well the serializable shouldn t be a problem the xmlserializer constructor takes a type argument even calling gettype on an instance of a derived class through a method on the abstract base will return the derived types actual type
so in essence as long as you know the proper type upon deserialization then the serializable of the proper type is trivial

591265
exponent	addition
then you need to shift the mantissa to the left and decrement the exponent by as much as it takes to get 0.1e-4
if your addition code is correct and your subtraction isn t the problem is presumably in the two s complement and addition

591900
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve been using codeigniter myself after using cakephp for some time
the main reason for switching was due to performance but cakephp has come a long way in the last few years so that s probably not a valid reason anymore

592292
emacs	aquamacs
a very good emacs for mac os x is aquamacs
there is not much emacs support in mac os x and xcode

592780
ati	nvidia
this issue was not seen on any ati cards where development occurs
just to add what we did to fix this issue we upgraded to the latest nvidia drivers solved the problem

595623
coalesce	isnull
so if it s null then it equals itself and wont filter edit i like marc miller s coalesce example and you could use either and i really shouldn t comment on the performance of one verses the other but.
my gut tells me isnull should win out but have a look at some of the debates on this issue if you have nothing better to do or if performance is really critical in this query

596154
allocator	stl
if users doesn t like the default allocator strategy they can specify one of their own now when the constructor allocates it will use a mycustomallocator instead of the default
here are some details on writing your own stl allocator

597847
northwind	adventureworks
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind
northwind is not the best database due to few new features of analysis and reporting service of sql server 2005

597847
northwind	adventureworks
northwind is not the best database due to few new features of analysis and reporting service of sql server 2005
msdn book on line bol uses the adventureworks in all of their example and it makes it easy to follow up if proper understanding of adventureworks schema is developed

598723
multiplication	modulo
for integers to be a group under multiplication you have to be modulo a prime number
eg z mod 7 2 4 1 so 2 and 4 are each other s inverses for floating point values simple multiplication or addition saturates to + - infinity and there are no values which are the inverses of infinity so either the set is not closed or it lacks invertibility

598723
addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
eg z mod 7 2 4 1 so 2 and 4 are each other s inverses for floating point values simple multiplication or addition saturates to + - infinity and there are no values which are the inverses of infinity so either the set is not closed or it lacks invertibility
if on the other hand you want something similar to integer multiplication modulo a power of 2 then multiplication will do - there are elements without an inverse so it s not a group but it is closed - you always get a floating point value back

599122
base	fractions
using decimal you will have fewer surprises than you will using the base 2 double type
double uses half as much memory as decimal and double will be much faster because of the cpu hardware for many common floating point operations but it cannot represent most base 10 fractions such as 1.05 accurately and has a less accurate 15+ decimal digits of precision

599235
haskell	sml
mutable data structures like arrays and real hash tables are used much less because they don t fit in as well with haskell
sml which is also functional but not lazy can use arrays more naturally than haskell but lists are still more common because they map well to recursive algorithms

601635
coalesce	nvl
the equivalent to the nvl command in hql is the coalesce command
coalesce a b will return a if a is not null otherwise b

601753
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
a consideration is that currently it is slightly easier to get wxhaskell to work natively on mac os x
gtk2hs depends on gtk which does have an implementation using native widgets on mac os x but that implementation is not as easily built as the wxwidgets implementation for mac os x is

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases
it is slightly easier imho to distribute applications based on wxhaskell simply because it has fewer library dependencies

603150
g++	gcc
if you only installed c compiler you would have command gcc but not command g++
g++ is c++ compiler not c compiler

603783
arraylist	treeset
you have to either put all the values into a treeset with a comparator that uses the fileid or put them into an arraylist and sort them with collections.sort again with a comparator that compares the way you want
the treeset method doesn t work if there are any duplicates and it may be overkill since you re not going to be adding things to or removing things from the set

604041
cvs	svn
cvs
it is svn that determines whether a file is conflicted not tortoise

605631
prepare	execute
for more information see this document prepare by kenneth lundin ericsson ab for erlang user conference stockholm november 13 2008
answer depends on the vm which is used 1 non-smp there is one scheduler os thread which execute all erlang processes taken from the pool of runnable processes those who are not blocked by receive 2 smp there are k schedulers os threads k is usually a number of cpu cores which execute erlang processes from the shared process queue

605631
queue	fifo
answer depends on the vm which is used 1 non-smp there is one scheduler os thread which executes all erlang processes taken from the pool of runnable processes those who are not blocked by receive 2 smp there are k schedulers os threads k is usually a number of cpu cores which executes erlang processes from the shared process queue
it is a simple fifo queue with locks to allow simultaneous access from multiple os threads

606476
actionscript	mxml
the mxml and even actionscript is not understood by the flash player
that being said there is a jsp library that you can use for dynamic mxml

608187
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you set up the now loading in viewwillappear but you never see it since by the time viewdidappear completes it s done with the heavy work
i could be wrong but perhaps your problem is that by doing the time-consuming work in viewdidappear you re blocking the main event thread so that the view doesn t update until the work is complete

608207
base	fractions
the key is that excel stores numbers as base 2 floating point numbers
most decimal fractions cannot be represented as base 2 floating point numbers

610260
memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
i d tend to use memcpy if i have already calculated the length although strcpy is usually optimised to work on machine words it feels that you should provide the library with as much information as you can so it can use the most optimal copying mechanism

610288
strcpy	strncpy
the reason why people use strncpy not strcpy is because strings are not always null terminated and it s very easy to overflow the buffer the space you have allocated for the string with strcpy and overwrite some unrelated bit of memory
with strcpy this can happen with strncpy this will never happen

610565
gif	png
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq
for buttons icons logos use png

610597
gif	png
png should be used when you need transparency either 1-bit or alpha transparency lossless compression will work well such as for a chart or logo or computer generated image jpeg should be used when lossless compression will not work well such as a photograph gif should be when png is not available such as on very old software or browsers animation is necessary despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

610597
gif	png
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you need to be careful if you forget to convert to palette mode your png image may be saved in 24 bit color which will take more space

610597
gif	png
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you need to be careful if you forget to convert to palette mode your png image may be saved in 24 bit color which will take more space
png modes include this is just a small subset palette colour of 2 to 256 colors like gif palette colour of 2 to 256 colors with transparent color like gif true color 24 bit color true color with alpha channel 24 bit color + 8 bit alpha transparency for best compression in png for the web use a palette mode

610769
gif	png
png should be used when you need transparency either 1-bit or alpha transparency lossless compression will work well such as for a chart or logo or computer generated image jpeg should be used when lossless compression will not work well such as a photograph full color is needed gif should be when png is not available such as on very old software or browsers animation is necessary despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

610769
gif	png
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you may run into problems on the web

610769
gif	png
if you find that your png files with transparency aren t working properly in ie6 while your gif files are then you are using 24 bit color + alpha transparency in png and palette mode with a transparent color with gif
you will have to make sure that you convert your png into a paletted color mode with a transparent color

611158
portrait	landscape
anyway i found portrait mode not really better when coding and only with my old 17 widescreen in portrait mode was viewing editing documents better
with two large screens in landscape mode you can put two pages on a screen when viewing documents and have many tool windows open at both sides of the ide s text editor

611821
division	subtract
to do division shift the divisor until it s not quite bigger than the dividend
subtract shifted divisor from dividend and increment the result with appropriate shift

612285
serializable	deserialization
it will work if nothing else happens to the element but if requested to serializable the name is not serializable
so when i said that forced a serialization which lost the name so it was not recovered upon deserialization

612668
super	self
incidentally unless you are planning on some in-depth multiple inheritance work and again now may not be the time for that you probably don t even need to use super
the usual iplugin.__init__ self ... method of calling a known superclass is the straightforward thing to do

613148
collabnet	svn
it doesn t require a bunch of registration information like the collabnet one does
i use slik svn

617234
delphi	oxygene
unfortunately it isn t backwardly compatible with delphi code
rem objects the actual owners of the prism compiler formerly known as oxygene has made available a utility application that attempts to convert the syntax differences automatically but i haven t tried it on anything yet

617482
prng	random
if instead of simple sequential scan you use some function i just have to follow the function which if it is difficult enough to follow it turns into a prng in it s own right
if you are not concerned about the cryptographic strength of your generator then there are much more compact ways of generating random numbers

617895
uiview	subviews
to do this a scrollview has a few extra properties over a normal uiview - but it is like a uiview in one imprtant respect it doesn t render any content directly itself
you need to add a subviews to draw your text

618563
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
the answer to my question then is no monodevelop on windows is not ready for normal use
i guess i ll make do with visual studio and sharpdevelop on windows and wait patiently or maybe even have a look at the outstanding bugs..

619483
bash	subshell
try or even removing the previous line edit - testing this properly it works fine in ksh but not in bash for some reason
i think it might be something to do with subshell

620500
gitolite	gitosis
the installation process i recommand is one done from a client post in order to copy the full installation of gitolite on the server from-client method install from the client to the server remember gitolite manages authorization not authentication ssh it can be used without ssh but its natural deployment is through ssh and the forced command mechanism
like gitosis was but with many more features old references for gitosis here is a step-by-step tutorial

621891
innodb	myisam
innodb does
you ll find people who are using myisam or those that are using innodb but aren t using it anyway

626443
uilabel	uibutton
as to brent s idea of putting the title uilabel as sibling view it doesn t seem to me like a very good idea
i keep thinking in interaction problems with the uilabel due to its touch events not getting through the uibutton s view

626443
uilabel	uibutton
i keep thinking in interaction problems with the uilabel due to its touch events not getting through the uibutton s view
on the other hand with a uilabel as subview of the uibutton i m pretty confortable knowing that the touch events will always be propagated to the uilabel s superview

626952
punctuation	words
if say you want this ...string changed to this ...string you want words capitalized even if there is punctuation before them try something more like this same thing but it split s on words w+ so that the captured elements of the list are word-only
same overall effect but will capitalize words that may not start with a words character

627922
freebsd	linux
executable files with this bit set will run with effective uid set to the uid of the file owner. directories with this bit set will force all files and sub- directories created in them to be owned by the directory owner and not by the uid of the creating process if the underlying file system supports this feature see chmod 2 and the suiddir option to mount 8 . please be aware that this is a security risk and know what you are doing when you enable it in freebsd but i believe linux as well it requires special mount flag to be enabled and will change the way files in that directory behave
as a followup on node s answer i will post the following from the freebsd man page for mount 8 suiddir a directory on the mounted file system will respond to the suid bit being set by setting the owner of any new files to be the same as the owner of the directory

629185
hex	binary
uxxxx where xxxx is the hex unicode value is most appropriate
generally this is the easiest way you could do another binary encoding not sure if base64 includes reserved characters.

633329
cvs	svn
it cannot because cvs doesn t record such information. so after the conversion you will have to explicitly tell subversion about merges that were done under cvs
the easiest way to do that is by using svn merge --record-only .

634976
jar	war
you could use an overlay although that requires that the sibling be of type war rather than jar
there s also using the dependency plugin to unpack the jar but it will only unpack the version in your local repository not the one you just packaged

638446
udp	tcp
especially since you can give tcp the same sort of latency as udp by disabling the nagle algorithm for example if you re transmitting real-time sensor data and you re not worried about congesting the network with lot s of small packets
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

638640
implements	extends
you should only be using extension methods if you cannot add the method in the original source and cannot extends the class with a sub-class if it is declared sealed the page on extension methods states in general we recommend that you implements extension methods sparingly and only when you have to
whenever possible client code that must extends an existing type should do so by creating a new type derived from the existing type

638936
ssl	https
with ssl you would get a warning error that the site does not have a valid certificate which would alert you that all is not as it should be
personally i tailor my passwords to whether or not information travels over https

639452
ubuntu	debian
the problem you will face as an ubuntu user is that there s always been a slight tension between debian packagers users and the main exim user base because debian chose to heavily customize their configuration
their reasons for customizing it are sound but it results in debian users showing up on the main mailing list asking questions using terms that aren t recognizable to non-debian users

639452
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately this ends up causing you a problem because ubuntu adopted all these packages from debian but doesn t support them in the same way as debian does and debian packagers seem to feel put upon to be asked to support these ubuntu users
so ubuntu user goes to main exim list and is told to ask their packager for help

639452
ubuntu	debian
so ubuntu user goes to main exim list and is told to ask their packager for help
so they go to the debian lists and ask for help and may or may not be helped

640972
mbunit	mstest
i am not sure that this feature is possible in mstest out of box like in other test frameworks mbunit
if i have to use mstest then i am solving this by defining abstract class testbase with testinitialize attribute and every test which needs this behaviour derives from this base class

641215
pascal	delphi
if you want to port a delphi project to the mac free pascal is your best solution
it s not 100 compatible with delphi but it s good enough for a lot of things and you specifically mentioned that you don t need to port the delphi gui stuff

641396
backgrounding	multitasking
possibilities push notifications with a good ui message stack in addition to badging sound whatever - if they have to have an extra approval step so apps can t be obnoxious so be it multiple full processes not possible with current os i realize but then i ve never seen a good explanation why the iphone doesn t support virtual memory smaller backgrounding versions of apps that can run in the backgrounding - no gui and a significantly tighter memory constraint
better multitasking is absolutely key at this point

643072
cdr	cons
perhaps we can use reduce define pairwise-call fun init-element lst reverse cdr reduce lambda a b append list b - b car a cdr a cons list init-element lst disclaimer quick hack untested
define pairwise-call fun init-element lst map fun lst cons init-element lst edit jleedev informs me that this is not the case in at least one scheme implementation

643808
unicode	ucs
unicode is just a standard that defines a character set ucs and encodings utf to encode this character set
but in general unicode is refered to the character set and not the standard

643829
ubuntu	linux
this is not supported for ubuntu or virtualpc but may work
personally i m using virtualbox for linux guests

645985
serializable	deserialization
also do not forget that you can read xml documents directly and write code to de serializable
original answer if you need to completely override one of serialisation or deserialization and thus implement ixmlserializable then you have to do both yourself

646702
pascal	delphi
what you can t do is debug those dlls symbolically in a 3rd party debugger which would have to understand object pascal name mangling at the very least
debug formats are not standardised - basically you can t use delphi to debug ms compiled code or vice versa

646780
inline	inlining
it s up to the jit the c# compiler doesn t do any inlining as far as i m aware but i believe the jit will inline trivial properties in most cases
note that it won t inline members of types deriving from marshalbyrefobject which includes system.windows.forms.control via system.componentmodel.component

647558
consistency	acid
the biggest limitation of most stores is that they are not transactionally safe see scalaris for an transactionally safe store and you need to ensure data consistency by yourself - most use read time consistency by merging conflicting data
rdbms are much easier to use for consistency of data acid joining data is much harder too

648412
inline	inlining
in c# you cannot force a method to inline but you can force a method not to
if you really need access to a specific callstack and you need to remove inlining you can use methodimplattribute with methodimploptions.noinlining

648951
realloc	malloc
i would only return a length of -1 if it failed realloc didn t work and make sure the old string is preserved if that happens
4 you re not storing the tmp variable into even though it can change - it rarely re-allocates memory in-place if you re increasing the size although it is possible if the increase is small enough to fit within any extra space allocated by malloc

649132
config	ini
if you don t need to do anything special conditionals etc. it doesn t look much different from other config styles
i could make a file config.py with stuff like and the only burden on the user compared with say ini files is that they need to put around strings

649732
inline	inlining
see hallvard vassbotn s article about inline routines
extracted from that site the rest of the inlining restrictions are common for both platforms and the most important ones are no inlining across package boundaries the inline routine cannot access implementation section identifiers the call site must have access to all identifiers used in the inline routine note the last point means that unless the call site unit uses the units required by the routine the routine cannot be inline

650721
realloc	strncpy
you need to initialize your mystring char pointer to null before using it in realloc
you should be passing 4 into strncpy not 5 if you had a larger string you d be overwriting memory

650721
realloc	malloc
if there is not enough available memory realloc returns a null pointer and sets errno to enomem
re-alloc will work like malloc when you pass in null if ptr is a null pointer realloc behaves like malloc for the specified size

650846
client-side	server-side
so to answer your question i think that jquery usage will likely expand into most of the areas that asp.net ajax s client-side library currently occupies but asp.net ajax s client-side library will evolve to become other useful things that jquery doesn t provide
keep in mind that asp.net ajax is comprised of both the client-side javascript library microsoftajax.js and the server-side components in system.web.extensions

651145
ssl	https
see readme specifically this part not all php installations support ssl
you can find out if yours supports ssl by reading the http fetching section of the output of examples detect.php. if your installation does not support ssl then https identity urls and server urls will not be supported by the library

652636
implements	extends
my approach would be to take a particular part of the system what exercises all the technical layers - db ui web services whatever and document how that should be implements maybe using class diagrams maybe just suggesting the specific libraries and approaches
in this way your tech spec isn t too big compliments and extends the architecture document which can be a bullet point list if you don t want too much doco

653854
inline	inlining
it s not useful for complex things but for simple lines of code that you want to inline it s not bad
it s good for inlining code and avoiding function call overhead

656559
keystore	jks
bash keytool -keystore foo.jks -genkeypair -alias foo -dname cn foo.example.com l melbourne st victoria c au enter keystore password re-enter new password enter key password for return if same as keystore password bash keytool -keystore foo.jks -exportcert -alias foo | openssl x509 -inform der -text enter keystore password asdasd certificate data version 3 0x2 serial number 1237334757 0x49c03ae5 signature algorithm dsawithsha1 issuer c au st victoria l melbourne cn foo.example.com validity not before mar 18 00 05 57 2009 gmt not after jun 16 00 05 57 2009 gmt subject c au st victoria l melbourne cn foo.example.com subject public key info public key algorithm dsaencryption dsa public key pub 00 e2 66 5c e0 2e da e0 6b a6 aa 97 64 59 14 7e a6 2e 5a 45 f9 2f b5 2d f4 34 27 e6 53 c7 bash keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore foo.jks -destkeystore foo.p12 -srcstoretype jks -deststoretype pkcs#12 enter destination keystore password re-enter new password enter source keystore password entry for alias foo successfully imported. import command completed 1 entries successfully imported 0 entries failed or cancelled bash openssl pkcs#12 -in foo.p12 -out foo.pem enter import password mac verified ok enter pem pass phrase verifying - enter pem pass phrase bash openssl x509 -text -in foo.pem certificate data version 3 0x2 serial number 1237334757 0x49c03ae5 signature algorithm dsawithsha1 issuer c au st victoria l melbourne cn foo.example.com validity not before mar 18 00 05 57 2009 gmt not after jun 16 00 05 57 2009 gmt subject c au st victoria l melbourne cn foo.example.com subject public key info public key algorithm dsaencryption dsa public key pub 00 e2 66 5c e0 2e da e0 6b a6 aa 97 64 59 14 7e a6 2e 5a 45 f9 2f b5 2d f4 34 27 e6 53 c7 bash openssl dsa -text -in foo.pem read dsa key enter pem pass phrase private-key 1024 bit priv 00 8f b1 af 55 63 92 7c d2 0f e6 f3 a2 f5 ff 1a 7a fe 8c 39 dd pub 00 e2 66 5c e0 2e da e0 6b a6 aa 97 64 59 14 7e a6 2e 5a 45 f9 2f b5 2d f4 34 27 e6 53 c7 you end up with foo.jks - keystore in java format
foo.p12 - keystore in pkcs#12 format

658177
tapestry	wicket
from the other side that could make transitions to the future versions easier for tapestry then for wicket
unfortunately tapestry 5 tutorial does not stress that tapestry code example like t loop source 1..10 ... can be a bad practice

658177
tapestry	wicket
so some effort should be put into writing tapestry usage conventions good practices if your team is not very small
my recommendations use wicket when your pages structure is very dynamic and you can afford spending 10-200 kbs of httpsession memory per user these are rough numbers

658702
prng	random
there s also bruce schneier s yarrow prng server
not truly random but considered cryptographically secure

659128
xstream	jackson
works nicely with jersey and i am use it myself current jersey version does not bundle full pojo data binding by default but will in near future i would actually not use any of xml libs to produce json xstream and jaxb jettison can produce kind of json but it uses ugly conventions that are rather non-intuitive
edit 18-jul-2011 jackson actually has an extension called jackson-xml-databind that can read write xml similar to jaxb

660452
rpm	yum
regerding your question you could try to override dependency checking by downloading rpm of the required package an doing rpm -i --force file.rpm since yum does not have any option for forced installations
as a rule of thumb it s better to have one package management in the system so you ll be better off packaging everything in rpms and managing it via yum

661568
lisp	scheme
this style of programming does not work in plain emacs lisp
emacs lisp uses dynamic binding and languages like scheme and common lisp are using lexical binding

662414
spaces	linefeed
instead of a spaces replace the 0 s with a rare whitespace character that shouldn t normally be in the column s text
a linefeed is probably good enough for a column like this

663125
listview	gridview
the previous data option only works with a listview and only if you don t have a gridview associated with it
i believe this may be because with a view hooked to the listview control it doesn t create an itemscontrol collection

664235
super	implements
as for simplexml itself i m not sure if it actually implements the arrayaccess interface or if there s something else going on behind the scenes in the php source that gives it these super powers
you can provide array like access to your object by implements the arrayaccess interface which is part of the php standard library

665042
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has better foreign key support better referential integrity transactions views subselects etc
but that doesn t mean mysql doesn t have its place

665249
awt	swing
the un-j d names were already taken by awt and we thought it useful to use a common prefix to distinguish components from other classes in the package. the already taken part does match with what i said about the compiler but does not confirm it
when sun started working on swing they had things like javax.swing.button

665252
awt	swing
the j was first put out by the kl group now quest.com whose revolutionary bwt forms the basis of today s improved awt called swing jfc
so it comes from the ancestor of today s kl jclass not so according to tofubeer s answer i leave the rest as a community answer because it details what was jclass but the j may not come at all from the integration of their library into swing. jclass swingsuite a new set of extensions and enhancements for swing in sun microsystems inc. s java tm development kit jdk tm version 1.2 it coincides with sun s announcement of the availability of jdk 1.2 made today during the java sm business expo sm in new york

665673
lisp	scheme
in lisp-1 lisp like scheme and clojure they do
in lisp-2 lisp like common lisp they do not

666057
trie	tree
this way the last trie you have will contain all the matches that are contained in all files
depending on how similar the entries within one file is it might be possible to create a trie not tree from it

666057
trie	tree
depending on how similar the entries within one file is it might be possible to create a trie not tree from it
using this trie you can iterate the other file and check each entry if it is inside the trie

666253
vb.net	vb6
and those who use vb.net surely have .net framework installed
all the answers are very useful but they all suggest that i create this callback redirector in vb6 which is not very convenient since i may have to redistribute the vb6 runtime with the client application

668572
g++	gcc
you also want to make sure that the g++ and f77 commands in your makefile are running the commands that you expect them to be running not accessing executables in unexpected directories or different incompatible versions
edit from your recent edits to your question you appear to be trying to link the sun compiler s f77 with the gcc g++

668916
ftp	telnet
i m not sure i understand your comment on using ftp to log in and monitor log files - surely you d be logging in with telnet and its brethren rather than using ftp for that purpose
i m not aware of windows ftp client having a similar functionality to the unix .netrc file although i ve been wrong before just ask the wife -

669381
udp	tcp
despite client protocol name of tcp ip mssql uses udp for bitbanging
you may not have the udp port open vpn-forwarded it s port number 1433

671852
udp	tcp
sql doesn t listen on tcp 1434 it listens on udp 1434
you can t test udp ports using telnet

671852
udp	tcp
have your isp open udp 1434
check the client connection order on the server and i ll get that named pipes is above tcp ip but ssms isn t use named pipes for some reason

672924
vim	emacs
code blocks is less used because it isn t extensible as emacs vim
during my work in emacs with different programming languages i often create a new scripts that make my work much easier

673674
gif	png
gif images are not very efficient for photographic images
you should experiment with other formats like jpg and png to see if you can get the same quality with smaller file size

674852
rpm	yum
you can either bypass rpm s dependency resolution by installing the package using rpm --nodeps and hope it works
or install the php version you compiled yourself in another directory so it can coexist with the old version from yum so everyone is happy not sure if that s possible i guess it depends on whether your apps use a hardcoded path to php or not

677459
config	ini
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested
i had a similar need and found this to be extremely useful and simple. it is an ini file reader and writer you just specify the header tag and the item name and it will read or write from a file

681872
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
furthermore all thread synchronization locks monitor readerwriterlock mutex semaphone autoresetevent manualresetevent etc. call interlocked methods internally
so it would seem that as wekempf pointed out that the result variables do not require the volatile keyword in the example as shown since the manualresetevent ensures cache coherency

681984
ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
usually for me the choice between ienumerable or ilist usually ends up being whichever is easier to implement in the standard case
iqueryable would have a rather heavy requirement on it -- you couldn t for example return an array

683158
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
furthermore all thread synchronization locks monitor readerwriterlock mutex semaphone autoresetevent manualresetevent etc. call interlocked methods internally
so it would seem that as wekempf pointed out that the result variables do not require the volatile keyword in the example as shown since the manualresetevent ensures cache coherency

683524
treemap	linkedhashmap
a linkedhashmap keeps the keys in the order they were inserted while a treemap is kept sorted via a comparator or the natural comparable ordering of the elements
since it doesn t have to keep the elements sorted linkedhashmap should be faster for most cases

683908
serializable	deserialization
in binary serializable you can get both old new version of the app to be able to read each other serializable info .net 2.0+ but if you save it back you will loose the extra info the version doesn t handles
starting at .net 2.0 the deserialization process ignores the extra data if you combine that with optional fields you can effectively get both apps to read other version s formats

683923
tostring	string.format
but when you alert element alert calls tostring on the element and htmllinkelement.tostring returns the contents of the href attribute so alert link spits out the same results as alert link.href
which is a bit weird and confusing but that s how javascript 1.0 worked so there s not much can be done about it now. i check the value of ele after calling getelementbyid it prints string.format javascript showhideelement..... that shouldn t happen with the exact example you ve given.

689320
xna	slimdx
unfortunately microsoft no longer supports managed directx and it s successor xna does not support 64bit either
slimdx is an open source alternative to managed directx and it supports 64bit

689576
google-chrome	firefox
and also i assumed that since it didnt work in google-chrome that safari would be the same but you know what they say about assuming it works in safari but not google-chrome
total facepalm moment in firefox tools options content tab advanced button next to enable javascript check the box named raise or lower windows this is turned off by default and must be enabled

690400
profiling	instrumentation
a tracing profiling adds code to your program a process known as instrumentation to essentially log what is going on
tracing profilers are slower but more accurate they also require that the program be changed the instrumentation process which could potentially introduce bugs not that i have heard of it happening.

690628
webclient	webrequest
with the webclient class i doubt you can change it out-of-the-box so that it does not allow redirects
what you could do is derive a class from the webclient class and then override the getwebrequest and the getwebresponse methods to alter the webrequest webresponse instances that the base implementation returns

690802
jar	war
you have three simple steps to accomplish this place the jar file in the ear we typically create a lib directory but that is not necessary
update the manifest for the war to include this jar file

690802
jar	war
edit as an alternative since you are only using the ear to wrap the war and not actually sharing the jar file
put the jar in the lib directory of the war

692310
octal	binary
octal numbers in c are preceded by the character 0 so 0123 is not 123 but is instead 1 64 + 2 8 + 3 or 83
in binary where the digits are 0 and 1

692639
factors	mean
this will cause the tree to rebalance incorrectly because the upward scan for balance factors will be working with incorrect balance factors
it could mean updating the balance factors but not balancing

692639
factors	mean
it could mean updating the balance factors but not balancing
this means you would end up when you did decide to delete something with balance factors greater than 2 or smaller than -2

693986
apache	nginx
clients hit the reverse proxy using ssl on 443 and the reverse proxy decrypts the whole thing and forwards it off to your apache server who doesn t know a thing about ssl
both squid and nginx support it

695018
config	ini
the registry is a fine place to put config data of all types
in general it is faster than most config files and more reliable individual operations on the registry are transacted so if your app crashes during a write the registry isn t corrupted - in general that isn t the case with ini files

697952
pascal	delphi
is a typical method of concatinating strings and has been used in pascal delphi for the past few decades without any significant problems
delphi does not require a string builder class but one is provided for delphi 2009 if you so desire to use it

698119
matlab	simulink
not mentioned in the book is matlab which in the last few years has gone from a simulation tool to a model driven development system for realtime systems. matlab simulink is in effect a dsl for linear programming state machines and algorithms
matlab can generate c or hdl for realtime and embedded systems

698265
client-side	server-side
this can be a huge problem because html can include client-side scripts that will take over the user s access to the site a cross-site-scripting attack
at this point you might be tempted to sniff the file on the server-side for example using the file command to check it doesn t contain html

699266
boost	stl	inline	inlining
because boost function is polymorphic it cannot be inline
the design of the stl is aimed at maximum potential for the compiler to do inlining of code which is easy on expanded templates

699350
spaces	delimiter
you can use afterwards which will replace all spaces with nothing
but you can also do that with commas but keep in mind that a the delimiter changes it s a dot for me not a comma

699408
spaces	delimiter
this condition means that your data should contain of only digits spaces and tab characters basically it should be digits and spaces or digits and tab only
for this just load the data to variable and check if it matches if it matches - it will mean that you will have set of integers delimiter by spaces or tabs it s not really relevant which character was used to delimit the integers

701208
implements	extends
that means you have two options how to achieve what you want implements your own subclass of fieldeditor which would represent the group widget
do not extends fieldeditorpreferencepage but only a preferencepage instead

702254
httphandler	httpmodule
without iis7 and on shared hosting you would have to creare a handler that mapped a .net file extention that you are not using like .asmx and in the web.config specify that .asmx files go to your httphandler which is set to rewrite the path to .jpg or whatever and set the header there too
in iis7 all requests go to .net so you would have to create an httpmodule that added those headers to all responses

704209
spweb	spsite
this means that it is not safe to use that spweb reference or any sp object created from it splist etc outside of your foreach loop
also sw would not be safe to use outside of that using block because the iterator s spwebcollections will be tied to the now-disposed spsite

704390
actionscript	mxml
flex has a markup piece mxml and a programming language piece actionscript
there isn t much of a learning curve for the mxml part

705272
appfuse	spring
i ve figured it out by reverse-engineering appfuse appfuse.org which does not seem to be affected by mojibake with its file upload form
it solved it by setting the charset encoding to utf-8 in the server side with spring s org.springframework.web.filter.characterencodingfilter

705926
cvs	svn
this is the approach i am using for interacting with cvs from git
if git-svn is not part of msysgit i recommend using a small unix server to host your gateway repository that clones your svn repository and then clone that repository onto your windows machine

706036
postgresql	mysql
in oracle in ms sql up to 100 rows or using hint up to 32768 in postgresql in mysql nothing
hate to say this but mysql is the only rdbms of the big four that doesn t have this feature

708271
boost	stl
you can use boost bind as an alternative
if you want stl strings you need to include is not a standard signature

709209
http	spdy
the overhead of using http side-wide is not seen as much of a big deal anymore
the new spdy protocol pioneered by google now evolved into http 2 is supported cross-browser and by major web servers and improves http speed

709465
nunit	mstest
if not or you don t mind converting existing mstests i would standardize on nunit
i strongly prefer nunit over mstest

709498
nunit	mstest
one other advantage of nunit is that it doesn t require that you add anything to your test classes
mstest requires the presence of a testcontext property

710096
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
you could use a solution that incorporates both jamie s and shoban s answers and adds some conditional comments the above works on windows in ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 opera 9.6 and google-chrome 1
it does not work in safari for windows 3 or 4

711052
implements	extends
you can t explicity implements interface members void ifoo.doa when implicitly implements the interface
in other words because bar only implements ifoo by virtue of extends foo you cannot use explicit implementation

711707
google-chrome	safari
this is definitely a google-chrome bug and you just need to report it and wait for solution. i checked your page in safari which uses same engine as google-chrome webkit and the page works fine
my good advice is to not create such long pages because it is not only bad for google-chrome but also for your s site visitors

711712
super	self
not sure why they have super and parent mean the same thing typical confusion super is the receiver not the parent of its class
just like self is not the receiver s class

713155
hash-collision	key
therefore unless you are performing a lot of key based operations on huge dictionaries with many hash-collision the speed of key to key comparisons will not be a major factor
the collections are fairly small but they get iterated lots of times if you are iterating there are no key to key comparisons

715574
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
below exception there is runtimeexception also an unchecked-exception
the way that the designers of java intended exceptions to be used is exception things that can go wrong error low level things that can go wrong and a program cannot recover from runtimeexception programmer errors like going past the end of an array or calling a method on null

715574
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the way that the designers of java intended exceptions to be used is exception things that can go wrong error low level things that can go wrong and a program cannot recover from runtimeexception programmer errors like going past the end of an array or calling a method on null
the idea behind not having to catch unchecked-exception is that they indicate failures vm level or programmer that either you cannot handle vm error or should not exist in a properly debugged program programmer mistake

715928
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
the correct way around the issue would be to use the domcontentloaded event which isn t supported in all browsers
hacks eg polling doscroll or using onreadystatechange exist so libraries are able to provide this functionality across browsers

716333
punctuation	words
as such you have to be aware that funky punctuation and stuff can make it in--it s not just words
for example i ve seen partial words that end in a hyphen that obviously occurred on the end of a line as well as dollar-signs numbers like 1

716454
webclient	httpwebrequest
if you are worried though you may want to use webclient which is idisposable
httpwebrequest doesn t implement idisposable since it can create a stream which does implement idisposable

717112
factors	mean
that s probably not an important factors unless you re dealing with millions of entries however
if you mean a java.util.list it s an interface

719159
lisp	scheme
note that this was not just lisp for scripting - it was lisp all the way down
one the scheme side there is also a new interesting implementation called ypsilon scheme

719187
automake	autotools
a number of projects eventually got rid of the automake abstraction and reverted to writing makefiles manually because you lose control over your makefiles and you might not need all the canned build targets that obfuscate your makefile
now to the alternatives and i strongly suggest an alternative to autotools based on your requirements cmake s most notable achievement is replacing autotools in kde

719403
implements	extends
put all your own new methods in a new interface and create a class which implements this interface too
here it would be you could then let this class extends the class you want but i would consider it better to have a private member of mymap being of class treemap as you then only expose those methods you actually want and not all those that treemap has additionally

722860
boost	stl
your expression is captures by i m no boost fanatic but their regexp library is nice
not the stl solution you asked for

722984
daemons	systemd
so all of these should display the expected string if you do decide to use asl note that while it accepts strings in utf8 format and passes the correct encoding to the syslog daemons so it will show up properly in the console it encodes the string for visual encoding when displaying to the terminal or logging to a file handle so non-ascii values will be displayed as escaped character sequences
nslog s s format specifier is in the systemd encoding which seems to always be macroman and not unicode so it can only display characters in macroman encoding

723040
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if so you shouldn t be using .htaccess files at all
it s a security risk not to have your server configured properly but all that configuration should be done in the main configuration file like etc apache2 httpd.conf for example

724269
union	distinct
thus each member of a union is a different view of the same memory
this does not happen with a struct because all of the members are distinct and separate from each other

724407
udp	tcp
the config file actions.txt uses the format action-name corresponding-shell-command # hash denotes a comment webroot nautilus var www ftp filezilla edit_homepage gedit var www homepage htdocs index.php this code doesn t check the originating ip of the incoming udp packets as i have it running on localhost i am firewalled of from anyone else and checking would provide no protection against spoofing anyway
i don t have time to rewrite it to use tcp ip but python is a language that s worth getting to know so if you really want that functionality i ll leave it to you to have a google for python and sock_stream

724938
postgresql	mysql
i didn t take very long to switch from mysql to postgresql back when i first started using postgresql in anger at a previous company
i found it very nice and very refreshing not that mysql was bad compared to mysql which i had used previously

725388
profiling	benchmarking
if you re seeing a huge difference try using profiling to see what s taking the time
assuming you re not using a variable-length text encoding such as utf-8 you can use array.array but since you re dealing with the contents of a file mmap should be more efficient here s a quick benchmarking script you ll need to replace dd with something else for non-unix oses output i got on my several-year-old laptop matches my intuition 5+0 records in 5+0 records out 5242880 bytes transferred in 0.710966 secs 7374304 bytes sec do_mmap 1.00865888596 do_array 1.09792494774 do_split 1.20163106918 so mmap is slightly faster but none of the suggested solutions is particularly different

727624
ssl	https
this will be a parameter after -h in the next command httpcfg.exe set ssl -i 0.0.0.0 801 -h 35c65fd4853f49552471d2226e03dd10b7a11755 then run a service host on and it works perfectly
what i cannot make work is for https to run on self-generated certificate

728093
postgresql	mysql
now on to your real question you are a sql guy albeit one who has not yet had experience with postgresql
this is a completely realistic task for you and a good one since you ll expand your understanding of the varieties of dbmss and gain a perspective on mysql that you can t get from working solely within its sphere

729016
vim	emacs
the coding form is recognized out of the box by gnu emacs but not vim yes without a universal agreement it s essentially a turf war
check the docs here if a comment in the first or second line of the python script matches the regular expression this comment is processed as an encoding declaration the recommended forms of this expression are which is recognized also by gnu emacs and which is recognized by bram moolenaar s vim. so you can put pretty much anything before the coding part but stick to coding with no prefix if you want to be 100 python-docs-recommendation-compatible

729256
uilabel	uitextview
update i use sizetofit with uilabel and it works just fine but uitextview is a subclass of uiscrollview so i can understand why sizetofit doesn t produce the desired result
you can still calculate the text height and use setframe but you might want to take advantage of uitextview s scrollbars if the text is too long

730857
equals	gethashcode
the equals method contains the implementation to perform the actual comparison and return true if the object values are equals or false if they are not
the gethashcode method should return a unique hash value that may be used to uniquely identify identical objects that contain different values

732591
prepare	execute
i am not extremely versed in security but here is an explanation that i hope will help you let s say you have a statement like select integer from mydb pretend when you prepare it the statement is compiled down to bytes in our imaginary sql implementation
01 00 00 23 opcode for select prepared bytes number of mydb for your integer now when you execute you will insert the number into the space reserved for your prepared statement

732870
comparator	comparable
the most general type-safe way to declare your mergesort function above is this enforces that the type t s comparator method can accept an argument of type t
in theory a type could implement comparable but not be comparable to itself like so it is important to have the requirement on the type parameter of comparable

732870
implements	extends
this is important because if you have a class a which implements
and then you have a subclass b which extends a b cannot implement because b already implements inherited from a and a class cannot implement an interface twice

733017
firefox	safari
some of the most end-user visible innovation has come from a new browser war examples would be html5 several vendors canvas apple xmlhttprequest microsoft s outlook web access team input range safari s built-in rss reader and the video element firefox --these came from the proprietary level on up not from the standards tower on down
and these new standards were forged by looking at these past individual implementations firefox copied microsoft largely for xmlhttprequest and so on not by some wide-eyed think tank pondering the future

733527
vim	textmate
and now i ve had my vim rant i m going to rant some more
textmate doesn t have a built in compiler

733972
postgresql	mysql
the only downside to postgresql is that it shares some of the same dba guru requirements as oracle where as ms sql can often be managed by a regular it person and mysql doesn t need much management besides restoring the old backups everytime it decides to become corrupted and lose your data
as mentioned mysql can provide high read performance assuming simple queries with few or no joins as long as you use the default table type

736836
innodb	myisam
if your application needs to not block when it s writing audit records to the database you should make the audit writing asynchronous and keep your own queue of audit data on disc or in memory so you don t block the main worker thread process innodb may allow concurrent inserts but that doesn t mean they won t be blocked by contention for resources or internal locks for things like index pages
myisam allows one inserter and several readers concurrent inserts under the following circumstances the table has no holes in it there are no threads trying to do an update or delete if you have an append-only table which you recreate each day or create a new partition every day if you use 5.1 partitioning you may get away with this

739734
implements	extends
alternatively you could implements your own wrapper around that interface more generally you could get the same effect using reflection so you wouldn t need to hardcode youcannotchangeme_iamnotyours in your wrapper class
you could extends the foreign class assuming it s non-final and make that class implements the interface

740950
postgresql	mysql
sqlite just does not scale anywhere near as far as apache etc with mysql postgresql
in some cases the way that sqlite handles data types or rather glosses over data types can lead to issues with a django app that is subsequently deployed with mysql postgres.

741350
vmware	virtualbox
not as powerful as vmware though
if you don t have the cash for vmware if you do it s the best money can buy try virtualbox

744701
udp	tcp
reliable udp is not the same as just using tcp
there are a number of differences but the most predominant is that you are guaranteed to always receive an entire udp message or not receive it at all

744701
udp	tcp
there are a number of differences but the most predominant is that you are guaranteed to always receive an entire udp message or not receive it at all
whereas it is not only possible but very common to receive partial tcp messages

745963
innodb	myisam
that said a very hot table lots and lots of select s will benefit from being migrated to innodb because myisam does not support concurrent read
myisam almost always survives a database crash with nothing more than a repair table needed

745963
innodb	myisam
innodb is not always so lucky
the myisam can also be backed-up out from under the database

746606
udp	tcp
udp is unreliable more or less by definition - ipso facto
you aren t going to get anywhere making the os-side implementation of the protocol more reliable. a great many applications that use udp use it because they need the low-overhead low-latency nature of it much more than they need the precise reliability of tcp

746606
voip	sip
think about sip in voip telephony for example
tcp s latent three-way handshake and very gradual congestion control aren t really acceptable for decent call setup time or qos but some way of acknowledging messages is definitely needed that s what provisional responses are for in sip terminology

746955
dictionary	map
it reduced me from a dictionary of 200 000 keys to only 2 000 keys simply during the input pass
this at the very least reduces memory overhead and that s sure to map to a speed increase somewhere as memory isn t infinitely fast

746999
png	tga
i wouldn t want to attempt tiff png gif or jpg in fortran without the help of external libraries however
you might find that one of the family of netpbm formats is easier to write and they would be easily converted to tga or any other format you might need for display or further processing with simple commands

748568
daemons	systemd
the socket file should be created automatically when the mysql daemons starts
if it isn t found most likely the directory which is supposed to contain it doesn t exist or some other file systemd problem is preventing the socket from being created

749458
implements	extends
the function form.getinputbyname is declared final as shown in the javadoc here the object htmlinput is abstract thus on runtime time it is always implements by an object that is extends htmlinput
due to the nature of final methods it is never overridden so there is no callstack the error comes beceause the compiler sees it as just htmlinput and not an implements htmlinput. ref he thinks there will be no callstack assigning it to a new htmlinput object correctly invokes the callstack and thus makes the code viable again

750068
realloc	malloc
also these two calls are equivalent to each other but not to free realloc null size malloc size
realloc ptr 0

750075
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

750481
implements	extends
for example a datatable implements ilistsource returning defaultview when requested
tweaks typedescriptionprovider still replaces metadata not extends can also be added be typedescriptor.addprovider can be applied per-type as well as per-instance making it possible to apply to lists without having to implement itypedlist typeconverter for propertygrid this is also the mechanism used to obtain metadata

750846
ssl	https
have a look at the jetty ssl socket connector instead of the often use socket connector. its not that difficult
just add the sslsocketconnector to your server after configuring it and after this your application should respond to https requests

751449
factors	mean
it takes roughly 10 bisection steps to cut the interval length by a factors of 1024 2 10 but only 20 steps will cut the interval by a factors of 2 20
log complexity does not always mean an algorithm is fast on all problems

752242
client-side	server-side
you should never rely on client-side features
the feature you re working on is usually implemented storing the session id client-side and the real user info server-side its id whether he s logged in or not his personal info etc

752754
vb.net	vb6
edit ant has correctly pointed out that on error goto -1 is a vb.net statement and isn t valid in vb6
edit arvo and onenerd have written answers with some interesting discussion of emulating finally teardown blocks in vb6 error handling

756817
factors	mean
various factors in the internal operating system and tcp stack may cause the application to get some bytes in one read call and some in the next
yes the tcp stack has to re-assemble the packet before sending it up but that doesn t mean your app is going to get it all in one shot it is likely will get it in one read but it s not guaranteed to get it in one read

756894
profiling	debugging
jvm ti supports the full breadth of tools that need access to jvm state including but not limited to profiling debugging monitoring thread analysis and coverage analysis tools
note jvm ti replaces the java virtual machine profiler interface jvmpi and the java virtual machine debugging interface jvmdi

759970
cpython	ironpython
note that the above is only true for cpython
jython and ironpython uses the jvm clr gc mechanism and does not use refcounting at all i believe

763841
inline	inlining
a big function that is called often probably shouldn t be inline because you end up copying a lot of code resulting in a larger executable and more instruction cache misses
inlining is always a tradeoff and often the compiler is better at weighing all the factors than you

764349
.htaccess	httpd.conf
to answer the basic question of how to modify sys.path from .htaccess you can use the pythonpath directive in .htaccess
according to ticket #2255 for django you need admin access to httpd.conf in order to use django with mod_python and this is not going to change so you may be dead in the water

765722
g++	gcc
g++ gives me the warning warning converting of negative value -0x00000000a to unsigned int without any -w directives
gcc you must use gcc main.c -wconversion which will give the warning warning negative integer implicitly converted to unsigned type note that -wall will not enable this warning

766614
listview	gridview
i ended up retrieving the key value for the updated item from the datakeys collection using the editindex of the listview
the listviewupdatedeventargs object that s passed in to the itemupdated event handler for the listview does not have a keys collection like the gridviewupdatedeventargs object passed into the rowupdated event handler for a gridview

767015
zlib	libpng
it depends on zlib which you probably already have shared libraries for but if not you ll have to get that too
here s a guide to compiling libpng on mac os x

769575
google-chrome	firefox
also i seem to recall having read that google s google-chrome browser uses a similar technique to do automated regression testing
using firefox it should be possible to implement much of it with its powerful support for addons and enhancements however that wouldn t really mean to run headless but really be a real scripted browser

770885
cdr	cons
cdr x ... both lists are affected
remember that each variable doesn t hold a list they hold just a cons cell

771662
expression-blend	silverlight
learning xaml will be very beneficial to you although is not absolutely required to use expression-blend
have a look at jesse liberty s silverlight video tutorial series which includes a couple of videos on expression-blend

772170
postgresql	mysql
i d strongly suggest getting your mysql to as strict an ansi compliance as possible before converting to postgresql then checking for any warnings when you run your applications
before converting set your mysql to ansi-strictness by starting the server with --transaction-isolation serializable --sql-mode ansi make sure you re not using myisam tables

772170
postgresql	mysql
postgresql gives you a choice of languages for these but you have to install the languages
it s not as user friendly as mysql

772170
postgresql	mysql
in particular postgresql uses || to mean string catenation
basically postgresql is pretty strictly ansi mysql isn t

772196
postgresql	mysql
case sensitive text lack of insert ignore and replace explicit casting needed almost everywhere no backticks load data infile copy is close but not close enough change autoincrement to serial although bad form in mysql in postgresql an inner join without an on clause can t happen use cross join or the like can be crazy slow databases are encoded with character sets not tables you can have multiple databases with multiple schemas mysql really has just one database and multiple schema partitioning is different mysql interval vs
postgresql interval for time intervals implicit column renaming postgresql requires as cannot update multiple tables at the same time in postgresql postgresql functions are powerful

773152
udp	tcp
when you receive a udp packet maybe you should spawn a new thread to take care of dealing with the message received
udp connections are not like tcp connections

773152
udp	tcp
udp connections are not like tcp connections
they do not remain active and such is the design of udp

773931
implements	extends
there isn t one as far as i know and set by its mathematical nature is meant to be unordered or at least implementationally meant not to guarantee order - in fact its usually implements as a hash table so it does mess up order
however it s not hard to either extends array directly or subclass it to do this

774113
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
so in the later case an invalidoperationexception is a reasonable choice
depending on the actual value and what exception fits best argumentexception something is wrong with the value argumentnullexception the argument is null while this is not allowed argumentoutofrangeexception the argument has a value outside of the valid range if this is not precise enough just derive your own exception class from argumentexception

774698
udp	tcp
the udp case is simpler and quite different since udp sockets are not necessarily connected
if you are really interested then i would advise you to read tcp ip illustrated volume 2

775169
implements	extends
you can create a completely custom class to function as the renderer given it implements certain required interfaces or in most cases you extends an existing component
since the default renderer for adg cells doesn t support background colors you have to create or extends a component that does and use that as the renderer

775719
queue	fifo
consumer producers usually need queue for synchronization anyway
i agree that it might work - so it might be safe but not sane. the main question is if this low-level sharing is really needed - i am not an expert on linux but i would consider to use for instance a fifo queue for the master shared memory segment so that the os does the locking work for you

778224
textmate	aptana
plus a lot of developers are using textmate for rails and therefore creating scripts and features that you can import and use
i m using aptana with radrails when i m on windows but it s not as good

778759
client-side	server-side
server-side validation is required simply because client-side validation can be disabled
client-side validation isn t required but it makes your application more responsive during error handling as you no longer need to do a form submit to the server and wait for the resulting page to come back

779293
apache	nginx
this has performance ram usage very close to fastcgi and mod_wsgi recently became the officially recommended way of hosting django see in general i would suggest using apache mod_wsgi if possible it is a stable and flexible combination
be sure that you re not prematurely optimizing by using nginx where apache + mod_wsgi would do just fine

779293
apache	nginx
be sure that you re not prematurely optimizing by using nginx where apache + mod_wsgi would do just fine
for a performance overview of mod_wsgi in daemon mode see nginx is awesome but for a django solution nginx is imho a better fit as a load balancer for many apache instances or a separate server for static files

779895
postgresql	mysql
quick postgresql optimization query optimizing short read explains a lot of things well and works a real example which is nice for those of us that learn better that way
after seeing the wiki link to postgresql figured i d edit this post with links for mysql oracle docs not really an optimization guides specifically but both are good resources especially the mysql one

780251
udp	tcp
unlike tcp this does not mean that the peer closed the connection because with udp there is no connection
actually you can send a udp datagram of 0 bytes length

782164
spaces	delimiter
consider the string the quick brown fox additional spaces if it s not obvious
using a delimiter of a single whitespace character will give a word count of six not four

782449
opera	firefox
illustration of one solution this is one solution to the problem tested in opera firefox and internet explorer 7
table of contents illustration of problem illustration of one solution illustration of problem copy the following html into your browsers at least firefox and internet explorer 7 but you should try opera too notice that the td element does not hide the overflowing content

783526
vb.net	vb6
it s not like it s terrifically hard to translate c# code to vb.net especially if you re not copy-pasting
i m sure most of the time the reason companies go forward with vb.net is exactly as you mentioned - large amounts of vb6 in the organization both in terms of codebase and developers

783533
vb.net	vb6
-p i have nothing against vb.net - i simply feel that c# allows me to do my job more elegantly
re the books etc - i wonder if there isn t a contingent of ex-vb6 developers who are still writing vb6 in vs2008

783534
vb.net	vb6
we re not standardized on vb.net and i often have to go back and forth between vb.net adn c#
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript

783534
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript
i say all this because it s important to remember the vb6 is not vb.net

783534
vb.net	vb6
i really hated vb6 but i fell in love with vb.net almost instantly
however vb.net did inherit some things from vb6 and not just a syntax style

783581
vb.net	vb6
finally the people who are crap are not crap because they are vb.net programmers that s just vb.net is easy to code and it s not a bad thing
also it s been said that most of these people coming from classic asp and vb6 background which are again really low entrance threshold languages

784538
subtraction	addition	division	addition	addition	multiplication
it s a basic arithmetic operation - like addition subtraction multiplication division except it s not usually taught in elementary school
it combines two integers bit by bit - like addition but we don t care about the carry-overs

785072
sctp	tcp
in my experience i would not expect all systems to have sctp installed on them and i would expect them not to if it were windows
if you include sctp in the application itself then that will more than double the number of messages being passed into an out of the kernel which will impact performance when compared with using the pre installed tcp

787394
vbscript	jscript
vbscript has that ability as a global function but other windows script host languages might not
for instance jscript does not have a global createobject function i believe it does however have a syntax so you do not need to use wscript.createobject in jscript either

787579
udp	tcp
i haven t seen this one per se but i have seen similar problems with large udp datagrams causing ip fragmentation which lead to congestion and ultimately dropped ethernet frames
since this is tcp ip i wouldn t expect ip fragmentation to be a large issue since it is a stream-based protocol

788008
mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
not nunit mbunit xunit.net etc
mstest

788445
implements	extends
when generic are compiled you end up with object in the above example as the implements type
as int and byte etc do not extends object you cannot use them inter-changeably even if the code involved would be identical again generics are not templates the only class int and object share is object

789318
onclick	onchange
another issue to consider is that the onclick event isn t supported for option elements atleast not in ie though firefox supports it fine
you should instead handle the onchange client side event

789596
vim	emacs
check what you have as term echo term and check the vim docs for how to fix the backspace issue
what you re seeing is that the terminal setting term in your shell vim session doesn t match what the emacs terminal is doing

789596
vim	emacs
what you re seeing is that the terminal setting term in your shell vim session doesn t match what the emacs terminal is doing
mine works fine with the exception that the delete key is mapped to del 0x127 while vim wants h 0x8

789896
mbunit	nunit
however in t type in ienumerable is more complex than string or valuetype in mbunit assertnoteqaual a b will not fail
i didn t look at nunit source code to see how nunit guys coded arenotequal. however i can tell you how it s done for mbunit that has the same behavior

790216
bash	subshell
just to expand on this a bit bash has fairly complicated rules for dealing with metacharacters in quotes
in general almost nothing is interpreted in single-quotes shell substitution is done inside double quotes but file metacharacters aren t expanded everything inside backquotes is passed to the subshell which interprets them

790473
rar	zip
it s in public domain it s fast on decompression it has fully managed implementation it s much better compressing than zip rar it has very small footprint it can work as a stream
i will be second to recommend lzma sdk but it s not zip

790545
google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
google-chrome uses a fork of webkit if you didn t know which is also used by safari
here s a few questions that are of the same vein embedding webkit with c# embedding gecko firefox engine with c# the webkit one isn t great as the other answer states one version no longer works the google code one and the mono one is experimental

792529
config	ini
thanks for your answers. this question as naive as it may seem at first glance was not so naive personally i don t like xml for config files i think it s hard for people to read and change and it s hard for computers to parse because it s so generic and powerful
ini files or java propery files are fine for only the most basic applications that does require nesting. common solutions to add nesting to those formats look like not a pretty sight a lot of redundancy and hard to move things between nodes

793123
nexus	artifactory
we used to use artifactory but ended up switching to nexus a while back
the main problem was that the disk space used by artifactory kept growing and we couldn t find a way to stop it

793996
directx	direct2d
direct2d is built on directx 10.1 so will not work on xp since directx 10 is vista+ only
direct2d and directwrite technical previews are both currently available in the march 2009 directx sdk

794794
lisp	scheme
actually common lisp is not only the extension language but large parts of the application are written in common lisp plus some c++
other than that lisp is a family of diverse dialects with diverse implementations scheme common lisp emacs lisp visual lisp clojure logo ... and several others

794998
comparator	comparable
whether or not equals and hashcode are consistent with comparator is a different matter
from the javadoc for comparable it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals

794998
equals	compareto
from the javadoc for comparable it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals
this is so because sorted sets and sorted maps without explicit comparators behave strangely when they are used with elements or keys whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals if you want to have compareto inconsistent with equals it is recommended that you instead use an explicit comparator by providing a class that implements comparator

795480
cassini	iis
browse 20 of your pages on cassini and you ve used that time anyway
one thing i ve noticed isn t always in the guides is that if you want to debug on a different address than you need to manually set the host to your local iis

798668
moq	typemock
also the syntax of the language for lambdas does not lead to something as clean as c# readability-wise no flames please i m a vb user and i miss some c# features every day and that s partly the attraction for moq
the only testing framework i know of that did something with regards to vb is typemock

799092
udp	tcp
the big thing to know when attempting to use udp is your packets might not all make it over the line which means there is going to be possible data corruption
if you re working on an application where 100 of the data needs to arrive reliably to provide functionality use tcp

801177
wxpython	pyqt
this may not answer your question directly but i chose pyqt because there were no good ui designers for wxpython
apparently you either write your guis by hand or switch to pyqt

803494
super	extends
the difference between this and your implicit super interface is that object has a number of final and protected methods and you couldn t have those modifiers in an interface
since interfaces can only extends other interfaces and object is a class not an interface there must be some implicit interface that is being extended

804348
ecj	javac
for the record i tried to compile the sample code with javac javac 1.6.0_13 and ecj eclipse java compiler 0.894_r34x 3.4.2 release and javac complained loudly and failed to produce any .class files while ecj only complained about some unused variables warnings and produced all the expected .class files
i don t claim to easily understand those complex generic types but if you find some code that compiles in javac and doesn t in ecj the eclipse compiler then file a bug report with both sun and eclipse and describe the situations cleary best if you also mention that you filed both bug reports and mention their respective urls although for sun it may take a while before the bug is publicly accessible

804685
prng	random
make sure the documentation promises the output is suitable for cryptography not just a regular prng
for example dev random on unix systems is a good source

806384
translation	localization
note a localization tool only manages translation not the original language
summary you should use a localization tool

807966
calloc	malloc
calloc allows you to initialize the memory block you allocate while malloc does not
the main difference between new and malloc i can recall is that you cannot reallocate memory allocated by new using realloc

811797
firefox	safari
i ve heard but cannot validate for ie that both ie and firefox support the view-source pseudo-protocol
firefox on mac indeed understands it but safari does not

811801
haskell	sml
while your class likely wouldn t use them anyways haskell s typeclasses are still an extra bump to get over -- getting them to understand the a versus a distinction in sml is tough enough
sml has a truly interactive interpreter in which functions can be both defined and used

811814
inline	inlining
if it s just returning a class member variable then chances are that the compiler will inline it
if getcontext has to perform a more complicated operation such as looking up the context in a table the compiler probably isn t inlining it and you may wish to only call it once as in your second snippet

811858
daemons	systemd
on linux the back-end daemons may be replaced by gamin but a program linked with fam will work with gamin just fine
behind the scenes fam may be using polling and gamin may be using inotify or dnotify or kqueue but you shouldn t need to worry about the implementation. os x.5 has fsevents which is very different in that it monitors the whole systemd instead of specified files and directories but would also satisfy your needs

comparator	comparable
now adding to student will also make the compiler ensure that there s a public int comparator method on student
but without the implements comparable even if the compiler knows there s a method student.compareto it doesn t know that that comparator is the comparable.compareto

actionscript	mxml
from a programmer s viewpoint the big difference between flash and flex is not so much which ide application you use for programming but whether you program in actionscript as only or use the flex framework and mxml to program your applications
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as

actionscript	mxml
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as
i would add to your list these pros cons flex pros easier for non-programmers to get into application development you can quickly combine components to create small applications components can provide an advantage in large-scale projects cons customizing the look of components can take a lot longer than anticipated depending on the visual style you re looking for when you find out you need a custom component that doesn t exist you might need to go back to flash to do the real programming work and packaging of the component the flexibility of flex means you will be reading a lot of documentation bugs in the flex framework you eventually will need to compromise with the architecture of the flex framework flash or flex ide in actionscript project mode pros easier for someone with a programming background

memcached	apc
memcached is a distributed caching system whereas apc is non-distributed - and mainly an opcode cache
if and only if you have a web application which has to live on different webservers loadbalancing you have to use memcache for distributed caching. if not just stick to apc and its cache

memcached	apc
if and only if you have a web application which has to live on different webservers loadbalancing you have to use memcached for distributed caching. if not just stick to apc and its cache
you should always use an opcode cache which apc is also apc will get integrated into php6 iirc so why not start using it now

mail things this setup doesn t cover i don t have mac os 10.4 i only test the latest version of opera not any earlier versions due to it s small userbase i test safari 3 and safari 4 both one on windows and one on the mac not both versions on both platforms

opera	safari
mail things this setup doesn t cover i don t have mac os 10.4 i only test the latest version of opera not any earlier versions due to it s small userbase i test safari 3 and safari 4 both one on windows and one on the mac not both versions on both platforms
now safari 4 is still in beta anyway

jruby	mri
some gems target specific platforms mongrel there s a mri one and a jruby one
also jruby cannot use gems that have native extensions c code unless they use the ffi which most do not - yet

typemock	nmock
typemock can do this because it utilizes the clr profiler to intercept and redirect calls
rhinomocks nmock and moq cannot do this because these libraries are simpler

820823
punctuation	words
if there are other characters besides spaces that you don t want to match some kinds of punctuation stick them in the construct as well of course
aniz in organization is not a complete words -- it s a part of a words

821614
realloc	strcpy
also dont forget you should check that realloc doesn t return null
i take this is a code snipet consequently i guess that you are alredy including string.h strcpy is defined as in lines num_righe-1 is a char not a char so it should be strcpy lines + num_righe-1 line

823338
haskell	ocaml
haskell s type system is ambitious and powerful but it is continually being improved which means there is some inconsistency as a result of history
f# essentially uses the .net type system plus ml-like hindley-milner polymorphism see question what is hindley-milner . ocaml is not quite consistent on whether it thinks variants should be statically typed or dynamically typed so it provides both algebraic data types and polymorphic variants

config	ini
the zend framework contains a config parses that parses files that are written in the ini format zend_config_ini it sounds like this is what you are using
the config file should not be located in your document root and if it is not in your document root then no re-write rules are required since no-one can access it anyway

823380
config	ini
the config file should not be located in your document root and if it is not in your document root then no re-write rules are required since no-one can access it anyway
the ini format is specialized to provide both the ability to have a hierarchy of configuration data keys and inheritance between configuration data sections

824472
daemons	systemd
bugs with thread.sleep under windows if timing is crucial to your application then an inelegant but practical way to get round these bugs is to leave a daemons thread running throughout the duration of your application that simply sleeps for a large prime number of milliseconds long.max_value will do
this way the interrupt period will be set once per invocation of your application minimising the effect on the systemd clock and setting the sleep granularity to 1ms even where the default interrupt period isn t 15ms

824586
mvp	presenter
based on what you ve told me i would recommend that you use the passive mvp model mentioned in the article above
my main assumptions are your dealing with an existing codebase of webforms apps you need to use thirdparty .net controls for existing functionality your working on existing apps and don t have time to re architect them any asp.net web apps you work on in the future you can incrementally apply the passive mvp and get the benefits of tdd straight away your view codebehind + aspx essentially become dumb and just perform simple tasks take information given by the presenter responds to events and provides information back to the presenter i ve used this model extensively for web forms development and i couldn t imagine not being able to unit test my model and presenter code
