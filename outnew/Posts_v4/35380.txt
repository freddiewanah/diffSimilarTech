bash	tcsh
on some operating systems bin sh might be the same command as bin bash . not all unix shells are based on the bourne shell
in particular csh and its derivative tcsh are largely incompatible with the bourne-derived shells

32000201
multiplying	addition
you could loop over the values of worker_list which is really a dictionary not a list and you could sum the sums with a nested expression or sum all list numbers by chaining them then multiplying that sum by 13 demo
you are replacing the total value each time if you wanted to add the result of the expression to the running total use addition or better yet augmented assignment note that you don t have to predefine worker

32000995
daemons	systemd
invoking that block informs the service that the application has completely processing of this set of events and the daemons can move on
the block is created and owned by the systemd and as such an application should not attempt to modify or change it other than copying the block which is the right thing to do

32002198
awt	swing
first of all this is not swing it s awt try and think about it like this
in swing and many other graphics based frameworks work like a artiest canvas where what ever was painted onto it first will still remain unless you paint over it first let s have a closer look at the code.

32004642
opera	google-chrome
if something is not understandable for you in this config you can read more details about it on the following page if you want you can add more browsers like edge safari opera etc.
connect your pcs to the selenium hub as a node with the configuration file and with the webdrivers as well create a new file with the following name startseleniumnode.cmd and add the following command in it you can download the latest google-chrome and ie webdriver on the same page where you downloaded the selenium server standalone write some java code it is just an example i m sure that there are better solutions

32007664
ssl	https
see how exactly https ssl works
if you are receiving the post data via https then it is encrypted in transit and not easily intercepted

32010482
swift	objective-c
these could be called from your swift classes in the same framework
as far as i know you can not directly import objective-c files into swift in a framework

32010482
swift	objective-c
as far as i know you can not directly import objective-c files into swift in a framework
but you could do it in another objective-c classes in he same framework

32014350
super	self
the following demo will work in python 2 and 3 and in python 2 it prints the name of each class thanks to the metaclass so i ll use that output first the imports and setup to make the printing nicer import inspect class meta type def __repr__ cls return cls.__name__ next we define a function to tell us what s going on based on the super object itself finally we declare a class hierarchy based on the example from the wikipedia entry on c3 linearization for a sufficiently complex example note the metaclass repr doesn t work in python3 but the attribute assignment won t break it
also note that we use the full super call of super name self which is equivalent to super in python 3 and will still work now when we print the mro of z we get the method resolution order defined by this algorithm applied to the inheritance tree and when we call z because our function uses the mro we ll visit each method in order and we stop at object.__init__

32018498
portrait	landscape
so tablets will always use landscape orientation for your app and phones will always use portrait orientation
there are multiple ways to force portrait mode but my preferred way to do so is the to use the following code for each activity inside androidmanifest.xml later on if and when you decide to create an alternate landscape layout for tablets you can change those same lines in androidmanifest.xml to this the nosensor setting tells your app to use the natural orientation for the device and will not change if the user rotates the device

32020862
swift	objective-c
so it does not make sense to explicitly mark say a subclass of uiviewcontroller as objective-c because the swift compiler does it for you
objective-c on class declarations means the annotated class will be exposed to the objective-c runtime

32020862
swift	objective-c
you can try to omit the annotation from a pure swift class not a subclass of nsobject then you are unable to use this class in objective-c code it won t appears in the genrated header file used by your objective-c code
note that any classes inheriting nsobject or any of its subclasses will automatically implicitly be marked objective-c

32021413
opencv	emgucv
using c++ and opencv this window does appear and you can choose from the installed codecs installed on your computer using c# and emgucv with the -1 for the codec dialog selection i get the window but some items do not work once selecting the codec as you can see the codec selection is not the same even though the same pc was used
the fact remains using c++ and opencv this line of code works using c# and emgucv this line of code does not edit i ended up just using cvinvoke.cv_fourcc i y u v which gives me pretty good compression and video quality

32022005
apache	nginx
the other answer provided here gives you a good idea of what that does but it essentially sits between django and nginx apache your webserver and passes the information between the two so what you need on your server python django wsgi server uwsgi gunicorn web server nginx apache . the client does not need any of those things a development machine only needs python and django which runs its own test server
python django and apache nginx should be installed on the server

32022249
google-chrome	firefox
here is a page that is supposed to work but it doesn t - read the very last comment - they describe the problem in a different way but it is the same problem i just tested the page again in google-chrome and it seems to work fairly satisfactorily
with firefox the problem exists

32022871
persistent	transient
cascading is hibernate s way of using transitive persistent model
transitive persistent is a technique that allows you to propagate persistent to transient object not yet saved in database and detached sub-graphs child objects automatically

32022871
persistent	transient
transitive persistent is a technique that allows you to propagate persistent to transient object not yet saved in database and detached sub-graphs child objects automatically
for example a newly created child object of already persistent parent object should automatically become persistent without a call to save or persist methods

32025698
build.gradle	gradlew
so your project build.gradle must look like and module build.gradle must have that plugin apply plugin com.android.databinding after all check in your module you re using latest buildtoolsversion right now it is 22.0.1
i am not sure that s required but it possibly will make you feel good about you re on the bleeding edge of technology _ buildtoolsversion 22.0.1 resync gradlew and rebuild your project

32028539
uiview	subviews
if you add it as a subviews at a different position using addsubview method it will be removed from the first position and added as a subviews to the new position. in your case to add more subviews you have to create more uiview objects not use a single global uiview. if the layout is repetitive a uitableview uicollectionview is a better choice
you should know a uiview can have a single superview parent

32029488
multiplying	multiplication
because it is the result of multiplying the base by itself a certain number of times which is how exponents work
because base is being multiplied by power base exponent - 1 and power base exponent - 1 itself is not being returned each iteration where exponent is not 0 essentially adds another multiplication of the base onto the result

32030867
awt	swing
you should not be adding awt components to a swing gui
canvas is an awt component

32032078
swift	objective-c
they should not need to change after init and it s safer to use let to tell swift that they can t change
the use of is a call to the superclass skspritenode s setter for texture settexture in objective-c

32036086
casting	autoboxing
here primitive narrowing casting will take place as casting from long to int may result in loss of some precision
in above line casting of l is not possible to int because wrapper classes are only by autoboxing and unboxing

32037457
config	ini
from first glance it look like short tags might not be turned on in your php config
using short tags instead of the long tags requires that the short_open_tag php ini directive be set

32040695
udp	tcp
for example in video games typically don t need a reliable network but the speed is the most important and using udp for games has the advantage of reducing network delay
comparing tcp with udp connection-less protocols like udp assure speed but not reliability of packet transmission

32041082
boost	allocator
if you don t want to do that yourself consider using boost type_erasure
also note that you are paying for this encapsulation with unnecessary dynamic memory allocator cache misses virtual function calls that probably cannot be inlined and triply redundant code same functions in iterator iteratr_base and iterator_helper

32041603
namenode	hdfs
5 format if necessary at this point if you have changed the value hadoop.tmp.dir you should reformat the namenode by hdfs namenode -format
if not remove the temporary files already present in the tmp directory you are using default tmp 6 start nodes and yarn in sbin start the name and data node by using the start-dfs.sh script and yarn with start-yarn.sh and evaluate the output of jps . start-dfs.sh . start-yarn.sh at this point if namenode datanode nodemanager and resourcemanager are all running you should be set to go

32042429
apache	nginx
the two advantages of apache nginx over the dev server that come to mind immediately django dev server isn t designed with security in mind
apache nginx being designed to be exposed over the network have had and continue to have effort put into finding fixing vulnerabilities that the django dev server just hasn t had

32044653
sudo	passwd
when you use sudo the shell this starts will ask for a passwd on the tty - it specifically doesn t read standard input for this information
since flask and other web applications typically run detached from a terminal sudo has no way to ask for a passwd so it looks for a program that can provide the passwd

32046376
implements	extends
you will get a proxy implements only the serializable interface
you have 3 options to solve it force class based proxies by configuring the proxyfactorybean create an interface and implement it force class based proxies by not extends random

32046376
implements	extends
you have 3 options to solve it force class based proxies by configuring the proxyfactorybean create an interface and implements it force class based proxies by not extends random
the last option would be the easiest simply don t extends random this will force the use of class-based proxies

32046992
udp	tcp
tcp not udp is also possible though doesn t guarantee application logic actually processes the notification
however udp is the default for snmp for good reasons as described at this so answer

32048301
implements	extends
java allows classes like u to implements multiple interfaces
because u can extends exactly one class abstract or not

32049006
inline	inlining
if the compiler can t see the function definition it can t inline it link-time optimization changes that but use of lto is not very widespread yet and most libraries do not ship with lto-enabled binaries that would allow link-time inlining
you should read inline as this function definition appears inline in this file not calls to this function should be inlined

32049006
inline	inlining
you should read inline as this function definition appears inline in this file not calls to this function should be inline
so the inline keyword is useful for allowing the compiler to see function definitions in multiple files which means it is possible for it to optimise the calls away by inlining them

32049006
inline	inlining
that doesn t necessarily make it more likely to be inline than any other function defined in the same translation unit
for functions that are called from multiple translation units defining the functions in headers and making them inline is necessary condition for the compiler to inline them but it is not sufficient because the compiler bases its inlining decisions on other conditions

32050175
firefox	safari
basically now i have followed the standard syntax rather than using webkit which is working perfectly fine in firefox desktop browser.firefox supports standard style syntax so according to this search when transitions not working on firefox simply use the standard syntax for css if you want to get it work on firefox i tested it and its working like a charm on desktop firefox but not smoothly on mobile firefox browser
i have found the solution for above issue actually yes the webkit is for safari but standard syntax are supported by firefox chrome internet-explorer 10 that is in above javascript replaced with similarly to and to and its ready for firefox desktop browser

32050534
google-chrome	firefox
essence from the mdn about let keyword the keyword let is supported in google-chrome only for testing purposes only in the console and not in the normal flow
google-chrome doesn t support let but firefox does

32050534
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t support let but firefox does
replace the following with google-chrome makes a strict decision on type attribute

32051579
pdfbox	itext
... ps this tool is pdfbox using pdfbox v1.8.10 the current release version in this method returns for the section shown above this is not really a neat column-wise extraction but certain blocks of information like address blocks remain together
getting the same output with itext sharp actually is very easy one merely has to explicitly use the simpletextextractionstrategy instead of the locationtextextractionstrategy which is used by default one has to replace this line by with the exception of one space character per dataset itext sharp extracts destination pick-up instead of destination pick-up the results are identical

32052785
noexcept	throw
keep in mind that noexcept is a clue to the compiler that it does not need provide mechanisms to properly unroll the stack frame in this particular function to protect from an exception allowing it to optimize a bit more
if an exception is throw anyway proper recovery may not be possible

32052981
decoder	encoder
likewise your code also doesn t deal with cases where the decoder outputs a number significantly bigger than frame_size like 10 frame_size expected by the encoder in which case you ll get overruns - basically your 1 1 decoder encode mapping is the main source of your problem
as a solution consider the swrcontext a fifo where you input all decoder samples and loop over it until it s got less than frame_size samples left

32054169
google-chrome	firefox
while the intl object may exist in some ecmascript-standard browsers the code above will only work in google-chrome
sadly firefox 40 and ie 11 currently do not have a resolved property in numformat

32056722
cpython	pypy
under the normal extension couchbase._libcouchbase contains the normal cpython extension code which is built
since cpyext doesn t really work under pypy the building of the code is disabled on that platform and you are required to inject the ffi module beforehand

32058777
jlist	jlabel
have an instance of jlist which contains jlabel with icons you don t understand the concept of models and renderers
you jlist does not contains jlabel

32058777
jlist	jlabel
you jlist does not contains jlabel
the renderer of the jlist is a jlabel which happens to display an icon

32062338
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview
and also inside your oncreate you don t have to redeclare the views just do plus add an edittext on your welcome.xml
the problem lies in both of these do not do findviewbyid without setcontentview called or especially outside the methods

32067421
shadowing	named
the f# code is just a condensed aka light version of this the sort of c# equivalent would be something like this in the context of having nested scopes c# doesn t allow shadowing of named but f# and almost all other languages do
in fact according to the font of all knowledge c# is unusual in being one of the few languages that explicitly disallow shadowing in this situation

32068805
junit	testng
the javadoc is saying to use it for junit and i think mockitojunitrunner mockitorule is a better way but not for testng
btw powermocktestcase is the equivalent of mockitojunitrunner when you use testng

32071185
trie	tree
if you are afraid about worst case behavior of hash tables you could use a trie or sort and iterate to filter out dupes once you have filtered out all duplicates create a suffix-tree for all the remaining strings. after creating the suffix tree for each string check if it exists as a suffix of some string which is not itself
this is done by following the path on the suffix tree from the root until the end of the string and if your only option is the exact same string it s not a substring otherwise - it is

32076945
google-chrome	firefox
we should clarify that the console plugin is only guaranteed against google-chrome
according to the relevant console plugin does not fail on error on firefox issue console plugin reliably works in google-chrome only this is because the firefoxdriver implements log grabbing slightly differently

32079722
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
now in terms of why you want to use this in the first place christos points out correctly that by letting asp.net-mvc construct the url your links continue to work even if your routing changes while if you hardcoded the url it would fail
however he misses the point that this doesn t require using html.actionlink

32082929
client-side	server-side
the client file is not at this exact path and does not necessarily even have this filename but when that route is hit the server-side socket.io installed route will serve up the appropriate file for client-side socket.io support
there is a nice advantage to doing it this way because any time you upgrade your server-side socket.io library you will automatically get a new client-side library embedded in the server-side library that will always keep the two in sync

32083006
mongodb	bson
these generally aren t suitable for database backups -- see the mongodb manual for supported backup and recovery tutorials
the strict mode export supported by mongoexport and mongoimport is extended json strict mode representations of bson types conform to the json rfc

32083098
swift	objective-c
applescriptobjc cannot be used directly in swift because the command loadapplescriptobjectivecscripts of nsbundle is not bridged to swift
however you can use a objective-c bridge class for example asobjc.h asobjc.m create a applescript source file form the applescriptobjc template asexcel.applescript script asexcel property parent class nsobject on openexceldocument filepath set asfilepath to filepath as text tell application microsoft excel set sourcebook to open workbook workbook file name asfilepath repeat try get workbooks return end try delay 0.5 end repeat end tell end opendocument on valueofusedrange tell application microsoft excel tell active sheet set activerange to used range return value of activerange end tell end tell end valueofusedrange end script link to the applescriptobjc framework if necessary

32084215
client-side	server-side
at least not client-side javascript
you need a server-side languaje like php

32084882
spaces	linefeed
the following code produces these results the pattern matches goodline appearing at the beginning of a line as well as greedily matching characters after it that are not linefeed as well as linefeed that are followed by spaces characters
if your text actually has tabs after linefeed instead of spaces you can change the spaces into a tab

32088870
treemap	linkedhashmap
a hashmap cannot be sorted you have to use a treemap like brijesh suggested your elements have to implement comparable or you have to provide a compartor during construction
if you just want insertion order you could also use a linkedhashmap

32089141
equals	compareto
if they are not equals i.e compareto returns 0 return that value
if the dates are equals use simpledateformat to convert the time strings to two date objects

32091023
icomparable	gethashcode
icomparable is meant for sorting
is to check if two items are equal or not but it also has the gethashcode method that the dictionary is using internally

32093901
lxml	libxml2
similarly if lxml v3.4+ is not available one can write a tree traversal function of their own
it looks like getpath underlying libxml2 call xmlgetnodepath produces positional expression xpath for namespaced documents. user mzjn in the comments section pointed out that since lxml v3.4.0 a function getelementpath produces a human-readable xpath with fully qualified tag names using clark notation

32096298
queue	fifo
so our data type being a queue i m not really supposed to mess with the internal arrangement nor should i care per se
if i m using a queue i basically want fifo behavior

32098916
comparator	comparable
there s no reason to use comparator
indeed many types that are comparable do not implement comparator

32105917
jar	war
you might think well enough just add the jdbc driver jar file to the project
but no in a web app servlet environment we must not include the jdbc driver in our build our war file folder

32107497
uicollectionview	uitableview
the short answer is that currently this feature isn t possible due to apple s design of uicollectionview
unlike uitableview which can check for this behavior by dequeuing a cell which would return an instantiated prototype cell and tell us that the reuseidentifier has already been created like we do in firebasetableviewdatasource here uicollectionview doesn t provide a similar method it only gives given that this method requires an a indexpath as it has to return a non-nil object it will throw an nsinternalinconsistencyexception when we try to read an arbitrary object at initialization since there exist no items for it to read from

32108309
phpstorm	webstorm
open keychain access applications utilities keychain access certificate assistant create a certificate add your certificate name identity type self signed root certificate type code signing open terminal sudo codesign -s your certificate name -f applications webstorm.app restart computer not always open webstorm.app accept incoming network connections for the last time the same process should work for any jetbrains ide phpstorm pycharm etc
i had to create my own certificate on keychain access then codesign webstorm via terminal

32108404
swift	objective-c
from the apple docs unlike subclassing in objective-c swift subclassing do not inherited their superclass initializers by default
swift s approach prevents a situation in which a simple initializer from a superclass is inherited by a more specialized subclassing and is used to create a new instance of the subclassing that is not fully or correctly initialized

32108906
jar	war
consider the following dependency tag the provided scope tells maven to use the log4j jar when compiling but to exclude it from the build so it would not appear in your war
if on the other hand you used a scope of compile or runtime then it would appear in the war

32109020
pthreads	fork
to unify the best answers i see so far which aren t necessarily the most popular according to the fork manual you re missing the header include and depending on the pthreads standard you use
note that this is an error in the program when a posix-compliant os is targeted which brings me to the next point those will only work on posix-compliant oses that support fork of course.

32117833
freebsd	linux
as systems are very different from each other libraries vary and a program for say linux cannot be run on freebsd despite the latter using also elf because they are not linked to the same libraries
to compile a windows executable on linux a technique known as cross-compilation can be used. a compiler is after all just a program that writes into a binary file so any compiler can in theory write code for any platform as long as the target system s libraries are available to be linked against

32118736
strcpy	malloc
you should use here strcpy as also suggested by others
in function the second statement changes word to point away from the allocated memory.you are not copying the string ab to the area of heap allocated by malloc

32121676
addition	multiplication
for cl i saw no difference whether or not mkl was linked but a slight none 554.132 total time addition -2006.37 130 milliseconds
total time multiplication 1.11832e+007 137 milliseconds

32122151
ssl	https
the incoming connection isn t secure until both peers have negotiated an ssl handshake including the certificates and a cipher suite
detail consider a web browser that downloads the https page - in that case it checks the server s certificate and puts it in the trust store

32127030
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
it is entirely up to that authority on whether this stuff is case-sensitive or not
in the case of c# and iis the backing store for the parsed query string in the httprequest object is a system.collections.specialized.namevaluecollection which happens to be case-insensitive by default

32127450
prepare	execute
well this is best explained by an anonymous author on php s doc so let me copy paste there is a common misconception about how the placeholders in prepare statements work they are not simply substituted in as escaped strings and the resulting sql execute
instead a dbms asked to prepare a statement comes up with a complete query plan for how it would execute that query including which tables and indexes it would use which will be the same regardless of how you fill in the placeholders

32129242
decoder	encoder
if your black box only supports the baseline profile it ll not be able to decoder a stream using high capabilities
in vlc you can set the h.264 profile to be used by the x264 encoder like this h.264 levels think of levels as a constraint indicator of required decoder performance

32134238
strcpy	malloc
once you ve allocated memory using malloc you should use strcpy to copy the data into the allocated memory
that said some advice please see why not to cast the return value of malloc and family in c

32134334
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you can not get the correct frame in viewwillappear system will give you correct frame in viewdidappear and viewwilllayoutsubviews viewdidlayoutsubviews
if your presented view is same as screen height width you can use uiscreen mainscreen .bound to get the correct dimensions in viewwillappear

32135990
implements	extends
you should not implements the actual spring data repository instead you have to declare another custom interface where you can put your custom methods
let s say you have a myrepository defined as now you want to add your custom findtuplesbymyarg for a sake of purpose you need to create custom repository interface afterwards comes the implementation of custom interface and we need to change myrepository declaration so it extends custom repository so that and you can easily access your findtuplesbymyarg by injecting myrepository pay attention that names are important here you need to have impl postfix by default configs in repo implementation

32142949
google-chrome	firefox
this is sort of a known behavior with google-chrome
firefox does seem to be able to handle the removal of animation smoothly with transition but google-chrome doesn t do so

32143759
jsf	tapestry
my opinion is not to use jsf if we you have complex pages with many components
i think tapestry is more optimized for this

32144452
client-side	server-side
i would caution against using client-side redirects however as they look very unprofessional and in the case of the js redirect aren t even guaranteed to work
not sure if you re looking for a client-side redirect or server-side

32144452
client-side	server-side
not sure if you re looking for a client-side redirect or server-side
but here s both server-side php redirect to redirect people via php you can use header

32147915
ionic	angular
it s pretty easy as you can read in here github.com zachsoft ionic-material#can-i-use-ionic-and-angular-material-together it s much better to use ionic material than angular material for ionic
here you have another module for ionic with material but i have not tested this

32148723
udp	tcp
however there s still a problem with dns traffic since it uses udp not tcp
you can work around that by changing the first rule to iptables -p input -p tcp drop so it only drops tcp traffic but not udp traffic

32149225
ng-app	ng-controller
no there is not implicit controller there behind the scene its when you don t specified a module in angular ng-app it will initialize angular on page with no angular module
but as you don t provided the ng-controller here angular will create it will utilize will create variable inside

32150907
hex	binary
this works because hexadecimal is base 16 and binary is base 2 and 16 is the 4th power of 2 so it takes 4 binary digits to make 1 hex digit
10 on the other hand is not a power of 2 so we can t convert binary to decimal nearly as easily. 2 - split the string of hex digits into pairs

32150907
hex	binary
10 on the other hand is not a power of 2 so we can t convert binary to decimal nearly as easily. 2 - split the string of hex digits into pairs
when converting a number into ascii every 2 hex digits is a character

32151207
build.gradle	gradlew
so i would expect you to not have a sourcesets closure in build.gradle and to just use the stock sourcesets structure for your various bits src main ... debug jnilibs res raw release jnilibs res raw
gradlew gradlew for android has an expected structure for a sourceset android resources in res java source tree in java pre-compiled jni libraries in jnilibs assets in assets etc

32153434
httpclient	okhttp
you have to use urlconnection or downgrade to sdk 22 compile com.android.support appcompat-v7 22.2.0 if you need sdk 23 add this to your gradle you also may try to download and include httpclient jar directly into your project or use okhttp instead
httpclient is not supported any more in sdk 23

32155850
octal	decimal
thus 019 gives 19 because 9 is not an octal digit
here some decimal numbers and their octal notations 1 1 | 5 5 | 9 11 | 13 15 2 2 | 6 6 | 10 12 | 14 16 3 3 | 7 7 | 11 13 | 15 17 4 4 | 8 10 | 12 14 | 16 20 as you can see since we have only 8 digits available 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 becomes 10 and 16 8+8 becomes 20 10+10

32156106
gson	jackson
gson doesn t care about jackson annotations
if you want these annotations to be taken into account use jackson to deserialize your json

32161361
single-quotes	double-quotes
here s a subroutine that take a list of strings filenames and returns a space-separated string of quoted versions of the strings that guarantee literal use by the shell example uses most posix shell metacharacters this passes the following to bin sh -c shown here as a pure literal without any quoting note how each input string is in enclosed in single-quotes and how the only character that needed quoting among all input strings was which as discussed was replaced with
this should output the input strings as-is one on each line on windows the analogous subroutine looks like this this works analogous to quoteforsh above except that double-quotes are used to enclose the tokens because cmd.exe doesn t support single-quoting

32163359
equals	compareto
to elaborate more sorted set used compareto to check if the two elements a b are equals or not and if the class for a b only overrides compareto method and not equals method then we could have a scenario where compareto method returns 0 but equals method return false which is quite weird and inconsistent
let s say i have a name class as shown below - the output is as shown below - true false 0 false now this shows the ambiguity since we haven t overridden the equals which in this case is returning false but compareto is returning 0 and hence sortedset considers the two objects n1 and n2 equals and hence adding n2 into the set return false as shown in the sysout but they are not equals

32167239
client-side	server-side
client-side javascript cannot do that but it s possible on server-side
basic technically steps send those files to server server does whatever you want and sends result back if you are using node.js it s pretty easy send files to server using multer modify files server-side using node-stream and send back this article describes basic mp3 file concatenation on node.js but if you still want client-side

division	subtract	division	exponent
division do a long division algorithm on the mantissas then subtract the exponent
renormalization might not be necessary depending on how you implement the long division

build.gradle	gradlew
i suggest that you create a completely new project using android studio and copy it s root level build.gradle file to the existing project
you cannot call android until after you apply the android plugin com.android.tools.build gradlew

dictionary	map
to obtain a dictionary you have several strategies for instance or perhaps loggers
the reason is that map can return only arrays and not dictionaries

32169256
union	distinct
select distinct m.msg_id m.uid_fk m.message s.created m.share_count u.username u.last_login m.uploads s.uid_fk as share_uid s.ouid_fk as share_ouid from messages m users u ......... union select distinct m.msg_id m.uid_fk m.message now as created add some default value m.share_count u.username u.last_login m.uploads 0 as share_uid 0 as share_ouid
that s because you are doing an union and in that case both part of select should contain exact same number of columns which isn t satisfying for your scenario

gtk	cairo	gtk	gdk
elib_intl.py can be used with pygtk gtk 2
from gi.repository import gtk gdk import cairo import locale #for multilanguage support import gettext import elib_intl elib_intl.install pdfbooklet share locale if you are using gtk 3 you will probably receive an error for line 447 this error indicates module not found

swift	objective-c
for this reason preprocessor directives are not imported in swift. build configurations swift code and objective-c code are conditionally compiled in different ways
swift code can be conditionally compiled based on the evaluation of build configurations

32171316
setcontentview	findviewbyid
your chronometer variable is not initialized in mainactivity.oncreate because layout is inflated setcontentview called only in secondactivity.oncreate
so findviewbyid in your mainactivity has no effect

32171999
implements	extends
i got method does not override or implements a method from a supertype which is the error i have expected
when you do this override public void loader graphics g2 you have to ensure the superclass which your subclass extends to in this case class jpanel must also contains the method you are overriding in this case loader

32173275
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
if you have to use nsurlconnection to support older operating systems you might consider subclassing nsurlrequest and adding extra data
note that this alternative approach does not work with nsurlsession and you ll need to provide your own redirect handler because otherwise you ll end up getting back generic nsurlrequest objects whenever a redirect happens iirc

haskell	ocaml
a summary of the discussion in comments show in haskell doesn t work like this and can t
in haskell would be translated to an explicit module argument in ocaml

dropbox	icloud
last year i removed icloud support from my app and added support for other sync services like dropbox and google drive
of course this is not a 1 to 1 replacement for icloud no live sync etc but at least these services work

32178772
implements	extends
in scala you do not have to implements the main method as for java
just extends the app trait is sufficient

sum	coalesce
id must be pesent in table a only select id sum a.adata coalesce sum b.bdata 0 coalesce sum c.cdata 0 from a left join b using id left join c using id group by id
id doesn t have to exist in any particular table select id coalesce sum a.adata 0 coalesce sum b.bdata 0 coalesce sum c.cdata 0 from a full outer join b using id full outer join c using id group by id

koa differs from express by having a very minimal core
for example express ships with a static webserver middleware but koa does not

32187062
express	koa
for example express ships with a static webserver middleware but koa does not
the fact that you need to import a separate module to do x in is simply how things are done in koa

32190378
youtube	vimeo
bonus no api keys are needed no server-side proxy is required example for your va770wplx-q video you can try a link like this or this for jsonp url those links have a standard url of a youtube video passed as the url parameter
it works not only with youtube but also with vimeo and other sites with urls like demo here is a simple example using jquery see demo on js bin

32190522
octal	decimal
if you are not getting any error from your code that means the function - split_file - is not being called at all and this is because of - int 016 when you prefix a number with 0 in python 2.x you are defining it as an octal number
example - 14 is the decimal representation for octal number 0o16

32190892
youtube	vimeo
no need for api key to get the video title you will not need an api key and you ll need to make a request to change the youtube url for the video that you need
it also works with vimeo and many other supported sites with urls like details it is not possible to get the video title using the video id with api v3 without the api key if you use the api directly

32190896
dictionary	map	serializable	deserialization
this is especially true when working with django models because django doesn t natively serializable model objects down to python dictionary it prefers the actual model object
the power of a serializer comes in the deserialization where it can map fields across models and build out relations for you

32191395
realloc	malloc
as per the c11 standard chapter 7.22.3.5 realloc specification emphasis mine if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

32191395
realloc	malloc
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined
... in your case is not a pointer returned by malloc and family

32191399
realloc	malloc
the argument to realloc can be null
if it is not null it must be a value that was returned by the malloc family of functions

32192576
move	drag
then we need add it to the page and then move it off the page as it s required that the element be visible so display none isn t allowed interpretation 2 now if you mean change the size of an image as you move it around the page then you can do that with jqueryui s .draggable working demo here
interpretation 1 if you mean ghost image as in the image copy that shows when you click and drag an image on any website as you drag it to a folder see screenshot below illustrating what i mean then you can do that with the new html5 draggable label

32193084
implements	extends
if you are implements the closeable interface directly you are required to implements close
if you are extends a class that already implements close then the contract has been fulfilled by your superclass and you do not need to override it

32195363
listview	gridview
i don t think we can put girdview or listview here because they are not shareable see the xaml resources must be shareable section of the resourcedictionary and xaml resource references uielement can never be shareable anyway the best practice is not simply to replace the current girdview with another existing one but instead you should modify your binding to another data source
the problem happens on this part instead of the applying the listview gridview to the zoominview zoomoutview

32196107
apache	nginx
sure you can in a container you can run apache on any port you want
but when you do docker run then you need to map this container port to a host port which won t be 80 since it is already taken but for instance 8080 docker run -d -p 8080 80 yourimage my goal would be that the people could access sitea.com siteb.com sitec.com and sitez.com that is called reverse proxy and you could run on port 80 a nginx in a container or not which would then reverse proxy back to sitea b or c each running on different port in container or not

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome happens to handle it nicely allowing the parent window main browser window to receive the mouseup event
apparently firefox and ie do not

32197308
google-chrome	firefox
the way to simulate it in google-chrome is to click on the slider and start to drag it but when the alert opens do not release the mouse button instead use the spacebar to click the ok button
after the alert closes while still holding the mouse button down move left to right and you ll see the same result that you saw in firefox

32199136
matlab	s-function
level 1 s-function block still exists in matlab primarily for legacy reasons level 2 is a improved version
there is nothing you can implement in a level 1 s-function which you can not implement in a level 2 s-function

32201156
rsa	aes
no you can t use aes as a replacement of rsa because as you already noted then aes key must be shared
a 460 bit rsa key doesn t provide any security nowadays

32202419
client-side	server-side
solution if you are not performing data processing on the server simply remove bserverside true and datatables will perform sorting filtering and ordering on the client-side
cause you have server-side processing mode enabled with bserverside true

32203164
octal	decimal
some older browsers went beyond the specification which they were allowed to in the past and treated numbers starting with a 0 as octal base 8 rather than decimal
naturally end users who type in say 0123 as a number probably mean the number 123 not the number 83 123 in octal 83 decimal

32203855
prng	random
another story would be if you had multiple instances of the same prng but that s not the case that s c not c++ and rand is static
it s all about what you want to do with the random data.

textview	imageview
if you want to add a margin from his parent try this keeping add to your textview not keeping use padding in the parent view like the example
for api 18 and earlier the margin is being applied after the alignment so if the margin in the imageview is greater than 0 you will get your textview moved

32205495
swift	objective-c
in order to create instance variable in swift you can just declare variable like this however i would recommend to add private in front of var or let so it will not be accessed outside the class - same as instance variable in objective-c computed class variable can be defined like this i would recommend to use class vars only if you want to override it in a subclass otherwise you can use
what you show is not called class variable it is called instance variable in objective-c

32205950
firefox	safari
unfortunately it also doesn t help with firefox but perhaps it will help in the direction of a solution
as for it sometimes working in chrome safari - i think this is due to a bug in the webkit blink which has been plaguing developers for a while

32207022
serializable	deserialization
so while you can make the rest of your objects serializable you ll have to make sure to mark any domino member variables as transient and re-fetch them as needed
the dominodocument wrapper class is serializable but you ll have to call one of the methods on it after deserialization restorewrappeddocument probably so it doesn t save you too much in this case

32208800
boost	allocator
i was trying to understand the strategy of boost pool chunks pre-allocation.i read this and also this boost doc but it is still not clear for me if it is possible to request a specific initial number of pre-allocated chunks when the pool is instantiated
no it is not possible except if you write your own allocator which may keep some default

32209159
postgresql	mysql
edit - for postgresql postgresql doesn t have the field function
you can define your own see simulating mysql #39

32210054
onkeyup	onkeydown
my changes are use onkeydown instead of onkeyup to trigger the function
onkeydown fires before the letter has been inserted into the text field and so the function doesn t see the key you just typed

32212717
shadowing	named
if you had it would work but as previously stated shadowing builtin functions is not a good idea
you are using which is for comparison not assignment use and don t use next as a variable named as it is shadowing the builtin python function next if flee in next raises the error you see as you have not actually assigned next to any value so you are actually trying to iterate over a reference to the builtin function next

32214394
google-chrome	firefox
if you don t know the specific properties and want a catch-all for all undefined property access then you will need es6 proxy support which is not widely available yet appears to be in some versions of firefox and in microsoft edge but not in google-chrome
so unless this is a firefox or edge-specific project there is no support for what you re asking that is cross browser as this is not an es5-level feature of javascript

32214483
google-chrome	firefox
hopefully a version of the adapter.js polyfill should be available soon that will make this work in google-chrome as well
when you run this fiddle in firefox you ll see checking connected does not use turn this is because the example provides both a stun and a turn server

32214574
queue	fifo
by definition performblockandwait breaks fifo ordering because it jumps the queue of blocks that have already been enqueued
blocks submitted with performblockandwait do not have to wait for other blocks that are running in the queue

32224191
pthreads	fork
if not the classical pthreads means should do fine
you have multiple options here the traditional pthreads fork exec there are literally tons of examples on how to do this in so for example this one

32225460
noexcept	throw
it would be faster to move the existing elements to the new storage but if moving could throw then any already-moved elements would have been altered already and meeting the strong guarantee would not be possible so the library will only try to move them when it knows that can t throw which it can only know if they are noexcept
the special importance of noexcept on move constructors and assignment operators is explained in detail in basically it doesn t enable optimisations in the traditional sense of allowing the compiler to generate better code

32225460
noexcept	throw
the special importance of noexcept on move constructors and assignment operators is explained in detail in basically it doesn t enable optimisations in the traditional sense of allowing the compiler to generate better code
instead it allows other types such as containers in the library to take a different code path when they can detect that moving the element types will never throw

32226302
keystore	jks
i think that you have a corrupted cacerts database keystore or the password that delphi is trying to use is changed for some reason
i m not quite sure whether the delphi ide is working on the main cacerts key store or on its own generated jks file

32226482
implements	extends
below is another way to implements a slideshow
i wrote it just now because i found your code to be pretty confusing not to mention difficult to extends to further images

32228635
implements	extends
i don t know if the strategy pattern can be useful here but it seems that an anonymous class where you can implements flynow and divenow the problem with this approach is that statements like divingcapablebird instanceof swim will return false because the type of divingcapablebird doesn t implements the swim interface
in order to solve this you can implements a class which implements swim and extends bird and will expose both of the methods however there s another issue this structure too - now it turns out that divingcapablebird is not an animal

32228635
implements	extends
in order to solve this you can implements a class which implements swim and extends bird and will expose both of the methods however there s another issue this structure too - now it turns out that divingcapablebird is not an animal
the root of all evil here is that animal should not implements both of the swim and fly interfaces

subtraction	modulo	division	modulo	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
as described here the value of is true for all arithmetic types t that handle overflows with modulo arithmetic that is if the result of addition subtraction multiplication or division of this type would fall outside the range the value returned by such operation differs from the expected value by a multiple of max -min +1
so it does not say about finding modulo but how a + b will behave

32230906
stateless	stateful
if the injected anotherbean is stateless then it makes no sense to call anotherbean.setname
if it is stateful then it does not make sense to inject a stateful bean in a stateless one check what stateful beans are made for

32230906
stateless	stateful
do not use instance variables other then injected ones in a stateless bean
otherwise you are not consistent with your stateful annotation

32231008
g++	gcc
either there is something wrong with your cmake configuration or there is something wrong with your scl invocation or gcc -v gives a different answer to g++ -v in which case check the contents of your toolset
but nullptr not being available and being accepted but not all suggest gcc 4.3 4.4 or 4.5

32231182
implements	extends
you will get a better understanding of kf by these links try to implements multi dimension kf and see how well your system responds to it
if you are not satisfied with the performance of your system then you may have to extends the filter by making some changes

32234418
fold	combinators
but i can also just do note that even better using using fold actually keeps foldl strict because in the example above the lazy tuples add a layer of indirection and make the fold lazy again incidentally
you can encode a normal foldl pretty straightforwardly as a fold i m actually a bit puzzled that this combinators isn t in the library.

32234418
fold	combinators
you can encode a normal foldl pretty straightforwardly as a fold i m actually a bit puzzled that this combinators isn t in the library.
anyways if you have foldl f z you can replace it with fold fold f z id so here you would normally be using with fold you d be making and you can use it as if you want to go back to a list at the end you can do m.tolist

quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
some sorting algorithms quicksort mergesort msd radix sort parallelize really well while others do not heapsort
if they re stored in an array quicksort or a quicksort variant will likely do well because of locality of reference while mergesort might be slow due to the extra memory needed

32234821
quicksort	heapsort
randomized quicksort while still having an o n 2 worst case has a vanishingly small probability of actually hitting that worst case
heapsort is a good algorithm in practice but isn t as fast as the other algorithms in some cases because it doesn t have good locality of reference

32235427
ng-show	ng-class
also you might consider using ng-show instead if you re toggling the visibility of these elements only not their styling
turn privacy variable private to a linking function currently thus inaccessible outside into a property of scope in this case it will be properly evaluated in your ng-class expression

32236132
fileoutputstream	filewriter
for writing streams of raw bytes consider using a fileoutputstream
so if you want to write raw integers or whatever other type the matrix is filewriter isn t the class of choice

32241110
entity-relationship	diagram
not really for generating logical entity-relationship diagram
plus the database diagram within ssms do not have features for printing arranging into heiarchies orthogonal shapes etc

32241110
entity-relationship	diagram
or scripting from the entity-relationship diagram like most data modeling tools do
ssms has a lot of features for scripting just not from the database diagram section of the tool

32247714
n-gram	words
the nltk s ngram taggers all make tag n-gram from the left
but you can easily derive your own tagger from their abstract base class contexttagger this defines a tetragram tagger 2+1+1 where the current words is third in the ngram not last as usual

32249564
ng-view	ng-include
basicly ng-view creates a new view which works with states or routing saying this view gets his own controller and stuff like it would be a html file
and ng-include is if you have like a html template which u need to show on different views and include it to not duplicate code

32253970
nsmutablestring	nsstring
to construct and manage a string that can be changed after it has been created use nsmutablestring
like ramkumar stated in a comment in his answer nsstring is not mutable so you can t change it s value just like that in swift so try changing in your .h file to and now in your .swift file you can do it is stated in the nsstring class reference an immutable string is a text string that is defined when it is created and subsequently cannot be changed

32256808
rspec	capybara
when using capybara with rspec you re not using capybara instead of rspec you are using rspec with some extra stuff thrown in by capybara
as such you can still use context describe it and nest them just like you can when using rspec without capybara

32261032
bower	npm
adding a .config file to your .ebextensions dir to install bower components helps
unfortunately node and npm are not added to the path by default so you need to find the latest node instance and create a symlink

32261279
portrait	landscape
and last but not least the thumbnail image returned by the api for this portrait image is 150 px square and looks like this
since the api returns only 1 set of images as of now but the site is able to show the original aspect ratio images i did some digging around and realized that if you remove the last but 1 section of the url from the square image urls in this example remove c0.135.1080.1080 you get to the original aspect ratio sized and uncropped landscape portrait images

32263589
apache	nginx
so if php is only enabled in apache but you now run nginx no wonder why it doesn t work
setup your virtual hosts in apache if you still want to use it which is probably the case since you had a working apache php stack before attempting this

32266175
bower	npm
i do not think they provide the single file but you can build it very easily using bower
if you have node and npm installed

32269202
backgrounding	multitasking
whether it s considered an abuse of the voip push message privilege to start the app in the backgrounding not for a call but to sync messages to the web i m unsure of but this certainly seems the most likely explanation for how it manages it
regarding how it works even when whatsapp is closed from the multitasking screen it is likely taking advantage of ios 8 s support for the new voip push messaging service

32269716
tortoisegit	svn
tortoisegit is not as good and this may put you off
however i now use the git command line which i much prefer to tortoise svn or any of the git gui s

32269812
mp4	h.264
mp4 is a container specification for video and audio steams and the videos and audios in the container may use different encodings
the subset that is supported on an ipad is definined here - the relevant extract is ios supports many industry-standard video formats and compression standards including the following h.264 video up to 1.5 mbps 640 by 480 pixels 30 frames per second low-complexity version of the h.264 baseline profile with aac-lc audio up to 160 kbps 48 khz stereo audio in .m4v .mp4 and .mov file formats h.264 video up to 768 kbps 320 by 240 pixels 30 frames per second baseline profile up to level 1.3 with aac-lc audio up to 160 kbps 48 khz stereo audio in .m4v .mp4 and .mov file formats mpeg-4 video up to 2.5 mbps 640 by 480 pixels 30 frames per second simple profile with aac-lc audio up to 160 kbps 48 khz stereo audio in .m4v .mp4 and .mov file formats numerous audio formats including the ones listed in audio technologies your case is slightly more complicated in that the video is in a browser on the device - you may not want this automatically to play on a mobile device as with some price plans you may be running up data costs for your users - this is a key reason auto play of videos on mobile devices is not historically supported

32269861
bower	npm
bower itself server side dependency which is made using node and you pull it using npm and manage client side dependency by bower bower is a package management system for client-side programming unlike npm node package manager which is for server side dependencies npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application server side as you know nodejs is not client side so you bower for stuff like .
jquery angular and npm for like .

32285288
daemons	systemd
signals are most probably not what you really want to communicate with a daemons process unless you want to terminate it in a specific manner
also no you can t define your own arbitrary signal numbers as the operating systemd needs to know how they are sent to the process

32285906
gif	png
other option another option may be to convert to mpg format something like this or updated answer i see - you have to use gif for your animation so png is not an option
maybe you can quantize in a different colourspace like this for lab colorspace convert orig.ppm -quantize lab -colors 256 result.gif other options might be yuv rgb - you can get a list of all options with identify -list colorspace original answer the problem is that your ppm file has more colours than the gif format can contain

32287536
config	ini
summary the time required to load config directives which is not the same as the time needed by the app to perform those directives is usually negligible - below one millisecond for most reasonably sized config
so don t worry - ini php or json are performance wise all equally good choices

32287536
config	ini
several modules exist zend opcache apc ... that will cache all php files config included
they will not cache ini files though

rtp	rtcp
members issue a compound rtcp report that contains a receiver report and optionally a sender report if that member has sent any rtp data packets other report types may be included in the compound report as well
rfc 3550 section 6.4 rtp receivers provide reception quality feedback using rtcp report packets which may take one of two forms depending upon whether or not the receiver is also a sender

32288299
gif	png
if you want to convert a tif gif or jpeg to png the command is convert image.tif result.png or convert image.jpg result.png in answer to your questions.
question 1 png is lossless by definition so that is not an issue

cdr	cons
actually cons needs not to be primitive in lisp you can build it with λ. see use of lambda for cons car cdr definition in sicp for details
in python it is translated to def cons x y return lambda pair pair x y def car pair return pair lambda p q p def cdr pair return pair lambda p q q now car cons a b should give you a

aggregate-functions	sum
in sql aggregate-functions like sum avg max min depending on the sql engine do not run on subqueries themselves
consider the following adjustment where sum is used inside the subquery

32299536
inline	inlining
first of all inlining something ie requiring inline substitution of the function body at the point of call doesn t mean that the implementation is constrained to do so 7.1.2 function specifiers 2 a function declaration 8.3.5 9.3 11.3 with an inline specifier declares an inline-functions
the inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the point of call is to be preferred to the usual function call mechanism

32299536
inline	constexpr
there are some examples of language constructs that the standard mandates to be inline and this not a matter of being a good compiler but a compliant one
function call operators of closure types 5.1.2 5 the closure type for a non-generic lambda-expression has a public inline function call operator ... for a generic lambda the closure type has a public inline function call operator member template ... constexpr functions 7.1.5 2 ... constexpr functions and constexpr constructors are implicitly inline 7.1.2

prepare	execute
github issue server-prepared plans postgresql has prepare and deallocate commands to reference the statement when sending execute over the wire

32301458
implements	extends
an object can implements multiple interfaces but can only extends one class so sometimes the user of your loose coupled library may not be able to extends your class
when you extends you incorporate the code of the superclass into yours sometimes there is no code to incorporate so implements is better suited

32301458
implements	extends
when you extends you incorporate the code of the superclass into yours sometimes there is no code to incorporate so implements is better suited
finally it is not the same paradigm when you write b extends a you say i am a i do the same things but i can also make other things

coalesce	nvl
please note that it is a little different than nvl where the value returned by the coalesce needs to be of same type
hence a blank can not be returned by coalesce in the above example

express	node.js
express is not a module it s a framework it gives you an api submodules and methodology and conventions for quickly and easily tying together all the components necessary to put up a modern functional web server with all the conveniences necessary for that static asset hosting templating handling xsrf cors cookie parsing post parsing you name it it probably lets you use it
the http api that s baked into node.js on the other hand is just the http module it can set up http connections and send and receive data as long as it uses the hypertext transfer protocol with the relevant http verb and that s.

ubuntu	debian
if your vps is running the jessie release 8 then jessie uses systemd not init.d as ubuntu and older releases of debian do
thus using the default ubuntu pm2 startup script won t work

in some compilers platforms noexcept functions can be made faster or simpler in code size as the exception setup catch etc doesn t have to be set up

32313000
erlang	elixir
as to the comparison with erlang elixir don t forget they are different paradigms as already mentioned
it is not impossible for the jvm to mimic erlang s behaviour though it is not for what it was intended to and therefore it goes with lots of trade-offs

super	implements
a possible implementation is def get_session_auth_hash self if not self.is_active return inactive return super mycustomuser self .get_session_auth_hash for this to work django.contrib.auth.middleware.sessionauthenticationmiddleware should be in settings.middleware_classes
as tony abou-assaleh i also needed to log out users who were set to inactive so i started by implements his solution

hash-collision	key
find optimal hashkeys trade-offs for optimal read performance all the hash-collision should fit in one block all oracle i o is done per block usually 8k
getting the ideal storage right is tricky and requires knowing the hash algorithm storage size not the same as the block size and number of hash key the buckets

32322714
httpclient	okhttp
alternatively you can also consider okhttp however seems okhttp is now included on android m i have not tested if it would have similar conflict. okhttp has two type of wrapper one is similar to urlconnection one is similar to httpclient you should be able to migrate in a very short time
you cannot import httpclient because it would create conflict with existing library

32327955
spaces	delimiter
but the question is not using a spaces but a comma
because from the parser point of view spaces tabs commas semicolons parenthesis and equals are delimiter

32331504
vmware	virtualbox
my experience is that you should prefer vmware but that s only because i had some crashes and memory loss with virtualbox
the programs use another way to create the virtual machines out of the iso so you have a more stable version in vmware and an other less stable version in virtualbox but the virtualbox virtual machine isn t taking as much space as the vmware machine

32331917
clang	llvm
os x binaries os x is compiled using clang and as apple clang currently has no openmp support by default cran doesn t either
edit according to the llvm project blog openmp support for the clang compiler was completed on may 22 2015 windows binaries seems like more info needed here that the windows toolchain supports openmp and pthreads but it s slow and not enabled by default

32334035
elasticsearch	kibana
while elasticsearch is quite powerful search engine it doesn t make much sense to me to restrict yourself to just search
by splitting your data into fields you will be able to unlock the full analytics power of elasticsearch and use for example kibana to visualize your data

32336771
qthread	qobject
it s a bit of a lie that thread is-a qthread since we cannot use some of the base class s members on it thus breaking the lsp
ideally thread should be a qobject and only internally contain a qthread

32338671
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
as you re reading values in if your array isn t big enough then user realloc to double the size of the array
start by using malloc or calloc to allocate an array of some known starting size and keep track of the current capacity in a variable

azure	hdinsight
the azure blob storage is a safe distributed storage for you data
you can use it whether you use hdinsight or not

32339958
srp	ocp
srp because all dependencies your usercontrol needs must be injected in the consuming window view while this view probably does not need all of these dependencies
and ocp because every you add or delete a dependency from your usercontrol you also need to add or delete this from the consuming window view

32340207
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
i notice your instructions said nothing about the realloc function.
edit if you cannot use any of the standard memory management functions malloc calloc or realloc then the only real alternative i can think of is to create your own memory pool and allocate your table elements from it

32340835

clang implements this in three x86_64 instructions not counting the frame setup and cleanup note that the results for any other input will be pretty much random
so don t do that. i don t think there s any feasible way to extends this method to return values in the 7..63 range directly the structure of the constant doesn t permit it but you can convert the results to that range by multiplying the result by 7

multiplying	multiplication
so don t do that. i don t think there s any feasible way to extend this method to return values in the 7..63 range directly the structure of the constant doesn t permit it but you can convert the results to that range by multiplying the result by 7
with regard to how this constant was designed i started with the following observations unsigned multiplication is a fast operation on most cpus and can have useful effects

the best way to force ssl for all web requests using iis is with a web.config rule
the application-based rule works by detecting that ssl is not being used and redirects the user to the secure https domain

32343416

the application-based rule works by detecting that ssl is not being used and redirects the user to the secure https domain
a valid ssl certificate is required to be configured otherwise a security message is displayed

32349638
queue	fifo
code blocks dispatched using dispatch_async on a concurrent queue are also executed in the fifo way and guaranteed to be executed in the order you dispatch them
the main difference is that dispatch_sync on a serial queue also guarantees you that following code blocks are not executed before the previous block has finished executing

32349798
viewdidload	viewdidappear
correct me if i m wrong but it seems you are pushing presenting a view controller call it a and another one the storeflyersviewcontroller immediately from the viewdidload method of a - when the view of a is not in the window hierarchy yet
to solve this you could move your code to viewdidappear

32353704
swift	objective-c
since we cannot use this function with objective-c classes we need to wrap nsmutableindexset in a swift class
swift 3 update swift 3 includes value types for many types from the foundation framework

32356792
profiling	debugging
but code which will optimized away will not generate any debugging profiling coverage information
with debugging it is not always true because newer versions of gcc generate some meta information which give a link to the original source code which enables to set breakpoints also if the code is not longer present in the executable

32357420
equals	gethashcode
the opposite is not true - two items that have the same hash code do not have to be equals
the object will be used to perform a two-step check to see if a tkey instance is equals to the key of an existing group and thus should be in that group it checks the hash code of the item using gethashcode against the hash code of existing keys

32357420
equals	gethashcode
the object will be used to perform a two-step check to see if a tkey instance is equals to the key of an existing group and thus should be in that group it checks the hash code of the item using gethashcode against the hash code of existing keys
if it does not equals any of those values it is added to a new group if a matching hash code is found it then checks for equality using equals

smana 1 like you guessed again it is not a dns resolution problem ping monitoring-influxdb.kube-system.svc.osm.local 10.233.83.114 56 84 bytes of data. the ping command indicates that is pinging ip 10.233.83.144 2 icmp is not supported for cluster ips
currently only tcp and udp are supported

32358454
swift	objective-c
if this is a swift project it doesn t use a .pch file
that s for objective-c

32359077
spaces	delimiter
but it might fail on other input for example when the plugin string is only one spaces away from the one for alarm
in that case you cannot properly distinguish group 4 and 5 and need a proper delimiter or fixed column lengths

32359655
inline	inlining
for example this results in good performance without -fno-full-laziness but inlining too early results in poor performance the problem with this inline solution is that it s rather fragile in the face of ghc s floating onslaught
for example manual inlining does not preserve performance

32360905
factors	mean
when working with mutable objects however neither factors comes into play
the fact that a mutable array might not have any elements off the main diagonal when it s generated doesn t mean it will never have any such elements

32363459
ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
this is true for all collection-types which ninject translates to multi-injection afair array ilist ienumerable but not icollection
i d recommend using another collection interface like icollection or collection implementation as constructor parameter

punctuation	words
every words and phrase is lowercased with punctuation removed
installation is easy with pip simply call segment to get a list of words as you noticed the old corpus doesn t rank app id very high

32364630
alloca	malloc
some implementations support alloca which allocates on the stack like a variable-length array would but this is non-standard
assuming your compiler supports c99 and variable-length arrays then the following code will work if your compiler does not you ll have to use malloc

32364912

facingmode is not yet implemented in google-chrome for android but works natively in firefox for android
you must use standard constraints however use https fiddle for google-chrome the syntax means the constraint is required and things fail if the user doesn t have the right camera

32365588
implements	extends
javascriptexecutor has nothing to do with the webdriver interface this one doesn t extends that one for example but firefoxdriver happens to implements both
so even though your driver variable is seen as a webdriver due to its declaration it actually holds as value an instance of firefoxdriver - thus its value is a javascriptexecutor as well because firefoxdriver implements javascriptexecutor

32366860
coalesce	isnull
or you can just cast the entire first subquery since the second should always return a result coalesce cast select ... as int select ... as startingmembershipcount because the second always returns a result this really doesn t need to be nullable at all
using isnull should fix that isnull cast select ... as int select ... as startingmembershipcount the disadvantages of isnull are that it can t support a third argument should you need one

32370308
swift	objective-c
an objective-c class can be used from swift and from objective-c so for a swift project it doesn t matter if you have a few objective-c classes
there is no way currently to call c++ from swift directly and i wouldn t expect it for a while

it should not be difficult to translate it in swift
this is a simple way of achieving that with nssession in objective-c

udp	tcp
try it with a udp gelf input it should work
as far as i know logstash does not support gelf with tcp

32380596
equals	gethashcode
as a thumb of rule you can follow the following pattern classes by default both the equals object method and equality operators check reference equality
if reference equality is not right for you override the equals method and also gethashcode

32381679
fread	calloc
many systems require for calloc fread
so use allocatable memory which may be more than real memory as calloc does not use memory just allocates it

32385191
swift	objective-c
so you can invoke your objective-c method in swift writing hope this helps
you should note that a parameter declared like this in objective-c does not becomes this in swift something string but it actually is translated into this something string

32386259
calloc	malloc
anyway you ve got some bad habits in your code the first is that you re not checking to see if the allocation succeeded or not then you re zeroing your own memory when calloc would probably be faster
if the allocation failed malloc would return null yet you re still dereferencing the pointer when you zero the memory yourself

32386545
mongodb	bson
as a one off operation this probably best done through the mongodb shell and with the use of bulk operations to minimize the network overhead when writing back the data
also not the bson operation there is designed to match strings so even if you began a conversion or changed some code to start producing bson date objects in the field then the query only picks up the string values for conversion

32386629
setinterval	settimeout
see here code executed by setinterval is run in a separate execution context to the function from which it was called
as a consequence the this keyword for the called function will be set to the window or global object it will not be the same as the this value for the function that called settimeout

32390031
viewdidappear	viewwillappear

32393762
dictionary	map
example but there would be no problem continuing adding objects of different types to the dictionary and changing the type of the existing objects
yes but remember that python objects are not statically typed so a declaration like this map is not needed and would not work what you do in python is declare an empty dictionary and add ints to it

32395169
implements	extends
update comment yes but the list is declared as list so it s the synonym to not and object doesn t implements comparable
answer you do not specify a generic type for the list and the collections.sort method only checks if the object s class extends comparable

32402461
realloc	malloc
sbrk n move the break by the given increment n in bytes. special case of sbrk when increment is null sbrk 0 the returned value is the actual break address the previous and the new break addresses are the same. sbrk is thus used to retrieve the beginning of the heap which is the initial position of the break step -1 implementation does not satisfy all criteria but at high level goal is satisfied it would move the break point by size requested and user would get memory allocation on heap without satisfying criteria to do realloc and allow it to free 1 so we need to know where each portion begins and when we are at beginning of each portion address of next one. 2 what is the size of that portion 3 if that portion is free or not so basically we need a list with below content using int for free might seem a bad idea but since struct are aligned by default it wont matter
another condition we have to take care is malloc must return aligned address

32404380
portrait	landscape
don t read unless you want box square and landscape portrait versions at the same time as far as i can tell instagram has not updated their api to return the original images in various sizes for the new landscape portrait upload feature they rolled out recently
there is a -- for lack of a better word - workaround that you can use to get the original uncropped landscape portrait images from the square images returned by the api for your landscape portrait photo

32404435
set	bag

cakephp	phalcon
even having used cakephp for the past 2 years and being familiar with mvc patterns and php i still worked my way through all 7 of the tutorials in phalcon
having said this my favourite thing about phalcon is that it is highly decoupled - so it is fairly easy after a while to replace bits of it with your own extensions if it doesn t quite do what you want

32408107
serializable	deserialization
when you serializable it s easy to write these because they re lvalue-references the value itself will have been serializable

png	ico
solution - this website allows one to create a fully-ranged ico file from a single png
secondly the ico s do not go in the top-most directory - they should be put in the same directory as the config.xml file thirdly one should not specify filename extensions for the icon file in the config.xml tags myicon.ico - this is done as needed when the file is parsed

to understand what happened take a look at what elixir does to your code to syntactically allow rebinding when the language does not support it elixir s foundation is erlang- elixir s compilation produces erlang .beam files to be executed by the erlang virtual machine

the problem is that uitableview takes uitableviewcell which goes out from the screen for reuse and it contains all your uicollectionviewcells

32451366
opera	google-chrome
whatwg.org has a javascript sample of using canvas.transfercontroltoproxy at but it does not seem to work in any browser even not in bleeding edge versions google-chrome canary or opera next
even turning enable experimental canvas features at google-chrome flags has no effect in google-chrome canary

32456252
gruntjs	package.json
gruntjs has many modules to work and one of those is called load-grunt-tasks so you should run again npm install load-grunt-tasks --save-dev of course this is just if you do not have the dependencies in the file
a node.js project if used with npm must come with a package.json file

32461709
eventlet	gevent
you need to pass the function and arguments to spawn which will call the function with those arguments in the separate eventlet but right now you are actually calling run which never ends until you kill it
on a side note this does not seem like the right way to run flask with gevent

32463160
fgets	fgetc
it could be easier for your to sometimes have a lookahead of one or two characters by first reading the entire line with getline 3 or else fgets 3 and perhaps even readline which gives you a line editor
if you cannot read a whole line consider using fgetc 3 and ungetc when needed

32463418
inline	constexpr
it s just not possible to use inline definition and also have the same type for the items as the type that contains them
by going to a struct rather than an enum you can accomplish something similar unfortunately you can t use std string since it isn t a literal type and thus not eligible for use in constexpr objects

32465868
fgets	realloc
hint use a field size for fscanf or even better some other function like fgets
the realloc here will not work should read you need to multiply the size of a single element which in this case is a pointer to char

32466026
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
however if statements by default are case-sensitive and you re checking against a value of tue which is not equal to tue
fortunately if has an i option that tells if to do a case-insensitive comparison

32467041
dns	spf
you can use gmail for example it allows you to send emails via smtp ssl but if you want to send emails from your host you should do the followign things to make sure your host is not treated as spam host make sure your host is not open relay anonymous can t conntect to its 25 port and send anything to anyone there are open relay check engines over the internet use them have some meaningful reverse dns record
your ip should resolve to something like not 44.33.22.191.clients-dsl.my.local.isp.net use spf you should have record for your email domain your_email_domain these 3 steps increase your chances to send emails from some_user your_email_domain with out of getting into spam folder

32471539
recvfrom	datagram
also the last two parameters of recvfrom provide you with the ip port of the datagram sender
they are not for specifying the network adapter to read datagram on

32473678
scikit-learn	nltk
this can be achieved with one line in scikit-learn - actually vectorizer allows to do a lot of things like removing stop words and lowercasing
i have done them in a separate step only because scikit-learn does not have non-english stopwords but nltk has

32474143
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

32474958
qgridlayout	qwidget
to have the backgroundcolor in the complete range of a single cell you have to add an intermediate qwidget to the qgridlayout set the property add a intermediate layout to the intermediate qwidget and into this you can add your widget you want to see in the table
without the intermediate widget if you set the coloredcell property to the actual widget itself in my example the qpushbutton only the backgroundcolor of this widget will be changed not the color of the whole qgridlayout cell

32478920
jar	manifest.mf
that jar is not a bundle hence can t be deployed to karaf it s just ignored
try make it sure that your bundle has in their meta-inf manifest.mf the osgi import declarations syntax

32481839
equals	compareto
if compareto where to be non-final it would be possible to override it with a behaviour which was not consistent with equals which would be very counter-intuitive
one possible explanation is that compareto should be consistent with equals

32485440
serializable	deserialization
give the getter setter combo jackson which i assume is what you are using for your json serializable deserialization will determine the property s name to be fgy not fgy
deserialization will therefore not find your property

32486343
rvm	bundler
the solution that worked for me was entirely different perhaps because i ve been inconsistent about using rvm or not
i used which bundler to find out where bundler was being launched it was from usr bin bundler

32486996
jar	manifest.mf
when you call getresource spring boot will load the first resource that matches the given resource name in the list of all jars available in the class path and your app jar is not the first choice
so when issuing a command like getclassloader .getresourceasstream meta-inf manifest.mf

32489353
prepare	execute
so it would appear it protects against sql injection. although prepare statements guarantee sql injection protection as we can read from php manual if you are using this function to build sql statements you are strongly recommended to use pdo prepare to prepare sql statements with bound parameters instead of using pdo quote to interpolate user input into an sql statement
prepare statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query

32489575
google-chrome	safari
this is the so that showed me the light ipad window.height give bad value in safari but not in google-chrome
it turns out that safari for ios has a bottom bar that messes up the innerheight calculation

32490698
tvos	ios
the tvos sdk is based off of ios but is not interchangeable
unlike when the first ipad was released the new apple tv will not be capable of running ios apps

32493551
redmine	mantis
zapier makes regular synchronization between redmine and teamwork
but mantis is not yet supported by zapier

32494135
cublas	lapack
i am not sure what library matlab uses for gpu multiplication but probably something like nvidia cublas
matlab uses a highly optimized implementation of lapack from intel known as intel math kernel library intel mkl - specifically the dgemm function

32494364
portrait	landscape
add all required controls in this size class. wcompact-hregular size class - for all iphones in portrait mode only
if you have added any control in this size class it will not be displayed when application will be in landscape mode and also not in ipad either. wany-hcompact size class - for all iphones in landscape mode only

32494364
portrait	landscape
if you have added any control in this size class it will not be displayed when application will be in portrait mode and also not in ipad either. final result when displayed in device or simulator
where label is displayed only in portrait mode and is invisible in landscape mode. conclusion

32495531
bash	subshell
see also bash 1 credentials 7 fork 2 execve 2 environ 7
as andreas explained you need to source the definition and you need the export to happen in your current shell process not in a subshell or child process you could instead define in your .bashrc some shell functions to do the job then in your terminal you would type prepare_for_java before starting doing java things and forget_java after you ve done with them

32498407
inline	inlining
even if the argument is not a compile-time constant the function can still be inline
recursion doesn t always make inlining impossible

32501803
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
as of august 2015 google-chrome 36+ opera 24+ and firefox 36+ support the will-change property
some interesting material for the null transform hack according to this it switches on the hardware compositing mode in google-chrome assuming it s supported for the platform you re on and isn t on already

32502348
vb.net	vb6
however to keep vb.net as backwards-compatible with vb6 as possible microsoft added a new option
just like vb6 had option explicit to allow it to be backwards-compatible with older versions which did not require variable declarations vb.net adds a new option strict

32502695
profiling	instrumentation
it is now working with time profiling and it shouldn t be hard to get it working with other instrumentation templates as well with a little more reverse engineering work
there are quite a few frameworks bundled with instrumentation as you can see in applications xcode.app contents applications instruments.app contents frameworks

32503382
exponent	modulo
i m voting to close this question as off-topic because although the question contains code this really is a conceptual question about cryptography where it has been asked before maarten bodewes from the link that he provides the answer to my question is no you generally cannot swap the public and private keys. it simply jeopardize the security of rsa by using small primes in public exponent
here is the detailed answer your public key consists of a public exponent and a modulo

32505118
awt	swing
so is learning and studying awt important in respect to android app development no as android does not have awt
or should i jump over to swing no as android does not have swing

32507398
vbscript	vba
webpages displayed in ie11 mode won t execute vbscript code.
talking about microsoft visual basic scripting edition not about visual basic nor visual basic for applications vba vbscript will be going away at some point

32508996
super	extends
the rules are not much different to the rules of super classes
if you change the interfaces so that interface iface2 extends iface1 and still declares printhello as an abstract method then this abstract method does override the default method and you can t invoke iface1.super.printhello from within test anymore

32511442
tvos	ios
for a complete list of ios api s that are available for tvos refer to ios 9.0 to tvos 9.0 api differences
uiwebview is not available for tvos as jessbowers mentioned in the comments and is documented here uikit changes for objective-c uikit changes for swift

32511654
google-chrome	firefox
i ve had an issue like this where the click wouldn t click in firefox but it would in google-chrome
the workaround was to add mouse down and mouse up action after doing the initial click that worked in google-chrome

32513889
swift	objective-c
information above current as of swift 2.0
no unlike the objective-c compiler the swift compiler does not currently verify selector names

32516377
swift	objective-c
finally the same arc rules for memory management apply to swift as objective-c thus you will often want to use the weak specifier
one caveat is that a lot of swift objects are value types not reference types

32516792
icmp	tcp
another caveat is that both tcp connection attempts and icmp echo request might be stopped anywhere from your system to the remote system by a firewall
if you want something simpler just try to do a tcp connection to the system using a random port number you will get different errors if the system is not reachable or if it is reachable but no one is listening on that port or you get a connection which you then promptly close

32517539
postgresql	greenplum
specifically or for running jobs via yarn see greenplum db distributed postgresql does not back pivotal hd
the exception is if you re referring to pivotal hawq which is effectively greenplum db on top of hdfs

32518820
jar	war
implementation class name is com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.mysqlconnectionpooldatasource then you define jdbc datasource for that jdbc provider and that s if you are not using jdbc provided by websphere and use spring to provide you with database connection you should bundle mysql jdbc connector jar with your war by copying it into web-inf lib or wherever your war lib directory is
the errors is self-explanatory - you are missing mysql jdbc connector jar in classpath mysql jdbc connector can be downloaded from if you are using websphere portal i guess you are using jdbc connections from jndi

32520273
matplotlib	colormap
so i ve wrote a small function for my everyday work here s the behavior of it than you just use new_cmap as your colormap on matplotlib the code is here it s also on github
for some time i was really annoyed by the fact that matplotlib doesn t generate colormap with random colors as this is a common need for segmentation and clustering tasks

32524488
implements	extends
curiously recurring template pattern it is easy to implements and use but also not very flexible - each of those child classes is strictly bound to the class it accepts as an argument
method overload this also lets you easily extends functionality - but it requires exact type of passes to be known at compile time

32524711
persistent	transient
in this case you should do one of the following solutions if juvenile is a persistent attribute then you should remove the transient annotation of it
if juvenile is not a persistent attribute and you are using it only for a logic that need this attribute then you should remove the mappings manytoone and joincolumn

32527650
lemmatization	stemming
you can also user a stemming which is a simpler version of lemmatization
a stemming is usually a rule-based component and is able to reduce words to their common root but the output word will not always be valid for example the word engine might be stemmed as engin

32527847
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in viewdidload views are only loaded in memory but not yet in screen so if you try to ask a view for its frame in viewdidload you will not get a consistante value.. instead use viewwillappear where you can ask view for its frame and you get a right value since the view is ready to be shown
in your code you get and set a view frame in viewdidload

32528129
profiling	instrumentation
also it is important to compile the packages on the same machine that will be used for profiling to get the source code and not only the disassembly in instrumentation
on mac os x instrumentation work fine

32528397
http	spdy
it also pioneered spdy push first and then http 2 push and it s actually very simple to enable http 2 push by adding a jetty provided servlet filter to your web application
as for using this feature you can find many examples online of http 2 push but our own website does have http 2 push enabled for a real world site not just a tiles example

32529762
apache	nginx
this is your current model the client accesses static data and the app data as two different origins wiki option #1 reverse proxy a much more popular design is the reverse-proxy nginx apache in which the http-server serves static data and acts as an interface to your node app
this way your both content types come from the same origin and port but still see performance gains ...but you re not using nginx or apache

32530158
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome not implement support rtsp streaming. an important project to check it webrtc
webrtc is a free open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with real-time communications rtc capabilities via simple apis supported browsers google-chrome firefox and opera

32537772
trie	dawg
the newly added entries will be stored like a trie until a compaction step every 128 new keys merges them into the dawg
or run the compaction less frequently for bigger dawgs so you aren t doing it too much like doubling the size of a hash table when it has to grow instead of growing linearly to amortize the expensive op. you can make a dawg more compact by storing multiple characters in a single node when there isn t any branching converging

32538122
haskell	idris
unfortunately haskell doesn t yet have proper support for dependent typing and existing workaround solutions involve some boilerplate and complications
idris is a language with haskell-like syntax and full dependent types so i can illustrate the idea in idris with greater clarity this is the complete idris solution

32539274
google-chrome	firefox
and phantomjs like ie does not support error.stack and blows up. the log location is clickable in google-chrome but not in firefox
i have used floatinglomas solution with some tweaks as it does not quite work on firefox the stack is slightly different

32540697
swift	objective-c
this is what you need to do create a swift file in your objective-c based project
no need to create bridging headers since they re used to see objective-c code from swift not swift code from objective-c

32540697
swift	objective-c
no need to create bridging headers since they re used to see objective-c code from swift not swift code from objective-c
in your target under build settings set embedded content contains swift code to yes your swift file should have an objective-c public class

32541409
swift	objective-c
it s due to swift
which objective-c does not

32542406
required	placeholder
you gonna need to add required attribute to your input like this and to your css add this rules notice i just added this rule .input-text valid .label-text-placeholder to yours
this rule will place the placeholder inside input text as long as it is not valid empty

32542999
implements	extends
an easier draweritem which implements the abstractdraweritem which comes with a few predefined methods and properties is the dividerdraweritem
the easiest solution is to extends one of the existing draweritems but this only works if you do not need a completely different item

32543178
serializable	deserialization
gson allows you to register your own custom serializable and deserializers
this is done by defining two parts json serialiers need to define custom serialization for an object json deserializers needed to define custom deserialization for a type instance creators not needed if no-args constructor is available or a deserializer is registered registertypeadapter call checks if the type adapter implements more than one of these interfaces and register it for all of them

32545530
ubuntu	linux
a first sad note is that just installing emscripten from the ubuntu repos probably isn t your best bet at least for now
i got much of what i needed by downloading portable emscripten sdk for linux and os x and following these steps from the included readme.md file run

32546879
swift	objective-c
you can mix swift c c++ objective-c objective-c++ files in the same xcode project
c c++ objective-c wrapper for c++ objective-c objective-c++ swift bridging-header.h cannot import cpp.hpp header file not because of it s naming convention but because it contains the class keyword

32546879
swift	objective-c
c c++ objective-c wrapper for c++ objective-c objective-c++ swift bridging-header.h cannot import cpp.hpp header file not because of it s naming convention but because it contains the class keyword
#import c.h #import cpp-wrapper.h #import objective-c.h #import objective-cpp.h invocation from swift invoke c hello_c world .cstringusingencoding nsutf8stringencoding can t invoke c++ without a wrapper cpp .hello_cpp world .cstringusingencoding nsutf8stringencoding invoke c++ through objective-c cpp_wrapper .hello_cpp_wrapped world invoke objective-c objective_c .hello_objectivec world invoke objective-c++ objective_cpp .hello_objectivecpp world invoke swift swift .hello_swift world .h headers see item 3 in this stack overflow answer .h this is the tricky part since they are ambiguously used for all flavors of c ++ or not objective or not

32546933
consistency	acid
nosql with two of consistency availability partitioning attributes of cap theory is good in some of use cases
but hadoop is not meant for real time transaction support with acid properties

32546971
rtp	rtsp
both sip and rtsp use exactly the same media transfer mechanisms such as sdp and rtp so they aren t a consideration when choosing between them
both sip and rtsp are signalling protocols

32549397
bash	tcsh
on freebsd tcsh is the standard shell not bash
setting variables in tcsh is done with set not with a simple . so the file variable is unset when you run this script and it tries to edit standard input

32550996
client-side	server-side
we have published a new package planifica encryption that let s you do client-side encryption of your mongo collections with ease
if follows the same principles as mylar does in fact it is based on the paper that mylar is based on but currently does not support all of mylars features like server-side search

32554229
swift	objective-c
in the same project you can happily mix c c++ objective-c objective c++ swift and even assembly
...bridging-header.h you expose c objective-c and objective-c++ to swift using this bridge exposes automatically your swift classes marked with objective-c to objective-c .h this is the tricky part since they are ambiguously used for all flavors of c ++ or not objective or not

32562692
required	placeholder
bad if you would required different number of controls in a mobile page
you will end up placing placeholder that would not be used either in desktop or mobile and it could become confusing maintaining such master pages by other developers or yourself after a significant amount of time

32564694
innodb	myisam
you need the innodb access method to use transactions
the people who created myisam did not include transactions in their code

32566710
namenode	hdfs
based on your requirement if you want to get the path in local file system where the block is stored read the value of this property identify the block id by reading namenode metadata then you ll be able to find the exact block in local file system that refers to a hdfs file programmatically
in hdfs the blocks are replicated and the namenode do not have any information on which is replica

32567516
clang	llvm
for llvm frontends such as clang it is convenient to not have to care about ssa form
if i use clang to compile the c code to llvm ir all the variables are allocated on the stack

32569374
subtract	addition	subtraction	addition
the reason your number does not return back to zero is that the last subtraction may be subtract a wrong number due to rounding errors
since neither 5.4 nor 0.1 can be represented precisely in the format of double your last subtraction or your last addition in case of negative numbers would overshoot

32570612
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
note this solution will work in ie10+ google-chrome 43+ opera 29+ and firefox 41+
not for safari

32571062
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
an activity does not need oncreateview since it has the setcontentview method which allows you to setup a layout in the activity s oncreate
oncreateview allows you to inflate a layout for a fragment and get your views with findviewbyid

32573222
apache	nginx
apache in turn has abovementioned .htaccess support which allows you to apply rewrite rules and other stuff without webserver reload
nginx is faster and lighter but many people find it easier to work with apache because of .htaccess support nginx does not have an analog due to performance concern

32573222
apache	nginx
nginx is faster and lighter but many people find it easier to work with apache because of .htaccess support nginx does not have an analog due to performance concern
the typical scheme is following you bind nginx on port 80 configure it to serve static files jpg png js css ttf etc. and make it proxy to apache on say port 8080 for non-static resources

32573422
swift	objective-c
currently as of xcode 7.2 you cannot fold swift source files
to fold objective-c comments you need to use a style of comment that has a begin and end like this then on the line where the comment begins hover your cursor over the tiny column next to the line number and click the arrow to fold it

32575559
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to solve the problem in firefox without compromising its appearance in google-chrome
this may not be as concise and technical of an answer as you d like but this is undoubtedly caused in differences between google-chrome firefox rendering engines

32576545
spaces	delimiter
import readline class testcomplete cmd.cmd def __init__ self cmd.cmd.__init__ self readline.set_completer_delims # spaces is the only delimiter now
cmd uses the readline module which defaults to the following set of delimiter you can use readline.set_completer_delims to choose a delimiter set that excludes the characters you do not want

32577750
equals	compareto	equals	icomparable
for objects a b and c the following must be true a.compareto a must return zero. if a.compareto b returns zero then b.compareto a must return zero. if a.compareto b returns zero and b.compareto c returns zero then a.compareto c must return zero. if a.compareto b returns a value other than zero then b.compareto a must return a value of the opposite sign. if a.compareto b returns a value x not equals to zero and b.compareto c returns a value y of the same sign as x then a.compareto c must return a value of the same sign as x and y. notes to callers use the compareto method to determine the ordering of instances of a class
you need to implement your own custom icomparable to your myclass and implement compareto

32578287
odoo	qweb
classes widgets the qweb template engine classes much as modules and contrary to most object-oriented languages javascript does not build in classes although it provides roughly equivalent if lower-level and more verbose mechanisms. for simplicity and developer-friendliness odoo web provides a class system based on javascript inheritance
widgets the odoo web client bundles jquery for easy dom manipulation

32579031
division	addition	addition	multiplication
but that s not the case here since division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition and there are no parentheses involved
in addition 15.7.1 states clearly my emphasis the left-hand operand of a binary operator appears to be fully evaluated before any part of the right-hand operand is evaluated

32584396
setinterval	settimeout
the main problem is a that the setinterval function is called once then if you change the value of interval variable this does not affect the setinterval call
a fast patch could be to use a settimeout instead called recursively

32585988
google-chrome	firefox
for instance consider this page google-chrome shows i m here and if you click the close tab button it doesn t close for several seconds seems like the loop completes
if it never finished odds are google-chrome would eventually tell you the script was misbehaving. firefox doesn t show i m here but the ui does the same thing doesn t close the tab for several seconds after you request the tab closure

32585988
google-chrome	firefox
if it never finished odds are google-chrome would eventually tell you the script was misbehaving. firefox doesn t show i m here but the ui does the same thing doesn t close the tab for several seconds after you request the tab closure
ie11 may or may not show i m here clicking the close tab button seems to respond more quickly but still after several seconds than google-chrome

32587806
spaces	delimiter
the format entry is a single spaces since that may not be clear
the code is simple as i said you cant define the columns since the delimiter is not uniform so they default to f1 f2 etc

32587806
spaces	delimiter
it will create a 6th faux column due to the trailing spaces which may not even exist in the real file
it will handle multiple delimiter but you want to set them as specify the doublespace first then a spaces

32596913
rspec	capybara
if that causes problems because it requires capybara rspec matchers although that file doesn t actually need rspec then you could just do world capybara dsl and then implement whatever before and after hooks you need for your testing environment see cucumber.rb
you can try require capybara cucumber in your minitest.rb

32599089
udp	tcp
udp in the right circumstances can be considered fully duplex but by itself it is not whereas tcp on the other hand is always fully duplex
udp is a fire-and-forget best-effort protocol but the upper layers can use it in a fully duplex fashion

32604219
google-chrome	firefox
however in a real life scenario the actual element that has to be clipped could be present anywhere within the body and hence i think it is a much better approach to use the objectboundingbox as the units like in the below snippet as mentioned in the question itself this behavior is visible only in google-chrome and not firefox for reasons unknown to me
firefox produces an output similar to the expected one even when a extra padding + margin is added to the body and b when the image itself is wrapped inside another container which also has padding + margin

32606725
super	implements
as you said you just let specialtestimpl implements test and call the default method or call the implements method in your super class testimpl
because it s really not exactly the super class

32610552
symfony	silex
if you want to use the orm package and have it integrated in your application you would have to use a serviceprovider list of a few services providers for silex to use the command line for building your database schema you will have to use doctrine command lines from the library itself it s not wrapped in console as it is in symfony here is the list of doctrine s commands
by default silex support only the dbal package of doctrine for database

32611453
swift	objective-c
since swift is constantly updating here s when this answer was applicable swift 2.0 xcode 7 gm
i can t be 100 positive but here s what i believe is happening protocol extensions aren t accessible from objective-c

32611453
swift	objective-c
this behavior will only be accessible in swift and shouldn t be problematic in any way
the problem is default implementations not being objective-c accessible

32616960
swift	objective-c
similar as in unsafemutablepointer int8 from string in swift you can send the response string as utf-8 encoded bytes to the handler method with inside the block is a pointer to a nul-terminated array of char with the utf-8 representation of the string
note also that your objective-c code has a potential problem length returns the number of utf-16 code points in the string not the number of utf-8 bytes

32618636
vbscript	vba
- microsoft scripting runtime in vbscript or in vba if you prefer using late binding variables without explicit types if running vba on a mac which doesn t have the microsoft scripting runtime there is a drop-in replacement for dictionary available
vbscript remove duplicates from an array word occurrences in vba find all distinct values in user based selection - excel vba another option vba only is to use a collection

32621257
implements	extends
currently shoryuken only supports fixed values for exponential backoff but you can submit a pr changing exponentialbackoffretry with so you will be able to use a proc or fixed values to set retry_intervals or you can remove the default exponentialbackoffretry and add yours shoryuken.configure_server do |config| config.server_middleware do |chain| chain.remove middleware server exponentialbackoffretry chain.add yourexponentialbackoffretry end end but keep in mind that sqs does not officially support exponential backoff it s something implements in shoryuken using the visibility timeout which can extended to a maximum of 12 hours
you can continue to call changemessagevisibility to extends the visibility timeout to a maximum of 12 hours

32621806
google-chrome	firefox
using generates but this is not currently supported in either google-chrome ie or firefox which is why you see only the standard textbox
recent versions of google-chrome however do support which will render a control allowing you to select both a date and a time

32622685
serializable	deserialization
some system-level classes such as thread outputstream and its subclasses and socket are not serializable
converting an object to bytes and bytes back to object deserialization

32623324
single-quotes	double-quotes
inside single-quotes backticks are not evaluated
use double-quotes instead for a variety of reasons backticks are considered archaic

32624056
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
datataskwithurl is intended to replace sendasynchronousrequest in nsurlconnection
first of all i would like to mention few things that nsurlconnection is deprecated in os x 10.11 and ios 9.0 but not going away apps using it will still work new features will be added to nsurlsession not supported on watchos secondly using nsurlsession and sending async call with it is as easy as with nsurlconnection

32626000
octal	decimal
floating point literals cannot be written in octal in c++
you ll have to settle for decimal

32627081
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup
just now i got a html which lxml and pyquery didn t work good on seems there are some errors in the html. since tidy is not easy to install in windows i choose beautifulsoup . but i found that act same as which real solve my problem is
you should install html5lib first then can use it as a parser in beautifulsoup . html5lib parser seems work much better than others

32628328
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
this seems to be a firefox issue as google-chrome ie11 do not have any problems
can t test on safari as on windows

32628704
inline	inlining
your best bet is to tell the compiler you want it inline make the function static be careful with extern as it s semantics change a little in gcc in some modes set the compiler options to inform the optimizer you want inlining and set inline limits appropriately turn on any couldn t inline warnings on the compiler verify the output you could check the assembler generated that the function is inline
compiler hints the answers here cover just one side of inlining the language hints to the compiler

32630802
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
source all pairs shortest path with floyd-warshall
doing a shortest path search for each couple of nodes with dijkstra s shortest path algorithm assuming a implementation would add a factor since you ll have to do it for each pair of nodes in the graph furthermore it might prove not to be a terribly-easy-to-code algorithm with a mutable heap

32634282
bower	npm
i tend to be biased towards bower whenever i have the option to install something with bower
you should install node.js with nvm because that way you do not have to provide superuser privileges when installing global packages you can simply execute npm install -g packagename without prepending sudo

32636086
inline	inlining
the trick is to use extern definition where you do not want to inline and extern inline where you need inlining
example you can also use non-standard attribute __attribute__ always_inline in gcc for extern inline definition instead of relying on -o2

32638229
move	drag
the animation will get run whether or not the button gets move to a new location
2 roll your own drag and drop code

32638517
rar	zip
in the vba procedure that triggers the zip-packaging of the docx-files i call winrar as follows c programme winrar winrar.exe a -afzip -ep -pthisisthepassword outputfullname inputfullname -afzip says create a zip file as opposed to a rar file -ep says do not include the paths of the source file put the file directly into the zip folder a full list of such switches is available in the winrar help section command line
just in case this helps i am currently working on an ms access database project customer relations management for a small company and one of the tasks there is to zip docx-files to be sent to customers with a certain password encryption used

32641086
factors	matrix
therefore i considered input data matching just what you mentioned where for convenience i am taking the person id to be strings encoded as factors in the input data frame my first idea would be to simply expand the data after splitting the comma-delimited values and then use dcast package reshape2 to put the data in wide format but this does not take advantage of the fact that the results are a sparse matrix which may be essentially a must depending on the actual data you are working with
since you mention sparse in the title here is an alternative solution although a bit longer in which the results are stored in a sparse matrix via package matrix

32643061
required	placeholder
class annotated with configuration when you annotate the class component and load using component scanning works as expected. the component scanning part is important you either need your configuration class to either have componentscan or perhaps remove configuration and replace with springbootapplication and this will enable scanning for components without needing to wire them up using bean configs use autowired required true fails with beancreationexception no qualifying bean of type java.lang.string found for dependency autowired required false does not crash value does not work if test.property is missing could not resolve placeholder test.property in string value test.property value with default value does not crash when getsomeprop is called it returns my default value unless you have test.property anything in your application.properties file then it returns anything inside your configuration file also fails if it cannot find anything to populate string someprop in the myclass method
as you said i also could not get required to run as expected this may be a bug and needs to be reported

32643090
super	self
we know that bar.x will cause the getter defined in bar to be called and we know that super bar self is a proxy for foo via self
therefore super bar self .x must call the getter defined not in bar but in foo

32644718
postgresql	mysql
this functionality may be peculiar to mysql i can t find anything similar documented for derby postgresql oracle or db2
the mysql 6.0 syntax for declaring a table is this and the mysql syntax for removing a table is this these clauses are mysql extensions which are not part of the ansi iso sql standard

32647683
implements	extends
adapter class adapter class is a simple java class that implements an interface with only empty implementation
instead of implementing interface if we extends adapter class we provide implementation only for require method ex--- instead of implementing servlet i if we extends genericservlet ac then we provide implementation for service method we are not require to provide implementation for remaining meyhod

32651331
google-chrome	firefox
the following example code worked for me in ie and google-chrome but not firefox this answer put me on the right track
update unfortunately i had to find out that firefox does not make the current event accessible via window.event thus this code won t work there

32652053
ienumerable	iqueryable
i also would recommend you to trace what you are getting back from a server when you use iqueryable and list using browser dev tools or fiddler you can find more information here iqueryable ienumerable or list implement efficient data paging to return iqueryable or not return iqueryable
if your controller returns odata format the response body from your action that returns iqueryable will contain more information such as next page of data odata metadata

32654333
g++	gcc
if you must use g++ for some reason try instead adding an explicit cast to each call to g_object_new
try compiling your code with gcc not g++ change the last line of your makefile

32659394
client-side	server-side
i would expect the client-side insert to be ignored after the result of the server-side insert propagates back to the client
i m not sure why it isn t being replaced by the server-side insert though

32660205
pickle	dill
now let s use dill with pickle trace turned on so we can see the path the serializer takes
dill can serialize a lambda so it doesn t fail

32660790
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome recognizes blinkmacsystemfont there are also other variations font-family -apple-system-body font-family -apple-system-headline font-family -apple-system-subheadline font-family -apple-system-caption1 font-family -apple-system-caption2 font-family -apple-system-footnote font-family -apple-system-short-body font-family -apple-system-short-headline font-family -apple-system-short-subheadline font-family -apple-system-short-caption1 font-family -apple-system-short-footnote font-family -apple-system-tall-body you can demo these at the following fiddle
most are not supported yet i got my info from craig hockenberry s article which has a lot of great info about using the font also some great info on the surfin safari blog about using abstracted system fonts and apparently apple is working with the w3c to standardize using a generic system font name in css

32661035
swift	objective-c
as the documentation says all nsset objects can be bridged to swift sets so the swift compiler replaces the nsset class with when it imports objective-c apis
so as matt already said with other words in his answer nsset inside the swift language is identical to and is not the same thing as nsset in the current version of objective-c language even if they have the same name

32661035
swift	objective-c
so as matt already said with other words in his answer nsset inside the swift language is identical to and is not the same thing as nsset in the current version of objective-c language even if they have the same name
continuing to cite the documentation you can also create an nsset object directly from a swift array literal following the same bridging rules outlined above

32661217
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
well a bufferedwriter is not used to get input but rather to output information but assuming that you meant a bufferedreader then the answer is yes definitely
understand that a gui and getting data with a bufferedreader are orthogonal concepts -- they both can work just fine independently of the other

32661992
swift	objective-c
normally when you re importing objective-c code into swift you do so by including the header of the file containing that code in the bridging header for your project
and that is indeed how you include code from a static library which your pods used to be. but it is not how your import objective-c code from a framework. so i simply added import awss3 to my controller and everything worked fine again

32662271
swift	objective-c
this answer might solve your problem normally when you re importing objective-c code into swift you do so by including the header of the file containing that code in the bridging header for your project
and that is indeed how you include code from a static library which your pods used to be. but it is not how your import objective-c code from a framework

32662288
persistent	transient
so the error is saying to you that in your project entity bean there is another bean which has not been persistent before the flush happened
probably you will have to add a cascade attribute to one of your project entity bean attribute not annotated transient

32663016
prepare	execute
for example you fairly frequently have patterns like prepare some data signal that the data is ready and consume some data signal that the memory used for the data is now free in such cases the memory location used as the signal is what you re probably going to protect with the fence--but it s not the only thing that really needs to be protected
in the first case i have to assure that all the code that writes the data gets execute and only after it s all done the signal will be set

32664238
octal	decimal
there are no octal floating point numbers in c++ for a reason the standard does not define octal floating point numbers and compilers obey this particular rule to the letter
leading 0 is read as just another decimal digit in the whole part or in the exponent

32670307
implements	extends
webdriver is a public interface and i do not think chromedriver or any other driver implements webdriver they rather extends remotewebdriver which is a class
edit as i have said the drivers extends remotewebdriver and that has the actual implementation of those method

32673769
swift	objective-c
this is allowed in objective-c and you can call the method with i don t know if the method was intentionally defined with an empty selector name i wouldn t recommend it. but it causes the swift compiler to crash
this happens only if nsstring is referenced somewhere in the swift code. the compiler should never crash no matter how malformed the input is so i would recommend to file a bug report at apple

32674487
jar	manifest.mf
now of course this is the additional cost which comes when you choose this option because when you run the jar then it is not you main class getting executed but jarrsrcloader will be executed which will load your main class and other libraries and all the referenced libraries are packaged
see manifest.mf section below manifest.mf main thing to note in this file is you main class

32676666
email	dkim
this combined with other elements in the ui of your email client such as fraud detection in thunderbird is as a user what would call out to you that the email might not be trustworthy
dkim dkim works via an asymmetric key

32677999
implements	extends
this is not a good idea the best way will be to implements the interfaces and provide the custom comparison logic
you will have to implements the comparable interface and your class rowcolelement must provide the implementation of compareto method if you dont want to implements these interfaces you will have to extends arraylist and will have to provide your own implementation

32678299
profiling	debugging
you re compiling with gprof profiling information when you compile with -pg
valgrind doesn t actually need that data to do it s profiling what it does need is the debugging information

32679747
vbscript	vba
and calling java library jar from vba vbscript visual basic classic there are not good solutions to get the same level of integration you have with vba c++ in vba java or vba scala
you can always use any external channel to comunicate between your vba and your scala such at a shell the file system or even http but that s not going to be as straightforward and efficient as your vba c++ example

32684347
express	node.js
specifically look at the sections on express generator and basic routing
in your code you are requiring the express module but not actually using it and this module is the most robust way to handle posts in node.js

32684347
express	node.js
in your code you are requiring the express module but not actually using it and this module is the most robust way to handle posts in node.js
if you still want to use the http module for handling post requests check this out node.js server that accepts post requests

32685178
ssl	https
also i m not sure whether it s correct to have the ssl configuration within your http block
i believe that ssl directives belong within an https block

32688124
super	implements
default does nothing now as per apple when you are implements this methods you should remember to call super implementation of that specific method
if you subclass uiviewcontroller you must call the super implementation of this method even if you aren t using a nib

32689837
innodb	myisam
yes people endorse innodb over myisam but that does not mean myisam is useless
in general sense innodb address a large set of issues which are limitations of myisam which are good for large pool of needs that people have

32692860
innodb	myisam
very rare need for transactions typical access is read-only little need for support of foreign keys the structure is trivial mysql devs don t need a safeguard to maintain referential integrity not even you smart administrator are not supposed to fiddle with this database administrative tools and commands exist for a reason speed does matter here myisam is still slightly faster than innodb especially for reads if it ain t broke don t fix it i could see one reason to switch to innodb though its resistance to crashes and its ability to recover from one due to its transactional nature
of course no one can speak for the dev team but myisam seems to be the most appropriate choice for these tables no real need for row-level locking there is little if any need for concurrency since very few threads typically one the administrator is supposed to ever write to this database at a time

32697310
bower	jspm
jspm install bower polymer jspm install bower polymerelements paper-elements in this last step i had a small problem with packaging version that i couldn t solve through jspm
so just go to jspm_packages bower polymerelements paper-elements version and run bower install this last step will install all the components for paper-elements

32698238
oncreate	onstart
to do this your view hierarchy must contain a listview object with the id android id list or list if it s in code solution 1 so if you are changing your fragment to listfragment then make sure the id of your listview in the layout file must also change and it should be as follow and inside oncreate it should be
and then set the adapter or solution 2 inside oncreateview you do not need to find the view and directly set the adapter using following code in the onstart or onresume

32700124
client-side	server-side
creating a key requires the gae sdk which is not available client-side
objectify is a server-side framework

32701343
ubuntu	debian
nokogiri s troubleshooting ubuntu debian installation documentation says here s what you should do if you should find yourself in this situation 1 sudo apt-get install ruby-dev zlib1g-dev please report it as a bug if this doesn t work for you see getting help for details
because you re using ubuntu and doing a normal install you ll need sudo to do any gem installs

32701737
ssl	https
you can get cheap ssl certs that do have both www and the domain as subject alternative names
as https negotiation happens before any request is made you cannot redirect to the correct hostname on certificate name mismatch

32701781
queue	fifo
the queue is not fifo as mentioned by the documentation
you can make it strictly fifo if you ensure that any new operation depends on the last operation added in the queue and that it can only run a single operation at a time

32705026
swift	objective-c
as mentioned by others the whole point is that objective-c provides base class for all classes while swift does not
nsobject in objective-c provides alloc and init methods hence one can expect that a descendant from nsobject will either implement or inherit those methods hence you can have the shortcut-category you mentioned in your question

32706918
ionic	angular
which in ionic means
reposted from my comments above. this is a css problem not a php or angular problem although there are solutions in those

32707491
calloc	malloc
try using calloc instead of malloc
the problem is that malloc doesn t initialize values to zero it only allocates the space

32707845
interpolation	splines
the locations and velocities at the control points will match you can interpolation up to the last update rather than the one before and you can apply this method just as easily to polar coordinates if the game world is inherently polar like space wars
another approach sometimes used for periodic data is to perform a fft and do trigonometric interpolation in the frequency domain but that doesn t sound applicable here. what originally appeared here was a derivation of the hermite splines using linear algebra in a somewhat unusual way that unless i made a mistake entering it would have worked

32710724
profiling	debugging
we need not to worry about the provisioning profiling that is already embedded in the .ipa file
no way to upload debugging symbols we need not to validate before submitting

32717264
dictionary	map
so while a dictionary is a type of map maps are a much broader range of possible function
in practice a its usually the mapping function that defines the name so a hashmap is a mapped data structure that uses a hashing algorithm to link the key to the value where as a dictionary doesn t specify how the keys are linked to a value so could be stored via a linked list tree or any other algorithm

32721818
coalesce	isnull
this will do it note the use of coalesce to handle the cases where table a does not provide emp_id or scheme_id
with sql server you could also use isnull in its place

32724774
aggregate-functions	sum
i m not sure how much are you familiar with sql but when you re writing a query that has a group by you can t select anything that isn t part of your group by or is part of an aggregate-functions
for example sum something etc

32725455
vbscript	vb6
vbscript has built-in constants for the arguments you re wanting they are vbok vbokcancel vbabortretryignore vbyesnocancel vbyesno vbretrycancel you can use them like so
you re getting a syntax error because in vbscript and vba and vb6 all function calls must use parenthesis when capturing return values unlike sub calls which must not use parenthesis unless you re using call syntax - yes i think vbscript s syntax is dumb

32725712
uialertview	uiwindow
some notes on my quest to find the uialertview in the view hierarchy i tried to loop through all of the view s recursively but couldn t find anything
the windows property of uiapplication docs states the following this property contains the uiwindow objects currently associated with the app

32727331
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
now a slightly related discussion about why i d not throw a nullpointerexception here with a slight c# bias personally if i were you i d throw an illegalargumentexception here
there have been debates about whether to use a nullpointerexception or an illegalargumentexception in cases where the parameter of a method is null

32728155
dictionary	map
in addition to that if you want to use filter on dictionary you should convert it to list first using .items or better yet to an iterator via .iteritems
functions like filter map and reduce do not modify the original sequence you pass to them

32729139
skip-lists	tree
the two obvious data structures for this task are the skip-lists which jack o reilly has already mentioned and some variant of the order statistic tree which behzad mentions but doesn t really explain
an order statistic tree stores one extra piece of information in each node

32729536
octal	decimal
isn t performing general number parsing simple string parsing will do but programmers who write the examples and documentation would prefix an octal number with 0 just to be sure and clear
in unix conventions written numbers are assumed to be decimal unless they are prefixed with a 0x or 0x in which case they are hexadecimal or prefixed with 0 which indicates they are octal numbers

32729670
matlab	simulink
under the hood this most likely does something like the matlab script described above.
this cannot be done out of the box with basic simulink using linmod dlinmod or linmod2

32729670
matlab	simulink
you could write some matlab code that would automatically take a model make a copy of it delete appropriate blocks insert inport and outports and perform a linearization. however that would be time consuming to get right and not something i d seriously suggest
the only solution is to use the add-on simulink control design product which has functionality for inserting specifying points in the model at which you wish to linearize from to without effecting the way that the model simulates

32733583
gitolite	gitosis
this is not how gitosis which is obsolete since 2009 or gitolite is working
which applies also for gitosis the url of your repo will always be git host myproject.git meaning you always access that service through ssh with the account git

32733745
mongodb	bson
the restriction was created to not allow your mongodb process to consume all your memory on server.to know more - here is a ticket about 4- 16 mb limit increase and discussion about it purpose
alternative approach is to use aggregation pipeline if the aggregate command returns a single document that contains the complete result set the command will produce an error if the result set exceeds the bson document size limit which is currently 16 megabytes

32736210
innodb	myisam
in order to convert a table from myisam to innodb is not a good practice to use the command alter table i suggest to export your table in a .sql file create a new table with the required structure and the innodb engine and then import the data from .sql file
not all aruba databases accept innodb tables

32739723
awt	swing
my guess is that this design was motivated by the vast number of swing applications that were incorrectly written with the primary jframe s being instantiated and shown on the wrong thread not on the awt event dispatch thread
my guess is that so many swing applications were incorrectly written that they had to defensively code the framework against the incorrect usage and that they wanted to avoid this scenario with javafx

32740291
google-chrome	firefox
the keypress event isn t captured on alt in google-chrome but you can use the keydown event instead
i d suggest using the keydown event in most cases rather than keypress as firefox does not fire keypress events on modifier keys like shift and webkit-based browsers google google-chrome and safari for example do not fire keypress events on the arrow keys¹

32745818
google-chrome	firefox
examples of gsap attrplugin used with svg gsap svg filter gaussian blur gsap svg filter hue-rotate gsap svg filter displacement turbulence i also noticed that your example above does not work in google-chrome
but both jquery and gsap without attrplugin change the fill in firefox even though it is not standard to the spec

32746954
division	addition
but it seems like drand48 saves the cost of division so might be worth using
i m not sure if drand is a new addition but it seems to do exactly what you want while avoiding the costly division

32746954
division	addition
i m not sure if drand is a new addition but it seems to do exactly what you want while avoiding the costly division
i came across this idea while researching if your division method generated sufficient randomness

32747608
build.gradle	gradlew
after some time spent looking for possible solutions and the cause of the problem i ve found out that the real problem was in fact buildship which was not paying any attention the the directives to the eclipse-wtp plugin in build.gradle and instead it was taking its own approach to generate a .classpath and the related eclipse configuration files
at the same time and so far buildship 1.0.5 released just today there is no way to configure or manipulate buildship while it is building its own model when importing a gradlew project when opening eclipse or when refreshing a project with f5

32749080
bower	npm
moreover your module is correctly published on bower the entry points are specified in the main of the bower.json - but you didn t do the same for npm specifying main or files in the package.json which means that when you npm install ng-wig then require ng-wig you get nothing
i wouldn t add any dev related install step in the standard npm install your postinstall hook

32752807
udp	tcp
udp doesn t wait on packets the way tcp does
udp is a fire-and-forget best-effort protocol

32752846
libstdc++	libc++
considering that clang from repositories and llvm.org depends on libstdc++ i would say that there is no proper wa y of getting rid of that dependency at least not on linux systems i ve played with which include ubuntu amazon linux centos and fedora
having said this however i find that even using clang dependent on libstdc++ allows one to produce programs that depend on libc++ instead of libstdc++

32752846
libstdc++	libc++
having said this however i find that even using clang dependent on libstdc++ allows one to produce programs that depend on libc++ instead of libstdc++
even though it is possible to build a clang+llvm setup that does not itself depend on libstdc++ as you have found already i don t think it s necessary to jump through all those hoops

32755739
n-gram	words
it would only work on names you have actually encountered in training like a list no real prediction. rather you need an n-gram model based on characters
for example in bigram model gimli -- _g gi im ml li i_ unfortunately you cannot use pyspark.ml.feature.ngram for this out of the box because it assumes a gram is a words not a character

32756620
swift	objective-c
swift needs special language features for this because of its static nature one cannot subclass at runtime
in objective-c this is not necessary so you have no language feature for this

32757109
ubuntu	linux
when we pull ubuntu image then it have different kernel no it does not it does not have the kernel part it relies on the kernel of the host the one running docker engine for all system calls
as mentioned in docker vs virtualization initially docker was built as an abstraction layer on top of linux containers lxc

32763331
ienumerable	iqueryable
something to think about here would be whether you wanted to have your repository return an iqueryable instead of ienumerable
if you return an iqueryable then again the statement will not be executed until your result set needs to be materialized

32763635
interpolation	splines
we ll generate random data and then interpolation it at points that are on a regular grid
note that the input is not on a regular grid and the interpolated points don t need to be either. choice of splines type i chose thin_plate as the type of splines

32773218
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
you can get these touches by overriding a uiview s touchesbegan and touchesmoved methods
not sure what you see in touchesended yet

32774416
multiplication	modulo
it uses a dwt for multiplication mod a 2 n c with a and c not too large see 17
we compared multiplication modulo 2 2wn 1 in prime95 version 24.14.2 with multiplication of n-word integers using our ssa implementation on a pentium 4 at 3.2 ghz and on an opteron 250 at 2.4 ghz see figure 4

32776359
hive	hdfs
if still safemode takes more than normal time execute hadoop dfsadmin -safemode leave if says permission issue thn use hdfs user to perform the same then check the hive status
reason is a safemode for namenode is essentially a read-only mode for the hdfs cluster where it does not allow any modifications to filesystem or blocks

32776359
namenode	hdfs
reason is a safemode for namenode is essentially a read-only mode for the hdfs cluster where it does not allow any modifications to filesystem or blocks
normally namenode gets out of safemode automatically at the beginning

32780517
implements	extends
the problem is that does not implements and is then deserialized as a sequence instead of a mapping
you will need to create your own implementation of a set perhaps by extends and implementing like this there are more members of that you will have to implements but these are the ones that are necessary to make deserialization work

32783357
udp	tcp
implementation-wise it is also not straightforward and somehow imitates tcp with udp
if you need tcp use tcp do not try to build tcp over udp - you will not succeed

32786233
serializable	deserialization
what that means is developers of bitmap class took special care to implement serializable deserialization logic and made it available to you
not so with bitmapimage class - it s even not marked with serializable attribute so it is not intended to be serialized directly

32787339
postgresql	mysql
this will work if you are on postgresql
will not work if you are on mysql or sqlite

32788507
innodb	myisam
as mhalt hints at there is a good reason not to use the query cache you should be using innodb rather than myisam as myisam is not robust enough for the cloud environment
innodb has built in caching as part of it s buffer pool

32790336
tvos	ios
tvos and xcode 7.1 now is in beta maybe apple will add settings bundle item in tvos section in the stable release
there isn t a settings bundle in tvos section in xcode but you can select the settings bundle from ios section it s a bit tricky but it definitely works

32793100
des	aes
des is a block cipher with a 64 bit block size and a key size of 56 bits usually represented as 64 bits where one bit of each byte is parity
of course you should not be using des anymore you should be using aes instead

32793100
des	aes
of course you should not be using des anymore you should be using aes instead
des can be cracked in a very short time frame

oncreate	onstart
finally you can find your child view within the fragment like so edit seems like the fragment s oncreateview is not called during the parent activity s oncreate
try moving the below code to onstart

32795188
apache	nginx
i would not use apache for anything
here is a sample nginx config you won t need cors with one

32797463
postgresql	mysql
solutions as e4c5 mentioned we can use but this only works with postgresql
it will not work with mysql

32797518
opera	google-chrome
if the notification button works in google-chrome but not in opera then don t try to detect opera but detect that buttons are not working and provide a fallback
for instance if you run into a case where you do want to detect an opera extension environment and use an opera-specific extension api you could use which is the namespace for opera-only extension apis

32797688
explode	substr
when parsing each data row it is not wise to use explode on the comma as this does not handle quote-encased strings that contain commas
explode breaks those strings into substr and gives extra array elements in so this check fails instead php has a purpose-built method to handle this

32798929
equals	compareto
in java you could use equals rather than compareto
note that these aren t exactly the same as and equals use an ordinal comparison rather than a culture-sensitive one - but i suspect that s what you want anyway

32801695
swift	objective-c
example using square brackets to demonstrate that the overridden method is used this works for pure swift classes as well because no foundation methods are used note that as already mentioned in above comments the hash value of an object is not necessarily identical to the memory address. a simple example is nsarray whose hash value is just the number of elements update for swift 3
any subclass of nsobject inherits the description method of nsobject which is defined in the nsobjectprotocol this default implementation prints the class name and the memory address of the object see for example friday q a 2013-01-25 let s build nsobject where it is shown how the objective-c implementation could look like the p format prints the value of a pointer as a hexadecimal number preceded by 0x

32803857
swift	objective-c
try getting all the swift files to be error-free even if you have to fake it temporarily by commenting something out or adding dummy code that compiles without error
also be sure the swift classes that you reference from objective-c inherit from nsobject or some other objective-c class and be sure they aren t all marked private

32803866
multiplying	subtraction
when n is odd the formula is a little more complex subtract 1 from n make a recursive call for n 2 square the result and multiplying by x
n 2 truncates the result so subtraction of 1 is not done explicitly

32804220
dictionary	map
find method returns a list because there are more objects returned. l_d is not a list because is not a list is a key value store a dictionary json or map in scala
maybe you want to take out the values from the map as a list

32805108
wildfly	glassfish
this problem occurs when working applications are migrated off glassfish onto wildfly
unfortunately wildfly s default hibernate jpa implementation does not allow you to fetch a lazy relationship after the context has been closed unlike eclipselink

32807197
matplotlib	colormap
other arguments and keywords like facecolor edgecolor linewidth are not passed to matplotlib in version 0.1.1
you can have a look in the docstring to see which arguments are supported. in version 0.1.1 only colormap and alpha are supported keywords that style the plot

32808500
uiview	subviews
according to their answers i made an implementation of navigation bar title with dropdown arrow image in swift 1.2 create a uiview subclass for custom titleview in your subclass a use auto layout for subviews but not for itself
set translatesautoresizingmaskintoconstraints to false for subviews and true for titleview itself

32808501
lxml	beautifulsoup
just remove the beautifulsoup y lxml call altogether
you should not pass element objects to beautifulsoup in the first place

32809897
build.gradle	gradlew
this plugin requires changes in the module s build.gradle file
specifically the android ... object should be inside model ... object like this so if you have updated your gradlew configuration to use the new gradlew plugin and the new android plugin but didn t change the module s build.gradle syntax you could get gradlew dsl method not found android error

32811811
realloc	malloc
or use realloc and dynamically count the entries and allocate the poitners simultaneously
also your code leaks memory as pointed out by user3629249 in this comment you don t need to cast the return value from malloc try not to mix code with declarations it makes it hard to track variables and their scope

32811899
spaces	linefeed
a non marking group matching either a character not being a carriage return or a linefeed ue search string only or an opening parenthesis or an opening square bracket or an opening brace or a spaces with using a negative lookahead expression checking if next character not being an opening parenthesis or an opening square bracket or an opening brace one or more times
in other words this last expression matches everything up to end of file name or or or not including the spaces left to those characters to avoid getting spaces spaces dash after feat_artist after replace

32813438
accelerometer	gyroscope
the step counter is another example of this it guesses at what a step is based on the accelerometer data
you also wouldn t want calibrated and uncalibrated gyroscope data

32815602
ssl	https
here is your 000-default.conf now here is default-ssl.conf after configuration is done we need to turn on the ssl site and optionally rewrite mod
your problem is that your apache is only configured for port 80 hence it doesn t serve pages over https port 443

32816086
draggable	droppable
in fact you click on the clone not on the droppable element so i would recommend you to attach the clone to the droppable element which means to move these lines to the drop event handler of the droppable element instead of draggable
thus you will create a clone only if draggable element was dropped in the one of three containers

32817341
amd	umd
it will inspect your amd modules and emit them into different layers
currently though if you configure your typescript project to utilise umd the r.js optimiser does not recognise properly your umd modules so the only option is to target amd for your project

32818151
namenode	hdfs
during this time namenode stays in safemode
safemode for the namenode is essentially a read-only mode for the hdfs cluster where it does not allow any modifications to file system or blocks

32818151
namenode	hdfs
safemode for the namenode is essentially a read-only mode for the hdfs cluster where it does not allow any modifications to file system or blocks
normally the namenode leaves safemode automatically after the datanodes have reported that most file system blocks are available

32819712
haskell	agda	haskell	idris
sam lindley and i wrote a paper about hasochism the pleasure and pain of dependently typed programming in haskell
it gives plenty of examples of what s possible now in haskell and draws points of comparison favourable as well as not with the agda idris generation of dependently typed languages

32820958
dictionary	map
to achieve this with gif would require a very lossy algorithm that would select vector quantization of true color pixels not to the closest pixel in the target gif palette but based also on the fact how good dictionary of code words this particular selection will make
the dictionary builds slowly and to achieve 2 bits pixel the average length of the decoded code word would have to map to 5.5 matching pixels in the close neighborhood

32822863
seaborn	matplotlib
as mwaskom says in comments this is straight matplotlib not seaborn
something like this yields this chart as usual importing seaborn beforehand does make the chart more attractive

32823484
union	distinct
alternatively you can use the variant s own stored knowledge of value type by using a visitor if boost is not an option you can hand-craft a suitable union for much the same purpose
and are two absolutely distinct types

32824140
google-chrome	firefox
notice that firefox and ie by default will theme selections based on the background color to make them more noticeable while google-chrome will not
google-chrome will also prevent any truly white selection background against a dark themed background

32826049
gif	png
this is because the built-in gif encoder cannot handle the source well unless it is already a 8 bpp image
you must convert your png image to a 256 color image first then you can save it correctly with the gif encoder

32828887
strdup	malloc
the memory in strdup is created by using malloc not new
strdup - duplicate a string the returned pointer can be passed to free

32830002
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome extension is not loading on browser navigation at youtube
the linked to solution mentions chrome.webnavigation.onhistorystateupdated the equivalent of that in firefox is onstatechange in nsiwebprogresslistener the other option is to insert content script to listen to transition animation end on the youtube loading bar as also pointed out in that stack post

32833582
strncpy	malloc
ignoring the issue with astring returning a pointer to an object that no longer exists you re essentially doing this the first thing to do is remedy the copying situation however you re still returning the address of a function-local object which means strncpy would attempt to copy the nonexistent string returned by astring
here s the second attempt at fixing the problem also you really should add a check to ensure malloc did not return a null pointer before attempting to use ptr at all

32835117
onchange	onblur
put the script below anywhere in your webform and it will work the way you want the validator doesn t work natively the way you want because it attachs an onchange event handler to the textboxes so if you don t change the text at all you don t get the validation
but if you force all the textboxes to trigger the same event onblur then whether if you have changed the text or not it will trigger the validation and that s what the script above is doing adding that event handler to all the textboxes in the page and calling the validatoronchange function when it occurs

32837411
daemons	systemd
it enables a daemons mode that runs the mongos process in the background
by default mongos does not run as a daemons typically you will run mongos as a daemons either by using --fork or by using a controlling process that handles the daemonization process as with upstart and systemd

32837708
equals	gethashcode
overriding of equals looks ok in your case and it should not break anything
but overriding of gethashcode in such a manner using property with public setter in calculation of hashcode will break retrieving of class a item from collections using hash code for example from dictionary if you will change this property value after adding into collection

32838740
pickle	dill
you use pickle might fail dill is more stable
dill is primarly based on pickle and so they are very similar some things you should take into account look into limitations of dill frame generator traceback standard types can not be packaged

32838740
pickle	dill
dill is primarly based on pickle and so they are very similar some things you should take into account look into limitations of dill frame generator traceback standard types can not be packaged
cloudpickle might be a good idea for your problem as well it has better support in pickling objects than pickle not per see better than dill and you can pickle code easily as well

32838740
pickle	dill
cloudpickle might be a good idea for your problem as well it has better support in pickling objects than pickle not per see better than dill and you can pickle code easily as well
once the target machine has the correct libraries loaded be carefull for different python versions as well because they may bug your code everything should work fine with both dill and cloudpickle as long as you do not use the unsuported standard types

32839178
spaces	linefeed
consider this command mysql -uroot -hlocalhost if there is a spaces after the line continuation will not work
the reason is that removes the special meaning for the next character which is a spaces not the invisible linefeed character

32839600
lxml	beautifulsoup
if you do not have this installed already pip install beautifulsoup4 pip install lxml
you can use beautifulsoup to parse your tag

32842783
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
in this particular case the documentation says the following note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

32843461
ssl	https
it used to not support https read more in android downloadmanager and ssl https however it does now
you can simply verify by trying to retrieve a file from a https origin for example

32843761
postgresql	mysql
note in postgresql there s a date_trunc function which returns the beginning of a specified time unit given a date such as week start month hour and so on
but that s not available in mysql

32844826
serializable	deserialization
for example with the following type values are serializable as either or so deserialization is possible by checking which fields are present
but in your type size all cases have zero argument so they would essentially all be serializable as so the deserializer wouldn t know which case to choose

32847017
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
you can check here this exception extends the runtimeexception class and thus belongs to those exceptions that can be thrown during the operation of the java virtual machine jvm
it is an unchecked-exception and thus it does not need to be declared in a method s or a constructor s throws clause

32847335
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this would be the code in swift this is how it would look like viewdidload is called when the controller loads it s view which is not necessarily right after initialisation
viewwillappear is called just before the view is displayed

32850656
udp	tcp
on udp the packets will not be resent
on tcp they will but actually i cannot tell what happens on the sender side if the resend fails too.

32851411
matlab	simulink
variables in the matlab workspace can be used in both m files and simulink
m files that contain only scripts and not functions will write every variable created in them to the matlab workspace

32853692
bower	npm
i guess that xcode has already been installed by npm bower you just need to open it for the first time cmd-space then type xcode to accept the license agreement then rerun bower install ngcordova
if xcode is not yet installed it is probably less of a hassle to install it manually see here for details open it once and rerun bower install ngcordova

32853692
bower	npm
if xcode is not yet installed it is probably less of a hassle to install it manually see here for details open it once and rerun bower install ngcordova
btw ilj is right it is usually a bad practice to run npm or bower under sudo

32854809
ubuntu	linux
i assume that you re not running an ubuntu server that s why you don t have etc apache2 directory
try this edit the httpd.conf file in etc httpd conf httpd.conf and set the allowoverride all then apachectl restart if this doesn t work please run and show us the output so we can know which linux distribution you are running

32855841
bower	npm
if you get bower command not found responses it can be either because you haven t installed bower or because bower isn t in the path
to install bower you need to have npm installed and then you do the following terminal command if your npm install is made as root you could need to be root to execute the precedent command that should install bower and put it in the path

32856224
ionic	angular
if you want something that is more tied to a specific js framework consider the ionic
i ve also successfully completed cordova projects with this it s very fast and well supported but does tie you to angular js at this point although this may not be the case in future

32860358
boost	allocator
first of all don t try to reinvent the wheel try to use some heavily optimized numerical library for example intel mkl fastest and most used math library for intel and compatible processors lapack++ library for high performance linear algebra boost not only numerical but solves almost any problem second if you need a matrix for a very simple program use notation
it s faster because you save an extra memory allocator

32860608
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu uses the debian package format so you can use debian s new maintainer s guide which is the canonical tutorial on how to create a debian package
it makes the assumption that you re going to upload the package to debian which in your case isn t true but that just means you need to skip some sections of the document

32862488
wildfly	jboss
wildfly is using slf4j as defult logging
you have to tell jboss not to use slf4j i am using log4j

32862827
cpython	pypy
pypy is mostly compatible with cpython on language and standard library level but it s incompatible with many cpython c extensions and the compatible ones may actually work slower
if your site is pure python and has proper test coverage you can easily check if it works with pypy and if it s considerably faster or not

32862957
udp	tcp
your tcp socket is connected but your udp socket is not
this means extra processing for every send receive on the udp socket

32866040
translation	localization
this blog post describes what needs to be done to get your strings into the translation interface
the accepted answer is wrong as the localization script is not scanning anything

32870196
config	ini
i have not tried this with mink yet but this is config that allows me to step through debugging of behat with behat running on a remote server configure your server with x-debug of note since this is commandline you need to edit the cli config under etc php5 cli conf.d 20-xdebug.ini
set remote_host to the ip of the computer you re using phpstorm from set autostart 1 disable connect_back you will initiate debugging from the server so there is nothign to connect back to you can also do this without editing your ini by exporting values as env variables just remember to do this each time you start a new shell or add to your .bash_profile file configure phpstorm s debugger it seems by default phpstorm doesn t understand remote-cli scripts so we need to add a config that tells it to expect a cli script to trigger xdebug open the run menu and select edit configurations click the green + to to add a new config and select php remote debug name the config e.g

32871342
super	self
if the base class inherits from object you would typically do super .__init__ feed # python 3 way of calling the super class since strategy is a module file or in some cases folder and not a class there is no way you could inherit from it .
strategy.backtestingstrategy #this is the class that your mystrategy class inherits it is class backtestingstrategy located in strategy.py strategy.backtestingstrategy.__init__ self feed # calls the parents constructor .

32875461
inline	inlining
no the inline keywords will only cause the a code to be inline inside the caller code
this will not affect inlining of b

32877169
google-chrome	firefox
changing your css to this seemed to fix the issue for me in firefox and not have an adverse effect in google-chrome
firefox is interpreting your padding based on a height of 0 due to inheriting from your .home article class

32877545
spaces	delimiter
if you want you can change the delimiter to something else than spaces by using usedelimiter method of scanner class update to change the delimiter to next line and to ensure the code accept spaces in the strings you can change your code to following
i tried following code and it printed 3 when i used 1 2 3 in userinput string the issue is not with split but this is happening cause scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern which by default matches whitespace and that s why this behaviour is shown

32879428
swift	objective-c
swift the other answers here use objective-c so i am providing a swift version here
swift uses automatic reference counting arc so i am not aware of any memory leak issues with this answer as warned about in the accepted answer

32885814
content-length	content-type
the content-length may confuse glide because you re lying about it the original file length may not be the same as the re-encoded jpg output
you re also lying about the content-type because it s a jpg not a png as you state it however i think glide would ignore that

32891725
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
that is mean qgraphicsview set some object scene from qgraphicsscene just like and source then you create main window and add with your qgraphicsview for example as some part qgroupbox qgraphicsscene is like some part of your mainwindow on which you can make some animation you can something draw
qgraphicsscene is more better to using if you want use animation not only static image it supplies more option to manipulate image ex scaling catch mouse click manage via cordinates others object and other object each should be animate or just display

32891743
single-quotes	double-quotes
the variable is not being interpreted because you are using single-quotes
try changing the line to use double-quotes or concatenate the variable update since the api expects json you should do this when using an array as you do according to the manual if value is an array the content-type header will be set to multipart form-data

32892354
allocator	stl
there is also the difference between memory abstraction and custom memory allocator
stl allocator are arguably an abstraction model and not a custom memory allocator

32893032
swift	objective-c
swift has bool type
this is different from objective-c s bool which is not actual type

32893516
ppm	pgm
there are c++ bindings for both imagemagick and graphicsmagick if you d like to do that within your program or you can just use the commandline convert file.ppm file.png or gm convert file.ppm file.png the only problem with ppm is that it doesn t support alpha so this approach is a little more complicated if an alpha channel is needed
one way is to put the alpha in a separate pgm file like ppm but only one channel and then merge them with imagemagick or graphicsmagick

32894988
namenode	hdfs
if you want to browse hdfs directories using a browser open the namenode web ui and there you have an option to browse the files and directories
you cannot browse the hdfs filesystem using a url like hdfs quickstart.cloudera 8020 home cloudera test5 using the browser

32895641
prepare	execute
i used for the table name because the first parameter is the prepare query string
yes you can do it with executemany cursor.executemany insert ignore into s values s s s table_name sql_data note you shouldn t use to pass values to the database instead you need to pass them in the second parameter of execute executemany

32898177
httphandler	httpmodule
you ve confused httphandler with httpmodule
an httphandler does exactly that handle the request. since you only handle the unauthorized condition you only get content when not authorized

32898177
httphandler	httpmodule
an httphandler does exactly that handle the request. since you only handle the unauthorized condition you only get content when not authorized
an httpmodule will examine a request and either do or not do something with it possibly letting it pass through to a handler possibly short circuiting the request if it doesn t like what it sees

32898585
boost	stl
building and using stl objects in shared memory is not tricky yet especially using boost interprocess wrappers
for sure you should also use syncing mechanisms also not a problem with boost s named_mutex

32898585
boost	stl
for sure you should also use syncing mechanisms also not a problem with boost s named_mutex
the real challenge is to keep consistency of stl objects in a shared memory

32900774
retrofit	okhttp
the final gradle.build should contain these 2 lines compile com.squareup.retrofit retrofit 2.0.0-beta1 compile com.squareup.retrofit converter-gson 2.0.0-beta1
jars doesn t contain any information about its dependencies so when you are adding jars you also have to download and add okhttp gson jars

32901605
uiview	subviews
obviously this is going to draw on top of the uiview you re actually using so this would get exceedingly complicated if you re trying to draw things that interact with the default elements of the uiview but for my purposes just a simple frame drawn with a uibezierpath it seems to work great
at present i m not sure if the subviews or the sublayer approach is more efficient

32906273
scipy	sympy
mystic depends on numpy and will use scipy if it is installed however scipy is not required
mystic utilizes sympy to handle symbolic constraints but it s also not required for optimization in general

32908176
implements	extends
no this is not possible - you would have to implements a resourceassembler to add links to your resources
usually your resources extends resourcesupport

32910760
bash	zsh
zsh has support for a -pcre-match flag to be used within and as described on stackexchange which may be a way to accomplish this if you wish to use another shell than bash although bash scripts are not always compatible with zsh scripts
with one slight modification from the original you can use grep -p instead of bash to accomplish this you can see the match here

32913817
innodb	myisam
you might want to use in innodb for testing purposes and not precisely for transactions
in myisam you do not have start transaction

32917735
division	modulo
modulo is not int division
modulo gives you the remainder of a division so 3 26 is 0 with a remainder of 3

32919040
hive	hdfs
to register it you can do the following alter table test add partition dt 20151002 location hive logs dt 20151002
it seems that you are not registering partition in hive meta-store. although partition is present in hdfs path hive won t know it if its not registered in meta store

32919699
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome chromium allow folder upload when webkitdirectory attribute is set
firefox does not allow folder upload currently though user can upload multiple files at single file dialog when multiple attribute set set allow_dirs attribute at firefox

32921025
operands	scalar
in contrast to swift which is much more strict with types the logical operators in c take arbitrary scalar operands. the boolean type bool did not even exist in early versions of c it was added with the c99 standard. the c standard specifies see nsz c c11 n1570.pdf which is a draft of the c11 standard 6.5.13 logical and operator constraints 2 each of the operands shall have scalar type
semantics 3 the operator shall yield 1 if both of its operands compare unequal to 0

32921025
swift	objective-c
therefore the above expression is equivalent to where the zero in the right operand is the null pointer constant which is usually written as null or nil for objective-c pointers some more information how this relates to swift cocoa cocoa touch objective-c methods which return an object pointer usually return nil to indicate an error compare handling error objects returned from methods in the error handling programming guide
so would mean no localized name for the encoding could be determined . the swift equivalent would be a method returning an optional string and you could check the success with however this does not compile and here is the reason why if you option-click on the objective-c localizednameofstringencoding method in xcode to show its declaration then you ll see here _nonnull indicates that the method is not expected to return nil

this kind of nullability annotations were introduced to improve the mapping of objective-c methods to swift see for example nullability and objective-c in the swift blog

32923144
punctuation	words
you need to filter after you have used the counter dictionary to get your words count you can map str.split on the file object chain the elements together rstripping the punctuation away and only keep the keys from the counter dictionary that have a value 1 it does not matter how many words you have per line splitting will remove the newlines etc
and chaining will chain all the words allowing you to call rstrip to remove the punctuation from each

32925601
pickle	dill
sklearn objects can be big so saving many of them to a single pickle is not always a good idea you might want to use klepto which has a dict interface to caching and archiving and enables you to configure the archive interface to store each key-value pair individually one entry per file
i m the dill author

32925601
pickle	dill
on the plus side dill does not pickle classes by reference so by pickling a class instance it serializes the class object itself -- which is a big advantage as it serializes instances of derived classes of classifiers models and etc from sklearn in their exact state at the time of pickling so if you make modifications to the class object the instance still unpicks correctly
there are other advantages of dill over cloudpickle aside from the broader range of objects and typically a smaller pickle -- however i won t list them here

opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
support.html log.php notes 1 - tested on google-chrome firefox and opera
i don t have a mac so i couldn t test it on safari but it should work too

32928037
swift	objective-c
your method doesn t conform to normal objective-c conventions so you could try disabling swift s conversion to a throwing function with the ns_swift_nothrow macro on the declaration of ppcoordinator.isscanningunsupported
you are describing the standard way that functions that produce an error in objective-c are interpreted in swift

32929892
strcpy	strncpy
replace strcpy with strncpy
and use the right length in strncpy depending the length of buffer you are copying in. also you are not checking the return value of strtok

32931183
pthreads	fork
pthreads shared memory is used for inter-process communication for locking for shared_buffers etc etc
not the memory inherited from fork ing

32931393
innodb	myisam
i would use innodb because it supports transactions
it is not slower than myisam on selects and supports fulltext searches from mysql v5.6

32931833
super	extends
this will serve as the super component for the concrete apps i have an abstract baseapplication in lib_commons something like the base activities fragments etc look similar to this so in the where the actual components doesn t exist yet i will create regular interfaces declaring the injection methods so that injection is as simple as getappcomponent injectioninterface.class .inject this
finally the modules would contain the actual component interface which will extends the super appcomponent and every other corresponding injectioninterface declared in the modules it depends on

if you need to protect an arbitrary size of data use rsa to exchange a symmetric key for a stream or block cipher like aes
rsa isn t meant to be used that way

32935479
multiplying	division
add sub multiplying are fine with zeros but potentially a problem with uninitialized junk that might represent nan or something
be careful with division that you aren t dividing by zero

32936484
eventlet	gevent
websocket support is native to eventlet so just installing eventlet in your virtualenv enables flask-socketio to work in the most optimal configuration
gevent and gevent-websocket if for any reason you prefer gevent that also works but in my tests it does not perform as good as eventlet

32936484
eventlet	gevent
gevent and gevent-websocket if for any reason you prefer gevent that also works but in my tests it does not perform as good as eventlet
if you want to have access to websocket when using gevent then you also need to install package gevent-websocket

32937286
ubuntu	debian
i ve also discovered on my debian jessie system where your code originally worked that it fails if i specifically use the plex86 vga bios by running with this command qemu-system-i386 -fda image.flp -vga std it appears this issue isn t specific to ubuntu
it affects debian as well

32938438
sudo	passwd
you need to add a sudo directive which allows the command to run without entering the passwd
the error is telling you that sudo is trying to ask for a passwd and cannot

32938964
postgresql	mysql
enum type in mysql is vendor-specific column type for example sqlite doesn t support it but postgresql does
in mysql an enum is a string object with a value chosen from a list of permitted values that are enumerated explicitly in the column specification at table creation time

32940647
mongodb	bson
yes i know mongodb is technically not a kv store but there is good information in the post...
ok mongodb is a document-centric repository storing json documents really bson but let s keep it simple for now

32941548
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you join an iqueryable with an ienumerable in this case entities.persons and persons your filtering will not happen within your query
instead your iqueryable is enumerated retrieving all of your records from the database while the join is performed in memory using the ienumerable join method

32942193
strcpy	strdup
if you want a separate staring that you can modify you ll need to strcpy it to somewhere else
or you could strdup from the second character if you re happy with a dynamically allocated buffer and your implementation actually has a strdup it s not mandated by the iso c standard

32943188
swift	objective-c
having said all of that for swift projects you really should just go ahead and use alamofire which is written by the same author but is written in swift not objective-c
afnetworking is written in objective-c but you can use it in swift projects

32944272
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
add-apt-repository ubuntu just like every debian derivatives and generally speaking every linux distribution has a main repository of packages that handle things like package dependencies and updating
in ubuntu is possible to extend the main repository using a ppa personal package archive that usually contains packages not available in the system just like oracle jdk or updated versions of available ones example libreoffice 5 in lts is available only through this ppa

32945407
division	multiplication
here example of binary division from one of my bigint templates c++ n is the number of 32 bit dword s used to store a bigint number
qeq a b is a comparison greater or equal done in it returns 0 for 1 for 2 for sub c a b is the speed boost is gained from that this does not use multiplication if you do not count the bit shift if you use digit with a big base like 2 32 alu blocks then you can rewrite the whole in polynomial like style using 32bit build in alu operations

32945742
mongodb	bson
i think with wireshark it should be possible to decode the mongodb traffic mongo wire protocol mongo
i do not think that you can use the dump directly to create bson data

32945816
base	fractions
if you re using an the op isn t but others finding this answer may and the browser supports them you can use valueasnumber instead if you re using or the browser doesn t support valueasnumber you can convert user-input values using parseint value 10 the 10 decimal base 10 if they re meant to be whole numbers that s just one option though you have several the unary + operator will coerce the string to a number using the javascript engine s standard rules for that
the number can have a fractions portion + 1.50 is 1.5

32949782
innodb	myisam
in general best option is to run a single transaction that performs the insert followed by update this is guaranteed to be atomic on innodb table so it either succeeds or fails completely
you are out of luck with myisam as it doesn t support transactions

32950553
seaborn	matplotlib
they have a nice discussion of the colorpalettes here mwaskom software seaborn tutorial color_palettes.html the following code demonstrates how you can pick a new color_cycle automatically for a simple line plot if you want to just change the linecolors and not use the other seaborn pre-sets such as the gray background just import seaborn with import seaborn.apionly as sns
the seaborn package based on matplotlib has nice default graph styles and i ve found that it s a nice way to create an appealing color-cycle

32950663
ubuntu	linux
here you can develop on windows for example even if you are going to deploy on ubuntu the staging machine can also keep phpunit and debuggers but it has to have an architecture very close if not identical with the server and maybe access to a copy of the real database
it has to have the same flavor of linux the same version of apache php mysql libraries as the production server

32952107
matlab	simulink
i was encouraged to use the int32 function to cast the .net enum value to the corresponding integer value by setting the value of the constant block to int32 system.dayofweek.thursday and to configure the switchcase block as follows however i was told that this will not work in combination with any code generation capabilities of matlab simulink
if that is required like in my case one could automatically let matlab generate an appropriate matlab enumeration with the help of .net reflection to keep the enums in sync

32953411
debian	linux
first of all jxcore is not fork of node.js but a node.js distribution with additional features . just like you don t call debian a linux fork
debian could run with different kernels freebsd or hurd and jxcore could use both v8 like node.js and spidermonkey from mozilla as javascript engines

32953463
strcpy	calloc
to copy the contents to the allocated pointer use strcpy strcpy origstr thequickbrownfoxjumpedoverthelazydog
let s see how you request memory with calloc this is wrong for multiple reasons you are allocating space for 9 pointers not 9 characters

32953463
calloc	malloc
let s see how you request memory with calloc this is wrong for multiple reasons you are allocating space for 9 pointers not 9 characters
you don t really need calloc because you will overwrite the contents immediately use malloc

32953463
calloc	malloc
you don t really need calloc because you will overwrite the contents immediately use malloc
you overwrite the pointer with a string literal now you lost reference to the pointer returned earlier by calloc and you cannot possible free it you should only free pointers return by malloc calloc realloc

32954620
bower	npm
you still have to build a copy of the distributed file in order to use it or pull it from bower or a cdn
it isn t an npm lib that can be included with browserify

32958000
google-chrome	safari
so it s hard to know what might have been working in mozilla google-chrome and ie without seeing the complete code
if the above snippet still doesn t work for you in your safari please open safari s web inspector for example from the develop menu or by right-clicking on the page and selecting inspect element and go to the console tab there and check to see what errors have been logged

32959125
noexcept	throw
therefore when defining a destructor with a body which may throw and no exception specification it must be explicitly declared as noexcept false
on the other hand if you are certain that the body may not throw you may want to declare it noexcept to be more explicit and help the compiler optimize but be careful if you choose to do this because if a destructor of any member ancestor of your class decides to throw your code will abort at runtime

32962151
strncpy	malloc
after strncpy call
conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value s 0 bytes after a block of size 3 alloc d -- here i may be zero hence malloc of 0 size consider the case when file has empty line instead of valid word invalid read of size 1 strcmp here s may be empty string so adding empty string handling not to call strcmp for empty string returning error will help

32966071
junit	testng
but they can be easily replaced with junit data-provider
for me the biggest problem is an integration with spring. i do not like to extend testng classes and write code like this because usually i have my own hierarchy of test classes. this was the main reason why i stopped using testng

32966802
memcpy	realloc
replace memcpy with strncpy - you shouldn t copy anything from outside the source object
if you use realloc you can get rid of the entire copying loop when you expand your table

32968054
google-chrome	safari
webkit used by google-chrome 28 safari and epiphany also support it but most of the time are disable at compilation time
blink used by google-chrome 28 does not support mathml at all

32968446
wildfly	undertow
there is some fact you need to understand. when using apache mod_proxy and wildfly the request will heading this way with this picture in mind the configuration should be easy. every request and response is only talking with the apache not with the undertow
therefore there is no additional setting than the http_connector on undertow side needed

32973195
super	implements
i do not understand why they introduced these super generic input output interfaces that are implements by various classes that cannot be used interchangeably
you are right the matrix class does implements that interface via super class cvarray and thus your code compiles. however cvinvoke.findchessboardcorners is supposed to return a few points depending on the size of the pattern

32973625
udp	tcp
the details depend to some extent on the underlying network protocol -- for example pretty much all bets are off for a stream-type protocol such as tcp but a datagram-type protocol such as udp should give you the kind of all-at-once behavior you seem to want
udp in particular however does not offer guaranteed delivery so you have different issues to deal with in that case

32975667
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
the lifecycle of a view controller is as follows init - loadview - viewdidload - viewwillappear - viewdidappear - viewwilldisappear - viewdiddisappear - deinit when you push or present another view controller controller b the current view controller controller a calls its viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear functions respectively but deinit does not get called because the a is still being referenced by the navigation stack
when b eventually pops back or gets dismissed the methods viewwillappear and viewdidappear get called a

32980183
cdr	cons
to apply mapcar to a list that might not be a proper list you can do something like this defun my-map fn conses like mapcar but for a dotted list also. let res while consp conses push funcall fn car conses res setq conses cdr conses when conses push funcall fn conses res nreverse res
listp returns non- nil for a cons cell listp is a built-in function in c source code . listp object return t if object is a list that is a cons cell or nil. otherwise return nil. listp does not check for a true list with cdr of it last cons cell nil

32985089
trie	tree
i have however written out a solution in python using a trie implementation from this answer
hopefully it is clear to you with the above in mind the answer to your original question becomes clearer we do not know ahead of time which combination of prefix words will take us successfully through the tree

32987840
namenode	hdfs
during this time namenode stays in safemode
a safemode for namenode is essentially a read-only mode for the hdfs cluster where it does not allow any modifications to filesystem or blocks

32988229
sctp	tcp
sctp is not better than tcp in any way but it does something different
tcp emulates a reliable ordered stream of octets over an unreliable unordered packet transport which is conceptually very similar to reading from a file without the ability to seek

32988561
listview	gridview
its possible to do by extending gridview and ovveriding onmeasure method the other option is to use recyclerview with gridlayoutmanager insted of listview and then not using gridview
gridview is scrolable element as its takes most space of the row its parent listview becomes untouchable. you need to make your gridview unscrollable

32989624
jar	war
you will only have to activate cdi for the war not the jar in this case since the ejb instances are retrieved by explicit jndi lookups
first of all your ejbs are not not injected as such even if they are deployed with your war

32989624
jar	war
when you outsource the ejbs into a jar cdi is not able to inject the bean isntances that would be produced by ejb the proxies but injects pojo instances instead
to avoid this you could create a producer field or method for each ejb in your war

32990033
sudo	passwd
so just put sudo at the top of the script then it will ask for the passwd right away and after it has been supplied all the other sudo commands will execute without asking anything
sudo doesn t ask you for the root passwd but your own

32990503
octal	decimal	octal	hex
this specifier reads decimal integers but accepts the forms that c code also accepts namely hex 0xff and octal 0377
the inputs 08 and 09 are treated as octal but they are not legal octal numbers because octal has no digit 8 or 9

32995948
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
memory management functions are listed at the beginning of 7.22.3 malloc calloc realloc and aligned_alloc

32997059
serializable	deserialization
java card does not provide any built-in mechanism to serializable a publickey object or objects in general into a byte array or to deserialize a byte array back into an object
consequently you would need to manually perform such serialization deserialization

32998672
super	extends
in your case you don t explicitly call super ... so the compiler is going to implicitly invoke the superclass constructor student however since there is no such constructor the only constructor in student takes two strings and two address es you get a compile error
your course class extends student which doesn t make much sense but that is beside the point

32999721
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
to elaborate on my comment subtraction unlike multiplication and addition which explains why your other examples work is not commutative and javascript evaluation is left-to-right whereas your function effectively does it right-to-left
to get the correct result with your existing code you can use the fact that a subtraction is an addition of a negative number

33000579
multiplying	addition
and this way will not be blocked as multiplying popups
one addition

33002190
client-side	server-side
afaik you cannot use recaptcha on client-side only
you need a server-side language just to process and validate captcha requests

33002688
portrait	landscape
hence as you are tipping back it goes to orientation face up and your code picks portrait as it is not landscape but face up
so add code to detect faceup down and ideally keep to the orientation last set until you see it actually go from portrait to landscape or the other way around

33003530
ssl	https
on your phone in your wi-fi parameters activate proxy set the ip of your windows device on your phone and the port on which the proxy is listening on for me it was 8890 then in internet explorer go to and install the certificate on your windows device in charles under ssl proxy setting add the location to which you want to proxy for me it was api.blabla.com i did not put a port number
in charles proxy you should not be able to see https traffic

33003626
google-chrome	firefox
user2169261 i had a similar problem with google-chrome
the parent window in firefox and ie could refresh correctly but not in google-chrome

33005256
vb6	vba
vba data types 1 fun fact vba doesn t have unsigned integer types since vb6 didn t have them
vb6 came out in 98

33007252
required	placeholder
note it is required to escape with a double-slash since the converterparameter value is in code space and follows normal c# string literal rules and not in markup-space as in the link in the question
from the docs the custom timespan format specifiers do not include placeholder separator symbols such as the symbols that separate days from hours hours from minutes or seconds from fractional seconds

33007902
strcpy	strncpy
first option not recommended use strcpy strcpy citizen.name some name
or the more safer recomended strncpy strncpy citizen.name some name sizeof citizen.name

33012695
super	extends
the super keyword does not work here because abstractclass.m has been declared abstract and therefore there is no suitable implementation of it on the parent of the inner class
remember that inner classes do not extends the outer class even if it is of the same type they include a reference to it instead

33014077
wildfly	jboss
the point is tapestry uses own classloader to support update classes on fly but it can t find own classes in jboss wildfly
check out if wildfly is not changed too much from last jboss version then it could work. if not then it could be a good starting point in looking solution

33014902
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
for the same reason i would recommend to use a descriptive illegalargumentexception instead of a nullpointerexception and give str a better name too
this is opinionated but imho it is better to throw it in the first layer if you got a stracktrace and see a nullpointerexception deep down inside a library implementation it is not clear if it was caused by a bug in the library or by your illegal argument

33020660
pickle	dill
the threading pool works because it doesn t need to pickle anything
so let s look at pickling work so you can t pickle a module ok can we do better using dill

33020994
vb6	vba
without knowing the structure of your vb6 application and your access files and what they do it is virtually impossible to give any sort of useful answer
what you want to do is not easily possible as stated in comments vba projects are not designed to work in this way

33022405
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
the c-style functions malloc calloc free and realloc doesn t ensure that
furthermore there is no guarantee that the mechanism used by new and delete to acquire and release raw memory is compatible with malloc and free

33023293
vim	emacs
yes emacs is the rival to vim as a programmer geek editor
and it seems i am a traitor of vim jump to emacs when the two are at war - it doesn t have to be that way

33023293
vim	emacs
and it seems i am a traitor of vim jump to emacs when the two are at war - it doesn t have to be that way
at first i installed emacs and ess plugin package and tried to learn the basics

33024225
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is why it works on google-chrome but not in firefox safari
i think you re missing a google-chrome is sometimes wiser when it comes to fixing mistyped code

33025320
spaces	delimiter
not sure why everyone missed this but the delimiter should be notice the spaces after the colon
without the spaces the command will return a spaces before the ip address

33025430
swift	objective-c
finding a swifty way to do this is not at all easy because swift has strict typing and no introspection
everything about implementing your own sort-by-sort-descriptor method in objective-c is hard to do in swift

33028487
swift	objective-c
3 doing this in swift doesn t work yet
at least as of the date i was trying this about 10 8 15 and xcode 7 you must do make your nsmutabledictionary subclass in objective-c not swift

33028487
swift	objective-c
at least as of the date i was trying this about 10 8 15 and xcode 7 you must do make your nsmutabledictionary subclass in objective-c not swift
see cannot override initializer of nsdictionary in swift 4 nscoding doesn t work with nsmutabledictionary subclasses

33028487
super	implements
if you just try to override the methods as above and invoke super your code will not work
you need to use composition to internally implements an nsmutabledictionary property

33030395
g++	gcc
you can enable this with the option g++ -std c++11 your_source_file.cpp
gcc doesn t enable c++11 mode automatically and for type-deduction using auto you need c++11 mode or later

33030400
swift	objective-c
try using the objective-c realm pod pod realm you ll still be able to use realm in your swift files you ll just have to convert the objective-c syntax to swift and of course the swift only stuff in realmswift won t be available
you might be seeing this error because using the realmswift pod is not supported in mixed objective-c swift apps

33032864
swift	objective-c
as swift is still a work in progress and realm has a very large codebase it is more convenient to start wrapping the older code around and give the swift features out to the developers without having to redo everything from scratch
i do not know what is the plan for future but the contributors to realm taught this concept in a workshop in this workshop you ll create a swift wrapper framework around a small existing objective-c library

33032911
pthreads	fork
for an implementation independent other than pthreads support solution for the worst case scenario is to use execl to make sure that the actual daemon doesn t fork that you in effect use one program that does the daemonizing thing which don t use boost logging and one program that s the proper daemon program
if it s not a big problem with fork if you don t use the logging fascility after the fork you could even do this with one single executable and differ the behaviour from command line switches

33038273
multiplying	modulo	multiplying	division
if giving is not used then the result is stored in one of the fields mentioned in the statement you should check which for divide multiplying add and subtract
remainder you will only see when the modulo of a division is required

33038943
ubuntu	debian
use alien tool for converting alien binary packages into debian packages or directly installing on ubuntu system
install alien tool on your ubuntu box install .rpm package directly for more info check man page of alien and community wiki update synology cloud station debian package version 3.2-3487 is not available but 3.2-3484 is

33038967
boost	allocator
so or boost it because naked pointers are ugly and error-prone or because not everyone likes boost and the standard has brought us the class or the old standby
you are allocator an array of objects

33039947
swift	objective-c
the solution outlined there is in objective-c and i am not sure how to translate it to swift as it involves directly accessing objective-c ivars in the copywithzone method
so i ve had to implement the basic subclass in objective-c and do the copy in objective-c

33041704
factors	mean
the address and hence the hashcode may be influenced by a variety of random factors depending on the application
however this does not mean that the hashcodes are random

33042807
kerberos	ntlm
it is even wider i could not go shorter than the excellent article we find here authentication in web services using c# and kerberos poc please update when you get more details about your error
kerberos is wide to troubleshot if it fails to ntlm you ll have to brainstorm your configuration

33042807
kerberos	ntlm
kerberos is wide to troubleshot if it fails to ntlm you ll have to brainstorm your configuration
to test you can start by analysing the request response header with a browser plugin i use httpfox for firefox or by using the asp.net authentication test page which might help you further keep in mind that kerberos might fail if try to login from the actual iis server computer using an ip address instead of a name no spn registered duplicate spns registered spn registered against wrong account krb_err_ap_modified no client dns dc connectivity client proxy setting local intranet zone not used for target site also check your configuration for updates about your next question can you explain detail configuration and code implementation about the kerberos implementation in c#

33042897
spaces	delimiter
if spaces are valid characters in the values then use some other delimiter
do not use comma as the delimiter as it means you will need to use macro quoting to call the macro

33047617
junit	testng
or migrate your tests to testng - it is more elegant framework and it works with parallel testing much better then junit imo
you have to provide explicit junit test provider and you should use junit 4.7+ as older versions does not work with parallel testing correctly

33048047
dictionary	map
if you want to merge concat join the data from your dictionary into a single file checkout the merging section of the docs think of this in terms of pandas dataframes rather than spreadsheets
the docs suggest you do this with the following the error occurs as from_dict on a dict of dataframes creates a strange dataframe where each element is a dataframe this isn t going to map to a excel sheet as that expects single values int float string as the elements

33049358
hex	binary
if this doesn t work you might need to send the content as hex edit note that filereadbinary has no buffer size limit and might crash the server when used with huge files
you need to send the binary content of the image if you transfer the request with content-type image jpeg

33052932
jar	war
as explained in the documentation you shouldn t do that when building a jar do not use the src main webapp directory if your application will be packaged as a jar
although this directory is a common standard it will only work with war packaging and it will be silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar

33053106
google-chrome	firefox
it turns out that google-chrome s sort is not stable at least in some cases which is what you are seeing
on the other hand firefox sort is stable

33056637
implements	extends
on the other hand signaturecredential is not implements serializable nor is any type that is recognized by hibernate to be as valid entity type
unless icredential interface extends serializable interface which i don t see in your code

33059211
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
from javadocs - note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

33059839
gson	jackson
with gson with should have not any problem i tried with the code of saurabh and it work well
try with the jackson library

33061076
rational-numbers	base
there will always be some rational-numbers that cannot be represented exactly by a given base
since irrational numbers can t be written as a rational number they can not be represented exactly by a given base

33064438
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari opera and ie the cookie property is defined on document.prototype whereas in firefox it is defined on htmldocument.prototype
ironically in the most privacy-concerned browser safari the descriptor has set configurable to false and does not contain the getter nor setter and neither does __lookupgetter__ or __lookupsetter__

33064890
implements	extends
if you want need all of your models to use the same instance of the databaseconnector class which will allow you to use transactions from within your modelx classes if you want you could make your databaseconnector implements the singleton pattern
i do not think that your modelx classes should be extends the databaseconnector class - they don t seem to be more specific versions of the database connector

33066338
prepare	execute
a given sql statement needs to be prepare at some point whether explicitly with a preparedstatement or on the fly with a statement
there may be a tiny bit more overhead incurred if we use a preparedstatement instead of a statement for something that will only be execute once but it is unlikely that the overhead involved would be significant especially if the statement you cite is true typical dbmses oracle db2 mssql mysql derby etc. will not even promote such a statement to prepare statement cache or at least their default jdbc driver datasource will not

33066338
prepare	execute
there may be a tiny bit more overhead incurred if we use a preparedstatement instead of a statement for something that will only be execute once but it is unlikely that the overhead involved would be significant especially if the statement you cite is true typical dbmses oracle db2 mssql mysql derby etc. will not even promote such a statement to prepare statement cache or at least their default jdbc driver datasource will not
what is discouraged is a pattern like this because the preparedstatement is only used once and the same sql statement is being prepare over and over again

33066589
ng-view	ng-include
this is not how you load views to html in angular.if that is what you are trying to achieve you should use ng-include directive to load an external html template inside div. actually changes the rendering content for your ng-view directive
if you want to change the rendered content of ng-view you need to define the corresponding route while configuring your service.please be a little more specific as to what you want to achieve so that we can give you more relevant solutions

33068882
udp	tcp
second udp is all-or-nothing
unlike tcp which operates on streaming data udp operates in datagrams instead and datagrams cannot be read in pieces

33069309
boost	allocator
to get boost serialization to instantiate the dynamic objects node data you would implement save_construct_data and load_construct_data you can read about this in the context of data classes which are not default constructible now for the central allocator you could use the same
however i suggest that it s probable much easier to simply serialize the mdataspace and mnodespace containers and serialize the indices into them instead of using boost to serialize all the tracked object references

33069595
prepare	execute
for some reason neither select not insert function supports prepare statements which renders them quite useless you can use pdo query instead with exactly the same outcome
but what you really have to is to use prepare execute properly by using placeholders in the query while sending actual variables to execute

33070926
super	implements
even though an arrowfunction may contain references to super the function object created in step 4 is not made into a method by performing makemethod
an arrowfunction that references super is always contained within a non- arrowfunction and the necessary state to implements super is accessible via the scope that is captured by the function object of the arrowfunction

33071635
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist
arraylist doesn t implement ienumerator rather ienumerable
public class arraylist ilist icollection ienumerable icloneable ienumerable edit ienumerator has one simple responsibility

33075928
lisp	scheme
the disadvantage would be that it isn t standardized though there is cffi for common lisp but like i said scheme isn t tied to c so it would be very rude if the spec enforced a c foreign function interface onto non-c implementations
like other dynamically typed languages scheme does have types but they re associated with values instead of with variables

translation	localization
i have same problem my theme is bookyourtravel and plugin wpml string translation did not translation these texts no translation
my solution was in wpml go to localization of themes and plugins check in translation by wpml then clic en save

33089067
client-side	server-side
if you want to redirect based on the hash you need to do it client-side via js
the hash part of a url is of client-side meaning only and is not even send to the server by common browsers so you can not rewrite based on it server-side because your server never gets to see it

33089583
google-chrome	firefox
this inconsistency with the specification is why it s not enabled in firefox by default as the specification may change to match google-chrome s implementation
the shapes expect the transform-box property to be fill-box transform-box fill-box firefox only supports this if the about config svg.transform-origin.enabled is set to true firefox 41 42 or svg.transform-box.enabled is set to true firefox 43 onwards

33090374
apache	nginx
by default apache will include the https environment variable when the connection is made over https however nginx will not if you re using fastcgi_pass
you need to configure this yourself by modifying your nginx config to set a fastcgi_param for https

33091829
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
instead of using nsuserdefaults why not just reference the uitableview itself from the uiviewcontroller set the values you want and then swap to it using self.tabbarcontroller.selectedindex
so for your scenario above it assuming the uitableviewcontollrer is the third view in the uitabbarcontroller you would do something like the following pass whatever you want into the uitabbarcontroller by setting some pre-defined var in it

33091839
hex	binary
it would be expected that the ciphertext is binary not a hex string
a common way to convert it to a hex string is bin2hex

33093871
swift	objective-c
the most obvious way that i can think of to do this would be the following according to the clang documentation instancetype is a contextual keyword that is only permitted in the result type of an objective-c method this is a compiler error however so perhaps the documentation should read instancetype is only permitted as the result type of an objective-c method. my next thought was to cheat by writing some swift code then importing it into an objective-c file to see what the preprocessor did to turn it into objective-c
sadly according to the documentation here generics in swift can t be accessed from objective-c -- because they aren t an objective-c language feature

33093871
swift	objective-c
sadly according to the documentation here generics in swift can t be accessed from objective-c -- because they aren t an objective-c language feature
this document has actually been updated for swift 2.0 according to the revision history

33093871
swift	objective-c
this document has actually been updated for swift 2.0 according to the revision history
probably they still aren t supported because the objective-c type system isn t as expressive as swift s even with the currently available generics

33095003
wildfly	undertow
to save you a click here are the jira s in 8.2.1 wfly-4946 upgrade xerces to 2.11.0.sp3 wfly-4113 8.2.0.final build hangs wfly-4945 8.x cve-2014-7849 wildfly domain management limited rbac authorization bypass wfly-4944 8.x cve-2014-7853 jacorb subsystem information disclosure via incorrect sensitivity classification of attribute wfly-4947 upgrade to undertow 1.1.8.final wfly-4951 rhino scripts can fail due to rhino classes not being exposed
the easiest way to see what is in a wildfly release is to just search on the wildfly jira

33097636
swift	objective-c
when using method swizzling in swift there are two requirements that your classes methods must comply with your class must extend nsobject the functions you want to swizzle must have the dynamic attribute for a complete explanation of why this is required check out using swift with cocoa and objective-c requiring dynamic dispatch while the objective-c attribute exposes your swift api to the objective-c runtime it does not guarantee dynamic dispatch of a property method subscript or initializer
the swift compiler may still devirtualize or inline member access to optimize the performance of your code bypassing the objective-c runtime

33097958
spaces	delimiter
that s not spaces that s empty strings
your string is it s split in the following way according to your regexp when two adjacent delimiter appear it s considered that there s an empty string token between them

33104121
lxml	elementtree
this is because lxml stores the parent in the element and so can t reuse them - it has to create new elements for every child
elementtree doesn t keep the parent in the element and so it s possible for the same element to coexist in several trees at once

33104216
junit	testng
eclipse will show run as testng test since test annotation is imported from testng library if you run it as testng it wont execute before and after since they belong to junit framework therefore driver variable is not initialized so we are getting nullpointer exception either we should import junit test annotation and run as junit test or change after before to aftertest beforetest and run as testng test
in this code snippet test annotation belongs to testng framework and before after annotation belongs to junit framework

33106661
draggable	droppable
there are different ways to do it one of them would be to set revert to true and let the droppable accept the draggable and manage behaviors on the drop
you have the dropped variable that will tell you if the draggable is dropped on a target if so you decide then whether it should revert or not

33107493
realloc	malloc
from c99 standard - 7.22.3.3 the free function ... otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
if you free memory not allocated by malloc or similar your program may cause error

33113068
spaces	delimiter
s3 does not rely have the concept of a folder and it s just doing the delimiter thing to make exploring the key spaces more easily
you can use the prefix and delimiter like you want

33113557
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the 302 to another host using cors only worked correctly on google-chrome
the change that allowed it to work on firefox and ie safari so far still doesn t work was including all the source up front

33115437
stateless	stateful
so when applying term stateful stateless to a stream api we re talking more about function processing element of a stream and not about function processing stream as a whole
also note that there is some confusion between terms stateless and deterministic

33116009
persistent	transient
a transient attribute does not get persistent to the database
for instance in one of my models i have a transient attribute called last_updated_by

33116605
subtraction	modulo
if current_time and last_time were unsigned int s and current_time were less than last_time the result of the subtraction would be an unsigned int and thus not negative
it would be the difference between the times modulo the maximum value of an unsigned int

33117066
rsa	aes
the rsa module is one of the oldest in openssl and dates to the time it was ssleay and eric cared about other things more than information hiding
newer modules like ecc sha aes evp and even somewhat reworked ones like bn bio ssl have apis that almost always remain opaque but rsa doesn t

33121379
implements	extends
i ve got this problem once because cli request routes are not the same object as the standard request object obviously so zend http request is not equal to zend console request it s not the same module plus it s not event the same structure event if they implements the same interface some methods does not exist
zend http request extends abstractmessage this one extends message zend console request extends message directly

33122015
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
this will place all right bar button items firmly attached to the right side of the navigation bar as opposed to being slightly left-adjusted by default the only place to set the uinavigationbar property of uinavigationcontroller is in its init like so the second line sets the root view controller of uinavigationcontroller. since we cannot set it via init rootviewcontroller
as anomie said we need to subclass uinavigationbar and override layoutsubviews

33122362
ionic	angular
you cannot use ionic to access database
ionic is a client side framework for building hybrid apps which itself is built on top of angular js

33122488
innodb	myisam
update your tables to use innodb
move to above your query edit you are using myisam engine which does not support transactions

33125984
glassfish	weblogic
it is still the reference implementation for java ee so you can expect glassfish to be around for as long as java ee is
oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere

33125984
glassfish	weblogic
oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere
it s also important to take note of the payara project which provides support for glassfish but also is actively looking for and fixing bugs in the upstream codebase

33125984
glassfish	weblogic
finally your point about whether or not glassfish is production ready doesn t take into account the amount of glassfish which is comprised of other projects like apache catalina jersey eclipselink weld and others
these are the same technologies used in jboss eap weblogic tomcat etc

33127011
inline	inlining
both .result and .wait will permit the task to be inline but of course .wait x cannot because it has to honor the timeout
however neither .result nor .wait will guarantee inlining - and it s important to keep that in mind when writing reliable code

33130355
swift	objective-c
language mixing with xamarin in case you want to mix swift code with c# code using xamarin then you can bind objective-c compatible swift code and use it in ios projects only
you are not able to execute swift code on android or windows phone

33130430
swift	objective-c
mogenerator working on a update for swift 2.0 issue #302 for me it is not fully ready for production use for swift 2.0
i would generate usual objective-c for model using objective-c code in swift project is so common and use swift extension if you want to beneficial from new swift features

33131921
queue	fifo
so it simply traverses the tree of boxes to find all queue and trivially helps itself to their contained elements
one thing to note is that while each individual queue will be fifo there is no synchronization between the queue so the combined queue will not necessarily be fifo

33131921
queue	fifo
one thing to note is that while each individual queue will be fifo there is no synchronization between the queue so the combined queue will not necessarily be fifo
if we now change the boolean y to a time-stamp or null 0 to indicate false the consumer can also expire locks after some safe timeout to re-activate dead queue

33133023
setinterval	settimeout
using an immediately-invoked function expression doesn t make it happen it s using settimeout instead of setinterval that does it
the mechanism of setinterval will not really start the next iteration before the first one has finished unless the handler does something like begin an asynchronous operation

33133023
setinterval	settimeout
the mechanism of setinterval will not really start the next iteration before the first one has finished unless the handler does something like begin an asynchronous operation
but by using settimeout instead it s possible to have more control over the delays between iterations

33134724
margin	text-align
old question new answer when the image is larger than the wrapping div a text-align center or margin auto is not going to work
but if the image is smaller then solutions with absolute positioning or a negative left margin are going to produce weird effects

33139627
fiddler	charles
it s still not as great as fiddler but it s there if you need it
as of version 3.11 charles proxy has a compose feature edit -- compose or cmd-m

33139702
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
should work on windows macos and linux though with limited usefulness on case-sensitive filesystems tested with node.js v4.1.1 note on windows no attempt is made to case-correct the drive letter or unc-share component of the path server name share name
platforms with case-insensitive filesystems windows macos make it surprisingly hard to get the case-exact form of a given possibly case-variant path - there seem to be no system apis for it so environments such as node.js or python perl ... are not to blame

33140949
swift	objective-c
you have to call it on the class or type in swift linguage itself not on an instance
the initial + in the declaration indicates that is a class method in objective-c

33142191
build.gradle	gradlew
in my case i found a workaround for my problem though add the following code to module-b build.gradle
i did not find a way to skip the testclasses task for module-b it seems that actions started from android studio like running a junit test run gradlew commands that cannot be modified

33147994
memcpy	memmove
or you can use memmove which permits overlapping memory space memcpy is not safe for overlapping copies
memmove is more efficient than a loop though optimizing compilers may solve that

33150026
elasticsearch	kibana
check out the indexes on the elasticsearch domain and look for a line that matches the kibana_index config directive via
for instance if your kibana_index directive is the value is .kibana-4 if you don t see a line like the following green open .kibana-4 1 1 3 2 30.3kb 17.2kb then your kibana index was not able to create the index it needs

33151279
vbscript	vba
the reason you get the error message on the .find line is that vbscript does not recognize excels constants so you need to replace xlvalues with the number -4163
all excel constant values can be found in the vba object browser

33151666

spaces	delimiter
now past the escaped spaces potential let s concentrate on what is in the file
your image and your posted data are not using as a delimiter

33154517
serializable	deserialization
when the queued messages are in xml format the service uses the serviceknowntypeattribute to determine what types are supported by the service for xml deserialization
in this case object isn t really a valid serializable type so it was probably ignored

33154795
inline	inlining
inline mostly means conflicting definitions of this function are to be discarded and one of the versions kept
it also non-bindingly suggests inlining in a vague way in that the standard doesn t really cover what inlining is

33156342
.htaccess	httpd.conf
after that create a .htaccess inside the codeigniter folder not the application folder inside there and use the following code now you have clean url s and no longer need to use index.php about but can just do about
problem solved there is no need to mess with the httpd.conf with mamp installed

33161177
fgets	strtol
ok i think it s easiest to show you some code that does what you want along with some comments about why you should do it that way still you should check the return value of scanf for production quality code because there could be errors the user entering something that isn t a number ... that being said for really reliable user input i d suggest to abandon scanf altogether and just use fgets to read a line of input whatsoever and then parse yourself
strtol could come handy .

33161498
sudo	passwd
backslashes should be escaped so use runtime.exec sudo mount path to mount point dir with spaces in name
as for the passwd sudo may not ask for passwd if recently you entered it on the same shell

33162457
rpm	yum
wget ftp ftp.pbone.net mirror ftp.scientificlinux.org linux scientific 6.0 x86_64 os packages libstdc++-4.4.4-13.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm -ivh libstdc++-4.4.4-13.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm -ivh libstdc++-4.4.4-13.el6.x86_64.rpm method 2 you can use yum to automatically resolve and install dependencies for you yum localinstall libstdc++-devel-4.4.4-13.el6.x86_64.rpm if that doesn t work try yum install libstdc++-devel
you can only install a rpm after you have installed all its dependencies. to install this rpm first you need to install libstdc++-4.4.4-13.el6.x86_64.rpm you can do this in two ways

33165013
comparator	comparable
you can do this via listiterator.add but i ll leave that to you another nice feature would be to allow your class to be constructed with a custom comparator to be used for sorting elements
this would allow use of element types that do not implement comparable as well as the ability to override the default ordering users of the class could supply a comparator for case-insensitive ordering of string s

33167145
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome decided to throw ms-specific code a bone and do both
firefox did not

tvos	ios
unfortunately this is not possible with the current tvos
on ios as advised by apple in qa1629 we would do the above request goes through safari which does not exist on tvos

33172776
prepare	execute
but according to the algorithm i see in your member_controller get_member it seems to me that you are only on prepare stage but not executing yet
i see that qt documentation is not clear enough and again i am not an expert because execute a sql statement on the database and returns a qsqlquery object

33174028
postgresql	mysql
you can use following query to get post by month i tried this with postgresql database
not sure this will work with mysql

33175437
elasticsearch	kibana
i was using nest to insert data into elasticsearch
it seems that the way nest is serializing a list and making a request to elasticsearch has special characters that kibana does not like

33176746
calloc	malloc
note that calloc is functionally malloc plus memset ... 0 but might be significantly faster in some implementations
according to the standard calloc does not store 0 but sets all bits zero

33177245
swift	objective-c
this is how you would do so in swift but it applies to objective-c as well also if you are passing information to your array between other uiviewcontroller s you can add this function to your class so every time you come back to your table view it loads the correct table cell count
i m not to familiar with objective-c but i know you need to initialize your array outside your viewdidload function

33177270
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome load the file but cannot run it
use firefox

33177600
swift	objective-c
you could simply keep the c function and call it from swift. the recipes given in how to call objective-c code from swift apply to pure c code as well
but it is actually not too complicated to translate that code to swift remarks kinfo_proc creates a fully initialized structure with all fields set to zero therefore setting is not necessary

33179318
implements	extends
the abstractactioncontroller implements a whole list of interfaces that makes the controller listen to mvcevents uses the service locator etc
if you are not supplying the controller with a servicelocator etc. then there is no point in extends the abstractactioncontroller

33181126
queue	fifo
maybe i m missing something but since its a queue and not a stack the answer is simple just to make sure you understand queue pops the first item in the queue and pushes items into the back
fifo first in first out. stack pops the last item in the list and pushes items into the back too

33183532
haskell	agda	haskell	idris
nevertheless forms of type-directed name resolution have been discussed for haskell for example in the context of resolving record field selectors and are supported by some languages similar to haskell such as agda for data constructors or idris more generally
it is a design decision not a theoretical problem not to include this in haskell

33184805
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome converts all valid html color names to rgb format except for the following 17 and i m not really sure why pink
firefox pink

33186510
apache	nginx
apache s _mod_security_ had blocked the file uploads but not normal post or get requests and returned 406 not acceptable
issuing resulted in nginx serves as a reverse-proxy and apache is behind it . in such case if you manage the server yourself you can disable the problematic rule using .htaccess or in other ways method 1 - completely disable mode_security for the file less recommended method 2 - disable specific rule modify the path to point to your apache error log which should returns lines like this one note the

33187680
single-quotes	double-quotes
if you replace the single-quotes with double-quotes the variable will get expanded to its value which is what you need here there are improvements possible the improvements more strict pattern in the sed command to make it more robust and to avoid some potential errors simpler way to extract hostname part and timestamp part without any sub-shells simpler arithmetic operations by enclosing within ...
the problem in your script was just this line variables inside single-quotes are not expanded to their values so the command is trying to replace literally hostname instead of its value

33194125
swift	objective-c
one other thing not mentioned here - perhaps this might be due to a wider issue of objective-c not being able to access the swift protocol extension implementations
for example the following code will generate the following in the swift generated header for the extension however using protocol extensions as follows similar to your post generates the following in the swift header for the protocol the implementation is not visible at all and so it seems to imply protocol extension implementations are not supported from objective-c

33195247
super	implements
if there was no default implementation just an interface method then the statement wouldn t make sense as the interface wouldn t contain an implementation like this i also do not see any relationship between super and the two interfaces as implements in flyingcar not sure i understand what you re asking. super is a way to call the implementation in the parent interface. without super there s just no other way to express that
as i understand it startengine was not defined in any super class therefore shouldn t be referred as resident in one

33196972
eigen	ublas
i would recommend using a higher level library such as eigen because it will save you a significant amount of development time with usually small performance costs
there is also ublas which is part of boost so if you are using boost as part of your project you could give it a try though it s not really optimised for performance

33198010
persistent	transient
the persistent context is the place used by the orm to keep track of your objects changes in order to persistent them at a later point
each object in a persistent context will have one of these states new or transient the object has just been instantiated and is not associated with a persistent context

33198010
persistent	transient
each object in a persistent context will have one of these states new or transient the object has just been instantiated and is not associated with a persistent context
it has no persistent representation in the persistent storage

openmpi	mpich
on fedora rhel rpm-based systems you can find the openmpi shared library in the valgrind-openmpi package
i could not find the mpich version

33202242
implements	extends
as i understood what you need is a feature for changing the starting number when using the ordered list which is not implements by the text-angular editor at the moment
what text-angular provides you in such cases is easy extends of the toolbar by adding new or overriding existing functionalities

33203971
noexcept	throw
i personally don t think noexcept will yield any measurable performance boost in but the most obscure corner cases -- compilers that support it are producing backend code that has no performance penalty for code that doesn t throw
to me noexcept is more of a language feature in the form of the compile-time checkable noexcept expression operator

33210300
noexcept	throw
noexcept indicates that a function is intended not to to throw an exception a guarantee you as a developer provides that is not enforced by the compiler
so using it in a situation where your function calls functions that might throw exceptions that you do not catch yourself is bad

33210300
noexcept	throw
the whole range of throw specifiers were removed because the exception specifiers were less than optimal in c++ see difference between c++03 throw specifier c++11 noexcept noexcept has the advantage of not stating which exception is throw but rather whether an exception is throw or not
it accepts a parameter which may be false if you expect the function to throw an exception

33210300
noexcept	throw
noexcept is also an operator which can evaluate an expression and return whether or not that expression may throw an exception or not as per 5.3.7
5.3.7 noexcept operator expr.unary.noexcept 1 the noexcept operator determines whether the evaluation of its operand which is an unevaluated operand clause 5 can throw an exception 15.1 . noexcept-expression noexcept expression 2 the result of the noexcept operator is a constant of type bool and is an rvalue

noexcept	throw
5.3.7 noexcept operator expr.unary.noexcept 1 the noexcept operator determines whether the evaluation of its operand which is an unevaluated operand clause 5 can throw an exception 15.1 . noexcept-expression noexcept expression 2 the result of the noexcept operator is a constant of type bool and is an rvalue
3 the result of the noexcept operator is false if in a potentially-evaluated context the expression would contain a potentially-evaluated call to a function member function function pointer or member function pointer that does not have a non-throwing exception-specification 15.4 unless the call is a constant expression 5.19 a potentially-evaluated throw-expression 15.1 a potentially-evaluated dynamic_cast expression dynamic_cast v where t is a reference type that requires a run-time check 5.2.7 or a potentially-evaluated typeid expression 5.2.8 applied to a glvalue expression whose type is a polymorphic class type 10.3

33210384
noexcept	throw
a noexcept specification on a function is merely a method for a programmer to inform the compiler whether or not a function should throw exceptions
the compiler can use this information to enable certain optimizations on non-throwing functions as well as enable the noexcept operator which can check at compile time if a particular expression is declared to throw any exceptions

33210384
noexcept	throw
the compiler can use this information to enable certain optimizations on non-throwing functions as well as enable the noexcept operator which can check at compile time if a particular expression is declared to throw any exceptions
for example containers such as std vector will move their elements if the elements move constructor is noexcept and copy otherwise unless the copy constructor is not accessible but a potentially throw move constructor is in which case the strong exception guarantee is waived

33210384
noexcept	throw
for example containers such as std vector will move their elements if the elements move constructor is noexcept and copy otherwise unless the copy constructor is not accessible but a potentially throw move constructor is in which case the strong exception guarantee is waived
noexcept is an improved version of throw which is deprecated in c++11

33210384
noexcept	throw
noexcept is an improved version of throw which is deprecated in c++11
unlike throw noexcept will not call std unexpected and may or may not unwind the stack which potentially allows the compiler to implement noexcept without the runtime overhead of throw

jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri
see the readme only works in mri ruby 1.9.2 1.9.3 2.0 2.1 and rbx rubinius and there is experimental support for jruby 1.7.x but it only works in interpreted mode use the option or append to your .jrubyrc
binding_of_caller does not work with jruby

33211612
cstring	bstr
the problem is that just points the bstr to a string literal it doesn t copy the value in the bstr in addition to the fact that the bstr whilst typedefed to does not behave like a cstring
to work with the bstr you must limit yourself to the sys.

33213805
equals	gethashcode
2 no because system.type has a properly implemented equals method
the purpose of the equals method is not only indicate equality but to break the tie when gethashcode produces a collision

33218870
noexcept	throw
inheriting constructors and the implicitly-declared default constructors copy constructors move constructors destructors copy-assignment operators and move-assignment operators are all noexcept true by default unless they are required to call a function that is noexcept false in which case these functions are noexcept false
you can also write lines like the above line will check if foo will throw an exception or not

33218911
express	node.js
you need to check compatibility of es6 with node.js instead any framework like sails.js express etc
because at last node.js will change the javascript to server side code. so it doesn t matter which framework you are using

33225319
memcmp	strcmp
to fix this either make command bigger and put a null terminator on the end or use memcmp instead of strcmp
but be careful with memcmp as it also causes ub if both objects are not at least as big as the size

33238248
keystore	jks
i also found this one importing an existing x509 certificate and private key in java keystore to use in ssl just for clarification javax.net.ssl.keystore must be client cert + key combined not just client cert as described in mysql guide
to summarize we have server-ca.pem - mysql ca certificate can be downloaded from ssl configuration - view server ca certificate client-cert.pem - client public key can be downloaded from client certificates - newly created certificate client-key.pem - client private key can be downloaded only from new ssl certificate created dialog box described here let s save them in server-instance folder and create jks folder for generated files in step 2

so by example if you have to intersect big number like this arr1 103344 234566 789900 1947890 arr2 150034 234566 845465 23849854 put everything into and array arr1 103344 234566 789900 1947890 150034 845465 23849854 and use for intersection the ordered indexes of the result array arr1index 0 1 2 3 arr2index 1 4 5 6 now we have smaller numbers with whom we can build some other nice arrays
what i did after taking the method from yorye i took arr2index and expand it into theoretically boolean array practically into byte arrays because of the memory size implication to following arr2indexcheck 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 that is more or less a dictionary which tells me for any index if second array contains it. the next step i did not use memory allocation which also took time instead i pre-created the result array before calling the method so during the process of finding my combinations i never instantiate anything

33244003
daemons	systemd
the flag is for the docker daemons
it is applied systemd wide not to single containers

33244009
google-chrome	firefox
use this for google-chrome firefox not yet supported
open bug to implement cue pseudo-element - edit support for firefox is available it works similarly as it does in google-chrome and opera

33244551
udp	tcp
if noone specific is found then in_addrany is used to find a match. if you always bind to in_addrany you can not have 2 udp sockets doing a recfrom with a socket bind to the same port nor can you have a listening tcp socket on the same port either
for udp the discussion ends here

33245089
union	distinct
select user_id from cloud_storage_a union select user_id from cloud_storage_b union select user_id from cloud_storage_c using keyword union here will give you distinct user_id s across all three tables
if you switched that to union all you would no longer get distinct which has it s advantages in other situations not here obviously

33245089
union	distinct
if you switched that to union all you would no longer get distinct which has it s advantages in other situations not here obviously
edited to add if you wanted to bring in user address you could use this thing as a subquery and join into your user table that union will need to grow as you add more cloud_storage_n tables

33245321
floating-point	fractions
decimal is not a floating-point data type
the decimal structure holds a binary integer value together with a sign bit and an integer scaling factor that specifies what portion of the value is a decimal fractions

33245909
set	bag
hashset already has an implementation of such a method that can compare two sets for equality so we can just create a wrapper around that so that we can use it with any type of sequence next to account for the fact that you have a bag not a set we can just take the two sequences that you have group them and project that out into a pair that has the item along with the count of matching items
if we do that for both sets then we can compare these sequences of objects as sets and see if they re set equal

33251171
direct3d	directx
it does not install direct3d directdraw directsound directinput directplay directsound directmusic directshow etc
everything you can call directx is part of the os as of windows xp service pack 2 and can only be updated by windows update service packs or new versions of the operating system

33251645
comparator	comparable
this class guarantees that the map will be in ascending key order sorted according to the natural order for the key s class see comparable or by the comparator provided at creation time depending on which constructor is used
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface

33251645
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

33252349
cstring	bstr
cstring is a c++ class
it is not binary compatible with a bstr

33255924
rar	zip
the maven-assembly-plugin does not support the rar archive format
quoting the format documentation the list of supported formats is zip - creates a zip file format tar - creates a tar format tar.gz or tgz - creates a gzip d tar format tar.bz2 or tbz2 - creates a bzip d tar format jar - creates a jar format dir - creates an exploded directory format war - creates a war format when the archiver encounters an unknown format it defaults to jar and for this format a meta-inf directory is created by default

33257880
vsto	add-in
microsoft office applications can disable vsto add-in that behave unexpectedly
if an application does not load your vsto add-in the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in

33257880
vsto	add-in
if an application does not load your vsto add-in the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in
hard disabling can occur when an vsto add-in causes the application to close unexpectedly

33257880
vsto	add-in
it might also occur on your development computer if you stop the debugger while the startup event handler in your vsto add-in is executing
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close

33257880
vsto	add-in
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close
for example an application might soft disable a vsto add-in if it throws an unhandled exception while the startup event handler is executing

33257880
vsto	add-in
when you re-enable a soft-disabled vsto add-in the application immediately attempts to load the vsto add-in
if the problem that initially caused the application to soft disable the vsto add-in has not been fixed the application will soft disable the vsto add-in again

33266501
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you want the jsfiddle with code jsfiddle demo full-screen jsfiddle demo tested in google-chrome firefox ie and safari
minor adjustments may be needed for certain font-family s edit this solution is prettier but doesn t work in google-chrome or ie the main condition for this to work is .snowflake must be display inline-block

33266737
octal	decimal
there is not a less two relationship though because 20 octal is 16 decimal 30 octal is 24 decimal etc
the escaped character is not encoded in decimal

33266737
octal	decimal
c has several forms of character escapes backslash and character specifier n r etc. backslash and 1 to 3 digits octal specifier digits must not be 8 or 9
377 backslash and x then hexadecimal number x40 backslash and u then hexadecimal number unicode constant 10 in octal is 8 in decimal hence your result

33271026
quicksort	mergesort
a sorting analog to median of medians exists using the pivot strategy approximate median in quicksort and similarly yields an optimal quicksort the short answer why mergesort is prefered over quicksort in some cases is that it is stable while quicksort is not
check wiki namely the selection by sorting section similarly given a median-selection algorithm or general selection algorithm applied to find the median one can use it as a pivot strategy in quicksort obtaining a sorting algorithm

33272576
rsa	aes
more importantly either a private key or public key or certificate for a public-key-crypto aka asymmetric scheme like rsa is not a symmetric key
java secretkeyspec is only for symmetric keys used with symmetric algorithms like aes

33272968
implements	extends
move method calculate perimeter to class shape and implements it using the getsides and getsidelength this is what is known as a template method design pattern not to be confused with the template function concept of c++ which is an entirely unrelated concept specific to this language
when you use inheritance you factor common behavior and state in the base class and make derived classes extends this state and behavior with their specific functionality

33274223
implements	extends
also it is always better to implements runnable because java does not support multiple inheritance via the extends concept
therefore in the future if your serverhandler needs to actually extends a custom class it wont be able to since it already extends the thread class

33275168
ubuntu	linux
for an overlayfs aufs mount you will need to initialize docker run with --cap-add sys_admin and for ubuntu and possibly other hosts with apparmor you also need --security-opt apparmor unconfined or preferably an apparmor profile which relaxes the necessary restrictions instead of unconfined
i m not sure about selinux . solution 2 runtime mounting uname -a linux agthinkpad 4.1 .10-040110-generic #201510030837 smp sat oct 3 12 38 41 utc 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux mkdir tmp overlay-test cd tmp overlay-test . dockerfile . entrypoint.sh docker build -t overlay-test . successfully built 582352b90f53 ok let s test it

33280319
division	multiplication	division	addition
you just have to treat it the same way you treat the division
for addition and multiplication the order does not matter

33285004
super	extends
there are rules for if and when you can use wildcards and when to use extends vs super depending on if you are putting new elements or not from the collection
see the explanation of the get-put principle which is sometimes called pecs which stands for put extends create super edit to be able to add other animals to the list later you have to change the animal list field to not use a wild card

33291315
super	self
super is then obviously aware of the previous calls before it it s not
when you do super b self .foo super knows the mro because that s just type self .__mro__ and it knows that it should start looking for foo at the point in the mro immediately after b

33296242
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately google-chrome s elements panel does not focus the part you edited so you either always start at the first attribute or you edit the whole element
in the firefox devtools there is currently no way to let their inspector do the updates immediately

33297211
mayavi	matplotlib
from mayavi import mlab mlab.figure mlab.surf x y z mlab.show
matplotlib 3d plotting isn t very good for large amount of data

33300743
super	extends
you may specify exact types like in here we create a type that extends a generic type but is not generic itself or you can create a generic type which uses its own type parameter for specifying the actual type argument of the super class note how we create a new type parameter n with its own constraints and use it to parametrize the superclass to require its type parameters to match ours
in contrast when you declare a class like you are extends the raw type function and create new type parameters which are entirely useless in your scenario

33303926
spaces	delimiter
in your case the 2 or 3 known fake spaces are before the timezone in the date after the http action for the url and before the http version
the space after get or post put... before the url is a known space but not a delimiter between individual values

33303926
spaces	delimiter
the spaces after get or post put... before the url is a known spaces but not a delimiter between individual values
if you replaced all occurrences of get with and the spaces for the timezone 01 +0300 say d d s first.

33303999
rvm	bundler
first remove your bundled_rspec wrapper it s not needed with latest rvm versions
then measure your rspec loading with and without bundler if time rspec -v gives you big numbers even for project with relatively small gemfile it s a bundler issue

33304865
ssl	https
as explained here new pci dss requires https cookies to be marked as secure. so first of all your site should use ssl for sensitive data
when you are using ssl and you are sending a cookie to client you need to mark the cookie as secure so the cookie will not be readable over http protocol

33305948
oncreate	onstart
activity is not going through the documented life cycle of oncreate onstart onresume onpause onstop and then ondestroy is bypassed to make it oncreate and then ondestroy without other methods it is going through the portion of that lifecycle that is appropriate for the situation
quoting the documentation the visible lifetime of an activity happens between the call to onstart and the call to onstop

33306248
stateless	stateful
conversely a stateless account would go as follows or even more idiomatically in this case balance is referentially transparent
now novaraccount doesn t have any var in it but it is still stateful because it s forwarding calls to account which is indeed stateful

33309638
serializable	deserialization
you can find more details on if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

33311677
super	implements
for a given event you will always receive one or more calls to touchesbegan withevent probably many calls to touchesmoved withevent and then either one or more calls to touchesended withevent or touchescancelled withevent a few things to consider here you should always implements all four of these methods even if you do nothing to prevent partial events from going up the responder chain which is what the super implementation does
you should not call super if you are handling the events

33312626
hex	binary
with this in mind you could interpret the strings as base-16 int first xor them and convert the resulting int back to a hex string
strings in python 3 are unicode objects and so a string of hexadecimal chars does not correspond to the binary representation of the int in memory which you need to use xor

33312785
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload begin frame.height 163.0 viewdidlayoutsubviews frame.height 161.5 should not be called yet viewdidload end frame.height 161.5 viewwillappear frame.height 161.5 viewdidappear frame.height 190.5 after removing layoutifneeded viewdidload begin frame.height 163.0 viewdidload end frame.height 163.0 viewwillappear frame.height 163.0 viewdidlayoutsubviews frame.height 190.5 viewdidappear frame.height 190.5
the problem was that i was calling layoutifneeded during viewdidload and before the text label s text was set

33313076
implements	extends
it would be best to define a superclass for all plugins implements via class instances and filter on that
if you want all instances which are not class definitions themselves and not functions then you can achieve this with however i would consider this really an error prone solution as really you just find anything that somehow extends object and does not have a special type for that like functions do

33313522
gridbaglayout	miglayout
which you use will come down to your needs have a look at how to use gridbaglayout for more details
not to discount the power of something like miglayout but if you re stuck on a project which limits third party libraries then knowing how to manipulate the default layout managers is one of the most important skills you can develop you could simply add a filler component into you layout setting it s weightx and weighty properties to fill the available space by changing to i can effect the position of the title as well but you can also effect it by using the anchor property

33318886
bash	zsh
bash ksh zsh in an understandable deviation from posix extend the assignment logic to and as well
in other words in bash ksh zsh export typeset declare local commands are treated like assignments so that quoting isn t strictly necessary

33319014
octal	decimal	octal	hex
you are using the python notation for octal escapes not unicode codepoints
if you wanted to include the u+0332 combining low line and u+0305 combining overline characters for example you need to use the uhhhh hex escape sequence in a unicode string here 818 decimal is 0332 hexadecimal and 773 is 0303 hexadecimal

33319165
gruntjs	package.json
what ever the error if you want to gruntjs integration
try to remove them and remove the node_modules folder of you project and run npm install you will see that you won t be able to run gruntjs task like default because all plugins needed are not registered in the package.json

33319539
lxml	libxml2
as it s said in the lxml docs the support for parsing broken html depends entirely on libxml2 s recovery algorithm
it is not the fault of lxml if you find documents that are so heavily broken that the parser cannot handle them

33321665
plone	buildout
the builtin content types in plone folder file image etc can be upgrade by plone.app.contenttypes but custom content add-ons should be migrate by a developer or their maintainer
buildout is not managed ttw through the web you must have access to the server filesystem where the plone is hosted

33321665
plone	buildout
buildout is not managed ttw through the web you must have access to the server filesystem where the plone is hosted
the buildout automates the installation and or configuration of plone and their additional components like a webserver cache service etc. but not only plone and many other softwares built with python or not

33321665
plone	buildout
the buildout automates the installation and or configuration of plone and their additional components like a webserver cache service etc. but not only plone and many other softwares built with python or not
from buildout.org website buildout is a python-based build system for creating assembling and deploying applications from multiple parts some of which may be non-python-based

33324254
swift	objective-c
to avoid the crash implement the observer method in the swift class that uses the protocol
the implementation has to be in the swift class itself not just the protocol extension because a selector always refers to an objective-c method and a function within a protocol extension is not available as an objective-c selector

33324803
firefox	safari
for example firefox doesn t include an origin header on same-origin requests
but chrome and safari include an origin header on same-origin post put delete requests same-origin get requests will not have an origin header

33328039
matlab	simulink
matlab simulink can not run m code directly on raspberries but you can run simulink models using the raspberry support package for simulink
this includes matlab s-functions which contain m code

33328524
retrofit	okhttp
compile com.squareup.okhttp3 logging-interceptor 3.9.0 you can also visit square s github page about this interceptor add logging to retrofit 2 while developing your app and for debugging purposes it s nice to have a log feature integrated to show request and response information
since logging isn t integrated by default anymore in retrofit 2 we need to add a logging interceptor for okhttp

33328524
retrofit	okhttp
since logging isn t integrated by default anymore in retrofit 2 we need to add a logging interceptor for okhttp
luckily okhttp already ships with this interceptor and you only need to activate it for your okhttpclient

33335077
swift	objective-c
in practical terms there s zero use for the versions in swift
but if you re writing c code or pre-closure objective-c then they re the idiomatic way to perform callbacks since closures aren t supported

33337109
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this will work beautifully in google-chrome firefox edge ie ie will only prompt the user once to access the clipboard
safari 5.1 at the time of writing does not support execcommand for copy cut all browsers except firefox which is able to only handle mime type plain text as far as i ve tested have not implemented the clipboard api

33347680
super	self
for anyone thinking ah but in 3.x you don t need arguments to super that s only true inside instance class methods
during the class definition none of the inherited attributes are available you can t even access them using super as the name of the subclass isn t defined within the definition block the only way to access the inherited attributes at definition time is to do so explicitly using the name of the superclass alternatively you can access them within class or instance methods but then you need to use the appropriate prefix of the class conventionally cls or instance conventionally self parameter

33348775
spaces	delimiter
however if you want fields to be split only on tabs and not on spaces then use
you can use awk note for a tab delimiter file as well above awk command will work since space or tab are default delimiter

33353322
avro	thrift
some differences hive is best for structured data pig is best for semi structured data hive is used for reporting pig for programming hive is used as a declarative sql pig as a procedural language hive supports partitions pig does not hive can start an optional thrift based server pig cannot hive defines tables beforehand schema + stores schema information in a database pig doesn t have a dedicated metadata of database hive does not support avro but pig does
edit hive supports avro specify the serde as org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.avro pig also supports additional cogroup feature for performing outer joins but hive does not

33358317
inline	inlining
the following trivial snippet of code proves my point node 4.2.1 on win10x64 results elapsed time function calls 127.332373 elapsed time no function calls 104.917725 + - 20 performance drop one would have expected the v8 jit compiler to inline those functions but in reality a b or c could be called somewhere else in the code and are not good candidate for the low hanging fruit inlining approach you get with v8 i ve seen plenty of code java php node.js having poor performance in production because of method or function call abuse if you write your code matryoshka style run time performance will degrade linearly with the invocation stack size despite looking conceptually clean
function calls are always expensive especially in for cycles and inlining doesn t happen as often as you may think the v8 engine that ships with node.js any version is supposed to do inlining extensively but in practical terms this capability is greatly constrained

33358324
multiplying	division
if you were to look in ieee std 1076-2008 9.2.7 multiplying operators you d find that division by a physical type other than with a left operand of the same physical type is not a predefined
you need to define a function to overload the division operator for your physical type or you you need to convert the left hand expression to your physical type

33358625
ubuntu	linux
note that the ubuntu package for libiomp5 isn t quite correct so you will need to add a symlink in usr lib from usr lib libiomp5.so to usr lib libiomp5.so.5
i m using g++-5.1 and clang++-3.6 on linux mint 17.2 essentially ubuntu trusty and i see the same results with the following code

33359866
equals	gethashcode
so when you overload equality-related operators and but not the equals method you get a warning
likewise implementing custom equality relationships without fixing gethashcode to properly reflect those equality relationships is a good way to get very-hard-to-fix bugs

33360427
inline	inlining
so when you use inlining you should be really confident that the inline function is bullet-proof otherwise you will make your code a lot harder to debug
i would really not bother with inlining unless you have a simple function that is called all the time

33361233
multiplying	division
if you want to display percentage you need to multiplying it by 100 as simple as that
here it is not a percentage like 50 it is a division like 0.5 that s why it never exceeds 1

33366334
setcontentview	findviewbyid
the moment setcontentview is encountered the views in your layout are created
that s when the creation of views is done and not when you do a findviewbyid

33371210
implements	extends
no you cannot treat nodejs as just another javascript library as nodejs is not a library but an application in the same way that a browser is an application that also happens to implements javascript
both nodejs and browsers extends the javascript language

33372161
allocator	stl
if you are bound to a particular compiler that does not support stateful allocator you have a few not-so-shiny options include a reference to your state as template argument of the allocator in your allocator include a back-link to the allocator in question usually destroys the purpose of a custom allocator for small data
before c++11 stl implementations were allowed to require allocator to behave as-if stateless

33374245
google-chrome	firefox
it s failing in firefox because you ve tried to reference the ie-specific global event variable which google-chrome also provides as a bone thrown to ie-specific code as sdgluck pointed out
firefox doesn t have that and so the code throws an error

33374306
pickle	dill
you could try not using pickle and instead using a better serializer like dill
with dill the class definition is stored with the pickle of the instance so it s easy if you don t know what type of instance you are unpickling

decimal	ieee
the current ieee std 754-2008 includes definitions for two different 64-bit floating-point representations a decimal 64-bit floating-point type and a binary 64-bit floating-point type
after rounding the string .99999990000000006 is the same as .9999999 in the ieee binary 64-bit representation but it is not the same as .9999999 in the ieee decimal 64-bit representation

decimal	ieee
after rounding the string .99999990000000006 is the same as .9999999 in the ieee binary 64-bit representation but it is not the same as .9999999 in the ieee decimal 64-bit representation
in 64-bit ieee decimal floating-point .99999990000000006 rounds to the value .9999999000000001 which is not the same as the decimal .9999999 value

33379536
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition
multiplying movl edi eax imull esi eax ret well that s certainly removed some code but it s still doing imull a regular multiplication
let s try to get it to not use imull with gcc -o2 -s multiply.c we get multiplying leal rdi rdi eax ret instead of computing the slower it instead computed x + x because addition is faster than multiplication

33379571
google-chrome	firefox
the filter chain does not appear to be valid so you should report a bug on google-chrome

cypher	gremlin
look into query.scala as a starting point on what defines a cypher query and what its grammatical components are
for gremlin i m not sure how it works but again i d guess you need to go source code diving it s likely that they too use a parser generator of some sort where the grammar is going to be effectively in code

33396421
udp	tftp
however this is not the only way udp traffic can be lost
your protocol has some similarities with tftp in that files are transmitted in blocks over udp

33396509
udp	tcp
if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you
not all packets containing file fragments are received by the other side this is a design feature of udp

firefox will also have a value of 0 but it will also factor in the values
unfortunately safari will not record consistent pagex pagey values for keyboard events and ie will record the exact location of the mouse when the keyboard click event was fired

33401783
serializable	deserialization
this precompiles all the serializable objects used by the assemblies sgen was run against and caches them in the resulting dll
this can give huge time savings on the first deserialization loading of config files from disk and initial calls to web services. if any iis servers do not have outgoing access to the internet turn off certificate revocation list crl checking for authenticode binaries by adding generatepublisherevidence false into machine.config

33401806
realloc	malloc
what you want here is the realloc function reworking your code such that size is actually the size of the array rather than its last index would help simplify this code but that s neither here nor there
calling malloc repeatedly like that doesn t do what you think it does

33402622
prepare	execute
before calling con.setautocommit true the example closes the possibly outstanding prepare statements
as such those statements will not get execute when switching back to auto-commit mode

33405909
serializable	deserialization
later when you try to deserialize this child xml by using serializable of type b it fails because generated serializable xml does not have context of base type
you have to create serializable of type b so that generated xml has the attribute xsi type which instructs xmlserializer which child type to instantiate during deserialization

33411081
division	modulo
hint modulo of a number after division by 5 and 1 not equal to 0 means it was not cleanly divisible by 5 the basic case is the ternary operator which is an if then else condition evaluated from the first argument if to return the second where true then or the third where false else
so you just need a logical condition to evaluate fives or tens then return that value for the grouping key and the modulo logic where the current price divided by five is either a odd even number depending on the remainder from division by two

33413807
implements	extends
the problem is that facebook facebook doesn t implements app_id app_secret and default_graph_version as public properties so your parameters are not taken in account when yii builds the object declared in your component
one way to fix that is to create your own class that extends facebook with those public properties and to correctly call facebook facebook constructor from it s own constructor

33414410
setinterval	settimeout
to fix this i used settimeout calls the function once after the specified time instead of setinterval calls the function over and over again
since we want it to be called not just once we put the call to settimeout inside the function changetext so it adds a timer to call itself

33417353
ssl	https
you can call app.listen twice with two different ports to start both ssl and non-ssl servers
you cannot serve http and https traffic on the same port

33422147
slug	permalinks
however the individual posts permalinks will not have the blogroll page s slug in the route
the only way you re probably going to be able to do this without a plugin is by utilizing categories and a custom permalinks structure

33424609
exponent	addition
an 80-bit value should be best held as combination of a long for the mantissa and an int for the exponent and sign
for many operations it will probably be most practical to place the upper and lower halves of the long into separate long values so the code for addition of two numbers with matching signs and exponents would probably be something like a bit of a nuisance all around but not completely unworkable

33426404
glut	glfw
here one can request a specific profile in general i would advice you not to use glut at all and move to a more modern way for window handling such as glfw or sdl2
glut itself is terribly outdated and does not support opengl 4.1 but it has a updated and extended opensource replacement freeglut

33427050
factors	matrix
so the expected number of rounds is about n 2 that is n 2 up to a constant factors no matter what the entries in the matrix are
you can t hope to do a lot better than that i think -- that s about the same amount of time it takes to just read all the entries of the matrix and it s hard to sample from a distribution that you cannot even read all of

33435629
des	aes
but it all that is rather old and today s best practice would use pbbkdf2 with sha in place of md5 and aes in place of des
md5 and des are extremely week and should not be used in new work

33438621
punctuation	words
what you can do if you want to use fulltext search is to perform a prefix search where you can search for words that start with i2 like this note that you cannot search for i2 in the middle or end of a words like or as in this case the asterix is ignored as standard punctuation and is not treated as a wildcard
this is due to the way that fulltext search works it s different to the way like works as it is not doing simple pattern matching it is language aware and is actually looking for words hence why it finds the row with the words i2 in it but not the one id 352 with the words id21 for example

33439452
rpm	yum
install the necessary support software yum install epel-release # you need this for mock yum install rpm-build yum install redhat-rpm-config yum install rpmdevtools yum install mock add a rpm build user account do not build as root or as a real user - security issues will come back to bite you
sudo adduser builder --home-dir home builder --create-home --user-group --groups mock --shell bin bash --comment rpm package builder next we need a build environment

33440378
stateless	stateful
a transaction stateful proxy is not the same as a call stateful proxy. stateless proxy a logical entity that does not maintain the client or server transaction state machines defined in this specification when it processes requests
a stateless proxy forwards every request it receives downstream and every response it receives upstream. an incoming sip request coming to a stateful proxy server will usually exist for a short duration

33440412
hive	hdfs
i needed to use the write function on the hivecontext and needed to use the com.databricks.spark.csv to write a sequencefile in hive
this does not require an intermediate step of saving a file in hdfs which is great and writes to hive successfully

33443041
subtract	addition
that also means that you have to subtract a 65 from your letters not 64
because decryption and encryption are so similar you can implement them in a single function with a flag for the mode of operation things to note the addition of 26 in the formula is to prevent taking the remainder of a negative number which will yield a negative number in c

33444961
getdate	datepart
right 0 + dt_wstr 2 month getdate 2 the isn t a concatenation operator in this languages so that is problem #1 with your formula
datepart returns an integer representing a datepart of a date

33445264
stateless	stateful
that being said idiomatic react greatly favors stateful components housing stateless components
unless theres a good reason for a child component to manage itself that is manage its own state and not let its parent manage it you should be composing your site with as few stateful components as possible that contain many stateless children

33447065
innodb	myisam
first and foremost if you are not using innodb close this question rebuild with innodb then see if you need to re-open the question
myisam is not preferred and should not be discussed

33448105
centos	linux
doing a few more tests centos 7 in this case so it seems linux ping does not reject the underscore completely but it does appear it disallows it being the first or last character or as a consequence the only character in an atom of the hostname
because linux more specifically some component of it such as libresolv or even ping itself is honoring the rfcs

33449086
ssl	https
also it does require keeping two sets of ssl config up to date though but that s a minor inconvenience
however if you were planning on using https at the front end and http for the second hop then this would mean that the traffic between your nginx setup and shopify url would not be encrypted

33450128
stateless	stateful
more correctly http is stateless
applications running on-top of http will most likely actually be stateful but http itself is not

33452421
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the behavior is seen in google-chrome upto v48.0.2535.0 dev-m ie edge opera and safari
the border image doesn t extend beyond the div in latest firefox v41.0.1 ie v11 in the below snippet you can see how it looks as though all other sides have a 3px border

33452421
google-chrome	firefox
there is no clear explanation either in the web or in the specs about whose behavior is correct google-chrome edge or firefox ie11
the w3c specs also say the following about border-image properties but in firefox and ie11 the border-image is not shown when only border-width is provided and border-image-width is avoided

33453014
boost	stl
seems like a lot of fuzz for nothing i don t think writing the phrase if you can use boost can be honestly described as a lot of fuss
because it s not an extension to the c++ standard library nor to the stl naturally

33453112
boost	stl
in my opinion boost is great extension to stl sometimes very heavyweight and clumsy but great nevertheless
boost is not a library but a collection of largely independent libraries of individual quality

33455775
direct3d	directx
if you were using direct3d 11 instead you can make use of directx tool kit and the spritebatch class to draw your hud
the directx sdk is deprecated the d3dx library is deprecated d3dxmath is deprecated and debugging for directx 9 is not supported on windows 8 or later

33456589
equals	compareto
take a look at the documentation of the equals method for bigdecimal compares this bigdecimal with the specified object for equality
unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equal only if they are equal in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by this method

33461215
prepare	execute
well your prepare statement is not preparing artistname
when using prepare statement you put placeholders in query and then execute passing variables to query

33461778
swift	objective-c
there s lots of this particular one on github but didn t find one in swift so i wrote my own put this in its own file like uibutton+block.swift then invoke it like this clearly this could be improved there could be options for the various kinds of events not just touch up inside and so on
but this worked for me. it s slightly more complicated than the pure objective-c version because of the need for a wrapper for the block

33462108
octal	decimal
in python3 integer literals cannot consist of a 0 followed by other digits if you really want octal literals you need to start them with 0o
but is seems you want decimal anyway in which case you need to remove the leading 0 s

33466238
scikit-learn	libsvm
in general libsvm is not designed to work with texts and i would not recommend you to do so - rather use some already existing library which make working with text easy and wraps around libsvm such as nltk or scikit-learn
libsvm representation is purely numeric so label index1 value1 index2 value2 means that each label index and value have to be numbers

33467408
google-chrome	firefox
it just works fine in firefox check the attached snapshot i executed the same in google-chrome browser but this is not expected
as it is valid and also firefox is doing right the same should have been worked in google-chrome

33469090
super	self
not using super can put unnecessary constraints on users of your code
somebaseclass.__init__ self means to call somebaseclass s __init__

33470513
bower	npm
you probably need bower as a local dependency and not global
if you are using grunt-bower-task you should ve downloaded bower from its dependencies already - but since the error specifically says that it cannot find module bower you should install it locally in your project s root with npm install bower -d

33471286
ubuntu	debian
here is a good tutorial on apt-get and friends apt get tutorial manage packages on ubuntu debian addendum i believe this command might help sudo apt-get install libxp6
yum isn t limited to redhat just as apt-get isn t limited to ubuntu

33471286
ubuntu	linux
yum isn t limited to redhat just as apt-get isn t limited to ubuntu
but apt-get is the native package handler for all debian-based linux distros including ubuntu

33474520
dictionary	map
as you can see in the json practically it is not a list but a dictionary
so gson can t really map that to a list without losing information

33482792
profiling	debugging
but side note its really bad and not very intuitive...i would recommend using some nicer commercial profiling instead because they are much simpler
as it turns out later versions of visual studio have this built in so right now with visual studio 2013 i can create a new profiler session by opening up visual studio and from the top menu there is an analyze drop down just go to analyze - profiler - attach detach to attach it to an existing process running in debugging mode i seem to have to do this inside of another visual studio window or else its grayed out

33484800
spaces	linefeed
this includes not just spaces or tabs t but also the carriage return r
for windows wsl cygwin etc users make sure that your line endings are standard unix line feeds n linefeed only

33485310
implements	extends
something like this or you can use an android.support.v4.app.listfragment which is implements in a similar manner to listactivity
you are extends appcompatactivity not listactivity appcompatactivity does not inherently implement a listview so there is no setlistadapter method

33485310
implements	extends
you are extends appcompatactivity not listactivity appcompatactivity does not inherently implements a listview so there is no setlistadapter method
you need to either extends listactivity which does not extends appcompatactivity so this may not be preferable or put a listview in your layout and call setadapter on your listview

33488309
udp	tcp
irc runs on tcp not on udp
i m trying to create server with tcp ip protocol you have created a sock_dgram udp socket not a sock_stream tcp socket

33488309
udp	tcp
i m trying to create server with tcp ip protocol you have created a sock_dgram udp socket not a sock_stream tcp socket
you cannot call listen or accept on a udp socket only on a tcp socket

33488407
implements	extends
instead make your drawable entity classes such as player base and enemy implements a common interface say drawable that has a painting method say draw graphics g
do not have them extends jcomponent jpanel or any other swing component

33488917
udp	tcp
in tcp it will be different than udp as tcp is stream oriented
for tcp tcp_connection_recv instead of reallocating a buffer if the buffer passed by the user is not big enough you can fill the whole buffer and then return maybe with an output parameter and indication that there is more data waiting to be read

33489771
symfony	silex
good alternative to silex if you prefer the symfony 2 style
comparing silex to symfony before 2.8 release silex microframework is based on symfony but it s not exactly the same thing

33489771
symfony	silex
comparing silex to symfony before 2.8 release silex microframework is based on symfony but it s not exactly the same thing
using a full-stack framework such as symfony for a small project is simply overkilling the project

33489771
symfony	silex
i would say that for small projects in symfony you would have to remove features - were in silex you would have to add them
it is also not true that silex isn t fit for larger projects

33491280
bash	zsh
using variables with the sequence-expression form of brace expansion only works in ksh and zsh but unfortunately not in bash and mostly strictly posix-features-only shells such as dash do not support brace expansion at all so brace expansion should be avoided with bin sh altogether
given your symptoms i assume you re using bash where you can only use literals in sequence expressions

33498204
super	implements
mix projects are super simple to set up you can specify your default exclusions in test test_helper.exs exunit.start exunit.configure exclude pending then you can write your test in test sublist_test.exs
to run the tests do and to include pending tests as well do now for your second question people usually mark tests as pending because they are not implements yet but they don t want to forget about them

33498452
bash	zsh
may be better to set something like note that i am using how to compare strings in bash script that is
as way to compare strings in zsh since is not posix

33499901
amd	umd
you may also consider switching to browserify or webpack instead of requirejs webpack natively supports amd modules and there is an amd loader for browserify . additionally both of them enables you to pre-build your templates using this loader for webpack or this transform for browserify and avoid including the whole handlebars library which is always a good practice
you do not need and should not shim handlebars as the library integrates a umd wrapper and thus is compatible with the amd pattern of which requirejs is an implementation and actually because when the library will load it will find the define function it won t append handlebars to the root object which is window . as a result obviously your shim can t find it

33499901
amd	umd

now your problem is that you want to use handlebars an amd loaded module with a non amd module

33500858
udp	tcp	rtp	rtsp
while http streaming is a newer standard offering more features rtsp rtp streaming may work better when streaming through a firewall router which doesn t have udp streaming open
this article may be useful this article explains how to configure the videolan vlc media player to stream live or on demand streams through rtsp rtp over tcp rtsp rtp interleaved

33506632
super	self
second if you are using python 3 the recommended style for invoking a super class method from a sub class is super .method_name parameters although in python 3 is possible to use superclassname.method_name self parameters it is an old style of syntax that is not the prefer style
first the reason you must use thread.__init__ self instead of thread.__init__ is because you are using the class name and not an object an instance of the class so you cannot call a method in the same way as an object

33507390
swift	objective-c
in the same way objective-c knows nothing of swift protocols and especially nothing of swift protocol extensions
as far as objective-c is concerned the viewdidrotate method is not present in the view controller class

33513163
bash	zsh
i stumbled upon your question when trying to solve the same issue while migrating from bash to oh-my-zsh
the reason it s not there is that there is no code setting it for zsh but there was for bash

33513163
bash	zsh
the reason it s not there is that there is no code setting it for zsh but there was for bash
generally theres something exporting java_home whenever a new bash window is opened so it s always set for you

33513465
client-side	server-side
you cannot safely replace these columns on the client-side because it will be available to a user somehow
if you want a user to never learn how your columns are actually named you should do this at the server-side

33514559
hive	hdfs
it s nothing like hive infrastructure on top of hadoop
aster file system comes as complex plug-able functional layer integrated into aster software - not as independent framework and software that are hdfs and hadoop

33520472
backtracking	greedy
there is no good way to do it with a pattern starting either with or in particular with large data since the first will cause a lot of backtracking and the second must test for each taken character if the following subpattern fails until it succeeds
using a non-greedy quantifier isn t faster than using a greedy quantifier

33523369
spaces	delimiter
the parser doesn t ignore spacing even though the uri spec rfc2396 specifies that spaces should be excluded and that spaces can be used as a delimiter section 2.3.4
the inclusion of spaces in the host names causes the networking error

33525069
innodb	myisam
it looks like i already had the myisam stopwords cleared but not the innodb ones
it s a little but harder to do than for myisam but here are the steps for anyone else that might need it in your etc my.cnf or my.ini on windows add these lines create a stopwords table

33526698
fgets	fread
one improvement would be to copy full lines or bigger text chunks using fgets and fputs even better is to not copy the file as a text file but instead just as a binary chunk
this is achieved by opening the file in binary mode with the b flag so and using fread and fwrite instead of the put character functions

33529064
multiplying	multiplication
your calculation breaks down when you attempt to multiplying inv a and d as the orders of these galois fields do not match
in this example it is unnecessary to explicitly define a as a galois field of order 2 gf 2 as multiplication in gf 256 takes place in gf 2

33529484
ienumerable	ilist
he is referring to the ability to implement with a read-only concrete type if you are writing such an api wrap the array in a readonlycollection and return an ienumerable or an ilist or something but not an array
and of course do not simply cast the array to ienumerable and think you re done

33534798
swift	objective-c
you ll learn more about the product module name later in naming your product module . for example your objective-c file would import this generated header #import myapp-swift.h for more information see importing swift into objective-c section of the using swift with cocoa and objective-c mix and match if you re not seeing the xxx-swift.h file double check your target settings note i searched for swift in the settings to narrow down the results. as you ll see the following are all set install objective-c compatibility header is set to yes
the objective-c generated interface header name is set and matches what i imported into my objective-c code

33535523
super	extends
this means that for java the following lines of code really look like this notice that the type information has been erased and only the super type baseevent remains as the type parameter for both methods which causes ambiguity and won t work
if the extends keyword had not been used it would only see object instead but would still run into the same problem

33537017
cdr	cons
if they are the answer is unique cdr l
if they are not it is cons car l unique cdr l

33537886
jar	manifest.mf
eventhough your class path in manifest.mf contains jar that you are dependent it does not mean that they actually on your class path when you run your project
you have two option here either put all the dependent jar in the same directory of your runnable jar or create a shaded jar

33541030
equals	gethashcode
the solution implement equals with the same rules as the gethashcode or provide a implementation to your hashset
it is not enough to only have a gethashcode method

33542804
bash	subshell
just group the commands and redirect its output or even better without invoking a subshell courtesy of ignacio vazquez-abrams you can read about this in bash reference manual - 3.2.4.3 grouping commands list placing a list of commands between parentheses causes a subshell environment to be created see command execution environment and each of the commands in list to be executed in that subshell
since the list is executed in a subshell variable assignments do not remain in effect after the subshell completes

33543285
google-chrome	firefox
it works as expected with google-chrome
looking under the hood you can see in firefox s console this error referenceerror tr is not defined trace 7 9 after a quick search it appears this uses trace-viewer which is embedded in google-chrome

33550970
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
by default uitabbarcontroller will allow not defer calls to the various rotation methods of uiviewcontroller to it s children
it is possible to subclass uitabbarcontroller and override these methods with an implementation that calls the method on the currently selected view controller so it can restrict rotation

33553280
google-chrome	firefox
ie and google-chrome have slightly different implementations because of that
firefox does not have an implementation of innertext yet

33555607
realloc	malloc
similarly you don t want to update number_of_friends until after the realloc call has completed
should be remember that realloc like malloc takes a number storage units bytes as an argument not number of elements of a particular type

33555607
realloc	malloc
should be remember that realloc like malloc takes a number storage units bytes as an argument not number of elements of a particular type
also realloc will return null on failure so you want to preserve your original pointer until you re sure that the realloc operation succeeded

33558982
factors	matrix
coordinatematrix doesn t support multiplications but is pretty easy to create and transform to other types of distributed matrix blockmatrix.multiply coordinatematrix.toblockmatrix 3 3 each type has its own strong and weak sides and there are some additional factors to consider when you use sparse or dense elements vectors or block matrix
multiplying by a local matrix is usually preferable since it doesn t require expensive shuffling

33561426
serializable	deserialization
problem is inner serializable process
actually it s implemented using deserialization pattern which doesn t work of course

33570561
uiview	calayer
they are owned by a uiview but they cannot own a uiview or another uilayoutguide
uilayoutguides do not contain a calayer and they are not a uiresponder

33574797
translation	localization
the issue seems to be that the module sometimes takes some values from the default en language into the target language which then prohibits the term to be listed as to be translation
yes sometimes the localization doesn t work perfectly

33575571
subtraction	addition
you can craft a simple program to examine what the logic would do with 3 bit addition subtraction
giving so for addition you would have one like this the signed overflow flag by definition is for when you interpret the bits as signed so 1 + 3 001 + 011 the bit pattern 100 which in a three bit twos complement world has the value -4 so 1 + 3 -4 which is wrong so signed overflow we cannot represent a +4 with three bits

33576679
google-chrome	safari
it may be useful to know that while google-chrome works great on most mobile devices the binary installed on your ios device does not share the same javascript api or runtime engine as everyone elses google-chrome
see apple likes to make sure all of their software works great in the apple eco-sphere - so any browser that s developed for ios actually needs to run using the safari rendering engine

33576838
spaces	delimiter
you allocated the spaces for the array but not for each individual struct that the pointers in the array point to other notes in c you should not cast the result of malloc
since you are reusing the delimiter string it would be good to store that in a variable instead of retyping the same sequence

33578048
interpolation	splines
update 2 although your input data doesn t contain any negative voltages this doesn t guarantee that the interpolation data won t
the splines fit is not constrained to be non-negative and you can expect the interpolation values to undershoot the real data in some places print volt.min # 0.0 print d_itp.min # -0.0172434740677 i m not really sure i understand what you mean by also the values input do not always seem to correspond to the points which should be their positions

33578048
interpolation	splines
the splines fit is not constrained to be non-negative and you can expect the interpolation values to undershoot the real data in some places print volt.min # 0.0 print d_itp.min # -0.0172434740677 i m not really sure i understand what you mean by also the values input do not always seem to correspond to the points which should be their positions
here s what your data look like as a 2d heatmap the colors of the scatter points representing your original voltage values match the interpolation values in the heat map exactly

33582238
udp	tcp
for example bittorrent can use both protocols udp for communicating with tracker and to manage the dht and tcp to transfer chunk of files
that s my explanation about their choice the tracker or the dht is interrogated periodically that means that in one day of usage you could update your tracker hundreds of times if some times that didn t work isn t a big deal because you are updating you tracker next time anyways the same idea is in the dns protocol you send your request via udp if you don t receive a response in a reasonable amount of time you just resend the request

33582238
udp	tcp
that s my explanation about their choice the tracker or the dht is interrogated periodically that means that in one day of usage you could update your tracker hundreds of times if some times that didn t work isn t a big deal because you are updating you tracker next time anyways the same idea is in the dns protocol you send your request via udp if you don t receive a response in a reasonable amount of time you just resend the request
the tcp protocol instead must be used for file transfer because you prefer to be more slow but you want absolute reliability

33585443
implements	extends
you could subclass mkpolygon and implements -isequal and -hash based on your own logic to compare the coordinate points
as you surmised it has to do with mkoverlay not being comparable specifically equatable and since mkoverlay is a protocol you can t extends it as you would a class

33587061
oncreate	findviewbyid
edit 1 added code you need to initialize all your view elements like the textview in oncreate itself and keep the reference as a class variable if you are going to use that view outside of oncreate
you are trying to do findviewbyid and update the text view in your doinbackground method via the update function which you cannot do

33590071
floating-point	fractions
frac and f d are display tokens not conversion tokens ti calculators can only store numbers one way in their proprietary floating-point format
this means that numbers cannot be converted from fractions to decimal or vice versa only displayed as fractions or decimals

33591899
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is with the dc.js version you are using an old version of dc sort works on firefox ie but not on google-chrome
well that s the reason why ethanjewett is able to see it sorted because he may be seeing this in firefox or ie

33592599
erlang	elixir
even the function you re calling bare are in a module - it s called kernel in erlang they live in erlang module
functions in erlang elixir are identified by module name and arity - only a combination of those three elements can tell you the real identity of a function but all of those three are concerned with only naming of the function - not data it acts on

uiview	subviews
edit 2 refer to this q a for new ish methods for rendering uiview as bitmaps as of ios 7 so if you are supporting ios 6 you can ignore this but that s unlikely
the gist of the article is that you can now use the uiview method -drawviewhierarchyinrect cgrect afterscreenupdates bool i can t say whether or not there exists a mathematical way to calculate the exact answer but one way of going about it would be add the two views to a parent view with the opaque view below the transparent view convert the parent view and all of its subviews to a uiimage sample the uiimage for the color it is composed of doing 1 is trivial

passenger	unicorn
as for your how to shutdown an app after a certain amount of time passenger already does that by default but you mean want to tweak things a little
have a look at these two config options passenger_pool_idle_time passenger_min_instances unicorn does not use less memory than passenger

scheme	racket
i would suggest using a named let classic scheme or the more rackety then since you re using racket and presumably dr racket the ide use the automatic indentation feature it helps a lot to make your code readable in order to understand how this code works use the build-in debugger to execute it step by step read a scheme tutorial which will teach you the common looping constructs among other useful things
your code doesn t work append expects only lists and is not the way to do it in scheme for more than one reason

33596764
arraylist	treeset
you can use the arraylist collection but elements are not automatically ordered after every insertion unless you invoke again an explicit sorting
to achieve this you have to use treeset or a concurrentskiplistset

33599991
implements	extends
the following post shows an example of implements listableobjectstore the repo referred to in the post tl
dr copy-paste jdbcobjectstore in your own class which implements listableobjectstore cannot extends its private fields and add the following continuing on sudarshan s example you d then add the following setting to your jdbcstore and the following query to your jdbcconnector p.s it s also convenient to add a transformer to this class to which you could assign mule s byte-array-to-object transformer

33606274
client-side	server-side
if not caught it will stop the currently running function and if it is thrown from a method or a subscription it will appear on the client-side
the above thrown error server-side will appear on the client with the reason and the details

33606720
mongodb	bson
mongodb does not use json
mongodb uses bson for both internal storage and as a communication interface

33608915
ssl	https
it s not hard though there are free ssl certificates coming let s encrypt
the best way to bypass the deprecation is to move your application to https

33610429
setcontentview	findviewbyid
in showsecondactivity.java you need to call setcontentview before you can use findviewbyid
until the setcontentview has taken place your view isn t in place and so it can t be interrogated for what it contains

33611121
factors	mean
if you do you ll see that uv2 has all the info as you didn t iterate through each element but you used the factors column as a whole
not sure what you mean by the numeric variable in real-life

33614114
concave	convex
concave hull isn t unique other than convex hull
for example this is another concave hull green you ll need some kind of heuristic to create a concave hull

33614979
super	self
just call the super method in your mixin class class myaddon object def remove_unusable_data self ... def categorize_data self super myaddon self .categorize_data self.remove_unusable_data i d like to note some things the method resolution order is left to right you have to call super you should be using kwargs for cooperative inheritance it seems counterintuitive to call super here as the parent of myaddon does not have an attribute called categorize_data and you would expect this notation to fail
this is where the super function comes into play

33621948
rar	zip
the only implementation of rar in javascript i know is at and does not seem to support encryption
if you need a portable compression format you may use zip instead with two implementations at and the latter seems to be the simpler one to use but as far as i can see both do not support encryption

33624351
nunit	mstest
solution with nunit with nunit you can mark single tests or even the whole fixtures with a category -attribute or and the only run those using nunit-console.exe nunit-console.exe mytests.dll include integrationtest solution with mstest the solution for mstest is very similar but here you have to mark all tests with that attribute it cannot be used to decorate the whole class
then like with nunit only execute those tests in the integrationtests -category using vstest.console.exe using mstest.exe mstest testcontainer mytests.dll category integrationtests edit you can also execute certain test-categories using the testexplorer of vs

33628922
implements	extends
postlink is not a part that is implements there but you can easily achieve it
in my example i have namespace of application with class of tag that extends from phalcon tag

33636547
uiview	subviews
my uiimageview is not directly added to uistackview instead wrapped in plain uiview
this way i can avoid interfering directly with any constraints that uistackview creates for each added subviews

33638874
cifs	smb
the key part of that error message is error initializing tcp-ip smb session handler permissão negada that is telling you that when alfresco tries to bind via jlan to the port s needed to offer cifs smb it is getting permission denied as you ve found out over on your related question on serverfault on linux by default a normal user can t bind to ports below 1024
cifs smb make heavy use of ports down in the one hundred range which regular users aren t allowed to listen on

33639909
prepare	execute
it is the result of the query you need to fetch mysql_ is deprecated use prepare statement i m not sure if mail has a limit on the recipient but it sounds like you should send them in batch see vonhergen and dagon for other things to fix
you did not execute the query prior to fetching and you passed the query string to mysql_fetch_array that is not correct

33641961
google-chrome	firefox
actually i think google-chrome and ie are the ones being wrong
they do give what you want but they should not like firefox

33642184
tensorflow	tensorboard
tensorboard comes packaged with tensorflow
tensorboard isn t a separate component

33647113
inline	inlining
point 2 is nonsense - all modern compilers at least ms gcc and clang aka xcode completely ignore inline keywords and decides purely based on frequency size critera determining code-bloat factor based on size number times so small functions or functions called only a few times are more likely to be inline - of course a getter would be a perfect choice for inlining always by the compiler since it will be only two or three instructions and most likely shorter than loading up this then calling the getter function
the inline keyword doesn t make any difference at all and the c++ standard states that a definition inside the class is inline anyway

33647113
clang	llvm
note that this is the inliner code for clang and clang++ - clang itself does not do anything particularly clever when it generates code it s just upsetting hundreds of programmers who have spent hundreds of manyears on that project
a parser for c and c++ that translates to llvm ir all the good clever stuff is done at the llvm layer - this is really a good way to provide a multilanguage compiler framework

33654421
base	fractions
since base 10 decimal has 2 and 5 as factors while binary only has 2 you can see where you can t perfectly represent things
for example in decimal the fractions 1 3 is not perfectly representable 0.33333333333333 this is particularly a problem adding numbers up as you re asking sas to do above

33656732
lisp	scheme
you could and some lisp implementations notably melt and probably sbcl do that define lambda as some macro - which would expand to building some closure in an implementation specific way but lambda cannot be defined as a function
lambda needs to be a core language feature like if let define are in scheme because it is constructing a closure so needs to manage the set of closed or free variables and somehow put their binding in the closure

33656983
imperative	declarative
in an imperative world you would tell them step by step how to make dinner
you have to provide these instructions go to the kitchen open fridge remove chicken from fridge ... bring food to the table in a declarative world you would simply describe what you want i want dinner with chicken. if your butler doesn t know how to make chicken then you cannot operate in a declarative style

33658232
gridview	objectdatasource
if you just want to bind the grid on the first page load then remove the objectdatasource control remove the objectdatasource1_selecting event handler remove the datasourceid property from the gridview and just bind the grid when the page loads if you want to use the objectdatasource control then give it a valid typename and selectmethod remove the objectdatasource1_selecting event handler and have the selectmethod return the data markup if you re using .net 4.5 you could also use model binding to load the data from the code-behind without using a data-source control markup
that s not how the objectdatasource control is meant to be used

33658614
client-side	server-side
no this is not possible with html alone because html is a client-side language and cannot access the server s files
to do this check if a file exists on the server and disable the link you must use a server-side language like php

33659236
zlib	libpng
in fact i just checked and libpng requires zlib libpng.org pub png libpng.html i m not sure why my original search or suggestions didn t bring that post up
i originally excluded the dlls for other file formats i wasn t using or initializing in my code but once i included the zlib dll bingo

33662548
n-gram	words
you have trimmed it twice once with n-gram and once with edgengrams which looks very wrong
your query does no trimming so your 11 words character does not match anything

33667571
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg has another solution for streaming server which is called ffserver which prepare ffmpeg pipe for vlc or another third-party application
and that s bad written and buggy too libav group -another fork of libav libraries never used ffserver code and in not sure if they have any plan to consider ffserver as their solution

33673870
google-chrome	firefox
no unlike firefox google-chrome doesn t expose its ui to extensions
the only remotely related options are webnavigation.onbeforenavigate or webrequest.onbeforerequest in case the prediction service is enabled use a prediction service to help complete searches and urls typed in the address bar option in google-chrome settings

33675345
sudo	passwd
option 2 perform a specific command as hdfs without leaving the cloudera user session cloudera quickstart sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -ls .
as cheloute has replied yarn and hdfs are technical users so they do not have a normal account with passwd or proper home directory you can check this looking at the etc passwd and etc shadow files -this last one as root

33678546
scheme	racket
racket is a descendant of scheme but it does not conform to any existing scheme standard
however racket is extensible it can support lots of languages even user-defined ones so different iterations of scheme are supported by racket

33678546
scheme	racket
perhaps confusingly even #lang scheme isn t an implementation of any scheme standard
in truth #lang scheme is a deprecated language that has been completely supplanted by #lang racket the former existed before plt scheme was renamed to racket much in part to reduce the confusion about its scheme not being an actual scheme implementation

33678546
scheme	racket
in truth #lang scheme is a deprecated language that has been completely supplanted by #lang racket the former existed before plt scheme was renamed to racket much in part to reduce the confusion about its scheme not being an actual scheme implementation
well racket does provide implementations of the various scheme standards

33679334
direct3d	directx
keep in mind that legacy direct3d 9 is over a decade old and debugging support the debug runtime for direct3d 9 is not available for windows 8.x or windows 10
the pix for windows tool in the deprecated directx sdk works for direct3d 9 but fails for direct3d 10 or direct3d 11 applications on the directx 11.1 runtime or later windows 10 windows 8.x windows 7 sp1+kb2670838

33680357
decoder	encoder
you will however find that a number of json encoding decoding libraries across languages do add support for other data structures or types typically adding handling behavior around primitive data types but i would not rely on this unless you fully understand the data structures that are going to be passed and how they are going to be encoded decoder across all applications that might pass the data around
for example php provides support for certain primitives as shown in this note from the json_encode documentation note like the reference json encoder json_encode will generate json that is a simple value that is neither an object nor an array if given a string integer float or boolean as an input value

33681697
cdr	cons
nil you could do setf cdr cdr cdr the-list list d and you d replace the nil with d to get a b c d
that requires using setf rather than setq since setq can only modify variables not arbitrary places like the cdr of a cons cell

33683991
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian
for discussion copy file to xclip and paste to firefox command-line copy paste with xclip debian ubuntu copy shell prompt output to linux unix x clipboard directly
the xclip program can do this if not already installed you may be able to install it since there are packages for the usual systems such as debian and fedora reads from standard in or from one or more files and makes the data available as an x selection for pasting into x applications

33687871
qtwebengine	qtwebkit
unfortunately this is normal for qtwebkit and will be never fixed because it is recommended to use qtwebengine now
about memory leaks there is a number of techniques you can use to clear memory like see here but usually this is not very helpful and you will have memory leaks as far as you will use qtwebkit

33688463
ubuntu	linux
reminder when you re using multiprocessing you need to start a process in an clause see programming guidelines on windows i see now starting process now joining process setstate happening now getting results from queue 10 now getting pickle dumps setstate happening 10 on ubuntu i see now starting process now joining process now getting results from queue 5 now getting pickle dumps getstate happening setstate happening 10 i suppose this should answer your question
the multiprocess invokes __setstate__ method on windows but not on linux

33689728
agda	idris
in agda s standard library there is a lift type in the module level to achieve something similar but it does not work as nicely. it would make sense to add cumulativity to agda
idris in addition has typical ambiguity where the universe levels are not apparent to the user but somehow the typechecker is supposed to check that you are not using universes in an inconsistent way

33693298
client-side	server-side
i cannot speak about specific implementation performance or file size limits but i am fairly certain that the desired approach here would be having both client- and server-side cropping implemented thusly if client is able to crop it client-side client sends to server whatever it s got cropped if able to crop uncropped otherwise server inspects what it received
if dimensions are greater than accepted crop it server-side

33693990
bash	subshell
as read in the bash reference manual - the set builtin -e exit immediately if a pipeline see pipelines which may consist of a single simple command see simple commands a list see lists or a compound command see compound commands returns a non-zero status. the shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword part of the test in an if statement part of any command executed in a or || list except the command following the final or || any command in a pipeline but the last or if the command s return status is being inverted with
if a compound command other than a subshell returns a non-zero status because a command failed while -e was being ignored the shell does not exit

33694757
gradle	ivy
following helped for the same problem while using gradle for dependency management
not sure how ivy works but if you can add additional repositories there adding should do the trick

33695762
apache	nginx
by default it will be installed to opt nginx on archlinux you would rather use the abs to get the pkgbuild and add the following to the configure part that way you also get the systemd unit-file to start and stop nginx.service last but not least here s the nginx config i use to run redmine using another webserver may be a daunting step but it took me less than 2 hours to get redmine up and running with nginx compared to nearly 2 days of wasted time to figure out why the heck apache didn t serve the webapp any more
i suffered the same issue on my archlinux installation with apache 2.4 and redmine 2.6.5

33704691
lemmatization	stemming
it usually sufficient that related words map to the same stemming even if the stemming is not in itself a valid root while in lemmatization it will return the dictionary form of a word which must be a valid word
in lemmatization the part of speech of a word should be first determined and the normalisation rules will be different for different part of speech while the stemming operates on a single word without knowledge of the context and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech

33705673
srt	subtitle
it turns out that my srt file had a bogus subtitle basically this shows that the subtitle ends before it begins which is not allowed in timed text the underlying format used by the mov_text codec
you may also encounter similar errors if you have subtitle that overlap as that s also not allowed with timed text

33706612
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
that means that even if you go this route you still don t have a guarantee that passing your new pointers to realloc does anything meaningful even if it s no longer undefined behaviour
the only possibly relevant restriction c++ adds to realloc is that c++ s malloc calloc realloc must not be implemented in terms of operator new and its free must not be implemented in terms of operator delete per c++14 c.malloc p3-4

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller

this object cannot be an instance of the uitabbarcontroller class

33709300
inline	inlining
it s generally very hard for a human to make a better decision than msvc regarding whether to inline a function or not
the compiler is the one that is doing the inlining

33709300
inline	inlining
having the inline keyword there means that warn if not inline warnings will be triggered if enabled if said functions are not inline for whatever reason
the msvc compiler issues warning c4710 when a function that is selected for inlining was not inline

33711584
google-chrome	firefox
update 24 6 17 google-chrome is dropping simd support in js and only allowing it in webassembly
update now it s possible in the latest version of google-chrome with a flag in google-chrome shortcut properties on your desktop target field will look something like this old answer you can try them out in node before they will be added to google-chrome same javascript engine install latest node from run your javascript as node --harmony-simd index.js your code in index.js print output from your script just like in google-chrome console using console.log bang or just log test 2 option 2 not google-chrome solution but you can use simd in firefox. download firefox nightly which has simd already integrated

33712694
rdf	owl
individuals do not have this restriction in either owl rdf or rdfs
so lack of a type assertion for an entity or the presence of only a rdf type owl thing assertion is a good indication that you re dealing with an individual

33713463
serializable	deserialization
once the serializable failed because of some reason the file is partly written xml file is not complete and it is invalid
in consequence xml deserialization does not work and your application may crash on start

33714634
retrofit	okhttp
that concern does not apply to retrofit 2 it uses okhttp to dispatch async calls
okhttp has been around awhile and used extensively it manages its own thread pool to execute async requests and is solid

hex	binary
y n y the before and after hex dumps disclaimer if you destroy valuable data using this code it s not my fault
here s a short demo of doing hex search replace in a binary file

33718401
shadowing	named
there is no shadowing no replacing not using the built in handler there is just a signal with 3 connections to the evaluation of three expressions
using signal.connect with a named function does come with one advantage you can later signal.disconnect namedfunction if you need to remove a built in or another handler

33719277
implements	extends
however the implementations will be checked if the interface is implements properly in classes
this line class student extends person istudentactivity does not work because you can t extends from multiple classes as the error says

33720779
comparator	comparable
as you can see below the comparator method from the comparable interface takes a generic as parameter
comparator without parameter does not exist

33721966
realloc	malloc
trying to realloc argv is undefined behavior
in general you shouldn t realloc what you haven t malloc -ed or received from a function that explicitly transfers ownership of memory to you

33722586
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup defaults to using the lxml.html parser and one can likely exploit differences between this and the browsers parsers all following the html spec to smuggle through strings that the browser will see as an element but your code will not
using beautifulsoup with html5lib would alleviate that possible attack surface as then you have a parser identical to browsers

33725894
gulp-sass	node-sass
if there is any issues with node-saas it s trying to force node-sass 3.4.1 you can try using npm install node-sass to get the latest version 3.4.2 . or when i got problems with node-saas friend on github helped me with using libsass commands where x is the version of gulp-sass in your package.json remove the old files in node_modules
i m not sure is necessary to use sudo search and replace inside package.json updating gulp-sass version to 3.4.1

33728240
google-chrome	firefox
the browser can easily handle many off screen canvases i just finished a job that had 60 full screen canvas stacked on top of each other note your gpu needs to have the ram to hold the images or it s too slow and google-chrome did not even blink
firefox and ie are just as capable

33728487
csv	tsv
tsv is not just csv with tab delimiters it s all good if in your case it works
just keep in mind trying to read a tsv using a csv parser is a bad idea as characters such as n or t may be escaped as actual sequences of and n

33730185
postgresql	mysql
but on postgresql you can use window functions
you can join to a derived table that contains the aggregate value for each grouping of b or using a subquery the question is tagged both mysql and psql so i m not sure which db you re using

33734232
vbo	normals
bufferdata fills vbo with raw data
at this point it doesn t matter how data is supposed to be interpreted when drawing the same data may be interpreted as vertex positions at one draw but as normals in another

33735197
g++	gcc
so if using gcc compile with g++ -wall -o2 and you might add -fverbose-asm -s and look inside the generated assembler code to check
some compilers and probably g++ won t bother inlining if not asked to optimize

33738280
ubuntu	linux
update commands you can try for osx and linux ubuntu being a windows user i am not very sure about the solutions but but you can give it a try
linux command line approach chromium-browser --disable-web-security osx to access local files like ajax or json you can use this flag too

33740224
dictionary	map
the forest itself even if you have a complete input space the random forest does not consist of a simple dictionary mapping of inputs to outputs
depending on the parameters of the model the mapping is typically from groups of nearby results to a single answer so that for example will all map to

33741375
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is likely running the modal dialog in the same thread as settimeout thus blocking the running of the settimeout and not allowing the value of flag to be incremented
i tried this in both firefox and in google-chrome

33743347
theano	cudnn
if not theano optimizations will not introduce cudnn ops
so theano will still work if the user did not introduce them manually

33743347
theano	cudnn
so theano will still work if the user did not introduce them manually
to get an error if theano can not use cudnn use this theano flag

33743347
theano	cudnn
to get an error if theano can not use cudnn use this theano flag
example to know your cudnn version cat usr local cuda include cudnn.h | grep cudnn_major -a 2 adding cnmem the cnmem library is a simple library to help the deep learning frameworks manage cuda memory.

33743800
move	drag
normally it works but if you move too fast the sequence makes it so that the saved parent is a sortable and not the original parent
you can fix this by saving the parent on drag start which in any case makes seems to make more sense

33746253
linefeed	delimiter
if the next character is a linefeed drop this and take the next character even when this is also a linefeed
with this simple rule you can explain things like #3 creates a file named cat dog as the space was escaped and doesn t work as delimiter anymore

33752119
profiling	benchmarking
but they aren t necessarily always going to be faster -- it is a good general rule to think that a higher-level library function that more directly expresses what you want to do is going to be faster but there are always exceptions to the rule but best discovered in hindsight with a profiling in hand since it s far better to err on the side of trust than distrust here
artificial benchmarking as for your second benchmarking it is almost certainly a result of the compiler optimizing away code that has no side effects that affect user output

33753271
bower	npm
i would recommend studio as it simplifies the installation-process a lot download from android.com unzip to arbitrary location run studio.sh in xy-location android-sdk_linux bin add sdk to path append to .bash_profile or .profile export android_home home xyx android sdk export path path android_home tools android_home platform-tools finally install the node modules sudo npm install -g gulp bower grunt-cli cordova and ionic sudo npm install -g ionic or for ionic v2 still in alpha state but cool++ sudo npm install -g ionic alpha

google-chrome	firefox
it can take 4 values 0 tilted left 90 portrait 180 and 270 on google-chrome all is good on firefox the orientation of landscape videos is wrong.
firefox and ie 10 are the only major browsers not supporting the rotation metadata

33757623
apache	nginx
there is another option that should be a little more secure and that is to add it to the apache nginx configuration file
i m using apache and have just used setenv secret_key_base my_secret then just leave the secrets.yml file set to production env secret_key_base for a production web server i m not sure it s valid to assume that a .bashrc file is run and will get your env variable set but i think this way is certain to set it

33758498
namenode	hdfs
the namenode marks datanodes without recent heartbeats as dead and does not forward any new io requests to them
any data that was registered to a dead datanode is not available to hdfs any more

33763389
serializable	deserialization
you are not handling an http request so you fire up django testing tools create a request mockup serializable your data into the request mockup call your view on the request mockup your view deserializes_data_from_request your view does_something_with_data your view serializes_result_into_response extract the serializable result from the response deserialize the result although it works it is definitely kludgy and convoluted
the only reason to do this is when building view testcases since then you actually want to test the deserialization serialization processes

33764283
aggregate-functions	sum
your specific problem may be translated in activerecord likewise you must use having here because where does not apply on on the aggregate-functions aka sum count avg etc
the sum of a specific field in your table is obtained by grouping the rows you need in your sql statement and then applying the aggregate-functions on it

33766184
serializable	deserialization
what you re doing there is json serializable which is not java serializable so writeobject and readobject methods won t be used at all unless the json encoder decoder establishes that it wil use them
if you need to customize the serializable deserialization of json using gson you may check this not a gson user so if there s anyone else who knows how this can be achieved feel free to edit this post to improve it also you re getting an empty result because there aren t fields to serialize in your test class

33769511
emacs	gedit
the standard commands become second-nature in a short while and learning them will guarantee that you aren t stuck using nano or gedit if you have to shell into someplace with an older version of emacs
you can skip the config file for now and just use the gui options - customize emacs - top-level customization group - editing - indent you might also consider checking out smart-tabs if you want tab to insert spaces instead of tab characters smart tabs tabs for indentation spaces for alignment as for changing the cut copy paste commands try cuamode should be installed by default on emacs 22.1.1 and later m-x cua-mode that will change many of your editing hotkeys around to the more standard versions

33769715
strcpy	strncpy
review man page cppreference for strcpy for what the parameters are
safer may be to use strncpy but that function is not actually meant to do what people use it for

33770775
libstdc++	libc++
this is a libstdc++ bug documented in the bug report std functions conflicts with c functions when building with c++0x support and using namespace std with a reproducing sample very similar to the op s and one of the comments says i don t think that s the problem because libstdc++ has always declared the names in the global namespace even though it wasn t valid in c++03 - we haven t changed that for c++0x all that happened is the standard was relaxed to reflect the reality of actual implementations this may eventually get fixed until then the solution provided from the bug report is as follows qualify isnan explicitly by calling either isnan or std isnan using isnan as far as i can tell works pre c++11 and in c++11
of course this is a libstdc++ specific solution it looks valid in libc++ as well but if you need to support a compiler where this does not work you will probably have to resort to using #if #else

33771392
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml.html	beautifulsoup
you can make the parsing faster by letting it use lxml.html under the hood if you re not using lxml as the underlying parser my advice is to start
beautifulsoup parses documents significantly faster using lxml than using html.parser or html5lib

swift	objective-c
i just found your post while trying to figure out the same it s not easy finding sample code and examples combining coreaudio audio unit and swift
by looking at this repository and reading several times - apples documentation about using swift with cocoa and objective-c i managed to piece something together

33781438
realloc	malloc
now datain being a pointer itself you can change the content of datain from the function but you cannot change datain itself look at the realloc from the function and expect that to get reflected back to main
so after returning your datain has just one element as it was malloc ed previously

33783566
awt	swing
this project was developed after the significant issues with the peer components like textarea to provide a 100 java gui solution that would be 100 cross platform it s not completely 100 but it s as good as you can get the other difference is that the old awt components were all thread-safe whereas swing components are not
swing components should only be modified by the ui thread

33785527
namenode	hdfs
check if hduser has rights to write the hadoop_store hdfs namenode and datanode directories with ls -ld directory you can change the rights by sudo chmod +777 hadoop_store hdfs namenode
if it is not an ssh issue do the next delete all contents from temporary directory rm -rf app hadoop tmp and format the namenode server bin hadoop namenode -format . start the namenode and datanode with bin start-dfs.sh . type jps in command line to check whether nodes are running

33786397
swift	objective-c
based on my answer over here here is a swift version
note that this was converted from objective-c to swift using an online converter as i am not at my dev machine--and don t usually work in swift with some added fiddling to get the weak self reference right

33786747
build.gradle	gradlew
what i actually found my issue causing my app to exceed method limit in my dex file ---- google play services if you do not need all the google play services library dependencies stay away from this line in your build.gradle compile com.google.android.gms play-services 8.3.0 and instead just use what you need
google has a comprehensive list of the libraries for selectively compiling here with all that said you probably only need to include this one line in gradlew for your google analytics edit also you can view the dependency tree by going to the root of your project or using terminal in android studio and running . gradlew app dependencies good luck and happy coding

33788411
setinterval	settimeout
the flickering effect you are experiencing with setinterval is normally caused when the function is invoked before the it s completed its previous call
you can mitigate this by using the self-invoking settimeout there is also a known bug in chrome that may be causing this flickering to occur - or at least would explain why it might be happening only in chrome and not the other browsers

33789185
swift	objective-c
here is why swift exception handling has nothing to do with exceptions
in fact you cannot catch nsexception which is what s being raised in the objective-c side

33789185
nsexception	nserror
in fact you cannot catch nsexception which is what s being raised in the obj-c side
swift catches nserror which is practically in swift an enum

33789185
nsexception	nserror
raising nsexception 2
returning nserror as i explained you cannot handle errors raised using the first approach

33790744
google-chrome	firefox
your google-chrome blocks some local sources for security reasons but firefox handles them pretty well
if you have a static website that does not involve with any database you can just create a directory and make html css and javascript files and open with firefox to test

33790812
google-chrome	firefox
now addressing your question the problem is that firefox and apparently ie11 have a different interpretation of the percentage height rule than google-chrome
specifically the vertical scrollbar you want is not rendering in google-chrome because you re using percentage heights in a way that doesn t conform with the traditional implementation of the spec

33790812
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is expecting to see the height property and when it doesn t it computes the height to auto
google-chrome vs firefox i haven t tested ie11 so i won t mention it here traditionally when calculating percentage heights browsers have interpreted the spec s use of the term height to mean the value of the height property

33792835
serializable	deserialization
if that s not convenient you can instead introduce a proxy array property and serializable that instead of the underlying collection for an explanation of why the property must be an array see xml deserialization of collection property with code defaults
i suspect you are actually trying to solve an xy problem where the real problem is the one described in the question deserializing list with xmlserializer causing extra items when you serializable and deserialize a collection property that has default items added in the constructor the default items get duplicated because the deserialized default items get added to the latest default items

33793186
bash	subshell
what you want won t work if you execute the script via bash script.sh # won t work or . script.sh # won t work even if script has executable bit set instead you must source it
script.sh or if you prefer source script.sh the issue is that subshell cannot alter the environment of the parent shell

33795764
super	self
all items need to be an integer. else super .append item
mylist.append 2.2 print mylist print mylist.avg or you could simplify the code by raising the error when the user tries to append a non-integer class intlist list def avg self return sum self len self def append self item if not isinstance item int raise valueerror invalid item in list

33801137
spaces	delimiter
one way to solve this is to specify for f usebackq a in dir folderpath output ad b s do note that i have moved the quotes just to prepare for the case of names with spaces which was your second problem
you might further simplify it with note that delims avoids spaces work as delimiter and 1 removes the quotes of the parameter and finally the for loop in each iteration just set s the folder variable it does not invoke the del command that is placed outside the loop

33802867
swift	objective-c
i am not 100 how swift classes that are not tagged objective-c are treated but nothing good can come of having two classes with the same name even if they re written in different languages
if the swift version is visible to the objective-c side you have a definite problem and you cannot be sure when instantiate a class which one you will get

33807677
qtableview	qtreewidget
if you did not specialize qtableview you can t simply call this function as it is protected so here s a trick to simply do it hope this will solve your problem
i had a similar problem a long time ago with a qtreewidget and i solved it by callig protected method updategeometries

33811151
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is honoring the img s percent max-width when computing the minimum intrinsic size of the flex item
firefox is not

33814869
postgresql	mysql
example or in your case sorry i know this doesn t answer the question with mysql and it might not be easy to just switch to postgresql but it s the best way we ve found to do it
even 6 years later mysql still doesn t support update .

33820084
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome best way you should open it in server like apache or xampp
this issue is not happening in firefox and safari

33820390
google-chrome	firefox
the html overflows were removed for google-chrome because otherwise this would not work in google-chrome
however the overflows are needed for firefox so they are done by setting it dynamically in the javascript set if not google-chrome

33820568
bash	subshell
first there seems to be a defect in bash s bourne shell emulation note that bin sh on os x is in fact bash it attempts to import functions exported in bash which is clearly a source of errors
to test this for instance a simple process substitution not present in bourne shell will blow it away note i didn t do anything in the bin sh subshell i only ran

33821468
udp	tcp
but udp messages are lightweight and in experienced hands they summon to life such systems as network action games and streaming video lost and reordered messages aren t crucial here and tcp becomes too slow
so i d recommend to start with tcp

33822100
octal	decimal
so you cannot use 777 as that s an octal representation of the permissions
an equivalent decimal representation is 511 7 8 2 + 7 8 1 + 7 8 0

33822815
client-side	server-side
the d3 library is a client-side one
this means that it must be used within a browser not within a server-side application

33824820
clang	llvm
i also wrote a blog where i compared gcc and llvm build size on arm cortex-m interesting results clang generated code is not much bigger than gcc on cortex-m.
i created a firmware framework - polymcu - that is based on cmake that support gcc and llvm

n-gram	words
i ve used the quanteda package to construct a document-term matrix and then filter based on n-gram containing the fruit words
added if you are looking to match the terms not separated by spaces to the document you can form n-gram with a null string concatenator and match as below

33827478
wildfly	glassfish
my own jaspic classes which function properly on glassfish 4.1 fail for the same reason on wildfly 9.0.2.final and 10.0.0.cr4 when used along with a plain servlet and an slsb even with the latter marked permitall
as i m myself unfamiliar with wildfly security internals i can not assist you in that respect

33827793
namedtuple	dictionary
the important difference between the two is that namedtuple gives you immutable objects whereas the class shown above is mutable and would require extra code to make it immutable
extra functions as khelwood mentions in a comment can for example be dealt with by combining the two the result still has read-only .rank and .suit attributes although it does now has its own dictionary for other mutable attributes so it s not really an immutable type any more

33827960
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload doesn t necessarily mean that the view is on-screen
you should be using viewwillappear or viewdidappear viewdidload only signifies that the view controller s view has been instantiated and by that point all iboutlet s have been wired up

33827960
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
you should be using viewwillappear or viewdidappear viewdidload only signifies that the view controller s view has been instantiated and by that point all iboutlet s have been wired up
you should only do additional initialization here and must not rely on when viewdidload was called or whether it was called multiple times etc you can unload your view controller s view with if it doesn t have a superview and it ll be automatically reloaded when it s needed

33828920
innodb	myisam
the same idea does not work with innodb tables although it is possible to copy them individually outside of the sql interface using special utilities e.g with xtrabackup
you can do this for myisam tables with some precautions

33829232
implements	extends
the sparsegraph class doesn t not implements the multigraph interface but only the graph interface
both classes extends the abstractgraph class

33829590
addition	multiplication
even if multiplication is not available and you are stuck with addition there are algorithms much faster than #2
typical modern cpus can do multiplication in hardware often at the same speed as addition

33831119
client-side	server-side
column clienttemplate is client-side functionality
you cannot use server-side variables in it

33834440
ssl	https
that way in future if you need to add an ssl certificate you can keep the secure part completely separate from the non-secure part
this means if you put a contact us form for instance under https it can never be accessed over http - simply won t work it doesn t exist under that docroot

33834827
mvp	presenter
i don t know how your ui looks like but to me it sounds that you should split your one big view into two subviews downloadusersview + viewstate managed by a downloaduserspresenter downloadprojectsview + viewstate managed by a downloadprojectspresenter from my point of view it is always a good idea that mvp has exactly one single model that gets displayed in the view and not two like in your scenario
usually if you have to deal with two models in the same view it is a indicator that you can split this view and presenter into two distinct

33835689
swift	objective-c
in swift it s not legal to have a function that s overloaded by whether it throws an objective-c method with a final nserror out-parameter gets converted into a throws method in swift
so if you have two objective-c methods that differ only in the addition of an error parameter it can t import using swift error syntax

33836348
swift	objective-c
so i ve ended up making that property private so that it is not exported to the bridging header and adding new method in swift class to receive abrecordref and then you can call from objective-c class
this error occurs if swift class declares some of the adressbook properties and this class is part of the mixed swift objective-c project

33836348
swift	objective-c
this error occurs if swift class declares some of the adressbook properties and this class is part of the mixed swift objective-c project
xcode then generate swift bridging header where this property becomes nonatomic strong which is applicable to objects only not structures

33836348
swift	objective-c
xcode then generate swift bridging header where this property becomes nonatomic strong which is applicable to objects only not structures
i have encountered similar issue when i needed to pass abrecordref from objective-c class to swift class xcode didn t like my abrecordref property in swift

33843568
build.gradle	gradlew
i suggest you add a repositories section to your build.gradle file and run gradlew build --refresh-dependencies from the command line
i am not familiar with libgdx project generator but speaking in general about how gradlew handles dependencies the build.gradle file usually contains a repositories section of the form when you declare dependencies in the dependencies section gradlew looks for dependencies in declared repositories in the order that they appear

33843568

i am not familiar with libgdx project generator but speaking in general about how gradlew handles dependencies the build.gradle file usually contains a repositories section of the form when you declare dependencies in the dependencies section gradlew looks for dependencies in declared repositories in the order that they appear
if needed the corrected versions of dependencies are downloaded into gradlew local cache and will show up in your ecplise buildpath as well

33844184
profiling	debugging
if you re on a mac then you can plug in and use remote debugging via safari where you ll have access to the tools including the profiling not sure the state of safari support in windows
there are numerous resources for showing how to remotely debugging a device unless it is a really old version of ios you should be fine you ll have to enable the develop menu via settings but after that its plain sailing if you know your debugging tools

33845119
margin	text-align
you ll need to create 3 elements 1 as a wrapper 1 as a left column 1 as a right column 2nd and this is important a span tag is an inline declaration not a block-line and generally is used solely in block-line declarations such as without working on the live project i couldn t give exactly the solution but here s the debugging method 1 use a block-line element above the iframe. 1a if your intending for the element to overlap the iframe the you ll need to also use the margin rule margin topvalue rightvalue bottomvalue leftvalue
2 if you need the text to also be right aligned use the text-align value

33848617
onkeyup	onkeydown
tip the order of events related to the onkeypress event onkeydown onkeypress onkeyup note the onkeypress event is not fired for all keys alt ctrl shift esc in all browsers
to detect only whether the user has pressed a key use onkeydown instead because it works for all keys

33848737
bash	subshell
when not in posix mode bash clears the -e option in such subshell
using the bash set command changes options for the current shell

33848737
bash	subshell
using the bash set command changes options for the current shell
changes to shell options are not inherited by a subshell

33849887
rsa	aes
then they will encrypt the aes key with your rsa public key and send you the aes-encrypted message and the rsa-encrypted key
block cipher modes aren t designed for use with rsa

33850729
implements	extends
however said object must be an instance of a class which implements serializable
resultset is an interface and does not extends serializable

33851939
theano	lasagne
note that you cannot use implementation from scikit-learn for example because lasagne requires the objective function to take theano tensors as arguments not lists or ndarrays
to see how an objective function is implemented in lasagne you can take a look at existing objective functions 2

33852584
daemons	systemd
your nsurlsession background tasks downloads and uploads run in an os daemons process not in the app process so they continue to run even if the app is killed by ios
according to apple s documentation if an ios app is terminated by the systemd and relaunched the app can use the same identifier to create a new configuration object and session and retrieve the status of transfers that were in progress at the time of termination

33854356
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
touchesbegan sets a bool to true to indicate that the player got touched touchesmoved always updates the players position no matter where the touch occurred as long as the bool is true touchesended sets the bool to false thanks
darvydas pointed me in the right direction and i was able to solve the problem like that the problem was not in the way i moved the player around it was this line in touchesmoved if self.player.containspoint touchlocation when the user moves really quickly the touchlocation is not inside the player because the position could not be updated that quickly

33858800
glfw	lwjgl
as it turns out slick2d is not compatible with glfw on os x
because of this i had to use the stb binding which is lwjgl 3.0 s stbimage org.lwjgl.stb.stbimage

33859802
rsa	aes
pkcs#1 encryption padding for rsa is as described at the bottom of page 52 and top of page 53 of that document which is identical in content though not format to the current openpgp spec and earlier which refers to and is effectively identical to near-current pkcs#1 spec and earlier all of which say it is one byte 00 one byte 02 enough bytes nonzero random to make the result the correct length and be secure one byte 00 the plaintext which for pgp encryption is actually the working symmetric key k formatted as specified in the pgp spec
note the paragraph beginning in case of the aes algorithm appears to be for a different option not pgp afaics described on the previous page as by option announced in extended capabilities the card supports the decryption of a plain text with an aes-key stored in a special do d5

33860612
factors	matrix
for this problem i am using a combination of different techniques arpack can compute a set of eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors unfortunately it is fast only for high frequencies and slow for low frequencies but since the eigenvectors of the inverse of a matrix are the same as the eigenvectors of a matrix one can factors the matrix using a sparse matrix factorization routine such as superlu or choldmod if the matrix is symmetric
the communication protocol with arpack only expects you to compute a matrix-vector product so if you do a linear system solve using the factored matrix instead then this makes arpack fast for the low frequencies of the spectrum do not forget then to replace the eigenvalue lambda by 1 lambda

33861532
rvm	bundler
update if you are using rvm for managing your ruby versions try doing the following to specify the ruby version 2.2.3 rvm use 2.2.3 looking at the error message c ruby22-x64 lib ruby site_ruby 2.2.0 rubygems core_ext kernel_require.rb 128 in require cannot load such file -- bundler loaderror it s using ruby 2.2.0 but not 2.2.3
require cannot load such file -- bundler loaderror this error just means the bundler gem is missing for your current ruby version

33862536
sml	scheme
i don t think that it is sml per se so much as sml nj default repl output
in the grand scheme of things the repl is for development debugging -- not the environment for the finished program to run it

33862670
google-chrome	firefox
once again your statement is true for google-chrome and ie11 but not for firefox
solutions let s start with the fixes so that all demos work in google-chrome firefox and ie11

33862670
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
solutions let s start with the fixes so that all demos work in google-chrome firefox and ie11
i didn t test in safari but that s webkit like google-chrome so it should be fine with vendor prefixes for any versions prior to 9 . also i ll use compiled code in the answer as not everybody uses preprocessors

33862938
namenode	hdfs
so i made two directories for namenode and datanode respectively if you have not done so
you don t have to put where i put it please replace it based on your hadoop directory. mkdir -p home hadoopuser hadoop-2.6.2 hdfs namenode mkdir -p home hadoopuser hadoop-2.6.2 hdfs datanode i reconfigured my hdfs-site.xml

33867244
swift	objective-c
forcing of course these last workarounds are totally against why swift appeared in this world but this is how you bring the old objective-c habits in the new modern swift
actually the problem with jsonmodel in swift is as follows it uses objc-runtime for understanding what type is each property and as soon as you declare a type which objective-c runtime does not know how to map then jsonmodel can only map it as a string .........or nsnumber if you know that you have a numeric field

33867734
config	ini
neither wikipedia nor microsoft s page about ini configutariont files mention anything about referring to other properties or other config files
however since it is not a formal standard each config parser can have its own variant

33869801
backtracking	greedy
from a computing standpoint this process of matching one item advancing failing backtracking expanding is expensive
since the next is not far the number of backtrack steps is much fewer than with greedy matching

33871545
postgresql	greenplum
if you see only postgresql make sure greenplum is started with running gpstate on the gpdb master host and make sure you re connecting to the right host and port
here you re just connected to postgres not greenplum this is why you are getting this error

33873126
mongodb	bson
i believe that numberlong in your second code snippet is a type that is specific to mongodb
cloudant and couchdb store documents as json not bson like mongodb

33873885
tensorflow	cudnn
your 9600gt does not satisfy these requirements in order to build or run tensorflow with gpu support both cuda toolkit 7.0 and cudnn 6.5 v2 from nvidia need to be installed
tensorflow gpu support requires having a gpu card with nvidia compute capability 3.5

33876140
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew
macports and fink are package managers for os x like homebrew
as the message says homebrew doesn t work well with these two so you should either stay with macports or fink or uninstall them and use homebrew

33881966
super	self
you should be using super subclass self .__init__ or in python3 super .__init__ the way you have it written you are starting the mro just after the parent class not just after your own class
you are using the super function wrong

33883450
hex	binary
x 4d7953514c is not a hex string
it is a binary string which corresponds to the db2 data type varchar whatever_length for bit data or may be char whatever_length for bit data

33883739
hive	hdfs
using the parquet file format with impala hive pig hbase and mapreduce
you won t be able open the file using a hdfs dfs -text because its not a text file

33884008
spaces	delimiter
so use x with spaces around it as the delimiter
the delimiter argument to explode doesn t have to be a single character it can be any string

33889049
swift	objective-c
as a workaround you could define the function like below and check for protocol conformance inside the function implementations likewise objective-c type will be exported to swift as uiviewcontroller
functions with generic type constraints cannot be exported to objective-c

33891619
kerberos	ntlm
in kerberos you authenticate not with pair username password but by attaching kerberos token which you can grab from credentialscache
see the second line will give you ntlm or kerberos credentials

33894729
sudo	passwd
like your script.js via nodejs using sudo and then read stdout and stderr wait for passwd request then provide it by writing to stdin for that process
don t forget in doing this the user www-data has to have a passwd and be in the sudoers list per the ops comment due to the way sudo works the path does not appear to contain the path to the node executables npm node so your best of building a .sh bash script and using sudo to run that

33894729
sudo	passwd
don t forget in doing this the user www-data has to have a passwd and be in the sudoers list per the ops comment due to the way sudo works the path does not appear to contain the path to the node executables npm node so your best of building a .sh bash script and using sudo to run that
you still need to monitor this process as it will still ask for a passwd #

33896298
spaces	delimiter
note in particular that sscanf retrieves strings by spaces is not exactly correct
sscanf interprets whitespace including more than just the spaces character as a field delimiter for the s field descriptor but you can also scan a string via the field descriptor as you already are doing and that scans whichever characters you tell it to scan

33897105
domcontentloaded	onload
the dropzone library doesn t try to attach to the elements until the domcontentloaded event is fired this is kind of the same that the onload attribute for your body tag but not quite i am not completely sure but i think the onload waits for a few more things before trigger
so what i believe its happening is that first the domcontentloaded is triggered and dropzone auto attaches to the .dropzone elements

33899386
mp4	webm
example from html5 rocks if the browser cannot play webm it will fall back to mp4
mp4 is a container format so it s also important what codecs you put inside it

33900027
pthreads	fork
according to pthreads however for the parent s subsequent use of its stream to have specified behavior it shall perform an lseek or fseek as appropriate to the type of handle to an appropriate location. in other words the parent process cannot rely on the child processes manipulation of the file offset to automatically be visible to it and in fact cannot rely on any particular offset at all after the children manipulate their copies of the stream
since you bring up fork i presume you are working with a posix-compliant system

33903466
tvos	ios
it indicates that the body executes on the minimum deployment target on other platforms like watchos or tvos
currently known platforms are listed under declaration attributes in attributes in the swift documentation ios iosapplicationextension osx osxapplicationextension watchos watchosapplicationextension tvos tvosapplicationextension the last argument is required to handle all platforms not explicitly listed and for future platforms

33906205
allocator	stl
but this should get you started with respect to proper usage of placement new in a data structure against some memory allocator malloc free in this exemplary case
last but not least couldn t use stl for memory reasons .

33907264
vim	emacs
i know this response is not straight to the point however like a vim user i found that spacemacs is the most functional emacs starter pack to move from vim to emacs
you can configure it to be vim like emacs like or hybrid

33908186
hive	hdfs
as an alternative i wouldn t recommend it but if you really wanted you could use a character other than n by configuring the property textinputformat.record.delimiter when reading the file through hadoop hive using a character that won t be in json for instance 001 or ctrl-a is commonly used by hive as a field delimiter but that can be tricky since it has to also be supported by the serde
also if you change the record delimiter anybody who copies uses the file on hdfs must be aware of the delimiter or they won t be able to parse it correctly and will need special code to do it while keeping n as a delimiter the files will still be normal text files and can be used by other tools

33912877
mongodb	bson
mongodb admin ui if you want something like phpmyadmin for mongodb you could use mongo-express if you want a complete list you could take a look at mongodb admin uis
mongodb doesn t have the concept of table instead it stores objects in a format called bson it s json and you can t rappresent easily an object in a table

33914951
swift	objective-c
it is not possible to subclass a struct in swift only classes can be subclassed
an extension is not a subclass it s just adding additional functionality on to the existing struct this is comparable to a category in objective-c

33917875
noexcept	throw
they all use the pattern of constructing a temporary inside noexcept whereas they should be using placement new this explicitly says what is only really alluded to in the lwg issue which eventually says is_nothrow_constructible is defined in terms of is_constructible which is defined by looking at a hypothetical variable and asking whether the variable definition is known not to throw exceptions
the issue claims that this also examines the type s destructor given the context and thus will return false if the destructor can potentially throw

33918965
activemq	rabbitmq
it is not like activemq - it can t run embedded in a java application
java.net.connectexception connection refused connect that simply means that rabbitmq is not running on localhost 127.0.0.1 on the standard port 5672

33920115
csv	tsv
so why not use the csv module then your file content look like this c 0.99813803 -0.00263872 -0.00464602 h 2.0944175 -0.00242373 0.00417336 h 0.63238996 1.03082951 0.00417296 h 0.62561232 -0.52974905 0.88151021 h 0.64010219 -0.50924801 -0.90858051
it seems like you are trying to write a tsv or csv file where delimiter is tab or space

33920137
mef	prism
i m not sure if much is changed since the release of windows 10 uwp and if things play well together now but it s certainly possible to use mef together with uwp
prism does currently not support mef for uwp

33920137
mef	prism
prism does currently not support mef for uwp
feel free to log an issue on prism s github to request support and the team will look into the feasability

jar	manifest.mf
to start with there is only one directory which contains three files helloworld.scala manifest.mf scala-library.jar helloworld.scala manifest.mf main-class helloworld class-path scala-library.jar first compile helloworld.scala scalac helloworld.scala then create the jar progra 1 java jdk18 1.0_4 bin jar -cfm helloworld.jar manifest.mf . now you can run it with java -jar helloworld.jar i found this simple solution because the original one did not work
later i found out that not because it is wrong but because of a trivial error if i don t close the second line in manifest.mf with a newline then this line will be ignored

google-chrome	firefox
certain websites cannot be accessed by google-chrome and ie on winxp due to incompatibility
however firefox apparently still does support windows xp and can access those websites freely

33922955
sudo	passwd
when you don t specify the user to emulate such as when running sudo pip install flask you are attempting to run the command as the system administrator known as root in many environments
you ll be asked for the administrator passwd which can be your own if you ve given your user admin privileges then the specified command runs as that user meaning that it has read write access to essentially every file and directory on the system there are some exceptions but they re mostly corner cases and not very important here

33925345
google-chrome	firefox
mdn filter though as usual it does say filter is not supported on google-chrome it has been from some time on the beta version
for ie i do not know and for firefox it has been supported for some time

33925514
dictionary	map
for example if you wanted to sort by the dictionary key then you could do something like this in swift this will give you an array of tuples which may not be the most use to you
if you wanted to order by key and then just store the data associated with it you could append the map function like so after sorting remember you refresh your table view

33928053
profiling	debugging
it slows the composer run down by 3x or 4x even when the profiling feature is not enabled
in other words xdebug is invaluable for debugging but increases the memory used and processing time of composer

33929758
dictionary	map
here s another working example note these solutions do not work in python 3 as the map function doesn t return a list and neither does the .keys method of dictionary
if you have a dictionary you can quickly check and find the first value which is different from the next two values cycling around the keys of your dictionary

33934349
dictionary	map
i don t know if this will speed up your code but the pythonic way of counting loops is like this for i p in enumerate points also - i m not sure i understand the logic of searching through the whole dictionary map keys every time
this bit of code doesn t look like its doing something useful this adds a key value pair of key q value q to the dictionary

33935872
ubuntu	linux
you can try and launch a full-fledge ubuntu vm and in it follows the regular docker installation for ubuntu
yes but not with docker-machine directly which relies on a tinycore-based linux distribution of 30 mo only

33936088
swift	objective-c
the latter is based on the former and a shallow wrapper around the objective-c apis adopting types and protocols from the swift standard library and exposing more convenient apis
the reason for that architecture instead of a pure swift binding is that swift doesn t allow to interface c++ code but realm s underlying storage engine is based on that. this means that even with realm swift you have foundation as transitive dependency as we rely on it for rlmobject with key-value coding inter-operate with kvo use foundation s value types nsnumber nsarray

so assuming that there won t be a linux-compatible foundation distribution shipping with the linux version of swift using realm on linux would require a pure swift binding of realm which isn t possible yet an alternative objective-c binding which avoids foundation or a mature alternative implementation of foundation where gnustep might be a candidate but this is entirely untested from our side

update #1 swift was open-sourced together with a swift implementation stub of foundation s apis as a shim over os apis so that it can be portably used on linux and other platforms where apple s foundation is not available

33936088
swift	objective-c
this stub was filled since then with actual implementations by contributors to the project and is part of the swift 3 release so it can be used for pure swift projects
however this doesn t solve the general issue here that realm swift is not pure swift and is based on realm objective-c

33936088
swift	objective-c
however this doesn t solve the general issue here that realm swift is not pure swift and is based on realm objective-c
so it relies on the availability of the objective-c runtime and foundation

33936382
factors	matrix
so i tried what happened if i forced the model matrix to 0 for the factors f1l3 that was not in the test data
note1 i created a target variable in the testdata because i couldn t get your code to run otherwise now generalize to allow for creation of a complete model matrix when factors are missing in testdata

33938746
decimal	ieee
from the c99 spec the strtod documentation refers to section 6.4.4.2 for decimal floating constants and also for hexadecimal floating constants when flt_radix is not a power of 2 the result is either the nearest representable value or the larger or smaller representable value immediately adjacent to the nearest representable value chosen in an implementation-defined manner
only if your c compiler supports annex f iec 60559 floating-point arithmetic strtod is guaranteed to conform to ieee 754 iec 60559 and ieee 754 are equivalent the translation time conversion of floating constants and the strtod strtof strtold fprintf fscanf and related library functions in stdlib.h stdio.h and wchar.h provide iec 60559 binary-decimal conversions

33942640
webclient	httpwebrequest
had to switch from webclient to httpwebrequest i could then set the contenttype to application json which was needed
i could not change the header content-type using webclient

33943866
onclick	onfocus
and therefore your onclick event is never run
the way to solve this with onfocus and onblur is to rearrange your html setup make sure your main menu item can have focus is already ok make sure your submenu can not have focus is ok make sure you submenu is inside your main menu component you would need to change this that way your main menu item does not lose focus if you click one of the sub-items

33943872
quicksort	heapsort
however heapsort is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort
heapsort is also not a stable sorting algorithm

33948152
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and firefox on os x did not allow interactivity with parent window when a print modal was opened from a child window closing the print dialog but not the pop-up re-enabled interactivity
ie8 on win xp ie11 google-chrome and firefox all on win7 always allowed interactivity with this same scenario

33951805
rar	zip
console version rar does not support zip format as it can be read in text file programfiles winrar rar.txt which is the manual for console version
only gui version winrar supports creating and extracting zip archives

33952976
jar	manifest.mf
if this is just one html which does not reference other resources in the plugin you can get a file type url using filelocator.tofileurl may extract the file from the jar and put it in a temporary location
if the html references other resources you may need to use eclipse-bundleshape dir in the plugin manifest.mf

33953871
build.gradle	gradlew
add this in your projecct build.gradle module app once you are done with you will get generate butterknife injections option on right click of layout
i also faced the same .so if am correct you have not added butter knife dependencies in your gradlew file

33965054
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not implement this yet
firefox has an implementation of the identity provider part of the spec which seems to be enabled by default

33965544
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout repeatedly setting another timeout from each callback though this is generally what setinterval is designed for
settimeout in node.js does not follow the minimum time interval that browsers do so settimeout fn 1 will be called pretty quickly though not as quickly as setimmediate or process.nexttick due to implementation differences

33967335
trie	dawg
a trie or radix trie could be a good choice
since you need to fetch associated data a dawg is probably not a good choice

33967495
noexcept	throw
it becomes easy to apply noexcept here because the function can t throw
can t possibly throw correctly another example of where noexcept doesn t require too much thought is in the case of a function that should be considered broken if it throw

33967563
noexcept	throw
noexcept was never intended to mean that nothing can go wrong
noexcept simply means that function does not throw c++ exceptions

33969224
queue	fifo
source eip message queue the basic idea of a message queue is a simple one two or more processes can exchange information via access to a common system message queue
the sending process places via some os message-passing module a message onto a queue which can be read by another process source dave marshall image source difference message queue contains fifo fifo rule whereas in message bus does not

33969548
bower	npm
cd to_root_project_path npm install install bower packages bower install finally run grunt tast
i think that you was not run npm install to install all packages for your project before running grunt

33973045
postgresql	mysql
postgresql does have extensive support for array columns but not all databases do mysql for instance does not
it is a postgresql specific feature and that tells you that this is not the common way to manage relationships in an rdbms

33974908
implements	extends
hibernates stores all properties that declare a type that implements serializable
but the type of your days property is a set which does not extends serializable

33978156
swift	objective-c
any exception handling behavior must be implemented in objective-c code used by swift
consider this class you can then catch those errors like so note this catching of errors should not be confused with exception handling which we used to be able to do in objective-c

33979203
swift	objective-c
this pure swift code compiles just fine note that i ve eliminated nsmanagedobject from the story as it has nothing to do with the issue that s because swift knows what a protocol extension is
but objective-c doesn t

33980104
swift	objective-c
i realize your question is tagged objective-c but i developed my answer in a swift playground for convenience
it shouldn t be hard to translate this to objective-c

33981464
calloc	malloc
usually there is a header like code from you may see that the block actually the buffer of data that you ll get when calling malloc calloc is surrounded by a lot of extra data ok here is special case for debug thus there are probably extra magics
well even if the memory allocated between calls to calloc was continuous for you program which you cannot make sure don t forget that the lib c has private data stored in the hunk of memory you allocated

33981751
super	implements
that the presence of eventhandler in the super means it has called it from its constructor you could do something like this ...but again the nature of the super sub relationship is that it s very tightly-bound so relying on your knowledge of whether the super does this or not is reasonable
since you know the parent constructor calls this.eventhandler don t do so in the derived classes re your comment the parent classes don t always implements an eventhandler method

33985767
prepare	execute
however any adhoc queries not stored procedure calls that they execute show up in sys.dm_exec_cached_plans with a cacheobjtype of compiled plan and an objtype of prepare
any of these adhoc queries if parameterized should be storing the initial input parameter values with the prepare plan and would hence be subject to parameter-sniffing issues

33986686
shadowing	named
you are shadowing the oh variable
inside the gen2 method convert this to this the reason it did not work is because you declared a new arraylist named oh whose scope was just inside the gen2 method

33988899
comparator	comparable
the first way comparator - you run the sort method with your comparator and the sort method will use it in order to compare the objects
since it uses the comparator it does not need you to implement compareto and comparable the second way comperable - you run the sort method without any comperator

33990070
decoder	encoder
many popular devices decoder data into a proprietary yuv format which is why the checkframe function in the buffer-to-buffer test can t always verify the results
you d expect the mediacodec encoder to be able to accept the frames output by the decoder but that s not guaranteed

33994171
oncreate	findviewbyid
using the new operator the activity does not go trough its lifecycle oncreate is not called and you are not creating a view hierarchy
more important a valid context is not attached to your activity making findviewbyid unusable this line locationmanager.requestlocationupdates locationmanager.gps_provider 0 0 locationlistener
