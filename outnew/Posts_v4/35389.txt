octal	binary
python int literals starting with 0 are considered octal but 8 isn t a valid octal digit
you most likely don t want octal binary or the other things a base of 0 will do

22004017
clang	llvm
i know very little about clang llvm internals so i m not sure how much effort this would require
i found no documentation about this so i dug around the clang source code

22006443
daemons	systemd
you d need to restart the asl daemons syslogd aslmanager or reboot the computer and you d probably need to keep an eye on the space used because the reason that debug and info messages are not stored is that they are apt to be very voluminous
using man syslog man asl asl apple systemd log and man aslmanager you ll find that there s a configuration file etc asl.conf and the default version contains the lines this messages at debug and info are therefore not stored by asl which in turn means they can t be printed by syslog after the fact

22006478
serializable	deserialization
you should have your treemodel implement serializable and you can then use simple java to convert to xml and read it back fairly simply and read it in op requested an xstream example therefore to serializable these deserialization is trivial good luck and if you should have further problems do leave a comment
do note that you don t necessarily need to implement serializable to use xstream -- it doesn t care

22009351
ssl	https
this message is displayed when there is a connection failure or the server ssl certificate is not trusted
connection between the android agent app and the emm server is through https and if you are using a self signed certificate then you need to put it in the agent project in eclipse and export the android app. please refer the android client configuration to create the bks and add it to your android project

22009981
tiff	png
you can convert your tiff to png without loss
try if this doesn t work you can first convert it to png as opencv can read and even write 16bit png files correctly

22015001
client-side	server-side
it won t make sense to do it client-side since there isn t really anything stopping an attacker from modifying disabling your js
so only secure option is server-side

22018205
ocaml	prolog
it s not at all clear how to code this in ocaml
a difference list is a prolog data structure

22024943
innodb	myisam
right now accessing innodb directly with web services is vulnerable to these kinds of disconnects and there s nothing you can do within fatcow other than ask them to restart the service for you
your idea to use myisam and low priority is okay and will probably not have this problem but if you want to go with innodb would recommend an approach like the following

22029071
elasticsearch	kibana
suppose i put the following in config.js elasticsearch i then load kibana s dashboard which comes up blank
i go to check my browser s javascript console and find two errors uncaught syntaxerror unexpected number in config.js uncaught referenceerror config is not defined in app.js in a nutshell kibana fails to render because you gave it a config file that won t compile

22029071
elasticsearch	kibana
but then throws up a red error message could not contact elasticsearch at please ensure that elasticsearch is reachable from your system. reason being kibana is resolving the ip address on the client machine not the server
since my workstation isn t an elasticsearch node my browser cannot find an es cluster at 127.0.0.1 9200

22029071
elasticsearch	kibana
since my workstation isn t an elasticsearch node my browser cannot find an es cluster at 127.0.0.1 9200
kibana doesn t know about logstash and doesn t care just as long as the rendered page can connect to an es cluster at the address given

22029365
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uinavigationcontrollerdelegate is the one responsible for fixing the layout guide before the transition finally the uiviewcontroller uses hp_toplayoutguide instead of toplayoutguide in the constraints and indicates this by overriding hp_usestoplayoutguideinconstraints hope it helps
as rob mentioned toplayoutguide is not reliable when using custom transitions in uinavigationcontroller

22030839
quicksort	heapsort
heapsort is different from bubble sort and quicksort the best and worst cases wouldn t happen when the input elements are ordered in a descending ascending manner
the first step of heapsort is building a heap max-heap in general which can be done in linear time o n by using the sift down version of heapify no matter what order the initial elements are

22031744
google-chrome	firefox
what this means is that for the first time when a page is cached for google-chrome it doesn t destroys the cached version of firefox or any other browsers if they exists
so when users make requests from google-chrome a separate cached copy is created for google-chrome browser only if it doesn t exists already and the cached version for firefox will still be there

22031744
google-chrome	firefox
so when users make requests from google-chrome a separate cached copy is created for google-chrome browser only if it doesn t exists already and the cached version for firefox will still be there
at any next moment requests come from firefox the cached version of firefox browser is sent as response

22032011
inline	constexpr
entities marked as constexpr are implicitly inline which is also true for functions defined directly within a class as stated in
functions having the inline specifier implicitly or not must follow the rules applied to such

22032274
sudo	passwd
consider modifying your sudoers file so that those specific commands are allowed to run through sudo without such a passwd prompt
the simplest but perhaps not the best way would be to use which means all commands are allowed to be run through sudo without passwd prompt

22032274
sudo	passwd
the simplest but perhaps not the best way would be to use which means all commands are allowed to be run through sudo without passwd prompt
a better approach would be to figure out which specific commands require sudo permissions and then add them to the sudoers file

22033588
rtp	rtcp
the amount of video data being sent from the presenter doesn t change regardless of how many people are viewing the presentation so from an rtp point of view it doesn t matter how many people are viewing it. on the other hand if every viewer computer sends rctp statistics back to the sender the sender now has to deal with 1000 reports
now the rtcp traffic can make up a significant amount of the bandwidth being used at the sender s machine

22034711
queue	fifo
upd i m sorry it was too early in the morning so i couldn t think clear. for fifo as avsej said you ll need two counters queue head and queue tail
so for fifo note code can look slightly different depending on start values of queue tail and queue head will it be zero or one or something else

22038927
javassist	cglib
however you might want to consider creating your classes using javassist which has a more modern api and supports the writing of annotations
this is not possible using cglib out of the box

22044365
ssl	https
if you have valid ssl certificate and encryption key then you only your data is accepted via ssl
simply redirecting your website to use https protocol doesn t encrypt your data flow

22045829
aggregate-functions	sum
if you have two columns id and name that are not in aggregate-functions you must list both of them in your group by clause
in most dbms implementations group by must include every column that does not appear in an aggregate function avg sum count etc.

22046731
thunk	trampolines
defun fn x when x princ x return thunk fn cdr x rest
when you need a tail call optimization like structure in a language that doesn t necessarily provide it but does provide closures you can use a trampolines to achieve constant stack space with a trade off for heap space for closure objects of course

22046731
thunk	trampolines
if it returns a thunk then since it returned the initial stack frame is reclaimed and then the closure of returned thunk is invoked
for instance here s what an implementation of non-variadic mapcar might look like when the list is empty we get an empty list immediately when it s not we get back a thunk this means that we should wrap a call with trampolines and this works fine for the base case too since trampolines passes non-thunk values through your example code isn t quite enough to be an illustrative example but defun fn x when x princ x jump fn cdr x rest would become the following

22046731
thunk	trampolines
for instance here s what an implementation of non-variadic mapcar might look like when the list is empty we get an empty list immediately when it s not we get back a thunk this means that we should wrap a call with trampolines and this works fine for the base case too since trampolines passes non-thunk values through your example code isn t quite enough to be an illustrative example but defun fn x when x princ x jump fn cdr x rest would become the following
the return provides the early termination from fn and the thunk value that s returned provides the next computation that the trampolines would invoke for you

22049521
prepare	execute
from the documentation execute the prepare statement
if the prepare statement included parameter markers you must either snip pass an array of input-only parameter values with you d be passing a multi-dimensional array that looks like this this is certainly not what it expects

22049636
serializable	deserialization
the second thing is that you ll need a serializable library of some kind and that will require that you add some code for each struct class to perform the serializable deserialization not necessarily intrusively meaning that you might not have to change the classes just add some code on the side
you can look at boost.serialization that s the basic template for how to create a serializable library in c++

22050081
shadowing	named
technically it is a declaration as well as a definition. at the moment you have an int gi line inside of your main function but this is just a shadowing definition
it is a local variable whose named happens to be the same as the declared global gi but it is not the global gi

22050941
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
now that said - google tells me as you mentioned that default windows handling of usernames is case-aware but not case-sensitive meaning that it will store the case as specified when a user is created but doesn t care about it when checking credentials
active directory also appears to be case-insensitive

22051485
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not automatically recognize custom protocol handlers
firefox will recognize when you are trying to use a protocol handler and offer to create a protocol handler definition for you

22053405
accelerometer	gyroscope
however if you are trying to determine device tilt attitude you want to use the gyroscope not the accelerometer
the accelerometer tells how fast the device is moving in each direction

22053632
sudo	passwd
instead run sudo visudo and add the line then your current alias will stop asking for a passwd and just allow the reboot
no you can not put the passwd in the alias

22055683
postgresql	greenplum
update you re not using postgresql at all
you are using greenplum database

22055683
postgresql	mysql
it is not postgresql
it s a bit like saying i m using mysql when you re using drizzle or percona but even more different

22055683
postgresql	greenplum
if you use greenplum say so don t just refer to it as postgresql
my advice to upgrade makes no sense if you re using greenplum database since you re not actually using postgresql 8.2.15 like you said you re using some greenplum database version that claims to be pg 8.2.15 at the protocol level something i find intensely frustrating

22055683
postgresql	greenplum
my advice to upgrade makes no sense if you re using greenplum database since you re not actually using postgresql 8.2.15 like you said you re using some greenplum database versioning that claims to be postgresql 8.2.15 at the protocol level something i find intensely frustrating
i m running postgresql 8.2.15 use a postgresql versioning that is not quite so pre-historic

22059800
addition	multiplication
m_expr can expand to a u_expr because unaries bind tighter than multiplication operations and a_expr can expand to a m_expr because multiplication operations bind tighter than addition operations
these statements are not attempting to imply that you should consider the statement to actually be an addition operation though it can be considered a term in a one-term addition in the grammatical sense

22061755
ssl	https
check android s doc about ssl it has quite extensive explanation
i m not an expert but i confirm you that with latest phonegap version sites you access using https still need to be signed from a trusted authority

22062865
debian	linux
however if you run netbsd and debian on two x86 machines the scripts may behave completely differently if great care is not taken to only use portable features
portability matters even if both the x86 and the arm systems run linux since you may find that the x86 distro uses full gnu tools while the arm system uses smaller and less feature rich busybox

22064441
gruntjs	package.json
the error suggests that your gruntfile.js might be referencing gruntjs modules that are not yet installed in this project
if these dependencies are defined in package.json you should only need to npm install if they are not defined in package.json you may need to manually install these modules and save them to your development dependencies

22076320
shadowing	named
shadowing warnings are targeted at situations when 1 the named hiding occurs one named is hidden by another named declared later or in a more local scope 2 the code is still well-formed
in case of your free if the declaration is made in global namespace then you have overloading not shadowing

22076785
erlang	elixir
i don t think learning erlang would be directly useful for learning elixir
learning what an atom looks like in erlang isn t going to affect how you learn about atoms in elixir for example

22076785
erlang	elixir
learning what an atom looks like in erlang isn t going to affect how you learn about atoms in elixir for example
however there s a lot more to erlang than just erlang the language

22078359
division	modulo
remainder is defined as the left over of a division euclidean arithmetic
when the dividend is not an integer the quotient is usually also not an integer there is no remainder but if the quotient is forced to be an integer and that s what happens when someone tries to get the remainder or modulo of a floating-point number there will be a non-integer left over obviously

22081449
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
here is the text from javadoc link note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

22082214
clang	llvm
enthought support here the latest version of xcode version 5 that was released with os x 10.9 mavericks has removed support for gcc such that gcc is no longer actually the gnu compiler collection but is symlinked to the clang compiler
users still hoping to access a c compiler for their projects such as in building c-extensions using cython should generally not run into any problems in using the symlinked gcc or directly using clang as clang uses the same llvm backend and libraries as apple s previous gcc compiler

22082757
profiling	debugging
when you run the profiling the debugger will not be attached
having the debugger attached prevents a lot of optimizations from happening when you run your program this mainly is because you would loose information that you may want to know during the debugging process

22083541
google-chrome	firefox
your example works in firefox but not in google-chrome
this is because google-chrome does not support certain events on certain elements

22083905
coffeescript	livescript
update coffeescript doesn t support function hoisting so you ve only really got two options here
try to untangle your code so that you can write it out in fashion that doesn t require using functions that haven t yet been defined or as i prefer to do use livescript

22087941
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
currently it works in google-chrome 33 which i am using and i have also succesfully tested it in firefox 27 internet explorer 11 and opera 19
safari 5.1 windows does not like it but it should work on the newer mac versions

22089169
textview	imageview
when you want to change the color behind the textview then change the imageview background as below.
if you want to do this using only one textview then its may be not possible

22089820
memcached	apc
when apc u or wincache actually copy arrays and scalars in and out of shared memory they do so bitwise byte by byte they do not serialize or otherwise have to change the format of the data this coupled with the fact there is 0 network overhead make local caching solutions like apc u much faster than anything like memcached or redis
apc u does not have any limitations on the size of segments or entries you should be able to configure it to consume all the memory your operating system will allow you to map

22090870
mtu	icmp
no not at all for the following reasons mtu is just the maximal packet size that can be transmitted without fragmentation
icmp packets should actually be smaller

22091894
google-chrome	firefox
also it s extremely unlikely that vendors will include support for the drm of their competition google-chrome has support for google s widevine ie11 had support for microsoft s playready
i would be very surprised if firefox would choose to support any of these. browser plug-ins however do not offer a valid option they do not exist on mobile devices

22099482
jar	war
my multi-module project had been structured as follows + project root pom.xml only lists modules + parent-pom pom.xml pom.xml lists all the project-level dependency versions plugin versions etc + entities pom.xml jar contains all the project s entities + webapp pom.xml war contains the bo and webapp design although this was fine for maven it was no good for roo
in order to get roo to see this as a multi-module project working i had to restructure it as follows + project root pom.xml lists all the project-level dependency versions plugin versions etc + modules + entities pom.xml jar contains all the project s entities + webapp pom.xml war contains the bo and webapp design not the biggest issue but i would have rather had the parent-pom as its own artifact disassociated from the modules

22100819
puma	unicorn
you may also want to lobby the puma developers to add a hook similar to before_fork in unicorn
if you haven t set up puma to fork and preload the app -w and --preload flags you shouldn t need to do anything

22102676
s-function	simulink
to use a c-mex s-function with simulink coder you do not need to write a tlc file unless you want to in-line the code
depends on what language you are going to write the s-function in

22105324
jtextfield	jlabel
create a jtextfield and decorate it accordingly opacity border non-editable etc. so that it looks like a jlabel
just put your messages in a jtextarea since jlabel aren t really well-suited for dynamic arbitrary text

22105995
cdr	cons
in any case the pointer address in the car and cdr is just copied onto a new cons in copy-tree as long as it s not itself a cons cell
copy-list is the same except it only does fresh cons for cdr and not for additional structure in car

22107375
bash	zsh
note in bash to also only require pressing tab once to list multiple matches add the following to your shell profile bind set show-all-if-ambiguous on
zsh solution bash solution note complete -o dirnames doesn t take an argument unfortunately - it always auto-completes for the current directory

22107857
comparator	comparable
here s the statement at treemap.java 1188 so if comparator is null then it will try to cast the set member to a comparable
if your class doesn t implement comparable this will cause the classcastexception you saw

22109932
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient doesn t exist though really it s really not all that important to have
you can get by with a httpwebrequest for most any of what you ll be doing

22111409
voip	sip
you can then use the wiresharks voip call graph analysis option which will display the dtmf events in the rtp
there are three main methods for sending dtmf with sip in-band rtp payloads generated dtmf tones sip info messages outdated and most likely not used most likely it s using the in-band rtp payload packets

22113338
super	extends
doesnt super have to have anything inside super need not have anything
i guess you are extends baseadapter

22113993
allocator	stl
even if the standard allocator does not use the size of the memory block that is to be freed other allocator might
therefore the argument has to be there such that all stl code that uses allocator can use different allocator in the same way

22113993
allocator	stl
therefore the argument has to be there such that all stl code that uses allocator can use different allocator in the same way
the standard allocator does not need the size argument because it remembers the size of each allocated block

22115748
jar	manifest.mf
in eclipse you can set that in run configurations see how to setup main class in run configurations in eclipse if your project uses maven you can configure that with the maven shade plugin if you are using ant you can use the option from the jar task
you have to include a main-class property in the meta-inf manifest.mf file like this main-class full.packagename.classname this will allow you to run the program with java -jar myprog.jar in any platform that supports java not only windows

22116406
tostring	string.format
of course you have little control over the actual format of the string if you are not implementing tostring .
using string.format with only the s format specifier is effectively typesafe type opaque might be a better term since every object will implement a tostring method and even null objects are handled

22120456
google-chrome	firefox
works on google-chrome + safari well on my end os x
for firefox the dropdown arrow is not displaying due to the removal of the left float

22120933
libstdc++	libc++
libcryptopp.a randpool.o this library has been built and depends on llvm s c++ runtime libc++ and not gnu s c++ runtime libstdc++
they both were compiled using -stdlib libstdc++ you need to either rebuild libcryptopp.a against libstdc++ or link with and build the rest of your code against libc++ as well

22121387
division	modulo
i am not really aware of the topic but here is a link to a repository implementing the ecc github edit the actual problem is the division modulo p
you can t just divide using integer arithmetics 15 4 3 but need to multiply by the inverse of 4 modulo 17 instead. the inverse of 4 modulo 17 is 13 because 4 13 17 1

22123743
comparator	comparable
in a comparator method the problem gets worse because dates do not sort correctly when you sort them alphabetically. java.util.date also implements comparable so you can replace that comparison in the method with in addition if any of the fields could be null you need to check for that as well
if you put your objects in a treeset you need to either provide an implementation of the comparator interface in the constructor or you need your objects to be of a class that implements comparable

22123743
equals	compareto
the javadoc of treeset says note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
the easiest way to achieve that is to let your equals method call the compareto method and check if the result is 0

22123743
equals	compareto
note i based this compareto method on your equals method. you were comparing the date-or-birth by first calling tostring
that s not a very good way of doing that - you can use the equals method in java.util.date directly

22125247
innodb	myisam
try to set innodb as a default engine using or create a table using explicitely innodb like this
i think that the default storage is set to myisam not innodb and the table is created as myisam not innodb

22125247
innodb	myisam
i think that the default storage is set to myisam not innodb and the table is created as myisam not innodb
foreign keys are only supported by innodb tables

22125247
innodb	myisam
foreign keys are only supported by innodb tables
for myisam tables foreign key constraints are not supported and while creating the table with create table command a foreign key specification is parsed but it is ignored

22125694
onresume	onpause
try to setup your location listener as below and do not forget to add permission into manifest.xml update this is because to add requestlocationupdates into onresume and removeupdates this
into onpause

22127933
super	implements
you have to override all touch methods if you do not call super s implementation
so you have to also implements the touchesmoved withevent and touchescancelled withevent methods

22131314
punctuation	words
if you want to retain such punctuation and split on whitespace you can just use the following instead of the regex line hope this helps
the first issue of this problem is to define the words word. am assuming by one of your comments that punctuation is not part of a words since you were asking how to ...delete punctuations from the text... one solution to this is to use a regex to capture only words characters alphanumeric and underscore by matching the text against w in the regex

22131314
punctuation	words
the first issue of this problem is to define the words word. am assuming by one of your comments that punctuation is not part of a words since you were asking how to ...delete punctuation from the text... one solution to this is to use a regex to capture only words characters alphanumeric and underscore by matching the text against w in the regex
building a hash where the keys are the words and the associated values are the counts is the way to go

22131953
comparator	comparable
treeset expects you to either pass in a comparator for its element type or for its elements to implement comparable
map does not implement comparable and you haven t provided a comparator

22132158
comparator	comparable
but since your sortmapbyvalue already implements the comparator interface you can simply use an instance of that class also note that with java 8 you can significantly reduce the length of the code
map.entry does not implement comparable so has no way to know how the entries should be sorted

22132297
ssl	https
some clarification given our discussion in your comments the above holds if your client is not compromised https does work since you are assuming that your clients will compromise themselves and use tools that will cheat your application by adding fake trusted certificates which requires admin rights i can suggest you to use two way ssl
the tools that i know like fiddler won t be able to decrypt this just by adding their trusted certificates thus making it more difficult for your clients to attack your application this way and bring them to use a debugger or patch it because it is easier than implementing a two way ssl proxy

22132754
debian	linux
on debian i have gcc-arm-none-eabi targeted for arm and gcc-msp430 targeted for msp430
unless the target is already possible with the current gcc like the -m32 option of gcc on x86-64 linux you cannot compile your code with your usual gcc

22133668
fossil	git
because fossil is a single source executable with all the features you mentioned integrated not even integrated so much as architecturally intimate my administration overhead has been effectively zero
also i just love using fossil from the command line in a way i never did with git or mercurial or subversion all of which are good tools

22134779
addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
in fact multiplication and addition of 64-bit integers in java c++ and c# is equivalent to multiplication and addition modulo 2 64
it s not necessarily a wise choice to use 2 64 as the modulo

22138053
spaces	delimiter
for example all these lists are equal and evaluate to the same value 44 444 44 444 44 444 if for some reason you want to consider the spaces as part of the list then you have to explicitly add them as elements in the list
in fact string-join is the right procedure for using in this case simply use a single space as delimiter just to clarify in a list the spaces between elements are not considered part of the list they re there to separate the elements

22141832
fileoutputstream	filewriter	fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter
when that s a filewriter this will ultimately close a fileoutputstream and tell the os that you re done writing to the file
the garbage collector will automatically call close not on the bufferedwriter or the wrapped filewriter but on the fileouputstream

22142158
inline	inlining
you just cannot make any assumptions that it will get inline
in this example you re dealing with task inlining a not-so-rare behavior of the tpl s default task scheduler

22144676
google-chrome	firefox
as for google-chrome chromium i second andy davies suggestion the page load time plugin is awesome it shows the load time next to the location bar and it also provides details
as for firefox the op has already answered his own question menu - web developer - network or ctrl + shift + k - network or ctrl + shift + q but i d like to mention the app.telemetry page speed monitor addon which does not require you to open the web console first

22145392
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure of any direct snap methods to use mousewheel but i guess you can just add a mousewheel listener...this example works in google-chrome you may need to tweak and add test case for different browsers
edit have updated to check for firefox as well

22151682
bash	subshell
for bash 3 there is a particular case that has a nice and simple solution if you don t want to handle a lot of variables or keys are simply invalid variable identifiers and your array is guaranteed to have less than 256 items you can abuse function return values
this solution does not require any subshell as the value is readily available as a variable nor any iteration so that performance screams

22158343
portrait	landscape
my app started showing the launch image and started in portrait mode
i also noticed that in attribute inspector for the launchimage asset collection iphone doesn t have landscape checkboxes so i guess if you re app is starting in landscape mode it has no image to work with

22159478
hex	binary
the mq message and correl and group id s aren t humanly readable and i strongly suggest you keep them as binary ie byte array or convert to hex digits in a string or something like that if you really want a displayable version
the string contains amq the beginning of the qmgr name and some binary information relating to date time and a counter for example

22160486
consistency	acid
check constraints parsed but not enforced indeterminate results using group by no analytic functions nonstandard quoting in backticks etc. if i had database system concepts in front of me and i wanted to understand what the author meant by ensuring consistency for an individual transaction is the responsibility of the programmer who codes the transaction. i d ask myself these questions
what does the author say about acid properties in earlier editions

22167230
implements	extends
this line is the problem for you your activity does not implements the declared interface
change public class mainactivity extends fragmentactivity to public class mainactivity extends fragmentactivity implements onheadlineselectedlistener and you should be good to go

22167230
implements	extends
change public class mainactivity extends fragmentactivity to public class mainactivity extends fragmentactivity implements onheadlineselectedlistener and you should be good to go
you do provide the method implementation but as long as you do not declare that your activity implements the interface you will not be able to upcast

22173413
allocator	stl
provide your own allocator using whatever memory allocator is available on uefi and you have a good chance of getting it to work
it s unlikely your stl implementation uses vtables anyway so 3 isn t a big deal either

22176896
super	self
calling super d self .name then tells super to find the first class past d with a name method which is a here
super doesn t look at __bases__

22176896
super	self
super doesn t look at __bases__
it looks at the method resolution order mro through type self .mro as you can see d is in there because it is a base class of e

22181844
sum	coalesce
obviously the column could be calculated simply as the sum of all the columns which might actually not be too bad with a small number of locations coalesce is needed because some results may be null. but there s an alternative to that where you don t have to list all the locations explicitly one extra time
you could return the totals per pubid alongside the details in the prepared dataset using sum over ... like this or like this if you wish to avoid repetition of the case expression then you would just include the total column into the main select clause along with the pivoted results and pubid that would be the total column for you

22183067
spaces	delimiter
or put the other two answers together and get something that s more complete so basically you use the first spaces as a delimiter to create 2 strings
then you trim the second one since trim only applies to leading and trailing spaces not everything in between

22183842
cashapelayer	calayer
cashapelayer doesn t do anything of the kind when it doesn t have a path set so the documentation you reference is misleading
this looks like it might be a copy-paste error in the documentation calayer s shadowpath property includes a similar block of text the default value of this property is nil which causes the layer to use a standard shadow shape

22186681
exponent	addition
thus a float cannot hold b exactly - it does the best job it can by setting some exponent and then mantissa to get as close as possible
when you then consider the floating point representation of b and a and try and add them the addition operation will shift the small number a s mantissa downwards as it tries to match b s exponent to the point where the value 3 falls off the end and you re left with 0

22194054
google-chrome	safari	mp4	h.264
you better think about a flash fallback include this into your video tag note ios doesnt all the profiles that h.264 provides source html5 mp4 video working in google-chrome and desktop safari but not iphone
mp4 is supported by safari desktop but you need quicktime installed to make it work which is a no-no you cant force your clients to install quicktime

22195970
fgets	fgetc
for pointers the special value in most cases is null so that is what fgets returns
however you cannot use null to mark the end of the input from fgetc because character code of zero can legally appear in the input

22196671
union	distinct
keep in mind that union will remove duplicate entries from the two sets
if you can guarantee that the two sets are distinct or you do not care about duplicates then union all will perform better especially as your result sets get larger

22199042
base	fractions
the integer and fractions parts both consist of a sequence of decimal base ten digits
either the integer part or the fractions part not both can be omitted

22199954
awt	swing
the awt approach is to add a windowlistener
while this is not a swing program you can substitute jframe for frame to leverage exit_on_close

22201707
sudo	passwd
if you run sudo visudo and enter a line like the below then the user privilegeduser should not have to enter a passwd when they run something like sudo service xxxx start
i don t think ansible will let you specify a passwd in the flags as you wish to do. there may be somewhere in the configs this can be set but this would make using ansible less secure overall and would not be recommended

22204350
direct3d	directx
you can try to set registry flags manually there hkey_local_machine software direct3d and there hkey_current_user software direct3d
but most likely it will not work on windows that is newer that windows 7 because directx 9 was deprecated a while ago and recently some updates broke all the old stuff even good ol pix

22213052
super	implements
yes you need to call init method to allow for super classes proper initialisation
second one you do not need to implements your class init method unless you need to initialise your class members

22213105
direct3d	gdi
direct3d 10.0 direct3d 9c and older direct3d runtimes do not support shared surfaces
system memory copies will continue to be used for interoperability with gdi or dxgi-based apis

22214096
google-chrome	firefox
i couldn t find google-chrome or internet explorer s listed anywhere but some quick testing shows google-chrome working at least up to 10mb and possibly further ie hitting the limit at 1mb in ie11 which is all i have handy
so to summarise for the people of the future history.state object size limit is 640kb for firefox 1mb for internet explorer 11 and at least 10mb for google-chrome

22220021
direct3d	gdi
when vista came along they unified the two driver stacks but the gdi code generally speaking still knows nothing about direct3d even if it internally uses some direct3d behind the scenes for desktop composition
in short setlayeredwindowattributes as well as updatelayeredwindow cannot and do not know about your direct3d swapchain

22220235
google-chrome	safari
it is slower than os-x and safari but tolerable and you may have some issues when google-chrome s developer tools don t quite match safari but it s much better than nothing
i have not been able to get the chrome-devtools url working so i just go to localhost 9222 in google-chrome after connecting my phone and starting the ios-webkit-debug-proxy

22221342
persistent	transient
this can be done in two ways that i know of either add provider element into the persistent unit as described in correct answere by chris or provider for interface javax.persistence.spi.persistenceprovider must be specified as a service see here this is usually included when you include hibernate or another jpa implementation into your classpath in my case i found out that due to maven misconfiguration hibernate-entitymanager jar was not included as a dependency even if it was a transient dependency of other module
quick advice check if persistence.xml is in your classpath check if hibernate provider is in your classpath with using jpa in standalone application outside of javaee a persistent provider needs to be specified somewhere

22221682
client-side	server-side
you can do it in one way or another but not both server-side remove the onclientclick javascript set the visible property of the button to false and in the code-behind click event on the server add client-side return false from the javascript function to the onclientclick
your btnimport has server-side onclient and client-side onclientclick both set

22221722
postgresql	mysql
see group by query that works in mysql is rejected by postgresql and in particular the comment and link on lazy impementation
on the upside mysql supports with rollup which might or might not be useful for you if you aggregate on different fields

22223984
postgresql	mysql
this query in mysql is using a nonstandard see note below mysql group by extension note this is a feature definied in sql 2003 standard as t301 functional dependencies it is not required by the standard and many rdbms don t support it including postgresql see this link for version 9.3 - unsupported features
the above query could be expressed in postgresql in this way where unique_id is a column that uniquely identifies each row in tab usually a primary key

22223997
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp
because tcp is stream oriented tcp will not transfer information of packet boundaries like udp and sctp
so you must add information of packet boundaries to tcp payload if it is not there already

22224589
persistent	transient
quick advice check if persistence.xml is in your classpath check if hibernate provider is in your classpath with using jpa in standalone application outside of javaee a persistent provider needs to be specified somewhere
this can be done in two ways that i know of either add provider element into the persistent unit as described in correct answer by chris here or provider for interface javax.persistence.spi.persistenceprovider must be specified as a service see here this is usually included when you include hibernate or another jpa implementation into your classpath in my case i found out that due to maven misconfiguration hibernate-entitymanager.jar was not included as a dependency even if it was a transient dependency of other module

22229018
ubuntu	linux
after days of research i ve learned several things first and foremost being that mono 3.x is not supported on ubuntu 12.04
so mvc 4 is out of the question on that os and most other linux os s that i messed with

22231566
activemq	rabbitmq
i would consider a standalone activemq since you might want to add more tomcat servers in some scenario and point both to the same activemq server
rabbitmq is not running on java but an erlang platform - so that is something different

22232213
postgresql	mysql
i know of something similar for mysql which might be useful for writing your own but nothing for using the json type in postgresql
what you need is something to translate json schema constraints into postgresql ones to i m not aware of any existing tools

22233066
implements	extends
so in some sense they re actually doing you a favor by not implements the statement variant
preparedstatement lives a bit of a double life it extends statement and thus inherits that class methods mdash

22234010
multiplying	addition
you would then add 1 to the network output and then multiplying by 1.25 to recover the desired range
note that this method may be easiest to accomplish since it does not directly change your network topology like the addition of bias would

22234145
ubuntu	linux
currently the supported configuration set for linux is only ubuntu 10.4+ gtk2 2.18+ with optional additional requirements for av codecs if you also want media playback support
so try using a supported ubuntu system instead of redhat and you may or may not get that working in a headless environment

22238660
realloc	strncpy
your realloc should be to strlen buffer +1 to accommodate the nul at the end of the string
whilst it s harmless here your strncpy should be setting the maximum amount of bytes to copy to the size of the destination buffer not the size of the source buffer

22238660
strncpy	malloc
whilst it s harmless here your strncpy should be setting the maximum amount of bytes to copy to the size of the destination buffer not the size of the source buffer
just use malloc

22238726
persistent	transient
this information really doesn t need to be persistent as it s only relevant to the current request
anything stateless should be made transient

22239503
direct3d	directx
you should include windows.h in prior to the direct3d headers
the error was due to the header orders you placed the directx headers before windows headers so some types defined in windows.h was not visible when the compiler process directx headers

22240263
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
but you can say notice my use of illegalargumentexception instead of nullpointerexception - the illegalargumentexception is more in line with what you re hoping to achieve
you d expect a nullpointerexception if you re trying to call a method on rank or suit not when you re knowingly checking its value

22241415
multiplying	multiplication
you are trying to multiplying two lists x and y or by itself but it is not defined in python
you either need to write your own function to do the list element-by-element multiplication or use numpy.multiply

22245203
cpython	pypy
i have tried this out and it failed on many occasions because pypy is only able to work with a few subset of what cpython uses
pyinstaller is a full blown cpython application so there are not able to communicate

22245203
cpython	pypy
pyinstaller is a full blown cpython application so there are not able to communicate
pyinstaller s mechanism is sensitive to how cpython works so pypy can introduce some issues

22255830
onchange	onfocus
if you then go back into the field and change the word then without unfocussing change it back to bird and then unfocus the onchange event will not fire because the value didn t change
other events like onkeydown and onfocus will fire however

22256570
equals	compareto
note they are not really equals based on the equals method
but the treeset uses the compareto method and this compareto method is currently not consistent with equals

22256570
equals	compareto
but the treeset uses the compareto method and this compareto method is currently not consistent with equals
so the set shows a wrong behavior because of your wrong compareto method

22257917
innodb	myisam
a plain select doesn t lock anything in innodb
re your comment myisam has a special case for insert where you can insert to the table even if it s otherwise locked by another session as long as the insert is appending to the end of the data

22259118
sum	coalesce
so you could sum coalesce value 10
if you just want to treat nulls as 10s then coalesce will do the trick the coalesce function returns the first of its arguments that is not null

22261482
jar	war
if you want your resources to be served by the application and not be in a jar file you place them in src main webapp in the standard maven directory layout
if you want to build a jar file containing these resources then this jar file should be built by another maven project and be one of the dependencies of the maven war project

22262830
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you can of course have mixed-case literal strings c hello world but labels field and field1 and keywords dcl and dcl are not case-sensitive
nope hlasm is case-insensitive

22264404
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
the first loop here will also be of log n since you re constantly dividing by 3 so multiplying the order of the 2 loops we get we cannot reduce that further since we have no constants to remove
just to point out a simple misconception we can have for this case normally if we have the below scenario we can reduce it like however your scenario is not an addition of orders it s multiplication so again we cannot remove the o logn here

22265404
single-quotes	double-quotes
note that this wouldn t work if you use double-quotes instead if you have error reporting enabled then you ll get the following error notice use of undefined constant lksdfasdkf - assumed lksdfasdkf in the reason is that variables are not parsed when they re wrapped in single-quotes
when you use double-quotes to define your variable the variable value gets interpolated into the resulting string meaning will contain the literal string echo lksdfasdkf

22270247
equals	compareto
the original sort function you gave doesn t correctly handle equals values so a.compareto a returns -1 instead of the expected 0
this is not the expected behavior of compareto which should be transitive

22270508
inline	inlining
inline has one guaranteed effect it allows you to define the same function identically in more than one translation unit and then requires the function to be defined in every translation unit where it s used
inline also serves as a hint that calls of the function should be inlined at the machine code level but that hint can be freely ignored and in case of a recursive function logically must be ignored for some calls machine code call inlining is not the same as macro expansion in particular the macro doesn t respect scopes

22271467
udp	tcp
of course with udp you ll have to deal with firewalls and nat blocking the packets going back to the client etc
there s nothing explicitly built in to the tcp apis to do what you want but assuming you have control over the server and clients you could do something like when the client s connect completes have the client record the current time using gettimeofday or similar when the server accepts the tcp connection have it immediately send back some data to the client doesn t matter what the data is when the client receives the data from the server have the client record the current time again and subtract from it the time recorded in 1 now you have the tcp round-trip time

22271966
gtk	gdk
here s how you would devise a method to return the corresponding top-level gtk window from a gdk window xid
but if you want to list all gtk windows of other processes then that s not easily possible

22273945
implements	extends
it can only be implements by other classes or extended by other interfaces
an abstract class cannot extends an interface

22274847
ssl	https
if it is a self-signed certificate it doesn t want any error warning when trying to access those gitlab urls hence the ssl verify_none
but that same certificate is also used by clients outside of the gitlab server using those same gitlab https urls from their browser

22276526
onresume	onpause
the best example where i can think of where you do stuff in onresume is when you set up a broadcastreceiver - you don t want the receiver to trigger something when an alert has come to the foreground you get the general idea
not always - onresume gets triggered when the activity temporarily lost focus like some pop up event when the onpause event was triggered and then you again gain focus thereby triggering an onresume

22276526
onresume	onpause
not always - onresume gets triggered when the activity temporarily lost focus like some pop up event when the onpause event was triggered and then you again gain focus thereby triggering an onresume
in this case if you had initialized variables in onresume they would all be re-initialized at this point and you would lose prior values

22276653
implements	extends
for use within an enum which cannot take generic type parameters create an abstract class that extends fragment and implements myinterface
make your implementations extends this class

22277327
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
since you re posting your -viewdidload code what is actually happening is that you re creating a whole new uiviewcontroller with all of its properties also being newly created
the only way i can think of to keep this from happening is to make a strong property to the uiviewcontroller so that it isn t destroyed when you pop it off the screen i m assuming you re closing it by popping it off the top of a uinavigationcontroller stack

22277327
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the only way i can think of to keep this from happening is to make a strong property to the uiviewcontroller so that it isn t destroyed when you pop it off the screen i m assuming you re closing it by popping it off the top of a uinavigationcontroller stack
that would explain why your viewdidload code is running multiple times since that will run just once per uiviewcontroller instance

22278928
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
strikes me that you could have use the delegate-based nsurlconnection returning a nsinputstream from connection neednewbodystream rather than loading the image into a nsdata
a couple of reactions this is not how you create a nsurlsession

22280003
udp	tcp
tcp has head-of-queue blocking as it guarantees complete and in-order delivery so when a packet gets lost in transit it has to wait for a retransmit of the missing packet whereas udp delivers packets to the application as they arrive including duplicates and without any guarantee that a packet arrives at all or which order they arrive it really is essentially ip with port numbers and an optional payload checksum added but that is fine for telephony for example where it usually simply doesn t matter when a few milliseconds of audio are missing but delay is very annoying so you don t bother with retransmits you just drop any duplicates sort reordered packets into the right order for a few hundred milliseconds of jitter buffer and if packets don t show up in time or at all they are simply skipped possible interpolated where supported by the codec
also a major part of tcp is flow control to make sure you get as much througput as possible but without overloading the network which is kinda redundant as an overloaded network will drop your packets which means you d have to do retransmits which hurts throughput udp doesn t have any of that - which makes sense for applications like telephony as telephony with a given codec needs a certain amount of bandwidth you can not slow it down and additional bandwidth also doesn t make the call go faster

22280003
udp	tcp
also a major part of tcp is flow control to make sure you get as much througput as possible but without overloading the network which is kinda redundant as an overloaded network will drop your packets which means you d have to do retransmits which hurts throughput udp doesn t have any of that - which makes sense for applications like telephony as telephony with a given codec needs a certain amount of bandwidth you can not slow it down and additional bandwidth also doesn t make the call go faster
in addition to realtime low latency applications udp makes sense for really small transactions such as dns lookups simply because it doesn t have the tcp connection establishment and teardown overhead both in terms of latency and in terms of bandwidth use

22280003
udp	mtu
in addition to realtime low latency applications udp makes sense for really small transactions such as dns lookups simply because it doesn t have the tcp connection establishment and teardown overhead both in terms of latency and in terms of bandwidth use
if your request is smaller than a typical mtu and the repsonse probably is too you can be done in one roundtrip with no need to keep any state at the server and flow control als ordering and all that probably isn t particularly useful for such uses either

22280650
fgets	getline
anyway it seems to me that this isn t a fair comparison is reading a word separated by spaces not what fgets does
probably you should use std getline for std string or istream getline for char to have similar though not identical functionalities

22281693
implements	extends
but it s not ambiguous it s of course it s redundant because it uses two way simultaneously to define that class4 implements
you could just do class class4 extends class3 and it d be exactly the same

22282393
jlist	jlabel
what you are seeing in a jlist are not true jlabel but images of jlabel or whatever components are used as the renderer
the jlist uses the same renderer to create images for each element in the column

22282393
jlist	jlabel
so say you have a jlist with 1000 items rather than create 1000 jlabel the jlist creates just one uses it to create jlabel images and then displays the images
so what you are clicking on is truly a jlist and not a jlabel

22282955
crossover	mutation
choose the crossover point randomly replace one of the genes in the chromosome randomly selected with one of the possible points note that in this post i just gave the key points however if you are not familiar with the ga at all you could read about the whole topic and i will help you for more details
i suggest you to use genetic algorithms with these settings chromosome a b c d fitness function |f 10000 a + f 10000 b + f 10000 c + f 10000 d - π| crossover ch1 ch2 xover a b c d a b c d - a b c d a b c d mutation ch mutate a b c d - a b c d this problem is really easy for ga to solve and if you implement it you will find it solves the problem in a short time

22285612
hex	binary
with a raw binary you only have one if any address associated the starting address not embedded in the file in a hex file or motorola srecord which is a similar and often used format as well
both the ihex and srec formats are basically lines of ascii hex numbers that represent a type a starting address length data and a checksum

22286494
google-chrome	firefox
i was having the same problem but then with google-chrome instead of firefox
in google-chrome i clicked hide once and i couldn t see the toolbar any longer

22286494
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome i clicked hide once and i couldn t see the toolbar any longer
in firefox ie or google-chrome s private browsing mode the toolbar was show without an issue

22286530
atom-editor	sublimetext
again because atom-editor is still in the beta stage sublimetext has much more native plugin packages
however since atom-editor is written in node.js the atom-editor official site said you can choose from over 50 thousand in node s package repository. because i am not a node.js pro i haven t look into this feature though atom-editor has better github support out of the box but sublimetext has a several git packages

22286530
atom-editor	sublimetext

sublimetext is a paid application unlimited evaluation period

22289484
noexcept	throw
if plugins must not throw exceptions declare the virtual function as noexcept in the base class
this will require all overrides in derived classes to be noexcept as well

22299238
strtol	atoi	strtol	atof
they re both deprecated have been replaced by strtol and strtof respectively
really you shouldn t be using either atoi or atof

22303915
inline	inlining
to answer your q1 pointer vs unique_ptr in debug build in -o0 calls are not inline automatically in particular is called explicitly with no inlining so that s 2 function call per iteration instead of 1 for regular pointers
this difference disappears for optimized builds to answer your q2 is it possible to inline virtual calls in this example gcc and clang don t inline the call because they probably don t do enough static analysis

22304684
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
some popular examples of systems where bin sh does not point to bin bash and on some of which bin bash may not even exist are modern debian and ubuntu systems which symlink sh to dash by default
busybox which is usually run during the linux system boot time as part of initramfs

22305020
serializable	deserialization
there s also the ability to inject serializable behavior into classes over which you don t have control
for the second part as you ve noticed hazelcast doesn t support a mapstore variant that works exclusively in terms of the serialized form so each load involves a deserialization followed by a serializable to the hazelcast structure

22305020
serializable	deserialization
for the second part as you ve noticed hazelcast doesn t support a mapstore variant that works exclusively in terms of the serializable form so each load involves a deserialization followed by a serializable to the hazelcast structure
from my experience and reading highly optimized serializable libraries like jackson and kryo are so fast that the extra work is entirely dominated by the cost of reading from the persistent store

22311343
collabnet	cvs
although cee used cvs as its initial version control system cvs s limitations were obvious from the beginning and collabnet knew it would eventually have to find something better
unfortunately cvs had become the de facto standard in the open source world largely because there wasn t anything better at least not under a free license

22312336
client-side	server-side
jquery javascript in the view will run client-side and will not have access to server-side resources unless it uses ajax to retrieve those
c# code is server-side code

22312441
erlang	elixir
so to take your erlang example to elixir it would look like someone else can chime in and correct me here but i haven t seen the oo-like access that you demonstrated here in any of the elixir code i ve seen
as far as i m aware it s not possible to call modules in this way in elixir

22314013
margin	text-align
given that you are setting a width on the element simply use margin 0 auto to center it
updated example here the reason text-align center wasn t working was because that property isn t respected by pure block level elements in this case the div

22317262
implements	extends
a class cannot extends from or implements different parameterized instantiation of a generic type
the difference is string class already implements while number class doesn t

22320137
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
i did not test opera and i did not test internet explorer which according to caniuse is not capable of server-sent events
i did some experiments and as it seems server-sent events do work on current versions of google-chrome firefox and safari out of the box with cors -

22320914
lxml	celementtree
lxml is not a swiss army knife and neither is any other piece of software for that matter
there are operations where lxml is virtually unbeatable and others where it is clearly outperformed by similar libraries like celementtree

22322228
portrait	landscape
this is not a landscape portrait issue
this will happen in portrait mode as well if you add enough buttons

22323900
gif	bmp
allowed formats are jpeg png gif wbmp and gd2
bmp format is not supported by imagecreatefromstring

22330984
backtracking	greedy
note 2 the second pattern will not have to test bcd and cd after the backtracking
bcd|cd|d | success | all letters are matched by pl+ greedy abcd | pl+

22331584
udp	tcp
udp however has two disadvantages over tcp which are even related in some way and which can become very significant
first of all udp is unreliable it does not guarantee delivery of your packets

22331666
cpython	ironpython
note that this is a cpython implementation detail and not strictly speaking part of the language python itself
for example jython and ironpython have no gil and can have truly concurrent threads

22335683
google-chrome	firefox
this amelioration shouldn t affect google-chrome but i can t test it now
-on firefox the ball was stopping before the bottom of the page

22338248
uitableview	uipageviewcontroller
in my situation i have multiple uipageviewcontrollers created from - uitableview didselectrowatindexpath some of which contain only 1 page
instead of using different controllers for different uitableview rows i implemented the uipageviewcontroller delegate method as follows this returns 0 if there is only 1 page which seems to make uipageviewcontroller not show the dots

22344987
strcpy	strncpy
you also have inverted the arguments to strcpy the destination is the first argument
the strcpy function always adds the terminator but strncpy may not do it in some cases

22345355
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy function copies data from source to destination address including with 0 termination character
strncpy function copies data as the same way but if there is no termination character 0 exists in the first n bytes to be copied termination character will not be copied then and you will need to add it by yourself to terminate the string

22347352
config	ini
create some application config file read it once at start of application bootstrap and you ll get all needed values
i m not saying anything about file structure - it can be xml ini yaml whatever you like

22349495
division	addition	division	multiplication
the reason it works for multiplication is because multiplication is distributive over addition division is not distributive
it doesn t work for division

22350138
translation	localization
here is my translation code original in c++ at
i considered the solution of werner van belle since all other approaches are incredible slow - not practicable at all an adaptive filter for the correct localization of subimages fft based subimage localization requires image normalization to work properly i wrote the code in c# where i need my solution but i am getting highly inaccurate results

22351603
client-side	server-side
it runs on a user s browser client-side and not on a server
if you want to upload pictures to a server then you need a server-side component to process your image files

22353035
noexcept	throw
to specify that a function does not throw any exception the noexcept keyword exists in c++11
throw is an exception specifier that declares that what will never throw an exception

22357303
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
on os x ubuntu centos and presumably other linux distros the .ssh directory does not exist by default in a user s home directory
on os x and most linux distros the ssh-client and typically an ssh server are installed by default so that can be a safe assumption

22358595
multiplying	division
as an aside this is a bit odd there s no need to multiplying the result by 1 here - that won t do anything
the key is in this line sum myarray.length ...since both sum and myarray.length are integers java performs integer division not floating point division which essentially means it drops the decimal component of the result

22361432
google-chrome	firefox
and on google-chrome it works
on firefox not so much

22361898
build.gradle	gradlew
i think if you take a lot of stuff out of your root-level build.gradle file and replace it with the default version for new projects which is this it will work
you ve got a bunch of stuff in your root-level gradlew build file that s making the build system think there s an android module there it s not

22362239
implements	extends
the point of an interface is to define a contract that can be implements however you want - it isn t tied to any particular abstract class which may already include a full or partial implementation
because a class can extends an abstract class and also implement an interface - or multiple interfaces come to that

22363422
jar	war
if it s a maven war project check if the jar is marked as excluded or in scope provided in the pom.xml as any of those would remove the jar from the war
if it s not the case go to the command line to the directory where the pom.xml war is and do a mvn dependency tree and confirm that your jar is indeed there

22363422
jar	war
if it s not the case go to the command line to the directory where the pom war is and do a mvn dependency tree and confirm that your jar is indeed there
if the jar is there then it means it can only be an ide related problem

22365491
queue	fifo
your queue is a fifo yes but you re not pushing data onto the queue in a fifo order
if .availableprocessors returns 1 you have several producers pushing data onto the queue - the threads your executor manages have no guarantee of running sequentially in respect to the order you call executor.execute producer

22367129
vb.net	vb6
default instances did not exist in vb.net until vb 2005 which was the third version
they were added to make the transition from vb6 easier because some vb6 developers were confused by having to explicitly create objects

22371715
postgresql	mysql
free tier does not have postgresql rds included
it does have mysql sql server and oracle

22375492
dictionary	map
your json is not well defined you must try to use something like then to parse the json dictionary into custom objects i would recommend you to use the category nsobject+motis i ve been working recently
it is very useful to map json dictionary into your custom objective-c objects

22375670
lodash	underscore.js
in general it is not safe to load underscore.js for code that requires lodash
the one exception is if you are 100 sure that the code in question used lodash in its underscore-compatible mode

22378017
setinterval	settimeout
to actually call the remote method you need to add a callback if for instance you designed your remote method to return whether or not the heartbeat was successful a more complete example would look like this it s generally recommended to use settimeout to initially schedule a deferred function and then call settimeout again from within that deferred function to schedule its own next execution instead of using setinterval
in this use case however this is particularly true because each remote method call is asynchronous so with setinterval you would eventually end up with request overlap because each call requires at least a few milliseconds to complete

22378439
client-side	server-side
something like this this would assign a javascript click handler to the client-side rendered output of button1
of course button1 still causes a post-back but since it doesn t need to do anything server-side it doesn t even need to be a server-side control

22383244
implements	extends
yes use the extends keyword for class inheritance and implements for interface implementation public class myclass extends somebaseclass implements someinterface from your question edit you should use extends in class declaration for class inheritance
in other words a class can only extends from another single class not from interfaces

22383436
implements	extends
in order to prevent the pitfalls and complexities that arise if you have a language that supports multiple inheritance c++ java allows you to inherit from exactly one class using extends and that class may or may not be abstract and any number of interfaces using implements
so this is valid public class myclass extends somebaseclass implements someinterface1 someinterface2 java 8 will allow you to have default methods in interfaces but it s implemented carefully enough so as to avoid multiple inheritance ambiguities

22388117
oncreate	setcontentview
your locationclass also does not call setcontentview in oncreate so you re not going to see a ui as far as i can tell unless you wanted it through the extends part
edit if you extend subclass and put this intent code in oncreate you re probably going to crash as it will call super in myactivity calling oncreate again as it s the superclass and will keep making more intents to start the activity

22391436
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you are not going to go back then you should get rid of your old uiviewcontroller instances
you can do so after a new instance of uiviewcontroller has been pushed to the uinavigationcontroller stack

22394935
ienumerable	iqueryable
this article is helpful iqueryable vs ienumerable in linq-to-sql
quoting that article as per the msdn documentation calls made on iqueryable operate by building up the internal expression tree instead. these methods that extend iqueryable of t do not perform any querying directly

22395135
ienumerable	iqueryable
and no i don t usually quote myself but these are very good articles. this article is helpful iqueryable vs ienumerable in linq-to-sql
quoting that article as per the msdn documentation calls made on iqueryable operate by building up the internal expression tree instead. these methods that extend iqueryable of t do not perform any querying directly

22397508
bazaar	git
i knew bazaar before git and i was quite confused at first by this and other things
git push is not designed to update the work tree

22403881
implements	extends
you need to implements your own servlet that can read data from classpath map it to some url use url in jsp with some parameter path identifying the requested file i implements simple prototype it does handle only css files and it does not cover any corner cases
but it works and you can extends it as you need servlet is simple it just takes part or url behind its mapping and loads resource from classpath jar you need to register the servlet and its mapping and you can use it this way i copied file layout.css under directory styles in one jar that is part of my war

22405693
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the java programming language does not require methods to catch or to specify unchecked-exception runtimeexception error and their subclasses .
you can find the definition of unchecked-exception in the java tutorials emphasis mine .

22406540
realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
so section 7.20.3.2 the free function from the draft c99 standard is still the proper reference and it says otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
you are not allowed to mix and match malloc and free with new and delete the draft c++ standard refers back to the c99 standard for this and if we go to the draft c++ standard section 20.6.13 c library it says emphasis mine going forward the contents are the same as the standard c library header stdlib.h with the following changes and the functions calloc malloc and realloc do not attempt to allocate storage by calling operator new 18.6

22408623
equals	gethashcode
the equals comes for free for you in the form of sequenceequal
the only remaining interesting thing to do is create a meaningful hash based on the values in the sequence rather than using the gethashcode method that the sequence provides itself because it generally won t do that most any ienumerable including list will base their hash code on the reference to the class not the values in it

22409078
leaflet	openlayers
leaflet is doing this internally already you don t need to do it manually
i made a double check with a simple wms layer in openlayers and a geojson overlay and it works fine so i proved that the distortion is not in the data

22409394
ubuntu	debian
i run into these problems a lot too because i avoid the crippled versions of openssl shipped by debian ubuntu fedora et al
for example ubuntu ships an openssl that disables tlsv1.1 and tls v1.2 cf. ubuntu 12.04 lts openssl downlevel version and does not support tls 1.2

22410157
google-chrome	firefox
that blue border is google-chrome specific firefox doesn t show it
google-chrome adds the border to links

22411574
wildfly	jboss
i d probably not suggest that unless you desperately need to use the formatter and can t wait for eap 6.3 or use wildfly
it s not possible in jboss 7.x or jboss eap 6.2

22413884
pdfbox	itext
furthermore the event oriented architecture of itext text parsing means a lower burden on resources than that of pdfbox
and pdfbox keeps information not strictly required for plain text extraction available for a longer time costing more resources

22414173
prepare	execute
from a comment on php manual documentation if you do not use mysqli_stmt_store_result and immediately call this function after executing a prepare statement this function will usually return 0 as it has no way to know how many rows are in the result set as the result set is not saved in memory yet
mysqli_stmt_store_result saves the result set in memory thus you can immedietly use this function after you both execute the statement and save the result set

22414738
memcached	opcache	memcached	apc
for larger cross-machine caches i ll also use memcached
opcache caches the bytecode and apcu is a simplified version apc that only caches the userland part and it s entirely compatible with the old apc it just doesn t tdo the bytecaching any more

22415168
implements	extends
better than 1 but still not optimal 3 solve the exception being thrown in hurlstack despite the fact that volley has implements patch
this would be best but i prefer to avoid tinkering with volley directly or extends my own httpstacks unnecessarily

22415260
build.gradle	gradlew
to do it create a new gradlew project and just put in its build.gradle the following configurations.create default artifacts.add default file somelib.jar this simply register your jar as the default artifact published by the project and this will get consumed by the other projects
this is not directly possible as local jars are not declared as transitive dependencies in gradlew

22416118
required	placeholder
required field #39
asterisk to form inputs another solution would be to add the span and placeholder text outside of the input field but that would require some javascript to control when it is and isn t visible

22416320
punctuation	words
first using tr or maybe sed - slightly slower but more flexible allows more precise removing of punctuation and so on you chunk the sentence file into words add -i option to grep for case insensitivity see comment by scott
you then use uniq to gather unique words and grep -v -f -f dictionary to get all words that are not in dictionary

22416882
uilabel	nsstring
so change the method to and change all parts of the code that call this method to pass in the uilabel
in your example value is an nsstring not the uilabel

22416882
uilabel	nsstring
in your example value is an nsstring not the uilabel
nsstring s have no sethidden method as the error message suggests

22418427
multiplying	multiplication
if you want three different dictionaries you need to run it three times more python cannot multiplying a list until after it has created the list
thus when is executed dict is evaluated first and then the multiplication is performed

22418694
google-chrome	firefox
after several hours the solution for me was let s say my site is settings app domain site123.com even blank it will work though site url important not php code - fb_config.php important note also i had some issues with firefox facebook- getuser was 0 even my code was working on google-chrome
but after cleaning firefox cache it worked nicely

22419274
nsorderedset	nsset
see for instance this answer ordered sets and core data nsorderedset objectatindexpath would make sense if the data structure were a tree and not an array
core data to-many relationships use nsset

22419274
nsorderedset	nsset
if you check ordered in xcode it will become an nsorderedset which has an objectatindex method
you would not want to use the unordered set because even if you got an array of objects with nsset s allobjects method the ordering is not necessarily the same every time you call it

22421445
csv	tsv
rabus points out the above solutions do not handle unquoted input fields that themselves contain characters correctly - you ll end up with extra csv fields
the following awk solution fixes this by enclosing such fields in ... on demand see the non-robust awk solution above for a partial explanation of the approach detects any field that contains and isn t already enclosed in double quotes updates the field by enclosing it in double quotes as stated before updating any field causes awk to rebuild the line from the fields with the ofs value in this case which amounts to the effective tsv - csv conversion

22422500
firefox	safari
in firefox and internet explorer unless the browser is explicitly set to offline mode
via the mdn documentation online is true in chrome and safari if the computer is connected to any network including a lan even if the lan doesn t have a working gateway to the internet

22423012
http	spdy
the clients will send a http request which is not understood the server expects spdy and that s why your connection hangs
only chromium chrome has a mode where you can make it speak clear-text spdy using the parameter as described here

22427879
equals	compareto
for instance if the class is called myclass have it implement give it a decent compareto ... method in this method you should sort by the number fields first and return a value if the numbers are not equals
and then by string second if the two numbers are equals

22433307
clang	llvm
speaking only for clang it seems like this is an issue that is just an unfortunate side effect of a compiler heuristic
from a brief look at clang file cgrecordlayoutbuilder.cpp function cgrecordlowering lowerunion it looks like llvm doesn t internally represent union types as such and the types of a function don t get changed depending on the uses within the function

22433307
clang	llvm
from a brief look at clang file cgrecordlayoutbuilder.cpp function cgrecordlowering lowerunion it looks like llvm doesn t internally represent union types as such and the types of a function don t get changed depending on the uses within the function
clang looks at your function and sees that it needs 16 bytes worth of arguments for the type signature then uses a heuristic to pick which type it thinks is best

22437508
ng-view	ng-include
having done further reading on this it appears that although functionality for multiple ng-view has had number of requests it was not able to make it into the angular release but there is possibility of something in future releases
in this discussion misko hevery pointed out another approach which is to use ng-include

22439241
jruby	mri
weird stuff such as these are likely caused by rails not being absolutely thread-safe even on mri but it s more obvious on jruby since it s gil-free .
rails.logger.silence and related have not been 100 thread-safe i ve dealt with similar issues on jruby on rails since 2.3 and there sure were attempts to fix this but somehow the same silencing logic keeps getting back

22440247
queue	fifo
you then send out one single byte from the sw buffer adjust the index and return note that there might still be some bytes queue within the sw buffer after that
whenever you send a byte you look for space in the hw fifo and put the byte directly there if not you queue it in the sw buffer

22440548
serializable	deserialization
serializable objects are stored in utf-16 string format to allow for sql server to save the objects
proper use of assemblyqualifiedname to allow for deserialization of objects not in the immediate assembly

22440716
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
that is to say writing this is almost certainly a code smell most modern frameworks will allow you to specify a specific state that your application enters when such an error occurs - if it s a web driven application you can have those sorts of runtimeexception handled as a 500
there is also error which is a special case of unchecked-exception - you should definitely not recover from this since it s indicated that something has gone terribly terribly wrong with the jvm

22445448
vbo	vao
the warning means that you should use vbos vertex buffer objects for static data. from your code i see you are creating the index buffer vbo using gl_element_array_buffer which is correct but you are not setting it when you call render
vao s do not store index buffer data so you should not be doing the gl_element_array_buffer work inside of the vao creation code

22446133
move	drag
alternatively change the button to a toggle so that if move mode is on it removes the gesture recognizer from the map instead of creating and adding it
to make it so that the map can be dragged if the user starts dragging outside the circle and to not drag the map if the user starts dragging inside the circle don t disable scrollenabled from the beginning -- leave it on until dragging starts and we can decide whether to disable or not

22447196
backgrounding	multitasking
if you stopped the app by swiping up from the multitasking view double tap home then ios 7 interprets this as meaning you do not want the app to operate at all - either in the foreground or backgrounding
if the app is killed as a result of being in the backgrounding when the device needs more memory then it will continue to operate in backgrounding mode

22452010
serializable	deserialization
this will only work for requests that take a detectable amount of time to serializable you can ignore the server s response and refuse to open a stream to read the body you can stop reading the response from the server you can simply ignore the results of the operation looking at the code it seems that you can t do #4 #5 or #6 because asyncserviceclient doesn t expose the iasyncresult used internally
the only thing you can do is simply ignore the response and pay the price of deserialization

22453152
equals	gethashcode
in more formal terms gethashcode must always return the same value for two objects that compare equals
with your current code two objects that differ only in the ret_usd value will always compare equals but are not guaranteed to have the same hash code

22453152
equals	gethashcode
with your current code two objects that differ only in the ret_usd value will always compare equals but are not guaranteed to have the same hash code
so what happens is that linq calls gethashcode on two objects you consider equals gets back different values concludes that since the values were different the objects cannot be equals so there s no point at all in calling equals and moves on

22453669
nodevalue	innerhtml
morever to get the content of a td element you cannot use nodevalue which is defined for text nodes only
you could use innertext but due to issues in browser support the good old innerhtml is safer

22457206
bash	subshell
as seen in bash reference manual - 3.4.2 special parameters expands to the process id of the shell
in a subshell it expands to the process id of the invoking shell not the subshell

22457378
git-svn	svn2git
ruby required it s worth noting that while git-svn defaults to pulling from just the path you specify not branches tags and trunk
svn2git is the opposite

22457802
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is able to animate the transform just fine
with all that said i m still not entirely sure if the spec is ambiguous or the behavior shown in ie and firefox is in fact correct

22460046
onclick	onchange
the first example does not work because the helper by default will handle the onclick event
generally the onclick event should not be placed on each option instead the onchange event on the select element should be handled to find out the option selected plenty of threads on so discuss this eg html javascript select action

22466499
junit	mockito
be sure that when you run the unit tests in eclipse the plugins tab in the launch config really contains the junit mockito and hamcrest plugins of the powermockito feature and not some other version
before first usage with tycho delete the .meta .cache and p2 folders from the maven local repository if this is not the case then please provide the followings to let me help you your target file as xml the test fragment manifest and host bundle manifest the size of your hamcrest and junit bundles inside if you file an issue at with a sample project i will take a look at it

22467305
ienumerable	iqueryable
the problem is because you passed in a delegate you ended up using this version of .where which outputs a ienumerable the problem is requires a and to get that you must use this version of .where which you can see only take in a not a
iqueryable objects do not work with delegates they work with expressions

22467554
ssl	https
this does not remove the need for you to use ssl on your servers in production as all financial transactions should occur over ssl
the interactions between your rails application and balanced always take place over https

22468132
selecteditem	selectedindex
there are two ways to get the selected item out of a combobox selectedindex which is always an int and selecteditem
selectedindex isn t generally used since you don t generally care about the index of the selected item you care about the selected item itself which is easily accessible by.

22471391
atom-editor	sublimetext
atom-editor has a richer api though poorly documented at present with the design goal of allowing greater control of its ui
being closely coupled with webkit offers numerous capabilities for ui feature enhancements not presently possible with sublimetext

22477943
uicollectionview	uitableview
i think i would go for using uicollectionview as it will allow more flexibility in the future and you will have to use it anyways
if you are not using some of the specific uitableview features 1 making uicollectionview look exactly like a table is trivial

22486405
lxml	beautifulsoup
use beautifulsoup version 4 not 3 and install lxml to handle xml parsing
currently as of version 4.3.2 beautifulsoup does ignore processing instructions like the instruction see bug 1294645

22486608
couchbase	couchdb
the in-memory multiget against couchbase is the fastest way to retrieve the matching documents using the ids from es
given the doc link i am assuming you are using couchbase and not couchdb

22486608
couchbase	couchdb
given the doc link i am assuming you are using couchbase and not couchdb
you are following the correct link for use of elastic search with couchbase

22491111
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if it s still not moving make sure useautolayout is not selected check this just because i already built it try this for tap to animate in your viewdidload then use these here s a way to loop it
add method like this call like this note notice that i put your animation call in viewdidappear if you animate in viewdidload you won t see anything because your view isn t displayed yet

22492140
multiplying	modulo
compute x 2 just once then multiplying the x power so far by this number x2 rather than taking x to the n th power here is some python code that implements this - it converges with very few terms and you can control the precision with the statement other than that i can t help you much as i am not familiar with scheme.
a few suggestions reduce your input modulo 2pi - most polynomial expansions converge very slowly with large numbers keep track of your factorials rather than computing them from scratch each time once you have 4

22492745
opensuse	linux
like i said i m using qemu on opensuse 12.2. i tried with vmware 8 and wrmsr followed by rdmsr returned eax 0x0
from what i understand vmware player or workstation does not support this. kvm does though but you would need to switch to a linux box with qemu

22493629
implements	extends
to overcome this you can implements your own class that can represent large bit sequences with necessary operations like adding and shifting etc
or you can find a similar class in your standard library and extends it. i am aware that this is not an easy task and i would not want to implements this myself

22498769
implements	extends
nothing wrong with this code... interface can extends multiple interface some points you should know 1 all variables declared in interface are by default public static 2 if i want to use members like methods or variable i just need to implements my interface in above case by doing this i can also get access to my1 and my2
3 moreover if i have implemented my and it extends my1 and my2 so i need to implements all the methods which are not in my but in my1 and my2

22498769
implements	extends
3 moreover if i have implements my and it extends my1 and my2 so i need to implements all the methods which are not in my but in my1 and my2
in above example i have to state method which is in my2 when i have implements my only

22503383
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
on the contrary you may be interested in __attribute__ noinline for gcc which will nearly never inline the call if you want to really know what s happening in your code you can use -winline to see when inline-functions are not inline
you can also use -os or -oz optimization levels to change internal compiler thresholds so that it will do less inlining

22503460
namenode	hdfs
namenode high availability is not related to yarn
yarn is the improved version of mapreduce framework it s a generic framework for handling different kinds of jobs not only limited to mapreduce namenode is an hdfs component it s a separate component

22503460
namenode	hdfs
yarn is the improved version of mapreduce framework it s a generic framework for handling different kinds of jobs not only limited to mapreduce namenode is an hdfs component it s a separate component
there is not direct connection between yarn and hdfs except yarn can access hdfs

22506053
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
appears to work on firefox google-chrome opera and ie11 but not ie8 9 10 .clonenode and .clone in jquery on firefox appears to copy the .value over therefore making the clone pointless
so here is the vanilla javascript function i have written that works on firefox 27 and 28 google-chrome 33 ie 8 9 10 11 opera 17 .

22507839
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
also this was implemented in a simple uiviewcontroller not embed in a uinavigationcontroller with a navigation bar i added manually
this code won t work in a uitableviewcontroller or a uiviewcontroller embed in a uinavigationcontroller

22508427
jar	war
instead the integrated version if an ear file is deployed at the application level and it has dependencies on a jar file in the data model project and dependencies on a war file in the view-controller project
it means you are not deploying just the war from jdeveloper it internally creates an ear

22508860
apache	nginx
jelastic only works in root for me with apache server
with nginx server not like loadbalancer impossible the install wordpress

22512226
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in particular it is very important that viewdidload is called in correct sequence right down the chain of creation and that this happens for all view controllers before they are sent decoderestorablestatewithcoder also in order down the chain
however you should not count on anything having to do with viewwillappear and its cousins

22513105
associativity	operator-precedence
and also you can see that associativity doesn t create problem while evaluating since operators with same precedence will have same associativity and evaluation is ordered by precedence first and within that ordered by associativity
here you should consider the operator-precedence

22514224
cassini	iis
granted iisexpress is much better than cassini but if there is no reason to not use full iis then i conitnue to advocate it s use
using full iis has some benefits

22515581
udp	tcp
anything that streams gains the most benefits from udp
the packet loss causing a one minute delay to tcp would not cause a one minute delay to udp

22515581
udp	tcp
the packet loss causing a one minute delay to tcp would not cause a one minute delay to udp
considering that most systems use multiple resolution streams making things go blocky when starving for packets makes even more sense to use udp

22518125
ng-show	ng-class
in previous versions of angular you could do this in recent versions this doesn t work however because ng-show does its visibility by adding and removing the ng-hide class which is less specific than an element attribute what i ve been doing recently is this doing it this way means that the will be immediately hidden by the style for the ngcloak class
when angular does start up it will process all of the directives include ng-class and ngcloak so your element will then have the right class and be visible

22518284
decimal	ieee
as sqlite uses ieee floating point numbers see sqlite data types decimal numbers are not perfectly represented
the normal way to deal with it is to round the result to two decimal places

22519722
rvm	bundler
stephen ball has a good blog post about how to use bundler instead of rvm gemsets which explores the overlaps in further detail
while rvm s gemsets are not necessary rvm provides other conveniences automatically adding bundler binstubs to the path so you can avoid typing bundle exec

mp3	wav
i converted my file from a wav to an mp3
i guess eclipse has problems with wav files if they re too big because my music.wav which was around 7mb wouldn t work but my soundeffect.wav which was less than 1mb worked fine

22521517
wadl	wsdl
i am surprised the answer above was accepted they are only links for tools validating the wadl not creating it
altova s xmlspy indeed has nice visual wsdl editor but there is no option for wadl

multiplication	modulo
here s what happens in your example convert to binary keeping only up to 52 digits perform multiplication 1.01000001010001111010111000010100011110101110000101 e2 x 1.1001 e6 -------------------------------------------------------------- 0.000101000001010001111010111000010100011110101110000101 0.101000001010001111010111000010100011110101110000101 + 1.01000001010001111010111000010100011110101110000101 ------------------------------------------------------------- 1.111101011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111101e8 cutting off at 52 digits gives 1.111101011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111e8 note that this is not the same as 1.11110110e8 which would be 502
perform modulo there may actually be additional error here depending on what algorithm is used within the mod function mod 1.111101011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111e8 1.01e3 1.111111111111111111111111111111111111111111100000000e0 the error is exactly -2 -44 which is -5.6843x10 -14

22524607
vim	gedit
you cannot access the clipboard from vim unless you have a +xterm_clipboard run this command vim --version | grep xterm_clipboard if you get +xterm_clipboard then its okay but if you get -xterm_clipboard then you need to compile your vim with xterm_clipboard enabled
furthermore you can install the vim-gnome sudo apt-get install vim-gnome and after that when you check the vim --version | grep xterm_clipboard you will get a +xterm_clipboard open your file in vim type the following keys in this order g g + y g this will copy the whole text into the system clipboard then you can directly copy it into any other thing gedit browser etc using ctrl + v make sure to keep the file open in vim or else closing the vim editor will clear the contents of the keyboard

22526423
rdf	owl
the schema ontology appears to be rdf rather than owl so i m not sure if it makes sense to try and fix these issues
the root cause for this is that during parsing by the owl api rdfs range xsd string is considered to be asserting that the range is the xsd string class

22528202
sudo	passwd
you need to specify the sudo command in winscp session settings as custom shell if you are using scp or use sudo in custom sftp server startup command if you are using sftp
though there are some limitations notably that you need to configure sudo not to require a passwd

22538246
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg rgb to yuv conversion loses color and scale
you copied and pasted old code that will not even compile with recent libav from someone else s website

22539067
bash	zsh
note how this quoting behavior differs fundamentally from that of bash 3.2+ zsh requires quoting only for syntax reasons and always treats the resulting string as a whole as a regex whether it or parts of it were quoted or not
there are 2 variables containing the matching results contains the entire matched string array variable contains only the matches for the capture groups note that zsh arrays start with index 1 and that you don t need to enclose the variable name in to reference array elements multi-shell implementation of the operator as shell function rematch the following shell function abstracts away the differences between bash ksh zsh with respect to the operator

22539328
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome browser wan not returning a position on 30000 miliseconds timeout
firefox was not returning a position too

22539370
clang	llvm
edit since you mention the cygwin clang integrated assembler doesn t work the best option is to output arm assembly with
llvm ir is not portable

22540005
spaces	delimiter
if it is there then add it into the list try this edit as pointed in comments if your someword contain spaces then the above method does not fit
step 1 you need to split the string based on space delimiter using string.split method

22541924
octal	decimal
it makes no difference for this particular value because octal 4 and decimal 4 are the same value
it s confusing and surprising to use an octal here though if it were idiomatic to refer to gpio pins using octal that might be a reason to use octal here but as far as i know it isn t

22542631
jar	manifest.mf
in this case java ignores any main-class specified in the manifest.mf file of the jar if one even is specified
multiple jar files as well as directories of java files not in a jar can be specified by putting colons between them

22544228
jruby	mri
this looks like a bug in jruby
they try to maintain compatibility with mri as much as possible and when that doesn t happen it is considered a bug unless otherwise noted

22545717
inline-functions	inlining
so better stick with inline-functions
apart from forcing inlining macros can also be detrimental to speed if they are not carefully written not to evaluate their arguments twice

22545820
strtol	atoi
1 intialize line to null getline will allocate space for you if it is not null it will assume you already allocated it 2 free line after use 3 use strtol or scanf to get the integer since you and the compiler can t be sure the input line will contain a number in ascii digits 4 check the return value of malloc it returns null in case of failure as a general rule treat every possible error case it is a necessary best practice in c
also strtok can just return null if line is a zero length string so there is potentially atoi null this code s behavior can be so undefined.

22546809
serializable	deserialization
you can make the serializable less forgiving by specifying the following option in your apphost config i am not aware of any way to modify the url to indicate to servicestack that the request is in json format
furthermore it doesn t appear there is any way inside servicestack to modify the content type before deserialization

22547017
subtract	addition
most of the tasks that matlab is used for physics and engineering use the convention of indices starting at 1 in most of the literature so people working in these fields do not need to convert their algorithms by subtract 1 from everything
in addition to this matlab is short for matrix laboratory and in mathematics the convention is typically to index matrices starting at 1 so it kind of makes sense that they will follow this convention

22547615
build.gradle	gradlew
when you get this configuration with name default not found error it s really confusing but what it means is that gradlew is looking for a module or a build.gradle file someplace and it s not finding it
in your case you have this in your settings.gradle file include libraries android-bootstrap android-bootstrap which is making gradlew look for a library at ftpbackup libraries android-bootstrap

22555538
google-chrome	safari
if you have a favicon.ico file with its declaration in the html code ios safari and android google-chrome won t load it tested on ipad mini and galaxy nexus
however if you have apple touch icons they will be loaded immediately by some browsers not when the page is bookmarked or added to home screen ios safari waits for bookmark or add to home screen events

22557581
hex	binary
then you can iterate through the input array convert each byte to an hex string and print the string content to the file
this is an example of such a conversion function printing hex byte sequence in console compile and run test in console if you want to convert the whole binary array into a single string at once you can define a function like this note that this is not good if the binary file is huge

22558088
fgets	strcpy
otherwise fgets writes an extra byte past the end of the memory space allocated by your program
finally you shouldn t be using strcpy to copy general data use memcpy instead

22560747
implements	extends
you can easily implements protected functions in an abstract class as you ve said
you say it s not possible because some of your classes must extends an unrelated class

22561568
ubuntu	centos
it s not a good idea to use on ubuntu the libraries designed to work with centos since at compile time they might dynamically link to your ubuntu system .so files. you will never have the guarantee it will work
your suggestion of installing the centos versions of the libraries in an ubuntu system might work but you need to test it first. if you can run your ubuntu compiled program on the centos system then you are safe to go

22563054
ssl	https
firebug works both with http and https but what it doesn t do is show you the ssl tls details under the https connection
the ssl tls handshake is not carried over the http protocol but it s done at the ssl tls level under http https is http over ssl tls

22565816
union	distinct
for example select foo as a 1 as b union all select bar 3 to query a different database you need to qualify the table references with the database name select t.mycol from mytable t union all select o.somecol from otherdatabase.mytable o given that you are using the distinct keyword in your original query you can use the union operator which eliminates duplicate rows
the union all operator does not perform the extra step of identifying and removing duplicate rows. followup a mysql query can t reference two different connections

22569144
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
push segues are executed against a uiviewcontroller that is embedded in or managed by a uinavigationcontroller with the system then finding the managing uinavigationcontroller via the view controller s navigationcontroller property in order to execute the push
the message you have received says ...push segues can only be used when the source controller is managed by an instance of uinavigationcontroller in your case the source controller is an instance of uinavigationcontroller it isn t managed by a uinavigationcontroller

22569512
fixed-point	fractions
depending on your need represent money values you might want to look into fixed-point arithmetic
some fractions numbers cannot be represented precisely in binary

22569604
uiview	subviews
the only relevant bit of information i ve come across is the following from apple s auto layout documentation you cannot set a constraint to cross the view hierarchy if the hierarchy includes a view that sets the frames of subviews manually in a custom implementation for the layoutsubviews method on uiview or the layout method on nsview
here the phrase view that sets the frames of subviews manually implies to me that manually setting frames is ok

22573161
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome this can be achieved by three different approaches see my blog article here for more details search in elements panel like below execute and in console panel as shown in lawrence s answer third party extensions not really necessary in most of the cases could be an overkill here is how you search xpath in elements panel press f12 to open google-chrome developer tool in elements panel press ctrl + f in the search box type in xpath or css selector if elements are found they will be highlighted in yellow
firefox either select web console from the web developer submenu in the firefox menu or tools menu if you display the menu bar or are on mac os x or press the ctrl + shift + k command + option + k on os x keyboard shortcut

22576152
ng-app	ng-controller
so since you have ng-app attribute on html you can define a new controller and use it in #header index.html app.js
using ngroute and ng-view does not preclude using ng-controller and other angular constructs in your code as long as the code resides inside an element which has ng-app attribute or has been bootstrapped

22579263
pickle	dill
there is absolutely no reason for python not to pickle things like ellipsis and notimplemented and frankly not having them picklable contributes to the frailty of python as a parallel asynchronous language
you can pickle these types of objects with dill a replacement for pickle

22580107
tabcontrol	tabitem
i am not sure about your complex scenario what you have but for posted sample issue is not in tabcontrol but instead in itemscontrol
itemscontrol by default does not support ui virtualization you have to make it ui virtualized whenever tabitem gets loaded all ui containers to host items will be created 1000 items will be created

22580982
pickle	dill
python s pickle and multiprocessing are pretty broken for doing parallel computing so if you aren t adverse to going outside of the standard library i d suggest dill for serialization and pathos.multiprocessing as a multiprocessing replacement
dill can serialize almost anything in python and pathos.multiprocessing uses dill to provide more robust parallel cpu use

22582461
multiplication	modulo
if you perform multiplication like where both result and x can be up to mod - 1 the intermediate expression can be up to mod - 1 squared
and for modulo 10 9 + 7 this surely does not fit into a 32-bit integer type

22584259
fiddler	charles
you cannot monitor your own network on the android phone without root but here is how you can do it on a computer doesn t require root if you are on a windows pc try the following install fiddler2 open and go to tools fiddler options connections check allow remote computers to connect optional - uncheck act as system proxy on startup to prevent you from getting traffic from your pc restart fiddler go to wifi settings touch your connected wifi network for 4 seconds choose modify network config show advanced options proxy manual hostname yourcomputer name or ip proxy port 8888 or what you set it to in fiddler2 enjoy p.s
if you are on mac there is charles if you are on another o.s

22585703
g++	gcc
at that point as pointed out elsewhere gcc g++ will work but it s not actually gcc but clang in disguise
for programs that only work using gcc extensions

22587236
gruntjs	package.json
step-by-step guide to converting the vs2013 sample project to use less and gruntjs remove bootstrap and install bootstrap less uninstall-package bootstrap install-package twitter.bootstrap.less open a command prompt and cd to your project directory ensure grunt-cli is installed globally npm install -g grunt-cli create a package.json file npm init install gruntjs and grunt-contrib-less locally npm install gruntjs grunt-contrib-less create a file in your project called gruntfile.js with the following contents edit your visual studio pre-build event to include --no-color removes some of the control characters from the visual studio build output build your project then enable show all files and incldue the two compiled css files in your project so that web deploy picks them up
i ve got this working in a slightly different way ensure you ve got grunt-cli installed globally npm install -g grunt-cli create a gruntfile.js in your project or solution and define a target to do whatever less compiling you want less add call gruntjs less to your pre-build event if you don t specify call then the process doesn t return after gruntjs you can add different targets to the development and production build processes if you like

22587415
build.gradle	gradlew
from comment #10 in that bug you can choose from one of two workarounds just add next lines to your build.gradle in order to use 0.9.1 plugin or just downgrade to 0.9.0 if you re not running 0.9.1 of the android gradlew plugin then this isn t your bug
you don t mention what version of android studio or what version of the android gradlew plugin you re running but i m guessing it s 0.5.1 and 0.9.1 respectively

22588402
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
the error is with you should initialize them to null since ptr3 and ptr4 are not null realloc assumes they were pointers to valid memory
from man realloc unless ptr is null it must have been returned by an earlier call to malloc calloc or realloc

22593117
onresume	onpause
whenever a user change from you app to another o goes to the notifications or whatever always will be calling onpause when it goes to another app and onresume when it came back
you have to understand that you activity may be killed if the system don t have enough resources in that case oncreate will be called first but if not then will jump the oncreate and goes to onresume

22593117
onresume	onpause
you have to understand that you activity may be killed if the system don t have enough resources in that case oncreate will be called first but if not then will jump the oncreate and goes to onresume
onstop is mostly no necessary as you should free all your resources in onpause because after the onpause call you don t know if your activity will be killed by the system

22595827
implements	extends
for example as soon as you make number an interface the immediate subclasses say integer would break as a class cannot extends from an interface but has to implements it
but integer class extends from number

22600445
mvp	presenter
i think mvp is the simplest way to look at it but it s not the most precise
in this notion each polymer element is it s own mvp system element properties are the model element methods are the presenter and the dom is the view

22608597
super	self
the following simple example will crash also if your super init method returned nil for any reason that might be indicator that something went wrong and you should not proceed with object initialization and any other required work with it
when you access instance variables in your methods the code is equivalent to addressing them via self pointer so if for some reason self pointer is nil and you access your ivars in init method your application will crash as you will try to derefenrence null pointer

22611039
matlab	simulink
the functionality in computer vision system toolbox is available as matlab functions system objects and simulink blocks
it s implemented in a mixture of matlab code and c code and as far as i know does not rely on opencv at all

22615383
spaces	delimiter
could just enumerate cultures even with that it appears you are not allowing spaces so you would need remove spaces
you are not allowing certain delimiter so would need to remove them you state any data format but you are really looking for specific date formats

22615395
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
using object.defineproperty should add several more browsers to the mix this code should work and was tested in firefox 1.5+ google-chrome 6+ opera 10.5+ and ie9+
unfortunately safari on any platform doesn t allow changing the useragent

22615705
consistency	acid
when dealing with cqrs and domain events there are 2 things that matter idempotency and eventual consistency
in this context you don t really have an acid transaction you have messages that were handled or not

22619625
build.gradle	gradlew
not working classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.9.+ working classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.9.0 see also edit commonsware s solution is neater as it works with all gradlew versions add to the build.gradle file
changing gradlew settings solves the problem

22620978
implements	extends
custom memory allocator using pointers you can also create your own pool allocator this is very simplified with lots of checks removed to just show the principle swap two values pointers also allows you to implements swap
that is swapping the values of two variables conclusion java has never been able to fully replace c++ for systems programming at places such as google in part because performance can not be tuned to the same extends due to the lack of ability to control memory layout and usage cache misses affect performance significantly

22622475
punctuation	words
the most important thing to be aware of with the other answers is that they do not take capitalization and punctuation into account
for example structure structure structure would be counted as 3 different words each with a value of 1 and not 1 words with a value of 3

22623268
oncreate	setcontentview
that is your oncreate method should start with a lowercase o
as the code is currently your oncreate method isn t getting called but if you rename the method correctly you ll still get the black screen because setcontentview needs to be called after you call super.oncreate

22623564
cdr	cons
unfortunately c++11 doesn t support polymorphic lambdas but there are several ways to implement cons car and cdr in c++ anyway
the first and possibly the most straightforward way to implement cons car and cdr is using std tuple or std pair

22623678
bmp	png
you need a bmp file in 32-bit alpha bmp format which many applications cannot save properly
my approach is to generate png images first and then convert them to 32-bit bmp using this little tool once you have such a file it should be loadable using toolbar.loadbitmap ... without problems. in case you re using an image list for the toolbar or if you want to use an image list to display icons in some other control such as a treeview load the image like this hope this helps

22624119
spaces	delimiter
this only works if you specify the delimiter to not ie works only for no spaces after the comma
if you want spaces after the comma - here is a example how

22624687
express	node.js
the problem is that this sessions collection is being specified directly in the express framework configuration not implementing mongoose i ll have to do my express session mocking separately
the sessions mongodb collection is being requested here by the node.js express framework s sessions module session.save node_modules express-session session session.js 63 25 i have been using mockgoose to mock my mongoose-wrapped mongodb tables

22625256
equals	compareto
dr myutildate_b .toinstant equals myutildate_a.toinstant .plus 24 chronounit.hours exactly 24 hours apart. and myutildate_b .toinstant .isafter myutildate_a.toinstant .plus 24 chronounit.hours over 24 hours apart. alternatively java.time you specifically asked for comparing two date-times to ask if either is one exactly 24 hours later than another is one more than 24 hours later than another
the compareto method you mentioned does not do this

22626392
ubuntu	linux
however if i use r 3.0 on ubuntu 13.04 gnu linux 3.8.0-23-generic x86_64 i get i tried experimenting and was able to get numbers very similar to what i got in windows 7 by using so i hope that is able to solve your second problem
in order to figure out why i was able to get non-nan answer with windows but not ubuntu we can look at and notice that macos x binary kernsmooth_2.23-10.tgz windows binary kernsmooth_2.23-11.zip naturally there are two different versions but the windows binary is one version further than macos x binary

22628917
boost	allocator
i would go with boost
my original answer which only works to send data around inside a process but not outside the process if you don t want to use boost.any or boost.variant you can roll your own using the excelent non intrusive polymorphism pattern from sean parent after making this variant class the rest should be easy here is a live example if you want speed you could get around the heap allocator by puting a stack allocator in the packetdata class which is big enough to hold the usual data sizes

22630625
interpolation	splines
first i m using destructuring to extract data points and cluster coordinates i m assuming that you always have a single cluster following your data points then i m breaking nested vector of pairs into two vectors one for each dimension then i m creating a plot object and drawing a line on it using your data points then i m adding original data point blue dots add-points x y and your cluster green dot finally i m displaying resulting plot view in my first example i m also using interpolation to make the line smoother i m using function-plot here because interp object is a function
i m not sure what you want but as far as i got you it s something like this i m using cubic-hermite splines interpolation to make the line smooth and i m using add-points function to add data points to the plot

22630625
interpolation	splines
i m not sure what you want but as far as i got you it s something like this i m using cubic-hermite splines interpolation to make the line smooth and i m using add-points function to add data points to the plot
you ll find more interpolation examples here

22632160
udp	tcp
in a local network you can send all the public environment packets ie public chat public events via udp in case of network high load some packets will be discarded but that is not a big deal
it can be tricky to handle republishing of lost udp packets this can be done with a temporary normal tcp call

22633963
lxml	beautifulsoup
using lxml prints note that with lxml an element tag can be in only one place in the tree since every element has only one parent so appending tag to ol also removes it from footnote
so unlike with beautifulsoup you do not need to iterate over the contents in reverse order nor use insert 0 ...

22634769
rvm	bundler
bundler was installing my gems in vendor bundle and not using those from the rvm gemset
what i did was to tell bundler to use those gems from rvm and then since nokogiri was already installed it worked

22636292
inline	inlining
in my experience the inline keyword is mainly useful in two situations it lets you write generic numeric code which would not be possible without inline
so in this case you need inlining regardless of the performance concerns

22636323
picasso	android-query
for me picasso is the way to go
very fast stable easy to use mostly one line of code i used to use universal-image-loader 1.9.0 universal-image-loader till i had to use a listview with an onscrolllistener where the next 10 items where downloaded and the scrolling became not fluently enough with universal-image-loader while fast-scrolling back and forth with for example 50 items loaded. to accomplish a smooth scrolling i ve tried different configurations and options in universal-image-loader did not help except the delay option a bit and i ve tried android-query fast but on scroll images vanished and appeared again even with a placeholder set and urlimageviewhelper fast but i could not set a drawable as a placeholder in case of no network connection so i ended up with picasso the fastest from those four i ve tested hence a smooth scrolling but i have to give a big compliment to nostra13 creator of universal-image-loader anyway because of clean and easy-to-follow documentation easy to use many options stable reliable support testing environment android htc desire x and a very weak wifi-connection

22641135
implements	extends
however what the documentation does not make clear is that if you go for option 3 it will not automatically apply the methods implements in classes that extends webmvcconfigureradapter
as others have said we really need to see your full configuration but if simply extends webmvcconfigurationsupport and removing enablewebmvc breaks other parts of your configuration my guess is that you are still using webmvcconfigureradapter somewhere else in your config

22641671
ssl	https
arguably the node.js server object for http and https ought to be given the capability to listen on an arbitrary number of ports and interfaces with and without ssl but this does not seem to currently be implemented
i was able to get one server to listen on two ports by passing a second server that had no request listener as the handle argument to server.listen handle callback interface in addition to server.listen port hostname backlog callback but it did not work with ssl non-ssl servers mixed. the stunnel workaround already mentioned is of course a viable option but if it is not desirable to install a separate piece of software to avoid non-node.js dependencies the same tunneling can be achieved natively in node.js instead assuming http on port 80 and https on port 443 this will have the same effect as using stunnel

22654286
sudo	passwd
su and sudo are 2 different things and you re getting confused
when you login as ubuntu and run any command using sudo it will not ask for passwd because of now jdoe is a part of admin group but admin groups needs to provide passwd as per

22654286
sudo	passwd
please note that this statement does not have nopasswd all so when user jdoe runs any command as sudo he has to enter the passwd now su is entirely different aspect than sudo
and when you run su ubuntu there is no sudo thing in picture

22656375
bash	zsh
it is not bound by default so add something like this to your configuration bindkey x e edit-command-line now ctrl+x ctrl+e will work the same way as in bash except that the command is not executed before return is struck
if you are using zsh the shell-command is called edit-command-line

22658230
mockito	jmockit
the issue here is that mockito does not allow for mocking static methods getinstance
however jmockit and powermock both do allow for this

22663026
hex	binary
by simply converting the result to hex code via the data is transformed into a form that my database can handle
the problem ended up being that the rjindeal function returns a raw binary string 010100100010100101111101010010101 that my database cannot handle

22663184
nunit	mstest
this isn t a feature that nunit provides
nunit has testcasesourceattribute which helps you to achieve parametrized test cases but in mstest you ll need datasourceattribute which would be in xml file and will be difficult to manage when you have complex logic in method

22665146
super	extends
you are not really overriding the method in super class
here s the overridden method since you re extends from the type parameter b is replaced with beanext type so does the return type and parameter of the method

22667764
jar	war
included dependency is not compiled as jar maven never compiles dependencies
it just takes them as they are and either puts them on the classpath or copies them into the war

22668570
oncreate	onstart
you cant run an animation in oncreate as it is not yet attached to the view so to run a start up animation override this method
try this in you xml anim im not sure if you need to set oneshot for scaling but my onetime startup animation list looks like this android documentation clearly states to use a startup animation you override the above method not onstart or oncreate

22669030
division	modulo
see lisyarus s answer for division in the ring of integers modulo q
if q is not divisible by 3 then both answers should give the same result because pow 4 p - 1 is always divisible by 3 so the rounding-down of integer division won t come into play

22670204
ssl	https
if the data security is not a problem for you then you can use the following option to use insecure communication for ssl
your url has https that s why it doesn t work for you

22670684
build.gradle	gradlew
in your build.gradle file change classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.9.+ to classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.9.1
per the latest in the bug report the issue was that version 0.9.2 was being served from maven central even though all the necessary components weren t yet available and gradlew doesn t register that as a problem

22671324
cdr	cons
the problem the reason is probably that the found object is the first in list in which case delete item list returns cdr list instead of modifying its structure to preserve identity
the important point here is that delete cannot guarantee that when item is the only element of x delete will return nil which cannot be eq to the original cons

22671889
google-chrome	firefox
the thing you re expecting to happen should happen but it doesn t in google-chrome due to a bug
it actually works correctly in firefox

22674721
inline	inlining
context to capture it is done via awaittaskcontinuation which tries to inline the continuation task first then uses threadpool to queue it if inlining is not possible
inlining is determined by isvalidlocationforinlining which never inlines the task on a thread with a custom synchronization context

22676573
cpython	ironpython
doing cpython threading with one or more cpu-bound threads doesn t work well
jython threads fine as does ironpython

22676573
jython	pypy
jython threads fine as does ironpython
and pypy may soon become the best at threading but for now it s not great

22677984
sudo	passwd
if you are on 16.04 14.04 12.04 sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5 if you are on 10.04 sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.1 if you are not sure which mysql-server version is installed you can try dpkg --get-selections | grep mysql-server updated notes for mysql-server-5.7 note that if you are using mysql-server-5.7 you can not use the easier dpkg-reconfigure method shown above
if you know the passwd login and run this alternatively you can use the following sudo mysql_secure_installation this will ask you a series of questions about securing your installation highly recommended including if you want to provide a new root passwd

22677984
sudo	passwd
if you know the passwd login and run this alternatively you can use the following sudo mysql_secure_installation this will ask you a series of questions about securing your installation highly recommended including if you want to provide a new root passwd
if you do not know the root passwd refer to this ubuntu-centric write up on the process

22680504
uiview	subviews
edit ok given that it needs to have the bottom corners not rounded how about if you had a category on uiview with 2 subviews 1 with 4 rounded corners and another layed over the top self bringsubviewtofront which simply covers the rounded view s footer with a non-rounded strip ie a view with equal width and tiny height which is equal to the rounded corner radius
if you have a solid color background then just make both subviews the same

22686615
prng	random
as you have noticed dev random blocks when there is not enough entropy in the pool to service the request but urandom will fall back to a prng if there is not enough
unless you very definitely need dev random you should use dev urandom

22687379
apache	nginx
you can probably change this behavior with some settings at least that is possible in nginx you should either remove the third port definition in apache or add another thin server
thin doesn t know or care about the apache configuration

22689759
ffmpeg	libav
however ffmpeg -i will show you the metatada of the video and you can find the rotate attribute in there
libav s avconv does not support it at least not yet

22690124
udp	tcp
if udp you might drop packets so some clients might see new controls or moved controls that other clients do not
i am guessing you use tcp for guaranteed delivery and congestion control

22692216
prepare	execute
i know this isn t a perfect answer but this is the error which is happening could not prepare statement 1 no such table dbversions somehow this error is hidden a bug in the shim as one of the maintainers i might look into it when i have time
this error occurs because this code is called a bit to soon somewhere around line 1570 this table doesn t exists yet because this code isn t execute yet around line 1494 in short there isn t much you can do about it because it is a bug in the shim delaying the code is i think the only way to fix it on your side

22695899
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the perl eq operator is case-sensitive and i am surprised you think it should behave any differently
to do a case-insensitive comparison you can convert both strings to lower case or upper case - it doesn t matter as long as both are modified in the same way before you do the comparison

22696205
laravel	yii
unless i m misunderstanding your question i would guess this could be done with any framework the above php is simple syntax i would use with laravel which makes stuff like this stupidly easy
i don t know much about yii but i can t imagine why it wouldn t let you do such a simple operation

22700438
inline	inlining
some more explanations cpu will load instructions when it will see it needs them so if function will be inline then cpu can load whole code in one read causing less cpu stalls
but if this function is actually quite large and is not executed very often then inlining it might actually cause more harm because cpu will likely load more cache lines that it is necessary

22700828
icomparable	compareto
you could implement the interface explicitly and then clients would have to cast to icomparable to see the method however note that your class is internal by default so the class is not even public
i m assuming from your error that compareto is not public in your real code

22705013
build.gradle	gradlew
make sure your app build.gradle not project build.gradle
has this dependencies classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.9.+ make sure you installed the lates android sdk

22705390
udp	tcp
the only way to workaround this udp problem is to force the iphone to stay live by creating a long running background task. the result is that the device never suspends which drains the battery very fast
it does not work in udp mode if your sip server can be switched to tcp mode it should work eg for asterisk use transport tcp in your sip.conf . it seems that ios does not allow udp traffic in background mode

22705390
udp	tcp
it does not work in udp mode if your sip server can be switched to tcp mode it should work eg for asterisk use transport tcp in your sip.conf . it seems that ios does not allow udp traffic in background mode
i recommend you to switch to sip tcp tls for having background mode working on linphone for ios

22707101
super	self
you are not overriding a service method so you don t need to use super to find an original method
remove the super call and access the attribute directly on self instead def setactionstatus self status print self.service.getactionrules super is only needed if you need to search the base classes in method resolution order mro for a method or other descriptor object often because the current class has redefined that name

22707101
super	self	super	implements
remove the super call and access the attribute directly on self instead def setactionstatus self status print self.service.getactionrules super is only needed if you need to search the base classes in method resolution order mro for a method or other descriptor object often because the current class has redefined that name
if you need to call a base class foo but the current class implements a foo method then you cannot use self.foo and you need to use super instead

22707101
super	implements
if you need to call a base class foo but the current class implements a foo method then you cannot use self.foo and you need to use super instead
you had to use super for __init__ for example

22709380
implements	extends
looking at views in 3.x you define a view in the plugin.xml and create a class implements viewpart
in an e4 application you define the view part in the application model application.e4xmi and the implements class is a pojo does not extends anything

22711262
armadillo	openblas
comming with cuda 6 at the moment release candidate status there is a true drop-in replacement called nvblas which takes care about gpu interaction and also works in combination with armadillo
you can use nvblas by linking your program agains libnvblas.so however not all blas methods may be available so you have to specify a fallback-blas library like openblas

22714308
webclient	httpwebrequest
alternatively you can find an alternative solution to webclient such as working with the lower-level httpwebrequest class or a 3rd party library
silverlight s webclient doesn t have a method called uploadfileasync

22719749
pillow	libjpeg	pillow	libtiff
4 these two lines are extremely important because they will ignore the errors during installation of pillow without these two lines the setup cannot be finished i am using python 2.7 so you may need to change whatever version you use sudo sed -i -e s -mno-fused-madd g system library frameworks python.framework versions 2.7 lib python2.7 _sysconfigdata.py sudo rm system library frameworks python.framework versions 2.7 lib python2.7 _sysconfigdata.pyc 5 run command sudo python setup.py install done
i confirm that following these steps i can install pillow on mavericks 10.9.2 with xcode 5 1 brew install libtiff libjpeg webp littlecms 2 go to here downalod the zip file and unzip it

22720651
equals	compareto
in particular such a sorted set or sorted map violates the general contract for set or map which is defined in terms of the equals method
it appears that your definition of equals is not consistent with compareto

22721072
aggregate-functions	sum
use aggregate-functions sum on both the columns bookmark and history
if any of them are unset from book marked or history status count will not work but sum works

22721446
centos	linux
systems windows 7 and centos 6.5 using ghostscript 9.14 a little backstory like the op i had been running a ghostscript program on windows to convert pdfs to a series of images
this worked fine until i needed to switch over to linux and run the program and about 5 of the pdfs i needed to convert came up with error cannot decode code stream

22722102
decimal	ieee
but it is representable using 4 decimal digits and a 3-digit exponent
an ieee double-precision floating point value has a 52-bit mantissa not 64-bit. you can think of floating-point numbers as being stored in the binary equivalent of scientific notation

22723347
jscrollpane	jinternalframe
a very basic example of creating a jscrollpane and add a jpanel to its viewport and then add that to your jinternalframe the most important take home message that you should get if you get nothing at all gear your gui classes towards creating jpanels not jframes not jinternalframe
if you can create a decent jpanel then you can put it anywhere it is needed inside of a jframe or jinternalframe or a jscrollpane .

22723411
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
first you should not animated views in viewdidload
you should start animation in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

22726256
inline-functions	inlining
the proper way of doing this in c99 and onward is to merely have an external declaration of an inline-functions in the .c file instead of a definition of it
this will force standalone code to be created for that function so that it will link properly if inlining is not possible for some reason

22726414
boost	eigen
in c++03 either substitute boost enable_if or just define and use your own
the type eigen vector2f is not equal to for any type derived

22729360
realloc	strcpy
and as memory pointed by p is not free-able the realloc fails
to copy the string do strcpy p this is

22729776
realloc	malloc
the man page of realloc states that unless the first argument of realloc is null it must have been returned by an earlier call to malloc calloc or realloc
the above statement passes p to realloc which points to the string literal this is which has static storage duration and is read-only though not const qualified

22730717
wordpress	joomla
simply installing wordpress in a subdirectory of a joomla site will not automatically display wordpress posts in the joomla template
you could develop a wordpress template that matches the joomla one or consider a joomla integrated solution like for what it s worth it is fairly easy to blog within joomla

22730871
sum	coalesce
it looks like your intention is to have the function return the sum of price in the paymentlog table for a given customercode or return 0 if the customercode doesn t exist
if this is correct you could do this if the customercode doesn t exist in the paymentlog table the sum function will return null and you can use either the coalesce or the isnull function to replace the null value with 0

22737641
ssl	https
openssl s_client -connect app.pilotpro.com 443 -capath etc ssl certs gives that is the complete chain which means that your client expects to have positivessl ca 2 as a trusted root-ca in the ca store
but this is not the case because this ca is just an intermediate ca so your https server should send all the intermediate cas on the path to the trusted root-ca

22738506
bash	zsh
instead you can rely on the fact that bash functions are exported as regular variables starting with
zsh does not have a concept of exporting functions

22742605
factors	mean
the number of concurrent connections and the frequency of reads are key factors
you certainly shouldn t usually allocate new buffer for each read if that is what you mean

22744345
octal	hex	octal	decimal
arithmetic is performed on numbers not on octal numbers or decimal numbers or hexadecimal numbers
the octal decimal hex aspect refers only to the written representation

22744575
google-chrome	firefox
this causes errors in google-chrome since google-chrome checks the subprotocol giving the error below websocket connection to ws xmvc.azurewebsites.net home failed error during websocket handshake sent non-empty sec-websocket-protocol header but no response was received it works fine in other browser that does not perform this check
i ve tried ie10 and firefox on this sample site running xsockets on a azure website in my opinion google-chrome is doing the correct thing and azure has a bug

22745273
exponent	modulo
since the security of rsa itself relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers it is infeasible to calculate the private exponent if we haven t constructed the modulo directly from its primes factors which is the real reason that you have to use primes rather than composite numbers
the use of primes numbers isn t about the difficulty of factoring - the most efficient method for factoring large composite numbers like the modulo of an rsa key is the general number field sieve which is much more efficient than simply trying to divide by successive numbers

22745273
primes	modulus
the use of primes isn t about the difficulty of factoring - the most efficient method for factoring large composite numbers like the modulus of an rsa key is the general number field sieve which is much more efficient than simply trying to divide by successive numbers
in fact your statement that it doesn t work with composite numbers isn t really true - whilst rsa is generally performed using two primes it still works more than two distinct primes and since every composite number is a product of primes you could choose two composite numbers providing they are the product of distinct primes and have no common factors and the algorithm will still work

22745273
primes	modulus
in fact your statement that it doesn t work with composite numbers isn t really true - whilst rsa is generally performed using two primes it still works more than two distinct primes and since every composite number is a product of primes you could choose two composite numbers providing they are the product of distinct primes and have no common factors and the algorithm will still work
for example if we choose two composite numbers with distinct prime factors and no common factors this is equivalent to 4-prime rsa so far so good however you go on to say that the primes are your private key which isn t really true either - the private key is actually the combination of the modulus which is also part of the public key and the private exponent which is the number d such that where e is the public exponent which is often just 65537 and phi is euler s totient function

22745487
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
opengl error logs for opengl errors as called unimplemented opengl-es api it s not an error but a statement
you should enable it in your manifest you can read this answer if you re using glsurfaceview inside homeactivity.java it might help you 3

22746165
memcpy	memmove
output the string abcdefghij actual memcpy output aabcdefghi implemented memcpy output aaaaaaaaaa implemented memmove output aabcdefghi but you can now understand why memmove will take care of overlapping issue
the code given in the links for memcpy seems to confuse me a bit as it does not give the same output when i implemented it using the below example

22751658
ssl	https
that being said apps are ssl-enabled already and can be accessed simply by using https but you would want to go with the ssl endpoint option when you want to establish the trusted relationship with your clients
both ways are as secure as the other but with the wildcard ssl also referred to as a shared ssl certificate the trust is established between the client via their browser and heroku not your app site

22755351
implements	extends
but you can manualy export to datatable like this edit how to implements copytodatatable where the generic type t is not a datarow
the extension-method datatableextensions extends generic where base-class of t is datarow

22757646
super	self
however in your comments you also write i want to add a target with a method implements in super class which suggests you are trying to use an api which uses the target action pattern nscontrol and others
if the method you wish to call is not overridden in the current class then simply passing self as the target will invoke the superclass method

22762892
realloc	malloc
use the pointer returned by realloc
if the old location does not have enough contiguous space for the larger block requested by the user realloc tries to find a new block of the required size like malloc copies the elements from the old block and frees the old block

22762892
realloc	malloc
if the old location does not have enough contiguous space for the larger block requested by the user realloc tries to find a new block of the required size like malloc copies the elements from the old block and frees the old block
if realloc fails the old pointer is valid and must be freed

22770844
spaces	delimiter
it is difficult to be certain as you don t show what result you do get and it is unclear what until i try to insert a spaces everything works means but.
01 s1 pic x 10 value space. where s1 had no value and presuming you are not using a compiler which sets a default value for a picture the delimiter by spaces will take the whole 10 bytes the values which a added by the string can never appear in the s1 unless it starts with a value of spaces

22770844
spaces	delimiter
01 s1 pic x 10 value space. where s1 had no value and presuming you are not using a compiler which sets a default value for a picture the delimiter by spaces will take the whole 10 bytes the values which a added by the string can never appear in the s1 unless it starts with a value of spaces
with the value of spaces your four strings should work

22771292
implements	extends
perhaps it should look like this note also that and similar should implements not the raw type expression
similarly should extends not operation

22772214
serializable	deserialization
it does not need to because the lambda function knows its size. so std function does not lend itself to serializable but works well as a blueprint
i followed what it does simplified it a lot i only wanted to serialize lambdas not the myriad other callable things saved the size of the closure value in a size_t and added methods for deserialization

22773893
inline	inlining
this is broadly true for pragmas like inline as they are merely hints to the compiler that this function s body should be inline wherever it is called in order to open up new optimization opportunities
haskell semantics gives us guarantees about when such inlining transformations do not change the meaning of the program thus the choice the compiler makes about whether or not to inline has no effect on the meaning of the program so long as it doesn t violate the assumptions of those guarantees

22774258
shadowing	named
then on the subject of shadowing and obscuring a local variable 14.4 formal parameter 8.4.1 15.27.1 exception parameter 14.20 and local class 14.3 can only be referred to using a simple named not a qualified named 6.2
some declarations are not permitted within the scope of a local variable formal parameter exception parameter or local class declaration because it would be impossible to distinguish between the declared entities using only simple named

22778422
ucma	ucwa
you could write a web proxy to a ucma service you ve written which would achieve the same thing but this wouldn t be able to do voice video either
the only way to do client-less lync in the browser is with ucwa

22778442
build.gradle	gradlew
it would be easy to additionally check for the correct gradlew version in build.gradle but typically this shouldn t be necessary
you cannot configure the gradlew version in build.gradle

22778442
build.gradle	gradlew
you cannot configure the gradlew version in build.gradle
instead you ll have to configure the gradlew wrapper as explained in the link you gave

22778828
ssl	https
i didn t have any issue getting my cordova app to connect to the ssl server simply by forcing all of my tags to use https instead of http
honestly there isn t a great reason not to use ssl outside of ease of setup and the cost of a signed certificate

isotope	masonry
ps there are some other alternatives exists for the masonry one is isotope and the other is a css-driven tool called salvattore
please send me the url first you can use masonry you must embed in in your website and you can use css techniques to fix the issue you can see the demo in here and please note that you can define a class for those object and interact with them using css code you can define specific height for them please note that the images are not loaded correctly in your web page and you have to fix them first if you have any other question please feel free to ask me

22784266
google-chrome	firefox
phantomjs is an headless version of a webkit browser such older versions of google-chrome so it doesn t launch any browser but itself
for firefox have a look to slimerjs while for internet explorer your only solution is triflejs

22786825
oncreate	setcontentview
should be right after oncreate statement. you getting null pointer here rl.setbackground bd as the layout is not yet initialized and you are trying access its components your relativelayout
so move this setcontentview r.layout.touchanddrag

22787566
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist
when i m only exposing an ienumerable interface i will not allow the consuments to modify the enumeration otherwise i d expose an icollection or ilist
return a new enumeration one short implementation could be using linq and use it like for non-generic enumerations and to have the second one as a new except -linq-style operation on the ienumerable interface you might define something like this and use it like edit use 100 ifs to check for the real type sounds like a bad idea as the caller can give you an own ienumerable implementation and you can t do anything against it

22794151
uilabel	uibutton
the problem is that the uilabel does not get the touch events because it simply does not handle touch events by design it s just for showing text
you might want to create a subclass of a uibutton but this is not a good idea since it s kind of a cluster class

22795112
apache	nginx
if not here are a couple other common headers i ve seen x-client-ip apache x-real-ip nginx
if you re behind a proxy you should use x-forwarded-for it is an ietf draft standard with wide support the x-forwarded-for field is supported by most proxy servers including squid apache mod_proxy pound haproxy varnish cache ironport web security appliance avanu webmux arraynetworks radware s appdirector and alteon adc adc-vx and adc-va f5 big-ip blue coat proxysg cisco cache engine mcafee web gateway phion airlock finjan s vital security netapp netcache jetnexus crescendo networks maestro web adjuster and websense web security gateway

22795556
ciimage	uiimage
it doesn t convert a uiimage into a ciimage or derive a ciimage from a uiimage
it merely provides a reference to the ciimage that is already the basis of this uiimage

22795556
ciimage	uiimage
it merely provides a reference to the ciimage that is already the basis of this uiimage
but this uiimage does not have a ciimage basis

22795556
ciimage	uiimage
but this uiimage does not have a ciimage basis
it is a bitmap cgimage not a filter output ciimage

22797672
google-chrome	safari
if it plays in google-chrome then it is not a mime type server issue
having an html5 doctype could also help safari will not play .webm or .ogg video files

22803804
portrait	landscape
but not really. in fact it s not orientation changed in my case but screensize changed that is fired as a configurationchange event when the nexus 5 go to sleep mode and when your activity is in portrait
it s not happening on nexus 7 because its normal mode is landscape when going to sleep so no configurationchange is fired

22810980
udp	tcp
even in cases such as udp where multiple applications can access the same port the data is handed out first-come first-serve
udp is also designed with minimum overhead so there isn t even an opportunity to check the queue like you hypothetically could with tcp

i double checked this behavior on firefox 3.0 firefox 6.0 text-overflow is not supported

22813425
hex	binary
if you use elf or coff or intel hex or srec or some binary format that includes addresses as well as data and does not require padding between the segments in the file then your files wills stay small.
so even if you have only a single byte of data in the data segment you need to have 0x10000000-0x00900000 + amount of data bytes in the .bin file...the raw binary file format does not have any address information therefore it needs to cover all loadable segments and pad with fill in between so you get that size of a file 0x10000000-0x00900000 + amount of data

22815200
clang	llvm
on a clean 10.9 install with xcode 5.1 you shouldn t have gcc at all though it s been completely replaced by clang
the compiler that comes with llvm is clang not gcc

22816241
knitr	latex
this seems like a reasonable concern but it doesn t happen to me with r-devel 3.1.0 knitr 1.5
also logically it seems as though it shouldn t happen since the contents of code chunks are evaluated before latex sees the file

22816630
implements	extends
the arguments that are supposed to explain this have been phrased as there could be class b2 extends b implements i and the compiler knows here that a and b are not related these are very true but it doesn t explain why the compiler knows that these two classes aren t related and not why it can t know if an interface has been implements
in the end these two situations should be rather similar if it can check at compile time if two classes have a relation then it should be able to check at compile time if an interface is implements in that class since both of these situations have their information available at compile time

22818137
oncreate	setcontentview
your problem is not in asynctask. in your oncreate bundle method you did not setcontentview int
assuming that your progressbar and mycustomview are defined in your_activity_layout.xml resource file you should add a line setcontentview r.layout.your_activity_layout.xml

22818463
alloca	malloc
on the matter of disregarding the standard there is one other thing alloca it s a bad word but i d be remiss not to mention it
unlike a char vla and like malloc alloca returns a void pointer to untyped space

22818463
alloca	malloc
unlike a char vla and like malloc alloca returns a void pointer to untyped space
since it has roughly the same semantics as malloc its use doesn t require any of the gymnastics listed above

22819227
fgets	atoi
fgets stops when either n-1 characters are read the newline character is read or the end-of-file is reached whichever comes first
so here fgets is reading more than one integer at a time from file so atoi is not getting the integers in file too

22823461
google-chrome	firefox
- comment of kevin b definitely suggest cross-browser os testing this before running with it i ve had issues in the past with linking to images for example with an erroneous instead of in the path working in google-chrome but not firefox
here are some results i got so far firefox version 28.0 yes sends two slashes curl and i hope therefore also programs using libcurl yes sends two slashes wget yes sends two slashes chromium version 33.0 yes sends two slashes unfortunately i have no access to more browsers now

22827128

it works in bash because of strong quoting feels like it also works in fish but does not work in zsh and sh
if you have bash your can run your script in sh or zsh with bash -c + escape all-the-rest-escaped +

if you modify an object before calling dbset.attach ... the modifications won t be persistent to db when you call savechages so attaching an object as is before modification calling dbset.attach ... and then modifying the object is the way to make ef aware of the modifications
not threadsafe as it contains a transient object dbcontext

22841325
build.gradle	gradlew
i verified that the problem indeed was in my config by testing with gradlew plugin versions 0.8.1 0.9.0 and 0.9.3 with my changed build.gradle
indeed changes in the plugin were not what fixed this even if 0.9.0 was the version that started giving me the useful error message. possibly the root cause here was using old project structure and build.gradle that was originally generated by eclipse

22843329
ssl	https
if security is a big concern basic authentication is not a sufficiently good choice -- even if you re using ssl
even if you re using ssl an attacker who can control or get access to your initial request can pretend to be the desired https web service and intercept your traffic easily then get a hold of your api credentials

22845324
queue	fifo
sqs does not guarantee order of items in the queue due to its geographically redundant nature
it can t even guarantee fifo

22847513
bash	subshell
edit in fact using a shell this way the parentheses are no longer necessary for command grouping and in fact would be less efficient due to spawning an additional subshell so this would suffice flock -n lockfile.lock bash -c command list
since the parentheses there are part of the shell syntax and not commands in their own right you would have to do something like this flock -n lockfile.lock bash -c command list depending on what your exact set of commands are the necessary quoting escaping might be a slight additional challenge but if that gets too hard then just put your commands in a proper shell script and call that instead of the bash -c .

22848840
paperclip	fog
expiring urls for rackspace only made it into fog somewhat recently -- v1.18.0 -- so if you re using an older versioning you may need to upgrade fog to take advantage of them bundle upgrade fog paperclip also supports generating obfuscated urls which looks interesting but would be less secure since the server wouldn t expire it
as it happens cloud files also supports the generation of temporary urls and it appears that paperclip does allow you to make use of it

22849256
equals	compareto
you have the criteria listed in your requirements so implementing equals will involve comparing those fields of this and p and determining if the two are equals or not
the strategies for compareto are similar

22849526
serializable	deserialization
this includes types that are not marked with one of the datacontractattribute serializableattribute collectiondatacontractattribute or enummemberattribute attributes or marked as serializable by any other means such as ixmlserializable
in your case to omit the usercode property - just do not mark with any serialization attributes added as you want deserialization to behave differently from serialization i see 2 ways to achieve this a described here how can i prevent a datamember from being serialized the disadvantage is that it is not thread-safe

22853324
nstextview	nstextstorage
it s not entirely obvious from the docs but the proper way to manipulate an nstextview is by manipulating the nstextstorage directly
also nstextstorage is a subclass of nsmutableattributedstring

22858957
division	addition	division	multiplication
note that trial division uses division at each step a slow operation on a modern processor when compared to addition or multiplication while the sieve of eratosthenes does not
so the trial division method will likely have a larger constant

22859242
keystore	jks
to create a keystore you can either choose the bouncycastle keystore or from android 4.3 the new androidkeystore based on openssl decdicated to store app-private keys more details here and if you have a jceks keystore you will have to convert it to bks format with keytool keytool -importkeystore -srcstoretype jceks -srckeystore my.keystore -srckeypass my_password -destprovidername bc -deststoretype bks -destkeypass my_new_password -destkeystore my.bks
android does not include the sunjce security provider and therefore jceks is not a supported keystore type neither is the older jks format

22859612
des	aes
do not use a keygenerator use a secretkeyfactory note that des is not a secure algorithm
consider using aes or triple des desede

22860859
profiling	debugging
when you see iphone developer in the code signing identity that means xcode will automatically select a matching identity to sign the app it doesn t mean that no profiling is selected
from what i can see it looks like iphone developer is chosen for both debugging and release configurations which will likely cause a problem because you cannot submit a developer signed app to the app store it must be signed with a distribution certificate and distribution profiling

22860859
profiling	debugging
from what i can see it looks like iphone developer is chosen for both debugging and release configurations which will likely cause a problem because you cannot submit a developer signed app to the app store it must be signed with a distribution certificate and distribution profiling
you will need to ensure that you have created a distribution certificate and profiling to sign your app with before archiving it and submission it via xcode

22861392
jsonb	hstore
imo there is no significant reason for not using jsonb once it is available if you are working with machine-readable data
hstore is more of a wide column storage type it is a flat non-nested dictionary of key-value pairs always stored in a reasonably efficient binary format a hash table hence the name

22862985
punctuation	words
i suggest making everything one case or the other and removing all punctuation before iterating through words
firstly pick better variable names secondly you can simplify your first check finally you could use while and slicing to move characters from the start of the words to the end note that this still doesn t quite do what you want eth appleway isway extremelyway asty.t eat

22866608
build.gradle	gradlew
occasionally you ll need to adjust build.gradle to generate eclipse settings in some very specific way
there is gradlew support for eclipse if you are using sts but i m not sure how good it is

22866846
bash	tcsh
use of to combine stderr and stdout works only in bash and sh
it does not for csh or tcsh

22869000
comparator	comparable
check out the official tutorial on comparator see the comparator section towards the bottom not the comparable part at the top
use the arrays.sort that takes a comparator then depending on the selection create a that compares two event s based on the selected sort key then if the user selects event number arrays.sort thearray new eventnumbercomparator

22869760
profiler	gprof
you need a different profiler one that stack-samples on wall-time is insensitive to recursion and reports inclusive presence on stack by line of code not just function. one that impresses me is zoom
gprof only works on functions that have been compiled with -pg which means you need specially-built libraries

22874124
xsl-fo	xslt
remember the xslt was initially chapter 2 of the xsl-fo specification in fact it still is but by reference not by inclusion
when working with xsl-fo there are many cases where if-then is needed not if-then-else

22874124
xsl-fo	xslt
when working with xsl-fo there are many cases where if-then is needed not if-then-else
for example consider adding a default property in a literal result element and then overriding it since if-then-else is already covered by this requirement meant it was necessary to create an xslt equivalent to if-then which is tighter than a choose with a single when

22874751
build.gradle	gradlew
i have mentioned global sourceset section in global common.gradle file so that i dont have to include common tasks configurations for test integrationtest etc tasks in each project s build.gradle file
now because srcdir for each of them is set to not_valid_value at global level my assumption is this invalid srcdir value will be either overwritten by the actual valid srcdir value when gradlew build system will read sourcesets section ... from each individual project s build.gradle file s sourceset section for main test etc or they will be clubbed together as a list entry main srcdir will become src java not_valid_value --- which when i printed in common.gradle and ran project gradlew build printed valid clubbed value println println sourcesets.main.alljava.srcdirs is set to + sourcesets.main.alljava.srcdirs println value printed don t know if quotes will be required as gradlew printed it fine thus when i m using sourcesets.main.alljava.srcdirs for sourcedirectories variable in jacocotestreport task its passing and not giving me an error as i have mentioned in my post even though srcdir variable for main java is src java not_valid_value at build time one from common.gradle and one from project s build.gradle sourceset section

22883555
uiview	subviews
essentially you re ending up with a ccoupondetailviewcontroller view with a 0x0 frame but since you haven t specified that you want your uiview to clip its subviews the portions of your ccoupondetailviewcontroller view are not actually on top of their view but visible and hanging over the uiview s bounds
the reason they aren t selectable is because they re not actually within the uiview

22883595
debian	linux
afaict that bug report is closed solved but as you appear to be on the latest version of debian i m not sure why you don t have the fix
i m a little out of my depth here because i personally use arch linux which doesn t even use sysvinit any more

22883971
super	extends
super extends classtype as you see extends only refers to a direct superclass
in the example in head first java dog doesn t extends object because its direct superclass is canine

22884107
super	implements
also change your activity.onbackpressed to call super if the slidingdrawer isn t opened
you re overriding activity.onkeydown which activity already overrides when implements activity.onbackpressed then returning false for keyevent.keycode_back which indicates that you have not handled this event and it should continue to be propagated

22884982
fgets	realloc
your code is trying to do the former but you probably meant to do the latter in which case getline may be easier to use than mucking about with fgets
obligatory nitpick when coding in c do not cast the return value of malloc nor realloc

22886060
portrait	landscape
you could turn the device to portrait and the conroller would rotate accordingly
once in landscape it is fixed in landscape and cannot be rotated any more. when you go back then to your portrait controller it would be presented in landscape .

22887419
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie and google-chrome because they define a window.event
firefox does not

22889607
scheme	racket
if you have an expression a scheme system will not evaluate everything at the same time but in parts
the order is not specified in scheme but lets imagine it s from left to right i think racket always do left to right you do the continuation to that would be to compute 10 2 then + result1 result2

22889607
scheme	racket
the order is not specified in scheme but lets imagine it s from left to right i think racket always do left to right you do the continuation to that would be to compute 10 2 then + result1 result2
the way a scheme system can do this is by transforming your code to continuation passing style before execution

22890404
ssl	https
let me dynamically server ssl certificates via domain header there is no domain header so i guess you mean the host header in the http request. but this will not work because https is http encapsulated inside ssl therefore you first have to do your ssl layer ssl handshake which requires the certificates then comes the http layer but the host header is inside the http layer in former times you would need to have a single ip address for each ssl certificate
current browsers do support sni server name indication which sends the expected target host already inside the ssl layer

22890783
ssl	https
however common ssl usage does not include client machine authentication
fro example your web browser checks for paypal s authenticity when you go to their https webpage

22892054
jar	war
if you re deploying into a java ee application server that entire jar is already provided by the application server and can be omitted from the war file
you can accomplish this by putting it into the provided scope that makes that dependency available for compilation and test execution but will not package it into the war

22892785
prepare	execute
the prepare phase passes the query to the server which parses the query and prepares an execution plan
when you bind the variables and execute the statement the variables are passed to the server and substituted in the execution plan not the query

22894330
division	subtract
now with a square root the method is very similar to division where you guess the first digit then the second digit and so on and subtract things
it s just that for a square root you subtract slightly different things but not that different calculating a square root can be done in a way very similar to a division except that with each digit added the divisor changes

22895372
factors	mean
following henrick s suggestion you can create a new variable with nas for the default color and character strings factors for non-default colors the first one happens to be red option 2 find the name of the default dark gray color you like
this is not the default color if you simply remove the scale_fill_manual line in your original code in that case you get four different pastels so i assume you mean the grey color produced by the code chunk just above this paragraph for those bars where

22897333
portrait	landscape
if the pitch is positive you re in reverse portrait and if the pitch is negative you re in portrait
if your device doesn t have a magnetometer you can use the x-axis and y-axis values of the accelerometer to differentiate between landscape and reverse landscape

22898117
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
quote from tsvetko html5-desktop-notifications the icon that will be set as a custom overlay for ie and notification displayed from google-chrome running on windows
note that icon by default is not required for google-chrome safari firefox but is required for ie

22898117
google-chrome	firefox
once again - safari and google-chrome on macos does not allow icon to be set
for firefox mobile the icon is always firefox icon

22898400
client-side	server-side
do the whole client-side validation for human users but repeat the same validation in the server-side so no one will be able to bypass your rules
client-side validation is easy to bypass but server-side validation should not

22898400
client-side	server-side
client-side validation is easy to bypass but server-side validation should not
i mean that client-side validation may work with human users but spam bots may send requests to your server bypassing your form or they even don t understand javascript

22901192
dns	spf
3 if you just changed your dns it may take hours days for that to propagate
not everyone respects ttl especially low ones. 4 some servers are configured to drop mail if the source or destination spf isn t set up properly

22903063
serializable	deserialization
this is a major enhancement over the above code it is essential that the serializable code be split into separate save and load functions
otherwise the deserialization code will not resize the matrix to hold the original data

22906875
udp	tcp
typically games using udp have an application level protocol on-top so they can send some messages reliably and others not
if they wanted to send everything reliably they would be better off using tcp

22908719
google-chrome	safari
somehow the apple developers site is having some issues with google-chrome
use safari and not google-chrome at least that seemed to be my issue

22908951
division	multiplication
the compiler knows it can perform shifts instead of multiplication division
you can use a sequence of and to get the remainder and to perform the division note sorry for possible syntax errors vb is not my language. however i don t think the source of outofmemoryexception are these trivial operations

22909974
comparator	comparable
the docs merely warn for this situation caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set or sorted map if you have one ordering based on date and another ordering based on date+time you should simply implement multiple comparator
for comparable the docs strongly advice against this situation it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals

22911123
prepare	execute
instead prepare statements of mysqli or pdo_mysql extension should be used to ward off sql injection attacks
this is because your query failed to execute because the username is not enclosed within quotes

22911310
innodb	myisam
third possible failure is that a transaction only can be rollbacked completely if all tables involved are capable of transactions like innodb or bdb
if you have myisam tables in there the insert statements will not get rolled back

22914502
required	placeholder
first thing to note is that you do not need to have this in your views this is only required in your layout
remember that renderbody is the placeholder for your view markup

22915378
ssl	https
openshift redirects wp-admin to https 2. upgrade to the bronze plan and the purchase a custom ssl certificate and install it you are getting that error from jetpack because the ssl certificate is not valid for your custom domain only for your app-domain.rhcloud.com address
you have a couple of options 1. disable using ssl for the admin in your wp-config.php file

22917977
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu i have not observed this behaviour in redhat linux the value for gettimeofday is updated before the value for time thus it is possible to get inconsistent values kernel updates gettimeofday you query gettimeofday you query time kernel updates time swapping your calls around gives consistent results
both time and gettimeofday are implemented as so called linux vsyscalls

22919223
postgresql	mysql
or were you using mysql on heroku too most people use postgresql
for information on how to get the data off ve your heroku database see here and here the relevant line is here now you ll have a postgresql backup file that will be all the sql commands needed to recreate the backup with all your data you would think that since sql is a standard and mysql uses that too you could just do unluckily you re often not that lucky i would recommend trying it you never know with simple enough database structures and you will then need to use a converter this question recommends using pg2mysql

22919391
prepare	execute
there is a pdo function pdo quote to escape strings independently from the prepare method but as the doc says if you are using this function to build sql statements you are strongly recommended to use pdo prepare to prepare sql statements with bound parameters instead of using pdo quote to interpolate user input into an sql statement
prepared statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query

22920758
bower	npm
bower is a package manager that aims at front-end web projects
you need npm and nodejs to install bower and to execute it though bower packages are not meant specifically for nodejs but rather for the browser environment

22922510
prepare	execute
and call the setter methods on the prepare statement to assign a value to each parameter
this will look something like that will execute the sql insert into member values a1 a2 notice the parameter indexes start from 1 not 0

22927680
subtraction	addition
see the specification addition subtraction
because the subtraction operator is not ambiguous and is only defined for numbers

22928708
http	spdy
hostname myversion-dot-myapplication.appspot.com was not verified the http certificate presented by the remote peer is not trusted by any of the root certificates on the requesting device
stream was reset cancel the spdy stream was reset by either the local client or the remote peer

22933870
realloc	malloc
as above - no - it s not possible to copy-construct destruct objects with any amount of care without changes to the realloc api
new and delete are typically layered atop the c library allocation functions ala malloc realloc free possibly with an extra layer for small-object optimisations that use one malloc -ed region for quickly satisfying many small new requests

22938202
gson	jackson
i am not familiar with gson but there is a discussion about the two you might want to take a look at
you could also use jackson which is in maven

22939890
jar	war
open project structure- libraries- new project library- from java select your jar or the thirdparty dir itself may work
go to modules- dependencies- add library and select your new library go to artifacts- output layout if your library is not already in the right pane do add library files and select your new library you should be able to just double click this library in the right pane this should result in the library showing up in the left pane as project library under web-inf lib also verify that your artifacts- output layout- type is web application exploded your artifacts- output layout- output directory is your war dir project- compiler output is your war web-inf classes dir doing this should cause intellij to move the gson.jar to the web-inf lib dir when building

22941884
mp3	wav
i m not entirely sure sound#extract writes mp3 data to the bytearray
i was always under the impression that as3 stuck to uncompressed wav data when writing audio data but i could be wrong

22945024
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
assuming the command foo can be found along the command path the following would need to be added to the appropriate configuration file for the sh bash and ksh shells for the csh and tcsh shells for the zsh shell the command path does not have to be used
say the command foo is stored in the directory bin then the above would become for the sh bash and ksh shells for the csh and tcsh shells for the zsh shell all of the above was tested using apple s osx 10.9.2. note when copying the above code be careful about deleting any spaces

22948177
bash	zsh
bash does not provide what you want
if your can control the caller s shell you could try using zsh instead

22948831
move	drag
if your main window does not have decorations then the user cannot drag anything so can t move or resize window
for moving window you could provide a widget to move window simplest case is handle mouse click event on that widget transitions the window to moving in this case the window s mouse move handler moves the window according to location of mouse

22948831
move	drag
alternately you could interpret a mouse click on background of your app as a window drag then you would derive and handle mouse events to move window
to resize you ll have to create some item in your window that user can drag to resize unless you want to use scrollwheel but that would not follow standard interface design

22950894
mongodb	bson
is a change in mongodb 2.6.0 no longer accepting bson object in the clause
this particular issue is being tracker as a php driver bug at the mongodb php driver will serialize an php array into bson array accepted by the in operator when the php array is sequential numerically indexed starting from 0 this means that if you have an array like and then you you actually wind up with which does not start with index 0

22950894
mongodb	bson
this particular issue is being tracker as a php driver bug at the mongodb php driver will serialize an php array into bson array accepted by the in operator when the php array is sequential numerically indexed starting from 0 this means that if you have an array like and then you you actually wind up with which does not start with index 0
the mongodb php driver therefore converts this into a bson object.

22952020
shadowing	named
you overwrote the binding see variable shadowing to the types module in this line after that types is no longer pointing to the module but to a list
just use another named in all the assignments update i think you overdesigned the solution except for the first line this is not a good fit for using regular expressions

22956325
innodb	myisam
for completeness here s how you can do it with a prepared statement although if it s a innodb table i wouldn t recommend to do a on it repeatedly
unlike myisam it doesn t store a row count in the table

22964683
imagemagick	magick++
after installing the font libraries you ll need to re-configure imagemagick remember to make clean and re-install
for the magick++ tutorial the following line is a bit confusing as it involves a few wildcards that you may not be familiar with

22965094
ubuntu	debian
if you don t know how to install it from binary check this resource on ubuntu for other optimisation methods you can check out toy image_optim
you can install pngout by installing the binary . currently there isn t any deb file for debian ubuntu as far as i know download the binaries from here and install it

22965400
udp	tcp
tcp is a stateful protocol unlike udp it requires user end computer to be involved in every step of connection and it will not work with two separate clients trying to communicate with one server
some alternatives using udp streaming instead of course you ll have to change both server client and iptable rule

22965636
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i hit the same issue on google-chrome 33.0.1750.152 on mac os x
i could not reproduce the issue on firefox and safari and after two days of suspecting the server side for dropping the last write before closing the socket inspecting packet traces etc. i tried converting the short blob to text using filereader

22966549
sudo	passwd
also if you are on a unix based system do not make the root account login accessible it should always be sudo only
passwd you tell your users to make good passwd to avoid getting hacked do the same

22967695
g++	gcc
if that does not work look at the output of g++ -v on my system i get this in this output you are looking for a directory following --prefix
add lib64 to the end of that prefix and you ll have your library directory. on my system it s usr local gcc-4.8.2 so i need the linker to look in usr local gcc-4.8.2 lib64 to find my libstdc++ . so i run programs like this if you don t want to set your ld_library_path before running your programs you should build them with -wl -rpath like this you can use ldd on a program to see where the shared libraries it is linked to are found here a.out is a program i built with the option -wl -rpath usr local gcc-4.8.2 lib64 so the linker looks there first and finds the libstdc++ that goes with my gcc 4.8.2 install

22967962
clang	llvm
from the clang source code llvm tools clang lib driver tools.cpp comes this code on about line 2825 of rev 205900 as you can see by the last few lines any -g option which hasn t already been eliminated -g7 gets transformed into a plain -g within this routine clang constructjob
i don t know of any plans to change this but i m also not a clang developer

22970567
fgets	strtod
reading a line of numbers spaced with white-space except n and then finally terminated with n is possible with scanf and ungetc but not worthy of coding except as an exercise as using fgets and sscanf strtod is far better
but fgets uses a char array banned by the post

22971980
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
the error indicates that somewhere in your program you are passing the address which is not allocated and recieved by malloc calloc realloc dynamic call
free expects the memory which is received by malloc calloc realloc

22974134
config	ini
an easy option is java.util.properties which not only supports loading config data from and xml files but also directly supports the hierarchical defaults you describe
for example note that properties does not have built-in support for grouped hierarchical properties an xml tree or an ini file with sections but will generally get the job done in many cases

22978028
udp	tcp
changing it to 80 say clears up the einval as in here port 80 here is not http but instead for udp is google s experimental quic chromium
wikipedia states that port 0 is for udp reserved and for tcp is unofficially reserved as a programming technique for specifying system-allocated dynamic ports

22982681
udp	tcp
as its name suggests tidtcpclient only supports tcp not udp
udp 224.0.0.252 5355 is used by microsoft in modern windows versions for link local multicast name resolution defined in rfc 4795 as part of their hostname-to-ip lookups when conventional dns is not available

22983635
gtk	cairo
the problem was i was trying to install gtk and pygtk without installing cairo and pango
so pygtk skipped building gtk packages because it did not find any cairo package

22987346
udp	tcp
hei that s helped me the thing is that typically sip signalling uses udp as a transfer protocol but apple allows persistent connections only with tcp protocol. so here are the steps 1 figure out if your sip server supports sip signalling with tcp for example sip2sip does ekiga doesn t
2 get rid of udp connection in pjsua insert somewhere 3 if you use outbound proxy put

22987471
ssl	https
another way would be to have separate ssl certificates for both http.test.com and https.test.com but for the above reasons you must then have them on separate ip addresses
that is not possible because when the client first connects to the https port of the server there is an ssl handshake that results in the server certificate being presented to the client before the client is even allowed to tell the server which url it is trying to access

22989922
qthread	qobject
also unless you re wanting to change how qt handles threads you should not be inheriting from qthread
instead create a worker object that inherits from qobject and move that to the new thread

22990545
union	distinct
columns that are formed by using the set operators union union all crossjoin except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns being modified are not affected by group by having or distinct clauses

22991167
bellman-ford	dijkstra
the main problem with a negative cycle is that you can just keep traversing it reducing the cost of the path thus there exists no finite shortest path to some vertices so it s arguable whether bellman-ford actually failed or not - it can detect these cycles
dijkstra s algorithm will have a similar problem with negative cycles not to mention the more general problem of dealing with negative edge weights

23000498
set	bag
collect a sample of websites some of them are squatters and some of them are not this is called the train set
use the bag of words model or the tf-idf model or any other model as your features-space and train a classifier using some supervised learning algorithm svm decision trees ...

23001471
spaces	delimiter
this should be what you re looking for also don t use s when you re just looking for spaces as it s possible you ll match a newline or some other whitespace character
simple spaces aren t delimiter or special characters in regex so it s fine to just type the space

23007443
ecj	javac
it uses the ecj compiler this is definitely a bug in the eclipse compiler as maven uses the standard javac to compile that s why it s working
eclipse compiler is not the standard javac

23009371
udp	tcp
tcp udp are elaborate protocols rules that govern how the two applications connect exchange data and terminate the connection
udp does not have the connect terminating phase btw. its interesting

23010775
prepare	execute
if you have to learn anyway please do learn prepare statements instead
this is the dangerest thing ever i don t want to have written this this is dangerous not only because of mysql_real_escape_string but also because of preg_replace with the e execute flag

23014701
lz77	lzw
deflate is a combination of lz77 and huffman coding
a scsu bridges the gap between an 8-bit based lzw and a 16-bit encoded unicode text by removing the extra redundancy that is part of the encoding sequences of every other byte being the same and not a redundancy in the content

23015649
sum	coalesce
so you would have to replace the sum over as backlog part thus however sql server even in version 2012 is not capable of executing this which i consider a dbms flaw
y.ano and y.mes or coalesce opened.ano closed.ano and coalesce opened.mes closed.mes for the first statement should be considered constants for the inner query because the evaluation is done per outer record month but they are not

23016287
inline	inlining
therefore if the method can not be inline in will not be inline no matter whether you attach the attribute or not
as far as i can tell from a bit of searching it is indeed the case that all available versions of the jit compiler are unable to perform inlining in methods with try catch blocks because this adds additional exit points besides the usual return statements and the end of a void method

23017821
ienumerable	iqueryable
first scenario while it is true that query_1 is an implicit ienumerable t it s more important that it returns an actual iqueryable t
any call you make on an iqueryable until it s truly converted to only an ienumerable is added to an underlying expression and is not called against the data source nor are any results stored in memory

23017821
ienumerable	iqueryable
any call you make on an iqueryable until it s truly converted to only an ienumerable is added to an underlying expression and is not called against the data source nor are any results stored in memory
once you make an executing call such as toarray first single etc the iqueryable s expression is converted to a sql call and the results are placed in an ienumerable

23022432
implements	extends
means that any class which actually implements this trait has to extends a
the error message class myint cannot be instantiated because it does not conform to its self-type v1.myint with int from comments basically says that myint doesn t extends int

23023532
gradle	ivy
there isn t currently a gradle api for downloading from a url
you can implement this using ant groovy or if you do want to benefit from gradle s dependency resolution caching features by pretending it s an ivy repository with a custom artifact url

23024924
comparator	comparable
this doesn t substantially change the answer but in effect you are now effectively talking about implementing rather and the method is effectively comparator object
a comparable type is a reference type whose class c implements the interface

23029049
google-chrome	firefox
i do not have an environment to test this right now but the first thing i would like to do is to print the while making a request using firefox then google-chrome
if for google-chrome the value is false you have to debug why

23029521
serializable	deserialization
i d write methods that handle the serializable
this allows full control over the state of the class as well as the deserialization and avoids potentially copying over fields that aren t supposed to be members of your class. it s a bit more effort than t.j

23031701
hex	binary
there are also situations where trailing linefeeds get trimmed and iirc some early versions of bash couldn t handle delete characters hex 7f .
basically don t try to store binary data as in stage2_hash or pass it as arguments as in . xor.sh in the shell

23032321
prng	random
for linux systems dev random returns the most entropy dev urandom is itself a seeded prng and may be used directly by applications
dev random however blocks if not enough entropy is available i would advice dev urandom for most purposes

23034972
daemons	systemd
to properly daemonize a go process one is advised to use a wrapper process such as daemons or run it under an an advanced substitute for the init superserver such as systemd or upstart or a standalone supervisor such as runit monit and others mdash
in which case the process has no braindead requirement to be a true unix daemons and may behave like a normal process does not perform double- fork plus

23035327
mongoose	mongojs
is just not possible to do it with mongojs for the same reason you can t do it with mongodb you have to use some sort of black magic to do them and this is when mongoose excells
to be honest i tried to avoid mongoose because i thought it was hard to use defining a model was just a waste of time when with mongojs you don t need to

23036350
bower	npm
if you don t have bower installed run npm install -g bower first
confusingly the grunt-bower-install task that comes with angular-fullstack doesn t install bower components

23036819
arraylist	treeset
then we could use treeset to sort an array faster than the method made specifically to sort it the saving gotten from not having to insert into the arraylist is fairly small
if this were consistently true java developers would simply replace that method with treeset wouldn t they

23038361
cstdio	iostream
eof is defined in stdio.h cstdio
what is likely happening is that you aren t including one of those headers but are including for example iostream

23038961
margin	text-align
cols are floater elements besides margin auto
we will also set it to float none to center the above col-lg-1 with class of centered we will write to center the content inside the div use text-align center if you want to center it only on the desktop and larger screen not on mobile then use the following media query

23040787
trie	tree
indexedseq is a vector which is a tree trie actually structure with a fanout of 32
so not counting memory locality you never get over a o log n factor of about 6--compare with a binary tree where it ranges from 1 to 30

23044968
haskell	agda
here are some examples agda has dependent types but haskell doesn t
so in agda we can parameterize lists with their length this is not possible in haskell

23046955
apache	nginx
spring boot does not provide this feature as it is already usually provided by a reverse proxy such as apache nginx running in front of the spring boot server
see here for an example here how the commercial version of nginx provides the functionality of dynamically scaling and reducing the upstream nodes

23052512
realloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
attempting to free a pointer you didn t get from malloc or one of its friends causes undefined behaviour

23053125
freemarker	thymeleaf	freemarker	velocity
in freemarker velocity thymeleaf or whatever you get an expression langauge that helps you with its expression features to build the actual html
so actually it s not a question of differences between html5+jquery and freemarker its a questions of differences between spring default templates and freemarker because you can integrate html5+jquery in both

23056738
http	spdy
after 1 http request follows 1 response
you cannot send content type text csv and content type text html at the same time maybe yes with spdy but not with pure http

23063992
mongodb	bson
so since that basic call is available everywhere in some form or another because it has to be then you can do everything that you find advertised on the mongodb site with every language implementation on any framework
but the short call to your particular request is since this is not actually a method call but is simply part of the bson arguments as passed in then of course there is no restriction by a particular language driver to actually use this

23066163
mathml	mathjax
you would be better off replacing the mathml by svg rather than html-css
mathjax s html-css output is different for different browsers operating systems font sizes and several other factors so if you save the html generated for one situation it may not work properly for another

23067305
realloc	calloc
ie if you pass foo and foo s address is 12345 and getline realloc s your storage and in a new location foo s new address might be 45678
this isn t an arguement against doing your own call to calloc because if you set foo null you re guaranteed that getline will have to call realloc

23067318
ssl	https
if you have an ssl enabled reverse proxy like nginx or apache+mod_proxy in front of nexus you need to make sure it is setting the x-forwarded-proto header
if you re using apache you can do this with requestheader set x-forwarded-proto https if this isn t the problem i m going to need some diagnostic information

23067568
hex	binary
the fact that you went from 00 to 60 means that you changed two bits in one of the hex digits
if you were viewing in binary mode you wouldn t see anything other than 0s and 1s

23072294
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
which translate this input element to 300 pixels to the left thus it no longer overlaps with your upload file this syntax only works in firefox and ie so lucky for you that is invalid syntax for webkit browsers google-chrome opera
so it was not working and therefore whole thing was working in google-chrome opera etc i don t know why this line is translating input to different place so in my opinion just remove the line but for future if you want this line to work on webkit browsers also then along with above line also add lines with browser specific prefix -webkit- in this case like this -webkit-transform translate -300px 0 scale 4

23072294
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
so it was not working and therefore whole thing was working in google-chrome opera etc i don t know why this line is translating input to different place so in my opinion just remove the line but for future if you want this line to work on webkit browsers also then along with above line also add lines with browser specific prefix -webkit- in this case like this -webkit-transform translate -300px 0 scale 4
also note there are prefix for ie and firefox also

23073354
sudo	passwd
yes your missing that you do sudo and have no tty you need to configure the etc sudoers file to set your user to get not prompted for passwd
on sudo

23074401
dictionary	map
hashtable implements a dictionary and total order of insertions is not retained because insertions with different hash values map to different chains
in the case of a dictionary implementation using chaining keys with colliding hashes are stored in a linked list as stated in the question and are indeed maintained in order of insertion

23075199
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the last parameter of flex is flex-basis which is apparently being handled a little differently between firefox and google-chrome safari
if you inspect one of the blurb elements and look at the computed styles in google-chrome and firefox you ll see that the browsers are interpreting the value as 0px. the problem is that while google-chrome is expecting 0px firefox is not

23075199
firefox	safari
firefox is expecting 0 which is not exactly the same thing as 0px
annoyingly if you were to use flex 3 0 0 while it would fix it for firefox it would also break chrome and safari s display

23075702
spaces	linefeed
also notepad++ can show white spaces chars including new lines which can be handy in such cases
it is probably the application or system you are using to view your file ignoring the linefeed not c# ignoring it

23077031
boost	stl
i d use boost phoenix note that it seems extremely weird to be comparing different fields unless the fields have some guaranteed redundancy relation they are always equal it will not satisfy the requirements for a strict weak total ordering - required for most stl containers algorithms that take a comparer
to avoid both the verbosity of the comparator as well as the risk of having different accesors on the left-hand right-hand sides i usually use a helper c++03 this no longer uses boost phoenix

23078292
boost	stl
personally i fixed this problem by using boost implementation instead until it s fixed
as pointed by stl the person who is in charge of the standard library in microsoft in the bug report this should be fixed for the visual studio versions higher than 2013 not the ctps as they don t change the standard library

23079653
clang	llvm
you can choose whether you want to use this compiler for all builds or just debug builds this makes sense when you use experimental and or self-modified versions of clang for instance
note that for features like autocompletion symbolic search etc. xcode does not use the clang binary but other llvm libraries distributed with xcode

23080732
build.gradle	gradlew
however opening classic android with added build.gradle in android studio should be easier so you can open as general project and then convert some modules into eclipse project but still it will not be fully functional but for a quick view inside may suffice from how to use gradlew to generate eclipse and intellij project files for android projects as answered in issue 57668 by android team raised by arcone project member #2 x... android.com the eclipse plugin is not compatible with the android plugin
you will not be able to import an android gradlew project into eclipse using the default gradlew support in eclipse

23082686
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like it should not be inherited according to perspective mdn documentation but i sort of agree with google-chrome as it feels intuitive to propagate it to descendants
i tried the workaround from 3d transformations with firefox 10+ which recommends reapplying transform-style preserve-3d with or without the -moz- depending on which versions of firefox you care about supporting at each depth but that still wasn t working for me

23083829
cdr	cons
3 and it can be swapped with map lambda x cons cdr x car x lst
you cannot check only if the list is null but also if the cdr is null as well

23085158
rpm	yum
rpm itself is not capable of doing this but usually you do not use such low-level too for removing packages
these higher-level tools yum in fedora tracks these changes to var log yum.log

23086753
umask	sudo
from ssh using acl on a system supporting chmod +a using acl on a system not supporting chmod +a sudo setfacl -r -m u www-data rwx -m u yourname rwx app cache app logs sudo setfacl -dr -m u www-data rwx -m u yourname rwx app cache app logs without using acl just after your opening php tag in app console web app.php and web app_dev.php add umask 0002
this will let the permissions be 0775 or umask 0000

23086919
bash	zsh
at that point i would expect your code to work in bash though not yet in zsh see below . note that simply removing function from the beginning of your function definition would make your code work in sh a posix-features-only shell too
the final problem affects only zsh not bash zsh by default doesn t perform word splitting on in the command so that ssh mydomain userxyz host.com is passed as a single argument to sshpass

23091184
bash	zsh
here s how i have set in .zshenv keep in mind however that zsh is not bash so just cause you have to source your .bash_profile every time you open a terminal does not mean that you have to do that with zsh
with zsh i only have to resource my .zshenv when i make changes to it and then only for terminals which are already open new terminals should have already sourced my new and improved .zshenv

23097170
gtk	cairo
consider using a version prior to it if the caller is on haskel side which seems not according to our comments or a version newer if the exception is thrown inside gtk package
according to cairo commit logs the leading underscore of that function has been removed in cairo- 1.9.2

23097605
uiview	subviews
if you re not using interface builder but instead are subclassing the uiwebview then it can be done by creating a uiview instance variable called scrollfixview and overriding the following methods
this problem only affects the uiwebview if it is the first subviews of the parent view

23101228
spaces	delimiter
run your copy command assuming your data does not have the pipe | character in it then use the split command to populated your target table note that i counted only 10 spaces and not 13 in your sample insert into venue_new venueid venuename venuecity venuestate select split_part venue_record 1 split_part venue_record 2 split_part venue_record 3 split_part venue_record 4 from stage_venue
the copy command only allows for single character delimiter so you cannot import this data directly into your target table

23106242
ubuntu	linux
trust me user3395860 it is easier to build a kivy android application on linux than on windows.if you cannot afford a machine with linux as the only operating system try to set a virtual machine like inclement suggested i guess it runs on virtualbox or do what i did i installed vmware on my windows 7 and downloaded a ubuntu virtual machine extention is .vmx that is compatible with my vmware version and ran it
next you need to install kivy on the ubuntu virtual machine and note that python is already installed on linux so you don t need to do so. to install kivy on ubuntu i do the following open the terminal ctrl + alt + t install the kivy ppa you will be prompted for your admin password here update your system install kivy test if kivy is installed open terminal as in 1 type python to open the python interpreter in the terminal then type to build your android application after you have copied it to the virtual machine and tested it go to this

23111298
apache	nginx
if apache is configured as you mentioned with a .htacess file to serve at the root of the host name then rewriting may not be required
an example nginx server block like this will pass the exact host and path being accessed from nginx through to apache without any changes

23111314
client-side	server-side
you cannot do this client-side
instead when the user votes send the vote to your server and record it server-side almost certainly in a database

23113257
jar	war
one skip the jar packaging for your application and make your ejbs be wars
if this doesn t sound appealing the other way is to create a separate project that s a war but pulls in your ejb jar as a dependency

23116563
implements	extends
in java the operator used to be safe with all operand combinations that would compile and provided neither operand was float nor double it would implements an equivalence relation
with the advent of autoboxing that is no longer quite true since the unfortunately-legal comparisons between primitives and their wrapped equivalent is not safe and extends the operator in a manner inconsistent with the equivalence relations defined by the types individually

23121891
google-chrome	firefox
correct behavior is google-chrome s one filling the use-generated clone
use-cloned version of the defs rect is wrongly not filled by firefox

23123114
octal	hex
i suspect you may be using the i conversion specifier which honors c conventions like 0x denoting hex and leading zeros denoting octal
if the input is 078 and i is used then only 07 matches because 8 is not an octal digit

23123114
octal	decimal
if the input is 078 and i is used then only 07 matches because 8 is not an octal digit
use d to scan decimal integers

23123895
memcpy	malloc
however you need memory space for the characters to be copied by memcpy from the source to the destination
therefore you need to allocate enough memory using malloc - strlen does not count the terminating null byte in the string pointed to by str

23126220
realloc	malloc
the amount of memory requested may be rounded up to some size the malloc system prefers to deal with - such as 16 so you may or may not own those extra 8 bytes in the sense that a realloc would always give you them rather than shift you to some other memory area but regardless it s undefined behaviour if you try to read modify them before such a realloc
it s also legal for the malloc library to use surrounding memory for its own bookkeeping and possible that the memory between your 8 byte allocations is still in use by some other library bootstrap code

23127798
prng	random
this means it s generated from a function which is said prng pseudo random number genrator
being generated from a function in turn means that the output is not random anymore since it s predictable

23128689
union	distinct
one more remark when union sets that are distinct yours are because of different status letters use union all not union
union is used to remove duplicates

23129099
pyenv	virtualenv
you can remove pyenv and install latest version of virtualenv and ask virtualenv to create the env for you by this command
if you re using the latest version of virtualenv --no-site-packages isn t necessary anymore

23135008
cdr	cons
or a cons cell whose car is the first element of the list and whose cdr is a proper list that is the rest of the list
that means that to make a list 2 3 + you would need the equivalent of cons 2 cons 3 cons + what you ve actually got is different you re not constructing what you what to in this code cons bin-tree-postorder left cons bin-tree-postorder right elmt since left is 2 bin-tree-postorder left is 2 since right is 3 bin-tree-postorder right is 3 since elmt is + elmt is 3 then what you ve got is if you want to use append then you ll need to make the last argument a proper list

23135113
gruntjs	package.json
run npm install grunt-cli -g if gruntjs is not found message gets displayed
your package.json is not a valid json

23139437
dataframe	multi-index
you can do this with and to be correct c is not a groupby object but a dataframe you also have pandas groupby objects but they are the result of a .groupby call
you can just index it like other dataframes but using tuples for the combination of levels however it is possible that for such indexing operations the multi-index needs to be sorted otherwise it can give and exception

23142983
express	koa	express	node.js
express on the other hand augments node s req and res objects with additional properties and methods and includes many other framework features such as routing and templating which koa does not
thus koa can be viewed as an abstraction of node.js s http modules where as express is an application framework for node.js

23143835
lxml	elementtree
for serious work with xml in python use lxml python comes with elementtree built in library but lxml extends it in terms of speed and functionality schema validation sax parsing xpath various sorts of iterators and many other features
you have to install it but in many places it is already assumed to be part of standard equipment google appengine does not allow c-based python packages but makes exception for lxml pyyaml and few others

23144194
couchbase	couchdb
the reason you will need couchdb as an intermediary is that there are a few issues with direct pouchdb - couchbase sync gateway syncing although hopefully they should be resolved soon see this and this
pouchdb is modeled after couchdb which doesn t have the concept of channels so there are no plans to implement it in pouchdb

23145976
calloc	malloc
it doesn t matter which way around the arguments are for calloc
your malloc calls are incorrect

23147743
fileinputstream	filechannel
also note that per the documentation if you move the position of the fileinputstream by reading bytes then you also move the position of the channel at the same time so be careful if you re trying to use both
fileinputstream.getchannel documentation says it returns a read-only filechannel that shares its position with this stream. you are assuming that the channel begins and ends exactly at the boundaries of your file which is the only way its total size would match what you expect but the documentation does not make that guarantee

23150011
uialertview	uiwindow
i do not know about sialertview but normal uialertview is shown via separate window
if you want to overlap it you can not do it by changing zpozition you have to also use a separate window update to overlap also a status bar use to dismiss uiwindow just invalidate strong pointer to it

23150911
haskell	idris
the compile-time evaluator is part of the idris kernel and is implemented in haskell using a hoas higher order abstract syntax style representation of values
since everything is known to have a normal form here the evaluation strategy doesn t actually matter because either way it will get the same answer and in practice it will do whatever the haskell run-time system chooses to do

23152560
client-side	server-side
for these controls are client-side as for regular html tags
therefore they are not even triggering postback to the server not to mention validation and server-side event handlers

23153202
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
that is because in ios7 the height of uinavigationbar is increased 64 points when it is contained in a uinavigationcontroller
with the status bar being transparent when you are presenting a view controller modally its not in the uinavigationcontroller so the height is normal 44 points and thus the map view is behind the status bar

23154390
google-chrome	safari
this is because the original width of the header is very large and google-chrome doesn t seem to update the calculated width at the end of the animation it does update correctly on safari and may be a bug in google-chrome
when you resize the window which opening dev tools will do google-chrome then calculates it correctly

23158650
equals	gethashcode
as with other hash-based collections like dictionary and hashset the internal structure used by distinct uses gethashcode to select a hash to store by but equals to determine actual equality
the problem could be either a bug in your equals or in your gethashcode but in the later case is that it doesn t correctly match your equals gethashcode must return the same hash for two objects for which equals returns true but can of course also return the same for two different objects which makes it a bug in the pair of methods

23158801
equals	gethashcode
that is why you need to implement both if you only implement equals then the step fails and it never tries the equals you implemented
gethashcode should be fast and it s value should not change while it sits in a collection that depends on it s value

23160114
google-chrome	firefox
if you re worried about your own personal computer you re unlikely to be vulnerable if you use windows or mac and google-chrome
i m not sure about firefox or ie

23160211
sudo	passwd
if something needs root access use sudo
you can setup sudo to not require a passwd for a particular user and limit the commands that can be run as root

23161453
nerdtree	netrw
there s feature parity in other areas too bookmarks while some things are unique to nerdtree fancier tree visualization customizable action menu
netrw provides transparent access to remote file systems which nerdtree doesn t

23169788
hmac	pbkdf2
it s not recommended to go over 20 bytes as that s the maximum size of the underlying hash function hmac
going over that will only give an advantage to the attacker this according to many is a design mistake in pbkdf2

23170094
apache	nginx
nginx is still faster and i might choose it but apache isn t asleep
apache is asynchronous if you want it to be with the event mpm

23170094
apache	nginx
apache is asynchronous if you want it to be with the event mpm
unlike nginx and cherokee etc. it is not the default

23171880
spaces	delimiter
it s not strtok that reads to the first spaces it s scanf scanf s expression
as soon as scanf sees a spaces a tab or any other delimiter it stops reading and returns the word up to the spaces

23174290
apache	nginx
so if you re just running a single instance of apache for example then you d never encounter network congestion or not available
if you are for example running apache as your primary web server and nginx on a different port as your content server then to test it its simply a case of stopping the nginx serving your content

23176454
multiplying	division
the latter sticks to integer operations by simply multiplying count first changing sequence of operations such that the division will not be 0 as long as count is not 0
the problem had already been pointed out by grant winney it s the integer division

23177100
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i had this issue happen to me viewwillappear was being called but viewdidappear was not
i finally figured out that this was because i had a tabbarcontroller where i overloaded it s own viewdidappear and forgot the it threw off every vc in every tab

23178273
implements	extends
this is a reference to the quick tip from additionally it may be more practical to create a class that extends textview to help you have a more practical implementation to a custom font that can be used for the textview s you want to add a custom font to like so and then you can use this in xml in any layout update these are a few ways that i have had success implements custom fonts
the sample showing how to add a custom textview via extends textview then adding it in xml is not necessary it just provides a skeleton of how to create your textview as a re-useable object rather than doing it dynamically in your activity or fragment

23183578
serializable	deserialization
serializable with scala-pickling or part of the standard-distribution starting with scala 2.11 in the exmple code the object is not written to a file and json is used instead of bytecode serializable which avoids certain problems originating in byte code incompatibilities between different scala version
you could use the serializable trait trivial serializable example using java serializable with the serializable trait case class person age int extends serializable usage serializable write object deserialization read object which creates following output as you see the deserialization can t infer the object type itself which is a clear drawback

23185126
g++	gcc
it sets the linking program to g++ which should allow the system linker to find the libraries it needs
the problem boils down to the fact that gcc doesn t actually have libstdc++ or the other core c++ libraries available to it but g++ does

23185126
g++	gcc
the problem boils down to the fact that gcc doesn t actually have libstdc++ or the other core c++ libraries available to it but g++ does
asking ghc to use g++ instead of gcc for linking should do the trick

23187362
noexcept	throw
in modern c++ you can use noexcept
the caveat here is that the process will exit if an exception is throw and not caught inside a method with noexcept

23188697
mtu	icmp
this appears to be a known issue with the rds instances not responding to icmp which is needed to auto-discover the mtu settings
as a workaround you ll need to configure a smaller mtu on the instance that is performing the query

23191255
spaces	delimiter
this should work cut -d -f1 2 5 6 it specifies the delimiter as spaces
you input is actually demited by spaces not tab

23203044
ssl	https
the other company will also need to present an ssl certificate that your server recognizes - in this case it should be a self signed certificate that you install in your trust store so you aren t accepting connections from just anyone who has a ca issued certificate
your software can contact your server with an https get request

23203432
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
if you want to create a date time representation which stores both a timestamp and an associated time zone locale you should create a java.util.calendar object using calendar.getinstance ... and provide it with a timezone and or a locale then set the time associated with the calendar with the date object representing the date time you want
the return value from dateformat.parse string is a java.util.date which does not retain any information about time zone or locale

23206327
comparator	comparable
comparable is an interface that any class may choose to implement in order to indicate that instances of the class may be compared using the class comparator method
so you can choose to implement this interface in any class you create yourself however you must write the code for comparator yourself since java doesn t know how to compare your objects in a meaningful manner

23206327
comparator	comparable
so you can choose to implement this interface in any class you create yourself however you must write the code for comparator yourself since java doesn t know how to compare your objects in a meaningful manner
some built-in classes implement comparable and others don t - there might be a list somewhere but it would be way too long for an so answer

comparator	comparable
if you are wondering about whether a specific class implements comparator check its documentation and see if the comparison does what you expect or simply try to call that method
if there is a built-in or third-party class that does not implement comparable you need to create a comparator instead in order to compare them

23208060
jsonb	hstore
json as it currently exists does allow for nesting but is text-based and does not allow for indexing thus it is slow jsonb that will be released with 9.4 will have the current nesting capabilities of json as well as the gin gist indexing of hstore so it will be fast people working on postgresql 9.4 seem to be saying that the new fast jsonb type will appeal to people who would have chosen to use a nosql data store like mongodb but can now combine a relational database with query-able unstructured data under one roof benchmarks of postgresql 9.4 jsonb seem to be on par with or in some cases faster than mongodb
as far as i can tell hstore as it currently exists in postgresql 9.3 does not allow for nesting other objects and arrays as the values of its key value pairs

ionic	angular
ionic doesn t use anything of jquery at all it uses angular js and i suggest that you read this post
about the single page structure i m afraid it isn t possible using ionic because ionic implements ui-router which creates routes for different templates each template being a different html

23209065
ionic	angular
about the single page structure i m afraid it isn t possible using ionic because ionic implements ui-router which creates routes for different templates each template being a different html
so just get rid of jquery and start thinking angular as the posts suggests you won t regret

23211195
octal	decimal
if you really want a leading zero octal you would need something like which gives you the decimal numbers 0 through 12 but in octal
however if you want to keep them evenly spaced with decimal just use a leading space instead of zero although i m not sure you gain anything from that

23211714
google-chrome	firefox
my guess is that google-chrome realizes that you want the link to point to a css file but firefox does not
the problem is your css file isn t loading on firefox

23217491
opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
sadly they re not implemented by firefox and there s discordance among the other browsers about what should be the origin point ie thinks it s the content box while google-chrome opera and safari the padding box which makes more sense since it s the same origin of absolutely positioned elements
layerx layery are properties of mouseevent objects defined by gecko-based browsers firefox et al.

super	implements
there even exists a legacy hack which makes it able to exploit this feature in java versions before 6 this way a field could be set before the super constructor is invoked which is however not longer possible
in jbc this behavior can still be implements

23218472
super	implements
branch a super constructor call in java it is not possible to define a constructor call like until java 7u23 the hotspot vm s verifier did however miss this check which is why it was possible
this was used by several code generation tools as a sort of a hack but it is not longer legal to implements a class like this

23218472
super	implements
call any default method the java compiler requires several conditions to be fulfilled in order to allow a default method s invocation the method must be the most specific one must not be overridden by a sub interface that is implements by any type including super types
the default method s interface type must be implements directly by the class that is calling the default method

23218472
implements	extends
the default method s interface type must be implements directly by the class that is calling the default method
however if interface b extends interface a but does not override a method in a the method can still be invoked

23220175
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
the easiest and most straightforward way is to use the jpopupmenu class
you can add any jcomponent to a jpopupmenu not just jmenuitem s

23220783
move	drag
and since you have done this already so i will not go through again and to get click drop working you just need to assign a class on element click check if any clicked class already on the board other then itself then it means a drop move
to assign the board div id as a1 to h8 just do a simple loop so you do not really need to use colour to check the element just back to basic div drag and click

23222073
apache	nginx
as i said i m not a nginx user so i don t know what the standard username is but for apache it would look something like this chown www-data www-data var www vhosts mydomain.com new_folder
i m not a nginx expert i m used to apache but my guess is all you need to do is make sure the user that nginx is running under has write permission to a folder

23222789
sse	avx
normally compiling with arch avx will fix this for your own code as it will use avx128 instructions instead of sse ones where possible
however in this case it may be that your standard library s math functions are not implemented using avx instructions in which case you d get a transition penalty for every function call

23227623
implements	extends
you can know which classes implements context and get more info on contexts here
it is unknown because your class doesn t extends any other class that has a context so it doesn t know what that method is

23230175
coldfusion	railo
that may or may not matter to you but your basic problem should be solved by switching to j2ee sessions in the coldfusion administrator
you might also want to consider moving to coldfusion 10 or railo to take advantage of httponly cookies which are not readable using javascript using the secure flag on cookies and using sessionrotate after login to prevent session fixation

23230592
bash	zsh
in a quick test with bin sh as a link to bin bash bash -c echo -n foo and bash -c echo -n foo | cat produced identical newline-free results but sh -c echo -n foo and sh -c echo -n foo | cat showed the results you report
i am not sure how other shells such as ksh dash or zsh behave when invoked as sh but by default they all treat -n as a newline suppressor. for predictable results use printf instead which never prints a newline unless a n is included in the format string

23234014
realloc	malloc
what you can do instead is to use realloc
a call to realloc will return a pointer to a block of memory just like malloc while preserving the contents of the block passed in but not necessarily in the same location

23234014
realloc	malloc
a call to realloc will return a pointer to a block of memory just like malloc while preserving the contents of the block passed in but not necessarily in the same location
depending on the size requested smaller same size or bigger and the availability of space in the heap realloc may return the original block adjusted in size as needed or it may return a new block in a different location

23235137
cas	shibboleth
also while it is a bit more work and can be a pain to set up if your employees already login to your domain via windows then you can actually piggy back on that and configure cas to use the windows login information users have already provided rather than prompting users with a login form making them re-enter their windows credentials
here are a few of your answers first let me give you a quick overview of how the interaction between a cas client and a cas server normally works i am not familiar with the shibboleth portion so i am omitting that. user hits the application webpage

23235137
cas	shibboleth
here are a few of your answers first let me give you a quick overview of how the interaction between a cas client and a cas server normally works i am not familiar with the shibboleth portion so i am omitting that. user hits the application webpage
application redirects user to cas

23235224
spaces	linefeed
if unicode is set then any character not marked as spaces in the unicode character properties database is matched
if you want to exclude just spaces and newline characters then you might want to use for example note that it will not eliminate all the other whitespace characters like tabs linefeed characters etc so if you want to exclude all the whitespace characters then you can use or for example s is the same as

23236847
multiplying	multiplication
the matrix multiplication does not have the same rules as the scalar multiplication and in your case a b does not equal b a when multiplying the matrices
if rest of the code is good your solution might simply be turning into do alway watch out for both multiplication order and parentheses when dealing with anything but scalar values

23237457
ubuntu	debian
btw i observe the same problem with ubuntu 12.04 debian 7.4 so it is not related to 11.04. ubuntu 14.04 works fine.
ubuntu 12.04.4 openssl s_client -connect github.com 443 -tls1 -servername github.com reports verify return code 20 unable to get local issuer certificate command host -t a github.com returns one from addresses 192.30.252.128 192.30.252.129 192.30.252.130 or 192.30.252.131

23243162
setinterval	settimeout
you need not to use the setinterval function after closing the modal so use the following code when you close the modal clearinterval timeout1
you need to use setinterval method here as settimeout would function after 1000ms 1 second so it is not going to check your time ever forth again but using setinterval would run every 1 second and check for the time and the code is executed

23244708
filewriter	printwriter
yes you can do it as filewriter comes with below 5 ways filewriter file file constructs a filewriter object given a file object. filewriter file file boolean append constructs a filewriter object given a file object. filewriter filedescriptor fd constructs a filewriter object associated with a file descriptor. filewriter string filename constructs a filewriter object given a file name. filewriter string filename boolean append constructs a filewriter object given a file name with a boolean indicating whether or not to append the data written.
1st question - i would like to ask if i can omit file declaration by writing printwriter outstream new printwriter new filewriter des.txt

23245754
opera	firefox
opera also returns a nodelist but with a nameditem method implemented which makes it similar to a htmlcollection
from the developer firefox documentation while the w3c dom 3 core specification says elements is a nodelist that was simply because of a an attempt to have the core specification not depend on the html specification at that time

23251338
vbscript	vba
update wrt comment the error message d g diamond final ms-access query1.vbs 2 9 microsoft vbscript compilation error expected end of statement prooves that the ot tried to write a vbscript the addition of the misleading vba access tags is c pankaj jaju
vbscript as opposed to vba or other dialects does not support typed dims

23251338
vbscript	vba
vbscript as opposed to vba or other dialects does not support typed dims
so dim dbs as dao.database dim dbfullname as string need to be dim dbs dim dbfullname vbscript has no native opendatabase function

23252435
decoder	encoder
most people will not need to use this and should use the libav hevc decoder available at instead see for documentation
if you have mean this openhevc than no it doesn t have its own hevc encoder

23255303
queue	fifo	implements	extends
it requires racket and uses its queue to implements breadth-first processing we maintain a fifo queue of pairs each consisting of a subset in reversed order and a list of items not included in it starting with an empty subset so all the original items are still not included in it
for each such pair we collect the subset into the result list and also extends the queue by extends this subset by each item from the not-included items

23256554
clang	llvm
the llvm project includes the lld linker which is apparently far enough along that it can self host on x86 windows and so might work for you as a cross-platform linker however lld is not yet a standard part of clang distributions
clang on os x still uses the os x platform linker ld by default as does clang on windows link.exe

23256554
clang	llvm
it can configure clang to build for os x or ios but you ll have to manually configure cross-platform builds to windows
i m relatively confident that one could cobble together an llvm based environment to build a c hello world windows exe on os x or linux but it s not quite ready for xcode to add a windows item to the list of possible target platforms

23257432
inline	inlining
hence for any architecture the functions that aren t inline will be treated as normal functions and hence the push pop from the stack when you call them like any normal non-inlined function and it is pretty much dependent upon how your compiler is configured
for eg gcc has flags like -finline-functions consider all functions for inlining even if they are not declared inline

23262182
implements	extends
if you need inheritance or to implements an interface you need to create a named class
anonymous classes aka anonymous types can not extends another class or implements an interface

23265665
udp	tcp
it is up to you if you need reliable delivery tcp or not udp
websockets works over tcp

23271002
bufferedreader	ioexception
the bufferedreader doesn t know that though it assumes whatever it is wrapping will throw ioexception and it is just passing it along
i would think about using the java.util.scanner class instead to avoid the annoyance of the bufferedreader checked exceptions here

23281717
prepare	execute
using a prepare statement is not always the most efficient way of executing a statement
a prepare statement execute only once causes more client-server round-trips than a non-prepared statement

23281851
prepare	execute
the idea of prepare statements is not primarily that you can bind parameters but that you can reuse the compiled statement multiple times which should increase efficiency
the prepare-execute workflow isn t too inconvenient for one-off use cases but pdo offers other methods as well execute execute a statement and returns the number of affected rows

23283264
octal	binary	octal	decimal
in javascript numbers with a leading zero are not considered to be correct when used in the way you use them. there are different types of numbers for example binary decimal octal and hexadecimal
javascript thinks the leading zero indicates an octal integer so it tries to convert those into octal base

23284181
jar	manifest.mf
place the image in the jar archive and specify the path in the option
the path should not have a leading slash. for example in the manifest.mf file manifest-version 1.0 main-class test splashscreen-image filename.gif the splashscreen class provides the api for controlling the splash screen

23285914
daemons	systemd
if all of the workers were daemons threads then the entire process would finish - and you would be back at your systemd shell prompt - very soon after you print main exit and it would be very rare though not impossible owing to race conditions for any worker to print after that
according to the threading docs the entire python program exits when only daemons threads are left this agrees with the quote you give but the slight difference in wording shows the result you get

23286222
ubuntu	debian
even an ubuntu to debian conversion or suchlike isn t really hard with some well directed apt-get install commands but these are untested
the paths supported by ubuntu are better only because they are well tested

23287218
clang	llvm
you will need to modify quite a bit of code for example there are portions of type definitions in ... llvm tools clang lib sema sema.cpp and ... llvm tools clang lib ast type.cpp
if you grep for int128 good choice as clang itself doesn t use that much in itself as opposed to for example size_t you will see that it turns up in a lot of places

23289789
innodb	myisam
so you will need to change the engine of your table to innodb if possible
even it has been mentioned on comment before -- just to make it more prominent myisam is not supporting foreign keys

23293256
onresume	onpause
in your write activity you register for the nfc foreground dispatch system in the onresume method
however you do not release the foreground dispatch in onpause

23294389
dropbox	icloud
if you need to sync data across multiple devices and not files dropbox does not provide this functionality
by the way ensembles framework by drew mccormack provides a way to sync core data apps through droppox icloud etc

23295313
aggregate-functions	sum
below i get the totals for each hatchid and pulloutdate select mh.sno as hatchid convert varchar mh.pulloutdate 103 as pulloutdate sum mh.chicksqnty as noofchicks sum mh.culls as culls sum mh.chicksqnty - mh.culls as salablechicks from k_hm_masterhatcherdet as mh where mh.pulloutdate is not null group by mh.sno mh.pulloutdate the main thing here is the group by handles mh.sno and mh.pulloutdate whilst the aggregate-functions operate on the remaining columns in the query
if you use a column in a group by you typically don t use an aggregrate function min sum etc

23296862
strcpy	strncpy
issue 1 since you re using c-style strings any copying of string data will require function calls such as strcpy strncpy etc
you failed in following this advice in this code you should be using strcpy not to copy strings

23297040
verilog	vhdl
it is very thorough but it tends to lean toward explaining things for verilog and then providing the vhdl equivalent
the full capability of vhdl isn t properly revealed by these types of mixed language books

23298813
ssms	sqlcmd
this is specific to sql server management studio ssms as sqlcmd mode is directives to ssms and not something that the database engine will be executing
you can enable sqlcmd mode on a per-session basis by going to the query menu and selecting sqlcmd mode

23298952
csv	tsv
the output widget can output csv tsv any other separated space semi-colon etc values javascript array or json
if you are just using basic functionality the default settings will output csv to a popup window only include the last header row only include filtered rows so all rows if the filter widget isn t even being used will only output the table cell text ignores html all you would need is this code demo html script i created another demo showing all options with a set of radio buttons which allow the user to choose between sending the output to a popup window or downloading the file

23300753
prepare	execute
edit final solution to the answer see below for other alternatives function usage program output demo you can also make use of debugdumpparams for that description public void pdostatement debugdumpparams void dumps the informations contained by a prepare statement directly on the output. it will provide the sql query in use the number of parameters used params the list of parameters with their name type paramtype as an integer their key name or position and the position in the query if this is supported by the pdo driver otherwise it will be -1
things to note you can only get the dumps after you run execute so your code would look like this debugdumpparams is not doing what you really wanted

23301282
stateless	stateful
i m not too familiar with ejbs but i believe the problem is that without the stateless annotation the bean is not a ejb so transactions are not automatically managed
if you need statefulness use the stateful annotation to make a stateful ejb

23301386
setinterval	settimeout
if you need to execute something at regular intervals which is the case you can use setinterval instead like this jsfiddle demo
as far as i know settimeout will not suit you because you need to execute some code every time you want to update the display several times per second while this method is intended for executing something only once

23303422
libstdc++	libc++
gnu s libstdc++ s just does not work at all until 4.9
either install g++-4.9 or libc++ or use boost regex .

23304207
super	self
note you would also need to change class foo to class foo object or adjust the super call
bar.py from foo import foo class bar foo def __init__ self super bar self .__init__ this may not be appropriate depending on what your objects are intended to do etc

23305614
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
intl.numberformat isn t available in all browsers yet but it works in latest google-chrome opera ie
firefox s next release should support it

23305729
phpstorm	webstorm
i also export my webstorm phpstorm settings so once i fixed these missing css properties i will not have to do it again
alternatively you can add the unknown css property to custom properties as shown in the following screenshot this is the result after you run inspection code... action this is a way to train your phpstorm webstorm with the missing css properties that you use

23313949
dbcontext	objectcontext
there is a simpler way with dbcontext you can just override the savechanges method which provides a nicer hook for implementing such requirements if you are not satisfied and still want the objectcontext it is there
this also answers your other question - the dbcontext uses the object context internally

23316030
portrait	landscape
chances are what s going on is that you are probably getting a reference to a layout element that exists in your portrait layouts activity .xml layout but doesn t exist in your landscape layout layouts-land activity .xml
for example might work if you re in portrait because you have a element in it

23316030
portrait	landscape
for example might work if you re in portrait because you have a element in it
but your landscape layout does not have the same element

23316363
intersect	contains
image taken from to find all points contains in a given query rectangle start at the root and recursively search for points in both subtrees using the following pruning rule if the query rectangle does not intersect the rectangle corresponding to a node there is no need to explore that node or its subtrees
a subtree is searched only if it might contains a point contains in the query rectangle

23316665
google-chrome	firefox
at the time of writing google-chrome supports multiple arguments to add and remove but none of the other browsers do
ie 10 and lower firefox 23 and lower google-chrome 23 and lower and other browsers do not support the second argument to toggle

23318490
direct3d	directx
direct3d initialization failed
looks like you have not installed directx

23318569
division	subtraction
for multiplication or division the raw values are probably ok
for subtraction probably not

23319507
bash	zsh
these are instances of bash shell parameter expansion
see note ksh and zsh support the expansions in your question too i m unclear on the full extent of the overlap in functionality whereas sh posix-features-only shells does not support the string-replacement expansion

23320431
jpql	hql
documentation says jpql is a heavily-inspired-by subset of hql
a jpql query is always a valid hql query the reverse is not true however

23320431
jpql	hql
a jpql query is always a valid hql query the reverse is not true however
in fact hibernate parses jpql query with the same grammar parser as hql

23322827
sudo	passwd
for instance by being member of the sudo group and having the line in your etc sudoers file
of course not asking the passwd lowers the security of your system

23326574
super	implements
you might be having suppose an administrator privilege some thing like super user role and the code might be just allowing everything for such role that means it does not really do much of conditional checking to see what is allowed or not
some times it s a considerable over ahead to get all the privileges of the user and have the conditions checking how course depends how how the authorization is implements

23327401
debian	linux	debian	centos	centos	linux
also you can not install packages without root access neither centos nor debian packages
dpkg is the low level package tool of the debian distribution and derived distributions such as ubuntu linux mint and others

23327401
debian	centos
apt-get is a higher-level user facing program used to retrieve and install debian packages on debian systems
it does not work on centos because centos uses a different package format rpm and cannot work with packages that were made for the debian distribution

23330060
haskell	scheme
and you can t do it in haskell because haskell doesn t let you mutate a variable once it s been defined
but you can do it in javascript or scheme define f1 x display first version got display x newline define around f before after lambda x before apply f x after set

23331581
uiview	subviews
this takes advantage of the provided by uiview
in the final block of code the uiview instance you are using as the loop iterator and calling subviews is not actually representative of the subviews of view

23332110
super	self
2 the fraction.__new__ method uses super to call object.__new__ to do the actual instance creation
addenda blckknght wants to know why value isn t returned directly after it is created its numerator and demoninator are copies into self before the value is throw-away

23335882
ienumerable	iqueryable
the warning exists because an ienumerable can disguise something expensive such as a database call most likely an iqueryable and as ienumerable doesn t have caching as part of it s contract it will re-enumerate the source fresh
this can lead to performance issues later on we have been stung by this a surprising amount and we don t even use iqueryable ours was on domain model traversal

23339447
centos	linux
another alternative is to install the developer toolset which is an optional add-on providing a recent version of gcc and other dev tools see for a re-packaged version for scientific linux that should be compatible with centos
the rhel and centos 5.x series use gcc 4.1 and do not provide newer versions because they are stable enterprise distributions so you can t update to a newer version using yum

23339615
laravel	codeigniter
here s a list of cms built with laravel stable laravel bootstrap bootstrap starter site pongo cms v1 wardrobe cms blogging in development at the moment pongocms v2 october cms larapress koanda
unfortunately i m pretty sure you ll not find any packages or projects that migrates a joomla web site to laravel or maybe codeigniter which is much older than laravel

23341435
atom-editor	sublimetext
atom-editor doesn t come with very much out of the box just like sublimetext but just like sublimetext it s highly extendable using its built in package manager
atom-editor s package manager is found in the preferences

23343483
draggable	droppable
as webeno noted in his comment the jquery ui droppable docs give examples on how to make the draggable element revert back to it s original position if not placed onto a droppable area
i ve modified your fiddle by adding the option to the draggable that is required to allow it to revert position when placed on an invalid not droppable area

23345700
dictionary	map
you can convert your array into a dictionary
not sure how efficient this is depends on the implementation and comparison call but it does use a hash map

23346478
translation	localization
any existing content you have is not automatically translation
the process should be this 1 enable english uk in settings localization languages and regions

23346668
awt	swing
suggestions first and foremost use swing not awt since drawing iwth swing jcomponents will give you automatic double buffering -- the lack of which is likely causing your problem
you shouldn t even be mixing your awt canvas component with your swing jframe component

23346668
awt	swing
you shouldn t even be mixing your awt canvas component with your swing jframe component
again just stick with all swing components

23348905
pdcurses	ncurses
meanwhile although it s not a pure ncurses solution and won t work with pdcurses people sometimes use select in this situation to wait on input from either ncurses or a network socket
halfdelay and more commonly nodelay are the correct solutions in the ncurses space

23349968
scheme	racket
doesn t exist in scheme
i know it s a standard procedure in the racket language but that is not scheme but a similar dialect

23351500
apache	lighttpd
apache lighttpd etc. so long as you can install the necessary php and python packages on the os itself with any nix-server os like ubuntu-server centos this is very easy to do
although i m not familiar with lighttpd what i would consider is to instead map the owncloud software to a subdomain owncloud.mydomain.com dealing with subdomains is much easier than link urls

23355673
move	drag
drag drop by default move files to your project not what you always want pressing alt while dragging copies files don t find a permanent config option for this but this is the workaround i m using
to import files from os x finder into android studio just drag the relevant files to your resource folder

23357072
intersect	contains
the union intersect and minus operators are not valid on long columns
if the select list preceding the set operator contains an expression then you must provide a column alias for the expression in order to refer to it in the order_by_clause

23360924
queue	fifo
queue is asynchronous it does not wait at all
tthread.queue is a fifo queue

23364303
direct3d	directx
additionally while not directx components themselves managed objects have been built on top of some parts of directx such as managed direct3d 40 and the xna graphics library 41 on top of direct3d 9
from wikipedia microsoft encourages the use of these directx components direct3d d3d for drawing 3d graphics. dxgi for enumerating adapters and monitors and managing swap chains for direct3d 10 and up

23366753
cassini	iis
this is because 2013 does not use cassini web server but instead uses iis express
this can happen in visual studio 2012 as well if you enable iis express instead of cassini

23370274
sudo	passwd
i feel the problem is sudo not asking me for a passwd as gksu does
but i don t know how to give it a passwd

23372408
ubuntu	debian
the node package in debian ubuntu is not node.js it s amateur packet radio software
my suggestion is that if you want node.js remove the existing node program sudo apt-get purge node for debian ubuntu and follow the instructions here for your particular distro platform

23372655
mediarecorder	audiorecord
found this graph on the states of the mediarecorder if you don t like the audiorecord this chart may be able to help you debug where you mediarecorder is getting put in an invalid state
i am not sure what is wrong with the mrecorder but i usually use an audiorecord object for recording audio rather then the full blown mediarecorder which can potentially do a lot more then just record audio

23372655
mediarecorder	audiorecord
i am not sure what is wrong with the mrecorder but i usually use an audiorecord object for recording audio rather then the full blown mediarecorder which can potentially do a lot more then just record audio
either way check out the android dev page for audiorecord hope that helps

23376193
postgresql	mysql
another option is simply to use another database system like postgresql
mysqldb does not support python 3 but it is not the only mysql driver for python

23377578
hlsl	glsl
are all hlsl cg
what is more the modulus operator is not going to work in glsl on a floating-point type

23379065
serializable	deserialization
even though immuttabletable isn t serializable you could always use a hashbasedtable or one of the other table implementations
and then after deserialization use immutabletable.copyof deserialized to get the immutabletable again

23379718
punctuation	words
it also won t match words directly before or after punctuation
if you want to match a words in a sentence even with punctuation you ll need a regex like this you could use w but that doesn t count underscores as punctuation. just concatenating spaces onto the beginning and the end won t match for example the words programmer in the string i am a java programmer because there s no space at the end

23385251
uilabel	nsstring
but in general there are few disadvantages of using uiwebview instead of native controls implementing interactive controls by web view is not easy task if it s possible that in the future your labels will become clickable and interactive then it s better use uicollectionview + uilabel toolset
compiler analyser can t check content of web view because usually nsstring is used for storing content

23385893
implements	extends
so if an abstract class has the same method as in an interface and if abstract class has implements the method already then for a child class its not necessary to override that method
i have an example to show why extends precedes implements in class declaration inerface abstract class child class if you observe there is same method getname in both interface and in abstract class where in abstract class the method has the implementation

23387098
coalesce	isnull
coalesce could hurt your performance but not compared to case because it s actually just a case by another name
isnull could lead to better perf in some cases

23390244
setcontentview	findviewbyid
this means that the identifier wtf exists in r this wouldn t compile otherwise but is not found in the layer activity_scene3 as we wave the following statement line 38 of scene3.oncreate setcontentview r.layout.activity_scene3
and later on findviewbyid returns null you have to revisit this layout to ensure that the button you are willing to access to actually exists with the id wtf

23394633
mongodb	bson
if you do not want to start a new instance and import the data another option could be using bsondump utility that comes as part of mongodb package to convert the bson dump files to json format and analyzing them
not sure what you mean by schema since mongodb is very flexible on schema

23394825
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome was the browser i used when writing the fiddle
firefox on the other hand does not update the display of the model until i tab or click out of the field

23395742
oncreate	findviewbyid
the reason is that you re calling findviewbyid before oncreate when initializing member variables
your activity does not have a window yet and findviewbyid needs it

23395742
setcontentview	findviewbyid
the setcontentview explanation given by other answers works but is not exactly correct
if you had the window and was callind findviewbyid before setcontentview a null would be returned instead of an npe being thrown

23395782
prng	random
you need to understand how prng work and the hint is in the p for pseudo the rest is random number generator
a prng does not create a random sequence of number because it is not random for the same input seed the same sequence is always produced and this sequence cycles at a given period

23397253
tabcontrol	tabitem
the original control template of a tabitem looks like this as you can see inside the template it has a border and its child is a contentpresenter which is basically what you modified in your itemtemplate for the tabcontrol it doesn t fill out because the border has its own background color which you can see it defined as lightbrush
in order to change this behavior you have to customize your tabitem template something like this

23399507
udp	tcp
while you already know that udp is not reliable you maybe missed the other advantages of tcp
relevant for you is that tcp has flow control and automatically scales down if the receiver is unable to cope with the senders speed packet loss

23400758
google-chrome	firefox
as a side note if you re not aware most modern browsers feature some sort of dev tools - hit f12 in google-chrome ie or firefox and it should pop up
within each there is a console section esc in google-chrome and you can not only execute javascript but browse the available functions and properties

23403298
domcontentloaded	onload
a solution would be to wrap it in window.onload alternatively you can use the domcontentloaded event
this differs from onload because it doesn t wait for images and css to be loaded

23406983
udp	tcp
well you have to remember that dns amplification attack is based on udp rather then on tcp thus - no connections need to be established
when using tcp http smtp etc. you have to establish a tcp connection 3-way handshake so spoofing is of course out of the question. there are some http amplification attacks though they are not called amplification per say which consist of requesting or posting a very large object rapidly thus exhausting the outbound or inbound - depending on the type of the attack pipe till eventually causing a dos

23407985
satellite	altitude
i do understand that the error on the satellite position grows proportionally with the difference between the epoch of the mean anomaly and the time of analysis but i don t understand why this error leads to a shift in the results and not in completely different results
note that the conversion between elevation and off nadir angle here is quite good provided that the value h + r distance between the satellite and the earth center range + earth_radius is corrected by the altitude on earth that is h + r + target_altitude

23408598
google-chrome	firefox
i have had this problem before firefox and ie do not allow any cross-domain font requests which is correct by spec but google-chrome webkit does
this means firefox ie will not load your fonts because they are still on your test sub-domain but your site has moved

23412419
nerdtree	netrw
first you have to understand that vim already comes with a rather powerful file explorer called netrw help netrw so there s actually no real hard need for another file explorer plugin like nerdtree
but netrw is not really designed to be used as a side-panel like those found in other editors and ides desire for that feature is what prompted the creation of nerdtree which closely mimics those side-panels

23413356
ssl	https
the only thing you need to add is ssl https so that the password isn t sent in the clear
this is a feature not a bug since that s what https was designed for

23415303
google-chrome	firefox
i m not 100 sure but it looks like google-chrome version 34.0.1847.131 m does not appear to have any settings that the user can use to choose whether or not to open popups in a new window or a new tab like firefox and internet explorer have
i checked the google-chrome documentation for managing pop-ups but it didn t mention anything about that sort of thing

23418773
strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc
documentation will in general be very clear and explicit if you need to free a pointer returned from a function for example strdup would be such a case
if you did not allocate it e.g malloc calloc then you shouldn t be deallocating it either e.g free

23420635
rvm	bundler
if you re using rvm try rvm use 2.x.x or whatever version it is you re using followed by a bundle install
this could be one of two issues bundler isn t installed - in this case simply run gem install bundler you re using two different ruby installations or rubygems installations for your app than your development environment and the gemset for your production app doesn t include bundler

23426309
decimal	ieee
if you choose an arbitrary number between 1 and 2 even one with a simple decimal representation you cannot expect that it will be represented more accurately than half this precision
if you have some leeway in the numbers you choose to represent but want them to be represented exactly as double-precision ieee 754 floating-point numbers do not pick numbers that have a simple representation in decimal but numbers that have a simple representation in binary

23429186
build.gradle	gradlew
perhaps you ll be able to spot some difference that is causing your particular error directory tree project_a build.gradle settings.gradle src main java a a.java project_b build.gradle src main java b b.java project_a build.gradle project_a settings.gradle includeflat project_b a.java project_b build.gradle apply plugin java b.java when running gradlew from project_a the output is gradlew clean build run clean up-to-date project_b clean up-to-date project_b compilejava project_b processresources up-to-date project_b classes project_b jar compilejava processresources up-to-date classes jar assemble compiletestjava up-to-date processtestresources up-to-date testclasses up-to-date test up-to-date check up-to-date build project_b assemble project_b compiletestjava up-to-date project_b processtestresources up-to-date project_b testclasses up-to-date project_b test up-to-date project_b check up-to-date project_b build run from a.main... calling b build successful
based on the java quckstart multi-project java build 1 your settings.gradle file needs to be in dev not dev project_a and it should contain something like this include project_a project_b 2 then your dev project_a build.gradle file should contain edit i have created a toy example following the project layout you ve described in your question

23429587
clang	llvm
also make sure you re not accidently using your systems clang
if you do emcc -v test.cpp assuming test.cpp is your file your compiling it should tell you exactly what headers llvm clang and node its going to rely on

23431186
client-side	server-side
sure you can access them on the client-side via plain javascript but don t expect them to be posted to the server
the problem is that dropdownlist s are rendered as elements on the client side and as such you cannot add an attribute to an element in html and retrieve it on the server-side because they are not posted

23432527
ant	emma
for more details troubleshooting if your os doesn t know the commands you have to add some paths to the environment path variable of you os you have to add the path of the android.bat normally tools and the path of the ant.bat depending where you installed ant
if you use eclipse with adt it is normally there plugins org.apache.ant... bin if you re using sdk 13 or older you ve to use ant coverage instead of ant emma debug install test the tests are running completely but there is no report and there is also a failed -message which contains permission denied you need to use a rooted device or an emulator generally it could help to clean your projects when you get a build failed if you have libraries that you use and you get an error

23434058
stringtemplate	xtend
the only thing you have to cope with is the interface igenerator it should be possible to call stringtemplate from there implementing the call in java or xtend
you do not have to use xtend to write the code generator

23434217
implements	extends
according to the php documentation datetime does not natively implements the __tostring method which explains the exceptions you keep getting
you may extends datetime and implements __tostring yourself provided you are using php 5.2 or later

23435637
sctp	tcp
i also highly doubt that media will ever support a tcp connection and suspect that only sctp will be supported for any tcp connection relayed or not
stun cannot work with tcp over a nat

23435637
google-chrome	firefox	sctp	tcp
sorry for the bad news edit this is simply a limitation of stun not of sctp so google-chrome could do nothing about it if they wanted to
firefox does not support sctp over tcp anyways

23436139
jar	manifest.mf
you need to look for implementation-version which if present is a free-text string so entirely up to the jar s author as to what you ll find in there. see also oracle docs and package version specificaion
just to expand on the answers above inside the meta-inf manifest.mf file in the jar you will likely see a line manifest-version 1.0 this is not the jar versions number

23441275
hex	binary
if you are working off specs that someone else provided you with maybe when they said 2 bytes they actually meant two 8-bit numbers which correspond to 4 digits four 4-bit nibbles in your hex string
but your string looks like it contains binary data as well not just characters

23441508
super	extends
you only need to add a super call in a constructor when you want to invoke a superclass constructor with arguments
every class that doesn t explicitly extends another class implicitly extends java.lang.object

23443142
udp	tcp
udp udp doesn t have any flow control mechanism as tcp
however there is an other implementation of udp such as rudp that have some of the features of tcp like flow control

23445262
ubuntu	linux
if you really want to host internally i d setup an ubuntu server in hyper-v use nginx and be done with it
on the other hand if your shop isn t built to deal with managing a linux server or hosting a rails app internally i think it would be more reasonable to consider heroku or another paas before dealing with iis

23446313
octal	decimal
trivia 0 itself is actually in octal for this reason not decimal
integer literals starting with 0 are in octal base 8

23448834
kerberos	ntlm
if you have a strict kerberos spnego only environment safest but all clients and users need to kerberos spnego enabled then use spnego.prompt.ntlm false because we only allow kerberos s pnego.allow.basic false because we only allow kerberos spnego.allow.unsecure.basic false not relevant because spnego.allow.basic false if you want to allow additional authentication mechanisms in addition to kerberos spnego than you have to decide which ones ntlm and or basic
ntlm is not supported by this library so basic is the only one left

23449020
jar	war
java.lang.classnotfoundexception org.omnifaces.exceptionhandler.fullajaxexceptionhandlerfactory the classnotfoundexception means that the mentioned class or at least the jar file containing the mentioned class isn t present in the current runtime classpath
when deployed as a war file the webapp s runtime classpath covers among others the following paths war s web-inf classes - for loose .class files usually ide will do it automatically for source files in the src folder of the project

23452695
ansible	puppet
however it does not support mint 13 its output is chef puppet or bash not ansible and it has not been updated in a few months...but that project does what you are thinking of
ansible is not really designed to copy an existing system. you ll have to create a playbook by hand

23453349
spaces	linefeed
token-by-token explanation match a single character from the list match any single character that is not a line break character linefeed between zero and unlimited times as few times as possible expanding as needed lazy assert that the regex below can be matched starting at this position positive lookahead match this alternative attempting the next alternative only if this one fails match the character literally match a single character that is a whitespace character ascii spaces tab linefeed carriage return vertical tab form feed between zero and unlimited times as many times as possible giving back as needed greedy assert that it is impossible to match the regex below starting at this position negative lookahead match any single character not present in the list between zero and unlimited times as many times as possible giving back as needed greedy match the character literally match a single character from the list or match this alternative the entire group fails if this one fails to match assert position at the end of the string or before the line break at the end of the string if any linefeed debuggex demo
looks to me like you want something like this demo on regex101 we match one opening quote then lazily match everything with up to a point where our lookahead is able to assert that the following characters are either a comma followed by optional spaces which are not followed by any number of non-parens characters followed by a closing parenthesis and a closing quote or the end of the string the anchor

23454947
pascal	delphi
i have not worked with fast report web server myself but for my own delphi free pascal http server applications i use apache as reverse proxy
cgi would launch the delphi application for every incoming http request causing much more server resource load than using the fastreport http server

23455932
super	implements
if you have not written that it automatically calls the super methods
but okay if you want to handle the stuff yourself like calling dispose on a screen or calling the init before you set a new screen you need to write your own game class which implements the applicationlistener interface

23458170
fgets	strncpy
for instance note that you #define typesize 180 but then read in 1 000 characters with fgets so you might read in more data than you have space to store it which would be bad
strncpy is an alternative which lets you put a limit on the number of characters copied but strncpy will not null-terminate the string if it hits the limit and sometimes when using filenames making only a partial copy of data and then using it can be as bad as having an overflow so either way you generally need to check your input pretty rigorously and manage your memory carefully

23458618
build.gradle	gradlew
now start by creating a build.gradle file in your project root
if you try to run the gradlew build in intellij now you will get the message error running build module your-plugin is not backed by gradlew

23459746
move	drag
listen for mousemove events and move the dragged circle by the distance the mouse has move since the last mousemove event listen for mouseup events and stop the drag operation here is annotated code and a demo
to outline your solution listen for mousedown events and either 1 create a new circle if the mouse is not over a circle or 2 start a drag operation on a circle if the mouse is over a circle

23462279
realloc	malloc
free is only for memory allocated with malloc or calloc or realloc
as you are not using malloc anywhere you really have no business using free

23462509
client-side	server-side
you should not rely on client-side validation as it is fairly easy to skip
always validate on server-side of your application

23463031
google-chrome	firefox
you can find this by using google-chrome s inspect element option in the context menu or by using firefox and the firebug extension
with google-chrome right-click on the webpage after you ve agreed to the terms and select inspect element click resources - cookies select the only element in the list copy the value of the asp.net_sessionid element with firebug right-click on the webpage after you ve agreed to the terms and click inspect element with firebug click cookies copy the value of the asp.net_sessionid element in my case i got ihbjzynwfcfvq4nzkncbviou - it might work for you if not you need to perform the above procedure

23463715
clang	llvm
clang and edg offers ast and symbol table construction
clang but i don t think edg has it has flow analysis at the llvm level but not flow analysis at the ast level afaik

23463715
clang	llvm
clang but i don t think edg has it has flow analysis at the llvm level but not flow analysis at the ast level afaik
neither clang nor edg offer the source pattern transformation capability so which is better depends on your long term tasks

23464976
debian	linux
my configuration is ocaml 4.01.0 installed via opam 1.1 linux debian squeeze bolt 1.4 core 111.08.00
in linux it is not accepted

23466097
ubuntu	linux
but it is and that s why on my ubuntu box the environment variable lang is set to es_es.utf-8 and not just es_es
or es_pe as it should be except that i keep running into little issues with that locale. if you re using a linux system you might find something similar

23470780
octal	binary	octal	decimal
other available options for number bases in verilog are b0 binary base2 o0 octal base8 d0 decimal base10 h0 hexadecimal base16
when you write below the right hand side is an integer decimal base10 not binary base2

23475916
ienumerable	iqueryable
list is just an output format and while it implements ienumerable is not directly related to querying
in other words when you re using iqueryable you re defining and expression that gets translated into something else

23476450
jar	war
you end up with a jar file
war files were not designed to be executable although it works

23477390
multiplying	multiplication
a straightforward implementation of matrix multiplying is not very cache friendly
the comment that you were told is probably referring to blocking which will do the multiplication in blocks to improve locality

23478172
daemons	systemd
and whether the app is a daemons or not is also irrelevant
what s relevant is whether the operating systemd considers your device to be a keyboard or not

23478242
comparator	comparable
you are confusing the type of the data your mintreeheap ought to store with the type of the comparator saying that t shall be both a comparator and the type of the items the comparator should compare makes no sense
and the defaultcomparator expects a type extending comparable which your t type variable does not fulfill

23479568
draggable	droppable
basically what we need to do is start the draggable with this option updated codepen
if you look closely we can still make it work the way it is if we go out of the droppable area and come back but that is not what we want when we try to make an usable interface

23479568
draggable	droppable
so the matter is that when we start to drag the droppable seems not to be expecting that the draggable will already be hovering
luckily for us draggable elements can be started with refreshpositions option which when set to true will calculate the position in every mouse move following the docs if set to true all droppable positions are calculated on every mousemove

23480467
punctuation	words
this uses words boundaries so it will not include punctuation
the regex w will allow you to split your string and create a list of words

23483882
oncreate	setcontentview
if that s the case then the following line in oncreate ... ...is failing to find an edittext with resource id r.id.id_st1_date_edit which suggests that particular edittext isn t in your activity_main.xml layout file
bearing in mind you re calling setcontentview ... in several places i m guessing it s actually in the browse_new.xml layout file or another layout file

23489038
org.json	jackson
that may only be my opinion as well but really when it comes to json anything is better than org.json
your gist shows org.json code not jackson

23489038
org.json	jackson
your gist shows org.json code not jackson
jackson has a perfectly able .equals implementation for all jsonnode s

23489599
interpolation	splines
interpolation on irregular 2d data is not that easy
i know of no true splines generalization to irregular 2d

23489998
postgresql	mysql
one year later - still not soaring like mysql but there seems to be a way according to this official hhvm blog comment reply from 19th december 2013 jeremy wilson says i d like to see redis and postgresql support
reply simon says redis support is already available and there s a postgresql extension you can use

23490083
jtextfield	jlabel
don t to use keylistener for swing jcomponents keylistener doesn t react correctly to backspace nor for inserted array of chars from clipboard copy - paste use documentlistener added to derived editor jtextfield jformattedtextfield from jspinner
my jspinner does not reflect the value to jlabel when i change the value using keyboard

23490856
innodb	myisam
you have to use innodb for it though
myisam does not support this

23493199
qthread	qobject
subclassing qthread is not recommended because of problems with signalling
better to use worker objects and move them to threads via qobject movetothread

23494240
ssl	https
looking at iana s list of uri schemes i did not see ssl therefore i would suggest against using it in any situation
https is http protocol encrypted with ssl

23496710
firefox	safari
trevor dixon s answer does fix safari but breaks in even the latest firefox typeerror not enough arguments to mouseevent.initmouseevent the best way to support safari mdash
without breaking firefox mdash

23497074
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
tested in ie7-10 firefox google-chrome safari
the only browser i have encountered that does not support .click is safari

23497206
bash	subshell
to do this in the first way - you cannot directly process but you can pass it as an argument to bash and then process it as a positional parameter
so instead of you can use instead of using -exec to execute tar directly a bash subshell is called passing the tar command as the argument for the -c option

23499060
bash	subshell
you should move the subshell later on this prints your subject and to lines before any other output but bash will not process those lines
because you have put the subshell first your subject and to print lines are printed before the output of exim and are being processed by bash

23502573
shadowing	named
simply use the variable normally and it should work as you expected note also that you are shadowing the built-in function dict by naming your variable dict - it is preferable to use another named because of this
enclosing your variable named in quotes makes them strings - python is looking for the key of the letter f not the key with the integer in the f variable

23503283
gulp-sass	node-sass
gulp-sass uses node-sass as it s sass compiler
referring to the node-sass docs it does not have a debug_info

23505395
imperative	declarative
in theory not always true but generally reattaching the handler applies to handlers that are being generated in imperative code buried somewhere in a controller or another directive or something
using a nice declarative directive like ng-click shouldn t be a problem because those handlers are going to be re-attached for you by angular whenever that template is rendered

23507404
libsvm	liblinear
liblinear you should know that the implementations differ a little bit in the formulation of the objective function libsvm solves the following dual problem on the other hand the dual form of liblinear with a l2-regularized l1-loss svc solver is .
not to mention that the algorithms are coded with different goals in mind libsvm is written in a way to allow switching between different kernel functions while liblinear is optimized to always be linear and have no concept of kernels at all

23507404
libsvm	liblinear
not to mention that the algorithms are coded with different goals in mind libsvm is written in a way to allow switching between different kernel functions while liblinear is optimized to always be linear and have no concept of kernels at all
which is why libsvm is not easily applicable to large scale problems even with a linear kernel and often it is suggested to use liblinear when you have large number of instances

23507404
libsvm	liblinear
which is why libsvm is not easily applicable to large scale problems even with a linear kernel and often it is suggested to use liblinear when you have large number of instances
furthermore regarding multi-class problems with k classes libsvm by default implements the one-against-one approach by constructing binary classifiers while liblinear implements the one-vs-the-rest strategy by constructing k binary classifiers it also has an alternative method by crammer and singer for handling multi-class problems

23507404
libsvm	liblinear
for instance i know that libsvm converts a categorical feature with m possible values into a m numeric 0-1 features encoded as binary indicator attributes i.e only one of them is one rest is zeros
i m not sure what liblinear does with discrete features

23511602
prepare	execute
you should definitely use the prepare api and pass values separately from the query as opposed to doing plain string interpolation bad
for binding parameters you have three options bindparam bindvalue execute it doesn t really matter which of these you use they re all equally secure

23513765
ssl	https
advantages if you ve disabled ssl check in development environment by following way then passing won t explicitly add https links to your view
this is not the case if you specify and disable ssl check

23515167
daemons	systemd
by now the reasons are obvious if the daemons is started from a terminal we want to be able to use that terminal for other tasks at a later time
for example if we start the daemons from a terminal log off the terminal and someone else logs in on that terminal we do not want any daemons error messages appearing during the next user s terminal session. unp p 331 correctly handle the following circumstances started by systemd v init process a daemons should be launchable at boot time obviously

23515167
daemons	systemd
for example if we start the daemons from a terminal log off the terminal and someone else logs in on that terminal we do not want any daemons error messages appearing during the next user s terminal session. unp p 331 correctly handle the following circumstances started by systemd v init process a daemons should be launchable at boot time obviously
daemons termination by sigterm signal sigterm means signal terminate

23516392
wadl	wsdl
that said if you are interested in discovering more about restful services and wadl you may want to consider experimenting with the open-source soapui web service test utility which provides support for wadl
since microsoft .net does not natively support wadl wadl is wsdl for rest providing a specific answer to your question is a bit difficult

23521300
implements	extends
i m not sure if you are implements responsehandler right or if onconnected is even firing you need to check that first
your module as do all modules extends krollmodule which extends krollproxy which handles events

23521417
bmp	png
may be that bmp is not supported
if you follow the java source code from the constructor of imageicon you end up at according to this article imageicon supports gif jpeg or png

23521990
google-chrome	firefox
you can try a simple example yourself the above works in google-chrome and ie but doesn t in firefox although there is an error
try putting the declaration of embedformatampm outside of your if i may be a being slightly unfair to say that firefox chokes - according to the spec the only thing allowed within a block are statements and a function declaration is not a statement

23523017
backtracking	greedy
because that works there s no backtracking
now you need to add a greedy match before your expression yet do not consume those characters

23527168
express	node.js
until there s definition file for express 4+ i d suggest you use javascript for the core of the application as it shouldn t need to change much and use typescript for things like application logic controllers etc.
in a node.js it s easy to mix and match

23531680
client-side	server-side
client-side validation is a nice feature but shouldn t be relied upon
server-side validation is what is critical

23532026
implements	extends
you don t always want to exclude all sub classes when implements an equals method only ones that override equals
if as you described there was a position3d class extends position and position3d had an additional field z that was part of the position3d equals method then of course that position3d should not be equal to any normal 2d position

23534603
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions throwable and any subclass of throwable that is not also a subclass of either runtimeexception or error are regarded as checked exceptions
below image will help you to understand exception hierarchy image ref programcreek as you can see throwable is superclass of error and exception while exception deals with checked and unchecked-exception

23535395
opera	google-chrome
the following fixes it in google-chrome alas not sure why it then doesn t work in opera
edit after a bit more testing it looks like opera can t quite cope with attributes src and ng src on the same element

23535672
opera	google-chrome
internet explorer and opera seem to misinterpret the spec on this
the xhtml spec outlines this algorithm that google-chrome does not implement fully

comparator	comparable
you can do either one of these in order to be able to use collections.sort subclass xmlgregoriancalendar and implement comparable create your own comparator for sorting your map using the builtin xmlgregoriancalendar.compare method be aware that sorting a map will involve using either sortedmap or treemap iirc
although there is a compare method xmlgregoriancalendar does not implement comparable so you cannot use the default sort methods

23538369
punctuation	words
also note that fscanf does not have the same notion of sentences and punctuation we have a full stop is likely to be sitting at the end of the string as in 1972. in your screenshot
you should therefore check whether the words has a full stop

23544623
equals	compareto
the result is true if and only if the argument is not null and is a string object that represents the same sequence of characters as this object. overrides equals ... in object parameters anobject the object to compare this string against returns true if the given object represents a string equivalent to this string false otherwise see also compareto string equalsignorecase string you may use str3.tostring equals str4
because the equals in class string has been over-written to compare the content while the equals in class stringbuffer remained inherited from class object which compares the address

23546497
atom-editor	sublimetext
advantages of atom-editor is entry-level hackability since it s built on the same code that powers web sites
advantages of sublimetext is performance as it doesn t need to run on top of node.js and it s a more mature product about to reach a stable version 3

23547594
profiling	instrumentation
profiling and test your code regularly at both the m-code and java level to make sure your bottlenecks are where you think they are and to see if there are parameters that need to be adjusted based on your data set size both in terms of row counts and column counts and types
i also like to build in some instrumentation and logging at both the matlab and java layer so you can easily get performance measurements have it summarize how much time it spent parsing different column types how much in the java layer and how much in the matlab layer and how much waiting on the server s responses probably not much due to pipelining but you never know

23548518
implements	extends
interface my gets tostring method from object class and it is not implements in the temp class
in addition to implementing my class temp extends object

profiling	benchmarking
edit original benchmarking for large dataset edit benchmarking for large dataset after da optimization #1 edit benchmarking for large data set after da optimization #2 note warning resulting from update #2 to testda memory and time profiling on large data set 50 iterations each profiling code testar profiling results testda profiling results testrb profiling results conclusion as far as i can tell arun s answer is the fastest and most memory efficient
rbatt answer scales better with data set size than does da s answer my initial guess was that approaches using posix or date classes might not scale well but i m unsure if this hunch is supported by the profiling results

23553340
onclick	onchange
you need an additional onclick handler on the checkbox to prevent the click from bubbling up
in your first example with a checkbox inside a div onchange is not the same event as onclick so calling event.stoppropagation in the onchange handler will not stop the outer onclick from firing

23559403
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the tag is supported in internet explorer 10 firefox opera and google-chrome
note that the tag is not supported in internet explorer 9 and earlier versions or in safari

23565272
bash	subshell
you can find it in bash manual please check things results in a subshell here
what you are doing you are executing test1 in a subshell child shell and child shells cannot modify anything in parent

23565911
ssl	https
a server doesn t need an ssl certificate in this case
https is used when you want to ensure that communication with the server is encrypted

23565962
rtp	rtcp
a participant need not use the same ssrc identifier for all the rtp sessions in a multimedia session
the binding of the ssrc identifiers is provided through rtcp see section 6.5.1

23566225
required	placeholder
the required fields are a width and height for the applet and a ref and id for the placeholder in the html where the applet will be inserted
i m not entirely clear what the ref is used for the id is used as an id attribute in the relevant . enter the required values and others as needed

23567195
ffmpeg	libav
you can then locate the documentation for that release by checking out the corresponding version from the ffmpeg repo
you may also find the documentation included with the tarball here . note that i m not sure whether the ffmpeg package included with your version of ubuntu is the real ffmpeg or the so-called libav fork of ffmpeg

23569609
fread	read.table
the solution would look something like replace with t for a tab let s make up some data josh s answer fread + concat.split.dt which is like using fread twice but is still super fast unbalanced data although it doesn t apply to your problem i should mention this for the benefit of others who might need to solve a similar problem one limitation of the above is that concat.split.dt only handles balanced data
fread doesn t have a fill argument like read.table does and i seem to remember reading somewhere that it most likely won t have such an argument

23569609
fread	read.table
fread doesn t have a fill argument like read.table does and i seem to remember reading somewhere that it most likely won t have such an argument
here s an example of what i mean by unbalanced read.table can handle that with the argument concat.split.dt will give you a nasty error in such cases but you can try my csplit function instead

23573102
n-gram	words
you are trying to filter the n-gram in the query itself. it is probably more efficient to do it in two steps. start with a table with all possible n-gram create table original ngram varchar 100 not null go create table refined ngram varchar 100 not null primary key go insert into original ngram select distinct ngram from n-gram where ngram in stack stack overflow protection go insert into refined ngram select ngram from original then delete the ones you do not want. for each ngram generate all possible substrings
for each substring delete that entry if any from the list. it takes a couple of nested loops but unless your n-gram contain an extremely large number of words it should not take much time

23573102
n-gram	words
for each substring delete that entry if any from the list. it takes a couple of nested loops but unless your n-gram contain an extremely large number of words it should not take much time
what s left is a table with only the longest n-gram call refine

23575714
dictionary	map
this is not strictly a difference of dictionary itself and one can still use mutable custom types as keys although such is discouraged in most cases
both ruby s hash and python s dictionary represent a map abstract data type adt

23576394
spaces	linefeed
not a terrible problem but limits input to 17 bytes while you have spaces for 128
the read system call returns the linefeed but doesn t null terminate the string

23577401
inline	inlining
so if the compiler doesn t want to inline there s not much you can do about it and nothing you should do about it
in the c languages there is simply no way to force inlining

23577401
inline	inlining
inline is just a hint to the compiler to perform inlining but it is not required to do so
the only way to force inline would be to use preprocessor macros but that s easy to get wrong

23578572
ssl	https
this is most commonly used but not limited to proxying ssl connections like those used for https
indy s tidhttp component uses connect internally when you have configured a proxy host port in the tidhttp.proxyparams property and then request an https url

23586374
equals	gethashcode
the reason the has been added to the .net framework is to allow you to customize the logic to hash-based containers in cases when you cannot modify the class with a different override of equals gethashcode say it s in someone else s library or you do not want to change the default implementation for any other reason - for example for backward compatibility
this is the primary purpose of having this interface you give it to hash containers and they use it instead of the equals gethashcode logic that comes with the object

23587417
mvp	presenter
in these cases you can user supervising controller which is a sub type of mvp where some basic rendering that is not related to the business logic is left in the view and more complex logic is done in the presenter controller
you can find information about it here there is also another sub type called passive view where the view only holds controls and the presenter is responsible for passing values to the view

23589144
operands	scalar
the value computations but not the side effect of the two operands of + are sequenced before computation of the result of the + operator
in particular because the side effect storing the decrement value on a scalar object _suma is unsequenced with respect to a value computation using the value of the same scalar object computation of the value of the first operand of + the behavior is undefined

23593562
operands	scalar
since at least one of your operands appears to be a vector of boolean conditions matlab is telling you that the shortcut evaluation cannot be peformed
you put this in an if so you needed a single scalar boolean anyway

23595919
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
compiler will not inline virtual functions unless it can determine the type of the object the virtual function belongs to the compiler will inline-functions that are small and or only called once particularly if the function is static
since inlining happens towards the end of compilation when all the source code have been parsed and placed in some sort of ast abstract syntax tree or similar form whether the function is before or after the point of usage typically doesn t really matter - of course if the call is to a function that isn t part of the ast the source code is not available the compiler has no choice but to not inline it

23595919
inline	inlining

the exception to can t inline when the source isn t available is so called lto link time optimisation

23597222
google-chrome	firefox
when a third party program installs an extension the google-chrome menu will be badged and users can click through the google-chrome menu to see a dialog containing an option to enable the extension or to remove it from their computer. source not sure if the badge bits are still the case though considering this post is from 2012 and iirc there are plans to outright disable all non-webstore installs at some point
regarding firefox no there is no supported way of doing silent or auto-enabled add-on installs in firefox

23602227
email	dkim
email deliverability issues are the reason why people tends to buy a paid services
if you setup own mail server you must consider at least setup mail daemon for receiving and sending like apache james setup dns related things like spf dkim ptr-record etc rate limited sending some provider doesn t like when you throw 1000 email at once

23605908
inline	inlining
an implementation is not required to perform this inline substitution at the point of call
funcion inlining is a compile time action

23605908
inline	inlining
for example large methods recursive methods methods containing loops or other method invocation are usually not inline d
when compiler do performs inlining it replaces method call with method body somewhat similar to macro expansion but this process is more complex

23609775
aggregate-functions	sum
sqlfiddle demo i ve tried to write a recursive cte but it s not possible to have aggregate-functions such as sum in it
this will get the full report the first query get the rolling sum by hacking the structure of the department name for the oens without the amounts the second one get the leafs

23610512
rtp	rtsp
i am not sure it is even possible to send audio and video over the same rtp stream in this manner in gstreamer
i know that the rtsp server implementation in gstreamer allows audio and video together but even in it i am not sure if it is still two streams just being abstracted away from implementation

23610627
fgets	strtod
read it all into a string with fgets
if you just want everything they enter to be a single int walk the string and look for isdigit on each char and then when you find that it is all just digits call strtod if not emit an error and re-prompt

23613002
pycharm	spyder
i have just started to use pycharm and it seems to be very good this reminds my rstudio
i do not think that this supports an interactive console like the one inside spyder or emacs

23613148
google-chrome	firefox
so your code in another.js will be like then if you are testing this in your local using google-chrome browser it may not work
because google-chrome doesn t support local ajax call and it will give xmlhttprequest cannot load anyways in firefox and other browsers it will work fine

23614947
memcpy	strcpy
don t use string functions with non-string data.in this case i guess you might want memcpy
you should incidentally get a warning from the strcpy call as one pointer is not correct

23616550
haskell	agda	haskell	idris
what you re wanting is dependent types which haskell doesn t have
dependent types are those that depend on values so using dependent types you could encode at the type level a vector with length 5 as again haskell does not have dependent types but languages like agda coq and idris do support them

23617981
union	distinct
select distinct fr_om from table union select distinct to from table
select distinct fr_om from table union select distinct to from table where to not in select distinct fr_om from table updated you can just use union to remove the duplicates from your result set

23621298
mongodb	bson
compiling and linking the mongodb dll should be possible but i ve never tried it
bson file is binary it s not human-readable

23624284
hex	binary
this is a bit tricky in python because aren t looking to convert the floating-point value to a hex integer
instead you re trying to interpret the ieee 754 binary representation of the floating-point value as hex

23626450
factors	matrix
library lattice library nlme data mathachieve below i convert ses and meanses into factors using cut with breakpoints as in the wikipedia example
i m not sure how to plot the four panels as on the wikipedia page so i ll just subset to non-minority females to convert this dataframe to a matrix i split it to a list and then coerce back to a matrix with the appropriate dimensions

23627100
portrait	landscape
controller and should only support portrait view
b - vc that is not embedded inside a vc and should support landscape only

23628119
dictionary	map
use a dictionary to map e nums keys to something readable values i assume your keys are strings
if not will work as well. update wrt comment added code create fill the dictionary before the loop assuming update.msrcseverity contains the e nums you are interested in change to not really tested

23628337
implements	extends
so for example this is your first version of the interface this interface would then be implements on a class like this then when you need to add new functionality create a version 2 you would create another interface with the same name but with a 2 on the end and the mathematicaloperationimpl would be extended to implements this new interface all of your new future clients could start using the version 2 interface but your existing clients would continue to work because they will only know about the first version of the interface
i encountered a similar issue some time ago and found the best way was not to try and extends an existing interface but to provide different versions of the interface with each new interface providing extra functionality

23629800
bash	zsh
msysgit does not support other shells than the built-in bash
you may consider using cygwin - if you can t live without zsh i understand you - which also provides a git-package

23630578
oncreate	onstart
to restore your data it doesn t matter if onrestoreinstancestate or oncreate is used
quote from the doc this method is called after onstart when the activity is being re-initialized from a previously saved state given here in savedinstancestate

23631167
bison	jison
when using bison and flex you d put the lexer s definitions the scanner generator in jison parlance in a .l file and the grammar in a .y file
i do not think there exist a way using bison and flex or yacc lex to combine the two files

23631167
bison	jison
i do not think there exist a way using bison and flex or yacc lex to combine the two files
it has been a very long while since i ve used bison and flex so it is not impossible that there s something i don t know. the fact is that although jison takes inspiration from bison and flex it is really an independent tool

23635094
onclick	onsubmit
if you really want to put something there it s onclick you need
onsubmit should be on the form tag not the input

23640336
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome would not display the files and ie compatibility mode would corrupt them
i did not test it in firefox before finding a solution

23640336
google-chrome	firefox
pdf file is now viewable in google-chrome and ie compatibility mode
in firefox the file actually downloads but i am not too worried about that

23642189
google-chrome	safari
the google-chrome frame plugin for ie has been discontinued so that s not a good solution either
the best option out there for now is adopting temasys plugin for ie and safari

23642730
super	extends
generate the stub or call super 0 instead of super in your remote object constructor so you don t need one
if your remote object doesn t extends unicastremoteobject use unicastremoteobject.exportobject with a port number even zero for the same reason

23644298
config	ini
from the debug config dialog php script tab choose alternate php then click the button installed php... then add or edit the php executable info as mentioned
typically cli php would read the ini file in conf.d where xdebug.ini would normally reside but not under php eclipse pdt hence the root cause of this problem

23644403
concave	convex
you can use if you aren t comfortable using this library you can use this algorithm to convert your concave shape to convex this is not meant to be used just really bad pseudocode for you to understand how convex hull is computed in other words you just remove concave parts
see also check out note both of these problems solve the convex case

23645065
profiling	debugging
if that doesn t speed your app up then try installing the profiling suggested or the one i prefer and see what is taking the most time to run
you can enable either profiling so that they run even when debugging mode is false

23645343
ubuntu	centos
for example your centos 6 binary might not run on centos 5 or ubuntu 10.04
but might run fine on centos 7 and ubuntu 12.04 14.04

23647548
decimal	ieee
if b 2 and p 24 then the decimal number 0.1 cannot be represented exactly but is approximately 1.10011001100110011001101 2 -4
the problem is that most floating point implementation are based on ieee 754

23649109
google-chrome	firefox
with four web workers ie and google-chrome seems to share the work among all the processors about equally with none pegged
firefox tends to use some of the processors for most of the work and others not very much

23649623
move	drag
hopefully you see the issue now for touchevents when a user touches but does not move you only trigger touchstart and touchend
it isn t until a user drag that touchmove gets called which in turn calls the function touchmoved that calls inputmoved - which updates your posx posy values

23650855
bash	zsh
also when you say shell i m assuming you mean bash but if you can use zsh it s as easy as for lower case and for upper case
i know this is an oldish post but i made this answer for another site so i thought i d post it up here upper - lower use python or ruby or perl probably my favorite or php or awk or sed or bash 4 or nodejs if you have it and are a bit nuts... you could also use dd but i wouldn t

23656613
stateless	stateful
the main difference between a stateful and a stateless bean is this if your bean is stateless then methoda and methodb are not guaranteed to be running on exactly the same bean instance at the server side
if your bean is stateful then methoda and methodb are guaranteed to be running on exactly the same bean instance at the server side

23659842
punctuation	words
the only thing that changes is how we parse whether or not the words has a white space character punctuation or letter after it not any other character like or anything like that
we can either exclude the characters we don t want etc or require the characters we do want white space punctuation etc

23660874
ienumerable	ilist
where returns an ienumerable not a list
since you don t actually need your traces variable to be an ilist here you should type it as an ienumerable to avoid the needless overhead of populating the results of your query into a list just so that you can iterate over that list and populate a new list

23660874
ienumerable	iqueryable
if it s important to materialize the results of the query into a list at some later point in time after you have finished constructing the query then you can call tolist on the ienumerable to build up a list with the results
on top of the above it appears that your actual data source is an iqueryable representing a query against a database not an in memory collection

23661568
shadowing	named
this can cause shadowing warnings it can cause linker errors it can cause all sorts of confusion to anyone who uses your header
it can also cause problems to someone who doesn t use your header by causing a collision with someone else who also happens to use your variable named as a global

23662082
google-chrome	firefox
in addition it runs curiously faster on firefox than on google-chrome under windows
for ubuntu actually i had to downgrade my firefox to the version 24 to have it work but since it s only a dev machine it doesn t bother me p.s superdevmode might compile faster if optimized hoestly i didn t try it increasing the localworkers could reduce compile time and make superdevmode a good solution but i can t tell you

23662612
backtracking	greedy
a greedy quantifier will take all possible characters and only after if needed will backtracking to make the next subpattern in your example match
but if instead of the dot that matches all except newlines you use a negated character class that doesn t contain the character you are sure to not have the steps of backtracking

23663406
spaces	delimiter
since the difference between multiple spaces and genuine tabs is usually not obvious you typically can t tell by looking at it as in the question copying and pasting may even quietly convert from tabs to spaces the more robust solution is not to rely on using the - prefix - sadly at the expense of readability depending on how the string is used leading spaces in the document itself - as opposed to the closing delimiter - may still be acceptable though
by default a here-doc closing delimiter must start at the very beginning of the line otherwise it won t be recognized

23663529
keystore	jks
this occurs because the system thinks you are trying to read a different type of keystore and not jks
you will need to specify that the file is jks or convert it to the other format

23665622
gson	jackson
gson works mainly by reflection on instance fields
so if you do not plan to move to jackson that has this feature i think you cannot have a general way to call your setters

23667472
division	multiplication
somehow the float library is more efficient in multiplication with all the fractions overhead than integer division
native avr arduino does not have multiplication or division functions much less native floating point handling

23667522
strtol	atoi
or better use strtol to get better stability
is a string i.e a null-terminated char array casting it to int doesn t give the result you expected you should use atoi to do the job

23667596
libstdc++	libc++
os x 10.9.x the default is libc++ as you know the including flag -stdlib libstdc++ links your project correctly
since you re trying to compile code that uses symbols that are not within the design of the newer llvm libc++ standard library you receive errors

23668114
floating-point	fractions
obligatory link what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic another link that might be helpful is to delphi s math.samevalue function that allows you to compare two floating point values for approximate equality depending on a specific allowable delta difference
short answer 0.7 cannot be represented exactly binary floating point values are always fractions with denominator that is a power of 2.

23672687
octal	hex
decode ... doesn t support u escapes only octal escapes.
it looks to me like you ve taken data in the form of 7-bit ascii with 2-byte unicode hex escapes uxxxx and stored it in a varchar typed field

23674340
fileoutputstream	filewriter	fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter
again fileoutputstream has a constructor allowing you to append instead of overwriting
the bufferedwriter isn t the problem - it s the way you re constructing the filewriter

23674340
filewriter	bufferedwriter
the bufferedwriter isn t the problem - it s the way you re constructing the filewriter
you can simply use the constructor overload which takes an append parameter new filewriter . cat info.txt true personally i would avoid using filewriter at all though it doesn t allow you to specify the encoding which means it will always use the platform-default encoding

23679026
inline	inlining
for some reason the intel compiler doesn t do inlining of functions in offloaded code i m not all that familiar with the concept so i don t know what the technical reason for this is . see effective-use-of-the-intel-compilers-offload-features for more information just search for inline
quoting from the linked article function inlining into offload constructs sometimes inlining a function is necessary for optimum performance of the generated code

23679174
setinterval	settimeout
reference settimeout cleartimeout setinterval clearinterval
if you want the code to run every 5 seconds and an ad hoc call to the code should reset the 5 second interval then you need to capture the return of settimeout and clear it with cleartimeout mdn within getopentickets if you want the code to run every 5 seconds regardless of whether you ve executed the code in an ad hoc fashion i would separate the code that creates the regular call from the call itself and use setinterval mdn instead of settimeout now you can call getopentickets ad hoc whenever you want but it s not going to compound the regular call

23679446
uicollectionview	uitableview
i think you can try resending touch events from your uicollectionview to uitableview. manually calling touchesbegin touchesmoved touchesended etc. maybe overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended methods will work for your case
you can try overriding uicollectionview with your subclass with property set to your uitableview instance and implementing touch handling methods with something like this hope it will help however i m not 100 sure about it

23679626
inline	constexpr
d suffers from the same shortcoming and another one function call run-time performance penalty because it can not be inline
2 avoid using non- constexpr a because of static initialization order fiasco

23680002
stateless	stateful
i just tried to use the javax.ejb.sessionsynchronization interface with a stateless session bean and was confused not to get any calls of the three implemented methods
then i saw this comment in the javax.ejb.sessionsynchronization javadoc only a stateful session bean with container-managed transaction demarcation can receive session synchronization notifications

23684224
implements	extends
an abstract class is a way to create a base class you don t need your developers instantiating directly because usually there is still missing code from it like methods were not fully implements
so you create an abstract which implements the common methods of your concrete restart classes and then you implement one by one of those classes extends your abstract and creating the missing methods option 1 if your whole application can use a single implementation of it and you just need the ability to swap from one to another because your business somehow changed a simple binding will do the trick app bind restartinterface apponerestart

23684859
strtol	atoi
to interpret the input as a binary number you can use strtol like this
atoi interprets its input as a decimal number not a binary number

23687673
stateless	stateful
first it s difficult to say if your service in your example is stateless or not but the interaction you have there in that particular method doesn t indicate that you are doing anything stateful with the service itself
that would lead me to believe that the service is going to be stateless

23687857
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so when your subclass of uiviewcontroller is the rootviewcontroller you get the log message
but when it is a child view controller of uinavigationcontroller you do not

23688382
implements	extends
of course it s not necessary to have the imageview implements the listeningtarget but i found it easier than searching for the right view every time a bitmap is loaded by picasso
when using picasso with item renderers in a list grid i ended up using the listeningtarget interface the lib provides create a custom class that extends imageview and implements listeningtarget

23689557
factors	mean
if another one of these is being called m times when it could be called just once the slowdown factors is n m. and whether or not there is such a slowdown the hot path would not look much different . so you cannot tell from looking at the hot path where the problem is except to say it is likely to be in one of those nine routines at the point where it calls the one below
since the percentages are in decreasing order they cannot be inclusive time because inclusive time must include not only the calls shown in these stack traces but other stack traces as well that just weren t the heaviest . for example common wisdom says you should focus on the call from rigidbodytoparenttransform to nodetophysicstransform because the number on the left drops from 30.3 to 14.0 . but that does not mean there s lots of self time in rigidbodytoparenttransform because there isn t

23689775
client-side	server-side
slow blocking codes can cause poor performances both on the client-side as well as server-side
you can run slow work on a separate thread and that might work well enough on the client-side but may not help on the server-side

23689782
factors	mean
this means it s safe to convert to a character matrix now you can replace the na values in the more general case where you have unwanted factors columns mixed in with other types you need to do something a little more complex
for practically any data structure x containing numerics use your question seems slightly discombobulated though - you have indicated that you mean not na without explaining what type is

23691978
sudo	passwd
for most applications it is sufficient to create a postgresql user for the web server s username sudo -u postgres createuser www-data then create a database owned by that user for the app to use sudo -u postgres createdb -o www-data test_django and configure the app to connect with username www-data to the test_django database with no passwd
postgresql on most distros including ubuntu defaults to peer authentication where it requires you to have the same unix username as the postgres user you re connecting as and doesn t require a passwd

23695913
innodb	myisam
first of all you need to use innodb
myisam doesn t handle any sort of transaction except lock table which will mess up your users

23697951
equals	compareto
actually the second way is preferrable because equals method checks whether objects are equals while compareto tells you if this object is greater then other or other is greater than this or none of that is applicable - which makes equals usage more semantically correct in your case
your product interface doesn t extend which adds int compareto product other

23699875
firefox	safari
i could not reproduce it in ie or firefox
as op already mentioned the error on google chrome is uncaught indexsizeerror failed to execute getrangeat on selection 0 is not a valid index safari has the same issue but the message is different index_size_err dom exception 1 index or size was negative or greater than the allowed value

23701713
ubuntu	debian	daemons	systemd
ubuntu systemd ... this is easily remedied by installing a network time protocol ntp daemons to set the time automatically as explained in debian s datetime which boils down to sudo apt-get install ntp and editing etc ntp.conf to target more local ntp server sources for optimal results
the clock skew mentioned in jeremy lindblom s answer means that the time on your server isn t sufficiently synchronized with coordinated universal time utc after subtracting the timezone offset you do not actually need to know the time on the amazon ses servers which most certainly is simply utc though rather just ensure that your own systemd is synchronized with utc too no matter what timezone you are in - see my answer to synchronize local debian time with amazon debian instances rds mdt to utc for more details on the subject and how to resolve this for a debian gnu resp

23702836
email	dkim
details and authenticating email with dkim in amazon ses is also available
however if you really do not want to dive into ses and rather just use what s available via ec2 sending email from ec2 instances provides a detailed list of actions you should take in order to host send you email from ec2 including 4

23703461
icollection	iqueryable
this doesn t work because the navigational properties do not implement iqueryable they implement icollection
icollection of course doesn t have a select method that accepts an expression parameter

23706177
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie 10+ edge and google-chrome
so for supporting firefox older than 42 along with ie 10+ edge google-chrome and opera i guess it s better to use comma-separated list of mime-types edge behavior the file type filter dropdown shows the file types mentioned here but is not the default in the dropdown

23710518
hex	binary
since this hex stream is in hex and for hex to hexdump conversion od doesn t seems to work
so the solution would be to convert this hex back to binary and then use od -ax -tx1 file on that binary file

23712372
oncreate	findviewbyid
here s an error in game oncreate here you must get an id not a layout.
so in your res layout game must be a linearlayout with id +id draw solution change the above instruction to note it s findviewbyid not findviewbylayout

23715113
google-chrome	firefox
we ve noticed google-chrome + canvas is not as performant as firefox + canvas
as to gc occurring when you open google-chrome dev tools well i d guess you may have some code that nudges google-chrome in just the right way to do a gc

23715922
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i believe that imagemagick s -composite must be a version of -mosaic which adds more features -mosaic might not support gravity but -composite does . it seems like graphicsmagick should implement something completely compatible with imagemagick s -composite. regardless there is an effective workaround available if you need to use your existing gm commands. if you have a modern graphicsmagick which supports gm batch then you can use the mpr coder magick persistent registry to remember intermediate images between commands and you can easily adapt your two commands to execute with full efficiency using the existing command lines
this unix shell example should give you some ideas notice that the output of the first command was saved as an image handle as natively used within graphicsmagick into mpr temporary and then the second command took input from mpr temporary and wrote the final output file

23716942
build.gradle	gradlew
right now the best script i can imagine that gives full support for aspectj using even library projects is for dependencies the compiler running script remember that if you want to run aspectj on a library-child project you must have also this script on the build.gradle of the library
although previous answers scripts works for most of the situations they doesn t cover some of the problems of using android with aspectj and gradlew

23716956
subtraction	addition
in the above case the culprits are the subtraction in b - a and the addition in
the op s algorithm does not suffer from this due to the components being completely multiplied before addition

23717704
interpolation	splines
method 2 - interpolation not linear you can subsample your points like we did above then use interp1 to interpolation in between the keypoints
let s assume you want to do a splines interpolation

23718316
division	modulo
the modulo will return the remainder of division problem looking at your logic your action needs to be taken when your incrementer minus 1 divided by 4 would have a remainder of 0 here s a link to the php manual page discussing mathematical operators
you re actually not too far off track from what you might want to be doing you just need to use one additional tool to accomplish it the or modulo

23718362
super	self
the next step should be basically only creating ivars properties if self as returned from super init is not nil
if self is nil at that point you would normally just bypass additional code and go straight to return self

23718911
clang	llvm
as pointed out in another so answer clang -cc1 --help can be used to list supported compilation flags where we see the following which may be of interest to you -disable-llvm-optzns don t run llvm optimization passes -fno-elide-constructors disable c++ copy constructor elision -mdisable-fp-elim disable frame pointer elimination optimization
clang does not support the -ggdb3 flag only -g as you have noticed

23721113
implements	extends
if your vector2 vector3 and vector4 classes all extends basevector and implements the multiply method then this will work it s not going to be able to get more generic than that because operator overloads are static extension methods that have to be declared in the class that they apply to
you would be able to use an interface and then any object that implements that interface would be able to be used but you would have to call the multiply method declared in the interface directly

23722301
lisp	scheme
learning ruby when you know java or common lisp if you know scheme it seems you have proven it s true that you can write fortran in any language
while doesn t exist in scheme but since i also program algol dialects i know how it s supposed to work

23722842
matlab	simulink
a lot of that is not necessarily because of any advantages of matlab itself though it has many and some disadvantages to be sure
a lot of it is because of simulink and the model-based design workflow which have no real alternatives in the open-source world

23726268
admob	inmobi
you should not use your inmobi credentials all is done through admob credentials
integration of inmobi into admob should be pretty simple

23727129
vim	sublimetext	emacs	sublimetext
alternatively you can change the editor git uses with this command replace vim with your preferred editor emacs nano etc git config --global core.editor vim edit also the correct command to launch sublimetext in terminal is subl thanks quantumphi
probably git is configured to use sublimetext as editor and it is not able to find it

23727308
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if you re still in viewdidload this certainly isn t going to be the case and i think this mostly will not be the case in viewwillappear
viewdidappear is the earliest possible state you can guarantee the view controller s presentation is complete and ready to be dismissed

23728278
oncreate	onstart
edit instead of restoring your state in oncreate you can also override the onrestoreinstancestate method
it is called after onstart and will only be called if the bundle is not null

23728312
noexcept	throw
for example this means that they will be noexcept for the common use cases
however if you create a rep that is an arithmetic emulator that might for example throw on overflow then these constructors will correctly not be noexcept

23728312
noexcept	throw
however if you create a rep that is an arithmetic emulator that might for example throw on overflow then these constructors will correctly not be noexcept
to make these constructors actually work the member function count needs to be conditionally noexcept and the function duration_cast needs to be made conditionally noexcept

23728630
prng	random
the current top answer is .join random.choice string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits for _ in range n this is an excellent method but the prng in random is not cryptographically secure
i assume many people researching this question will want to generate random strings for encryption or passwords

23728795
google-chrome	firefox
good performance for large data when compared to web storage. search good search performance with indexing in rdbms. indexing indexing available in rdbms compatibility supported on webkit based browsers including google-chrome safari and mobile browsers like ios safari
not supported by microsoft and firefox and have decided to never support as the spec depends on non-standard sql lite

23739880
addition	multiplication
this vector is not the same as vector from methematics because in mathematics vectors are members of any set v such that there are two important operations defined on this set + addition of vectors and x multiplication of a vector by a scalar from field f and these operations satisfy 8 axioms associativity of addition u + v + w u + v + w commutativity of addition u + v v + u identity element of addition there exists an element 0 v called the zero vector such that v + 0 v for all v v
inverse elements of addition for every v v there exists an element v v called the additive inverse of v such that v + v 0 compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication a bv ab v identity element of scalar multiplication 1 v v where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity in f

23740076
super	self
calling super doesn t change the self as seen above
as such methods you call on self explicitly or implicitly by not providing a receiver still act upon the original instance and use it for method lookup

23740337
udp	tcp
so you cannot have more udp listeners on same port as you write in the title
considering the erlang implementation the common design pattern for tcp is to have one process handling the listening socket spawning new worker processes for each connected sockets

23740391
jtextpane	jeditorpane
workaround setting foreground color for whole text before doing any custom coloring will solve your problem with jeditorpane if you can choose jtextpane instead of jeditorpane then it will solve the issue
screenshot edit why i m not using a jtextpane

23743300
gruntjs	package.json
one possibility is to use the postinstall phase to execute your gruntjs task
first install grunt-cli in a way you re not supposed to npm install grunt-cli --save-dev then update your package.json to execute gruntjs prod in the postinstall phase now when you deploy to openshift and after your dependencies are installed your gruntjs task should run

23746101
ssl	https
the answer to my interpretation of the op s question is no the source of a redirect does not need to be secured with ssl tls merely in order to issue a redirect to a protected site
case 2 in my table above. there may be other reasons why the originating server should use https but it is not a requirement merely for the ability to redirect

23746357
super	self
if i remember correct then should have been - because you should not pass self as paramter to __init__ of super
in fact when using instance methods you should not pass self explicitly to any method self is automatically provided when the call is made by the interpreter btw all these calls are redundant

23751540
oncreate	setcontentview
see nullpointerexception accessing views in oncreate for more on that
looks like you ve changed setcontentview r.layout.activity_main to setcontentview r.layout.fragment_main but there s still the template-generated placeholderfragment transaction that attempts to put the fragment in view r.id.container in the main activity layout and the view is not found

23752189
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
here s something you should consider taken from this stackoverflow question afhttprequestoperationmanager uses the old nsurlconnection so that doesn t facilitate background downloading
afurlsessionmanager uses nsurlsession under the hood so that does that being said if for some reason you insist on using the afhttprequestoperationmanager keep on reading

23752224
dns	spf
every mail server that supports dmarc will look up that record in yahoo s dns and apply yahoo s p reject policy
in effect what yahoo has done is stated to the world if the email does not originate from this list of ips spf or bear this crytographic signature dkim then reject p reject it. since your mail server is not in their list of mail servers ips nor are the messages signed with yahoo s dkim key a substantial and growing portion of the mail servers on the internet are going to reject it or deliver it to the spam folder gmail

23752224
email	dkim
in effect what yahoo has done is stated to the world if the email does not originate from this list of ips spf or bear this crytographic signature dkim then reject p reject it. since your mail server is not in their list of mail servers ips nor are the messages signed with yahoo s dkim key a substantial and growing portion of the mail servers on the internet are going to reject it or deliver it to the spam folder gmail
in addition to the spf dkim checks dmarc also introduces the concept of alignment

23754967
prepare	execute
pdo execute however isn t very safe because it does not use prepare statements so it s good of you to use a pdostatement but then use the appropriate methods
it s quite easy to get the number of affected rows from a prepare statement too.

23763804
onkeyup	onkeydown
it would also works fine if you use onkeyup method
do not use onkeydown it may be called few times if user holds his finger too long

23765721
client-side	server-side
think like this all apps script code you write runs on a google server server-side but the interface is obviously shown on your computer client-side
the apps script environment has a client-side script that we do not have access or control of that receives the information on how to build the interface you defined in your code server-side

23766288
vbo	vao
vbos can be shared so you just need one vbo per object
vaos aren t shared so you ll need to generate a new vao for each object per context or else the behavior will become unpredictable and incorrect upon deletion creation of a new one

23766496
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
so since components like uilabel or uiimageview aren t design to be touchable to add a touchable feature like a uitaprecognizer you have to set their userinteractionenabled to yes
so even if you set this property correctly for your uiimageview star1 since you add it as a subview of ratinglabelbody you couldn t trigger your uitapgesturerecognizer imgtouchup

23766816
trie	tree
every path from the root of the trie is a substring in the string there are no such paths that are not substrings in the string and paths are unique
if you really need it in memory then you can try making a suffix tree

23767774
multiplying	subtract
if the original angle is greater then 90 you have to multiplying the y coordinate with -1. the method for this would be the coordinates are now in double as the results are most of the time not going to be whole numbers
round them to ints before you subtract them from the origin coordinates

23768733
ubuntu	linux
on debian-based distros such as ubuntu sudo apt-get install xmlstarlet
in general for a robust solution that works with varying input data you should use an xml parser for this task a solution based on xmllint - xmllint is a standard utility on os x and some linux distros fedora if your linux distro does not come with xmllint chances are that it can be installed with your platform s package manager

23769913
g++	gcc
netbeans should automatically detect gdb g++ ps i d prefer to use a good gnu linux distro
cygwin alone is not enough first of all you have to check if you installed c++ gcc gdb packages in your cygwin

23774889
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
sfml does not have mp3 support as another has suggested
what i always do is use audacity and make all my music into ogg and leave all my sound effects as wav

23776465
mp3	wav
the mp3 does not have a single header like most files instead a single file is split to many frames packets with their own headers which can be spotted without needing to know their exact location and with the possibility to interleave them with some other data sometimes referred to as sideband info it is usually id3 tags but it can be pretty much anything
that is why mp3 is good for streaming music so anyone can connect to the middle of the stream and start playback the same thing works if you split the mp3 file to two halves both first and second file will play without problems something that wav or png format will not support

23777153
opera	firefox
but if i puts these in an updatepanel on a website to do a partical postback then none of the new html input types are included in the postback response to the server from those browsers that understands these new types safari webkit and opera
it works correctly in ie8 and firefox 4 but probably only because they have not implemented these new types and falls back to understanding it as a type text field

23777227
ubuntu	linux
how to setup ftp if it s not already running start the bitnami s ubuntu magento vm you setup in the steps above and log in using bitnami as the username and the new password you entered
you should now see bitnami linux with your cursor after it in the vm ware player window

23779110
postgresql	mysql
one can not create indexes on function evaluations in mysql like it is possible with postgresql
since the needed keys to decrypt the content must be provided to mysql for this type of query i do not see a reason why the database server should encrypt the contents

23779291
ssl	https
curl 1 protocol https not supported or disabeld in libcurl the error message means that curl was not built with ssl support
if you built curl from source you ll need to rebuild it with ssl support

23781594
implements	extends
depending on the situation one possibility is to wrap all classes in a wrapper class that exposes the said interface i mean something like this then you want the interface to look like as a solution you can wrap your unmodifyableobject in a wrappedunmodifyableobject it does nothing more than delegate all methods and of course it implements the interface
a few important things to note are that - you should use composition over inheritance it might look easier to just extends the class but you do not control that code it may remove methods or it may even be final . - this does mean you have to do quite some work. - if you do not want to do the work yourself you might need to look into tools to change the bytecode either before execution or before loading the class

23786001
boost	allocator
here are my main pain-points regarding boost s and stl s implementations and what i d like instead 1.first of all performance is not an issue here
memory allocator virtual function calls o n complexity - it doesn t matter

23786001
dictionary	map
if dictionary key check if the element exists
this is again not a good idea to implement in c++ in a generic map

23787539
coalesce	isnull
you can do projections.sqlfunction coalesce nhibernateutil.string projections.property name projections.constant unknown to get a projection that does the equivalent of isnull
isnull is not supported in nhibernates sql dialects but coalesce is and is the same thing for two parameters

23788302
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
when my app is displayed in landscape on an iphone i wanted the uinavigationbar at the top to shrink to the standardly accepted 32 points high as is the case with any apps that use the uinavigationcontroller class
however as i am not using a uinavigationcontroller for this particular view for varying reasons of feasibility i needed to implement this manually

23788302
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
however as i am not using a uinavigationcontroller for this particular view for varying reasons of feasibility i needed to implement this manually
to account for the new transparent status bar in ios 7 i adjusted the origin and size of the uinavigationbar so it encompassed both the bounds of the status bar and the normal uinavigationbar region ie so the uinavigationbar frame origin was 0 0 and the height was 52 points. unfortunately this happened while the bar itself is rendering at the proper position and height all of the content in the bar including the title and buttons are not positioned properly being much too high almost touching the status bar content

23788302
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
when i tested the same orientations with a normal uinavigationcontroller this was not the case and the title and buttons in the uinavigationbar from the uinavigationcontroller worked absolutely fine
apple had done something in there that wasn t part of the normal uinavigationbar implementation

23790694
pickle	dill
it might not be a bug in pickle as i can pickle what you wanted to do initially without problems
if you use dill instead of pickle then there s no issue and all dill is is a bunch of copy_reg functions to register how to serialize different types that pickle can t handle by default

23792559
punctuation	words
an easy way to make it better is to split the string in a smarter way so punctuation marks aren t glued to the words they are adjacent to
another improvement could be to remove all non-alphabetic characters from each words and check if the remaining letters are in the same order in a words

23792644
invokelater	invokeandwait
even if you call invokelater from the edt the task is scheduled not executed at the moment
the same happens with invokeandwait yes the code is executed sequentially as if it was executed at the moment but it is still an scheduled work

23794287
realloc	malloc
after a better reading of your code i don t understand why you re using realloc at all here as you re not using the old contents of output
you d get the same behaviour and the same error if you replaced realloc with malloc

23796227
laravel	cakephp
as mentioned in my comment the url structure you are using might not be how laravel does their own arguments parameters in query strings
for example cakephp format is controller action param value param value etc

23796729
jlist	jtable
jlist does not support the notion of a cell editor
instead use a two-column jtable

23796735
ember.js	backbone.js
i realised exactly the abstractions i needed and noticed ember.js had pretty much nailed it proper and backbone.js marionette was nowhere near what i needed not to say it isn t useful for certain type of apps but i personally haven t looked back
i was able to get quick wins a huge productivity increase with ember.js plus have a more powerful framework so i changed

23798708
implements	extends
type mismatch even though mywaterfowl implements those interfaces
it s not about the type d implementing those interfaces and or extends a class

23799218
wav	caf
you are uploading the file to a server but i recommend you to not use the wav because it s bigger in size than any other formats
use caf m4a or any other formats instead

23799732
postgresql	mysql
it looks like you re actually using postgresql not mysql
you can view your existing code running on postgresql in action on postgresql here which gives the same error as you get above

23800568
spaces	linefeed
cr+lf microsoft windows dec tops-10 rt-11 and most other early non-unix and non-ibm oses cp m mp m dos ms-dos pc dos etc. atari tos os 2 symbian os palm os amstrad cpc the regex would be r n| n r| n| r cr+lf or lf+cr or linefeed or cr demo if you plan on not having any empty lines lines with white spaces count as empty you can add an optional to the end of your regex which will match 0 to an infinite amount of white spaces after your newlines demo if you plan on not having any empty lines but expect lines with white spaces to not count as empty you can even simplify the regex demo
to make sure you get all of the possible new line combinations you should use preg_split instead linefeed n cr r linefeed multics unix and unix-like systems gnu linux os x freebsd aix xenix etc. beos amiga risc os and others

23802891
sudo	passwd
passwd entry for sudo can only be keyboard interactive which you cannot do remotely
you can only run this remotely if the sudoers configuration on the server allows this specific command executed by the given user in the name of the other user to run w o asking for passwd nopasswd option

23805975
g++	gcc
since your program isn t aborted from any following kill i suspect it uses the bsd semantics as described later under portability the situation on linux is as follows to force system v behaviour you need to define one of _posix_source _xopen_source or _svid_source gcc -d_svid_source -wall -g -pthread test.c this doesn t seem to work with g++ though
when you compile with g++ -d_svid_source -wall -g -pthread test.cpp you still get the bsd behaviour

23806582
orientdb	neo4j
neo4j s paid licenses have great support up 24x7x365 1 hour turnaround worldwide versus orientdb s rather lacklustre support 4 hour turnaround in the eu daytime only and i imagine mongodb has good support too though i have not checked up on it
in short there s a reason neo4j is the top database for connected data it kicks ass

23809506
factors	matrix
the unknown scale factors cannot be responsible for the reconstruction errors you see
regardless of global scale the result of projecting onto the image pair a 3d point estimated from good matches and with a valid essential matrix should be consistent

23811073
ssl	https
this is a typical setup so that only the external request bears the overhead of ssl encryption
because it s actually on a http connection that the server receives any absolute urls generated by the router such as when a redirect is issued will use http by default and not https as that is the protocol by which the application server is being accessed

23811317
namenode	hdfs
you can remove the hdfs files reformat the hdfs bin hadoop namenode -format and restart hadoop services bin hadoop start-all.sh hadoop 1.x or sbin hadoop start-all.sh hadoop 2.x
another possibility is the namenode is not running

23812002
ng-view	ng-controller
and used then function to use that promise. and now it always updates scope.cities in any situation that template loads not just in ng-view
answering my own question i m trying to make this happen in my a controller defined in my view using ng-controller not a controller linked to a router otherwise you could use resolve property like this delaying angularjs route change until model loaded to prevent flicker

23813556
innodb	myisam
for older mysql versions in mysql vesions older than 5.6 was not possible to define a fulltext index on an innodb table
from the mysql 5.5 docu full-text indexes can be used only with myisam tables

23813556
innodb	myisam
since innodb supported foreign key constraints but didn t support fulltext indexes
an attempt to create a fulltext index on an innodb table failed with an error query alter table child add fulltext body error code 1214 the used table type doesn t support fulltext indexes so you had to use myisam for fulltext index

23815467
activemq	rabbitmq
it seems activemq is better than rabbitmq in the sense that it is easy to set up and maintenance for cluster
activemq seems to be good alternative i was using rabbitmq to set up cluster over wan which is not supported by rabbitmq cluster since it requires all machines within same location

23816984
super	implements	super	extends
in the example it s called from viewcontroller.m super isn t like calling self
if classb extends classa and both class implements a method x then refers to the implementation in classa even if it s overridden by classb in this case myscene extends skscene

23818490
build.gradle	gradlew
if you want a way to avoid keeping the keystore password in the build file here s an answer with code for saving it in a separate file sign apk without putting keystore info in build.gradle
android studio doesn t pass environment variables to gradlew so what you re trying to do won t work from the ide

23818642
ssl	https
original answer the rails force_ssl method does not really force a request to arrive on port 443 on your server it is satisfied when the original client request was sent over ssl through the internet
the load balancer as a proxy sets the header x-forwarded-proto to https

23831467
g++	gcc
unfortunately for history buffs the most readily available c++03 compiler for windows namely mingw g++ of some old version such as 3.2 does not enforce the c++03 rule
file template_versus_cc.cpp compiling with old g++ h dev test copy_construction bin mingw_3_1 bin g++ --version | find ++ g++ gcc 3.2.3 mingw special 20030504-1 h dev test copy_construction bin mingw_3_1 bin g++ -std c++98 -pedantic template_versus_cc.cpp template_versus_cc.cpp in function int main template_versus_cc.cpp 4 s s const s is private template_versus_cc.cpp 19 within this context h dev test copy_construction _ by the c++03 c++98 rules the compiler should have flagged both copy initializations at lines 18 and 19 but only flagged the latter behaving as a c++11 compiler in this respect

23835942
jar	war
so i d recommend putting it only into the interface jar
if you plan to run on jboss as 7 or wildfly you should ensure that such classes do not appear in utility jars interface jar and in a module ie war or ejb jar

23835942
wildfly	jboss
if you plan to run on jboss 7 or wildfly you should ensure that such classes do not appear in utility jars interface jar and in a module ie war or ejb jar
jboss will throw an error when finding the class file in a library and a module

23840466
daemons	systemd
the trend in modern practice has changed processes should not take care of themselves but are run by a daemons manager such as start-stop-daemon 8 again a decision of the packager
now that systemd is becoming ubiquitous some of the best practices are changing

23840891
strtol	strtod
you want strtod not strtol
strtol only parses integers

23841282
union	distinct
you probably want to do a join not union union takes rows that have the same structure from two different tables
also the distinct is not needed since you re doing a group by

23843966
intersect	contains
i wrote this code on another forum some years back as a quick method to add a subtract range option the same approach i used in fast method for determining unlocked cell range background this function accepts two ranges removes the cells where the two ranges intersect and then produces a string output contains the address of the reduced range
this is done by creating a new one-sheet workbook entering the n a formula into all the cells on this sheet contains in rng1 clearing the contents of all cells on this sheet that are contains by rng2 using specialcells to return the remaining n a formulae which represents the cells in rng1 that are not found in rng2 if the boolean variable bbothranges is set to true then the process is repeated with the cells with the opposite range order the code then returns the reduced range as a string then closes the workbook

23844947
g++	gcc
similarly a link file usr bin g++ pointing to g++-4.4 is needed too
only install gcc package is not enough providing package gcc-4 has been installed check if usr bin gcc exists usually it is a link file pointing to usr bin gcc-4.4 for example

23845993
mp4	h.264
your command was stream copying re-muxing mpeg-4 part 2 video into mp4 container but this format is probably not playable by the browser
you should use h.264 video instead for mp4 container -movflags +faststart will allow the video to begin playback before the file is completely downloaded by the viewer

23846961
comparator	comparable
java 8 offers a new answer convert the entries into a stream and use the comparator combinators from map.entry this will let you consume the entries sorted in ascending order of value
if you want descending value simply reverse the comparator if the values are not comparable you can pass an explicit comparator you can then proceed to use other stream operations to consume the data

23848253
oncreate	findviewbyid
the reason why it works if you do it inside oncreate is because activity has a findviewbyid
i see a couple of problems here 1 you are trying to use findviewbyid in a class that doesn t extends activity or any class that has a findviewbyid

23850354
division	modulo
division method when using the division method we usually avoid certain values of m table size
for example m should not be a power of 2 since if m 2 p then h k is just the p lowest-order bits of k . --clrs to understand why uses only the p lowest bits of k you must first understand the modulo hash function

23850354
division	multiplication
important distinction this pertains specifically to the division method of hashing
in fact the converse is true for the multiplication method as stated in clrs an advantage of the multiplication method is that the value of m is not critical.

23851400
implements	extends
implements these four changes results in the following complete file however this still leaves a few things to be desired if you use this to separate diagrams that are over top something that isn t white the spacer will still be drawn potentially eclipsing some part of the underlying diagram
rectangles extends in two dimensions meaning that if you use this to horizontally align diagrams shorter than your spacer or vertically align diagrams narrower than your spacer the resulting composite will have an incorrect envelope

23852908
google-chrome	firefox
in fact google-chrome tends to load all declared icons not only the best first last one
firefox no see bug 751712

23858383
bower	npm
bower is not part of npm you need to install it separately npm install -g bower then you will have the executable in usr local bin bower and you will be able to use the bower command in terminal
the difference between npm install -g and npm install is that npm install -g installs the module globally executable will be placed into usr local bin

23859229
noexcept	throw
in case of failure throw exception we can simply abort the process of copying and start destroying the copied elements - so the cost in the worst case is where d is the cost of deallocation we copy n-1 elements when copying the n-th element exception is throw so we destroy n-1 elements and deallocate the new block note the above applies when moves are not noexcept
if moves are noexcept the only possible point of failure is allocation of the new memory block since destructors are required to be noexcept and the reallocation process is simpler and faster

23860896
dictionary	map
since the data sources rows are dictionary in this case you are not guaranteed a consistent ordering when iterating indexing is not available anyhow
to ensure consistent ordering setup an ordered list of column indices that map to the data sources keys if you want to re-use this custom model for wrapping other data sets you probably don t want to couple the column names so tightly with the class

23863711
profiling	debugging
but thanks to xcode now it automatically maintains ios team provisioning profiling not a profiling with a specific appid
so for the debugging we don t need to create new provisional profiling manually

23864323
sudo	passwd
if you face any issue feel free to use comments-section below. relaying postfix mails via smtp.gmail.com first install all necessary packages sudo apt-get install postfix mailutils libsasl2-2 ca-certificates libsasl2-modules if you do not have postfix installed before postfix configuration wizard will ask you some questions
just select your server as internet site and for fqdn use something like mail.example.com then open your postfix config file vim etc postfix main.cf and following lines to it you might have noticed that we haven t specified our gmail username and passwd in above lines

23865933
inline	inlining
the sample he shows is depending on the ability of eclipse to inline methods if you do not have this you need to do that by hand copying the called code to your unit test
the sample shows that he is copying inlining the code under test inline into his unit test

23866869
factors	matrix
adjusting the contrast basically does the following it shifts all pixel values by -0.5 so that a medium-gray becomes 0 it applies a factors to all pixel values it reverts the shift so in a formula for a single-channel image we can transform this into a matrix multiplication for multi-channel images the 2x2 matrix becomes a 5x5 four channels + w-channel for translations matrix with c and t at the positions you already specified
keep in mind that a factors of 1 does not change anything

23867346
boost	stl
template requires a fixed size in advance at compile-time however one way you can do this by using boost dynamic_bitset something like following see here
this is not possible with stl bitset

23871821
super	extends
the reason for that is that you are not calling super
you can check what s happening in the error stack down to top you instantiate childclass and you pass the previously created childmc to the constructor childclass extends parentclass so when instantiated it always calls the constructor the constructor of parentclass tries to add something as a child the problem is that you cannot add null as a child

23878790
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you are calling setcontentview twice which suggests to me that one of these calls is wrong and unnecessary
either r.layout.receivedata contains the textview you are retrieving with findviewbyid and you did not mean to make second call

23879748
octal	decimal
this non-normative annex presents uniform syntax and semantics for octal literals and octal escape sequences for compatibility with some older ecmascript programs
what you have 003050 is a numeric literal the syntax and semantics of 7.8.3 can be extended as follows except that this extension is not allowed for strict mode code syntax numericliteral decimalliteral hexintegerliteral octalintegerliteral octalintegerliteral 0 octaldigit octalintegerliteral octaldigit octaldigit one of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and so if not using strict mode where this syntax has been removed then 003050 an octal is the decimal value 1576

23882650
strcpy	malloc
and use strcpy for assigning value to node- src
you need to do malloc not only for your node but for it s element node- src too

23883015
oncreate	onstart
if your activityb stay in foreground for a long time of-course your activitya will be in background in that case so ultimately your activity in onstop remember not in onpause and android activity life cycle doc says after onstop if your app want reach your activity then it will goes in oncreate so finish activityb would work but there is no guarantee to your activitya called oncreate when you do so
since you already got your answer by rajitha siriwardena but i just want to clear some of the points here as i know it should be just called once and then onstart should be called

23883508
des	aes
we can see default enctypes 18 17 aes 16 des and 23 rc4-hmac
1 is not on this list that s why entry for this very old des variant is not loaded from keytab with error found unsupported keytype 1 for my my.com

23890794
domcontentloaded	onload
and this image is cached then the image onload executes before domcontentloaded
html js demo output domcontentloaded imgloaded imgloaded ----- wrong domcontentloaded also putting the onload event directly on the image does not work

23895484
dictionary	map
if two dictionary do not use the same implementation of iequalitycomparer they should generally not be considered equivalent regardless of the items they contain
for example a with a case-sensitive comparer and one with a case-insensitive comparer both of which contain the key-value pair fred quimby are not equivalent since the latter would map fred to quimby but the former would not

23895557
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it seems as though the clearsselectiononviewwillappear might actually be getting called by viewdidappear rather than viewwillappear the change only happens once the transition is completely over and if you cancel the interactive transition it does not happen at all if it was in viewwillappear it would
this looks like a uikit bug as the docs clearly state it should be getting called in viewwillappear put the following line of code into viewwillappear and you will get the exact behavior you are looking for i just tried it

23899673
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
this is a illegalstateexception that s a runtimeexception
runtimeexception is a unchecked-exception that will not cause the system server crash at all

23900822
spaces	linefeed
if you want to see what would be passed as arguments you can use printf echo output for the same would consist of each string in with a single spaces between them
note especially that in the case of the unquoted variable the resulting would not show the linefeed because echo sees four separate words that it just joins with spaces

23901373
backgrounding	multitasking
no because you re talking about termination not backgrounding it works when the app is running or in the backgrounding but i need it to somehow execute the database saving code of the app even when the app is terminated closed by swiping up on the multitasking menu
you re probably confusing the backgrounding and not running state as mentioned here

23905658
mp4	h.264
mp4 mov uses avcc box format which is defined in other iso iec document
it is called h.264 annex b byte stream format defined in iso iec 14496-12 . i think below page has very good explanation there are many open source implementations about this not easily reusable though

23906397
skip-lists	tree
another idea would be a skip-lists where the skips are annotated with the number of elements they skip
but this implementation is not trivial since you have to update the skip length of each skip above an element that is inserted or deleted so adjusting a binary search tree is less hassle imho

23910617
prepare	execute
first of all i m not sure you would get a significant performance increase by not recreating the prepare statement every time because the jdbc driver database often caches prepare statements
but if you want to execute multiple queries with a single prepare statement simply use one of the execute methods of jdbctemplate which creates a prepare statement from a sql query or lets you create it and then execute a callback taking the prepare statement as argument

23911448
lodash	underscore.js
there are even compatible clones like lodash you can be sure that it will be around for a long time
as you already know the _ variable is set by underscore.js and not provided by the javascript runtime itself

23912533
union	distinct
you can use union select id_product from tb_compare union select id_product from tb_product_field
note that union removes duplicate rows in a list so distinct is not necessary

23914241
udp	tcp
when that has happened udp will silently discard incoming datagrams
tcp will discard incoming datagrams and not acknowledge them triggering congestion control halving the window size under reno xp or switching to the delay-window under compoundtcp vista+

23914750
hlsl	glsl
short answer not yet currently you have to write your shaders in hlsl regardless of whether you are using directx or opengl
the .fx shader written in hlsl will be converted to glsl internally if you are targeting opengl and are using the monogame content pipeline with the monogame effect content processor or the 2mgfx tool

23916090
textview	imageview
write your textview like this if this is not what you intended and you want the textview to remain centered when you move the imageview then the solution is even simpler set the imageview s visibility to invisible not gone
you don t need to programmatically change the layout params of the textview use instead

23919520
icomparable	compareto
c# doesn t have that operator but it has the icomparable interface with compareto method
vb way in c c++ and many c-like languages without compareto method you can use this way many languages like java don t allow you to directly use the comparison results as a numeric value

23920869
gruntjs	package.json
try running npm install from the root directory then re-running gruntjs
i see that the grunt-contrib-uglify is in your package.json file but the error indicates it s not installed

23922428
udp	tcp
if you want more control over the number of packets that are sent use udp instead of tcp
when you are using tcp the network layer does guarantee that all the bytes you pass to send will actually be sent if not the socket will be closed

23923698
multiplying	multiplication
you re forgetting that binary doesn t work by multiplying the value by 10 but by 2 multiplying by 10 would be good it you re converting a decimal number to an int but there are already functions for that
so if i take your code and apply the appropriate multiplication instead of multiplying by 2 the value of bin you can use bitshifts instead replace with

23924870
daemons	systemd
follow the steps as follows stop the service daemons of mysql running start mysql without any privileges using the following option
this option is used to boot up and do not use the privilege systemd of mysql

23925490
uiview	subviews
the following pattern helped minimize memory leaks do not keep uiviewcontroller s uiview s in memory always create them as needed and explicitly dispose when not needed
within a dispose method dispose owned uiviewcontroller uiview s within dispose method manually remove from parent and dispose all subviews within dispose method nullify all references to controllers views within dispose method nullify all events use new refcount feature and new gc project options if using sqlite do this on startup mono.data.sqlite.sqliteconnection.setconfig mono.data.sqlite.sqliteconfig.serialized

23926495
setinterval	settimeout
you probably want settimeout not setinterval
setinterval will keep invoking the callback until you cancel it whereas settimeout will only invoke the callback once after the specified delay

23928975
prepare	execute
query ok 0 rows affected 0.00 sec statement prepare and now we can just do not care if we ll pass null or not - it will work properly mysql set x 1
query ok 0 rows affected 0.03 sec mysql execute stmt using x

23930991
google-chrome	firefox
http get for resource located on client will not work with the google-chrome browser and will give a cors error unless you disable google-chrome web security by opening google-chrome using run ... chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files -disable-web-security
firefox gives an error saying the json in not well formed even though it is

23931807
qwindow	qwidget
you can see an example of a minimal qwindow based application using qpainter here
an application will typically use qwidget or qquickview for its ui and not qwindow directly

23931807
qwindow	qwidget
an application will typically use qwidget or qquickview for its ui and not qwindow directly
qwindow is more low level than qwidget

23935135
draggable	droppable
it does not get the draggable currently being dragged it tests the draggable that you just dropped in the droppable element
from the droppable documentation function a function that will be called for each draggable on the page passed as the first argument to the function . the function must return true if the draggable should be accepted. regardless what you get as a parameter is a jquery element not a js object

23938796
strtol	atoi
the behavior is the same as strtol nptr null 10
except that atoi does not detect errors

23946455
namenode	hdfs
namenode stores the hdfs filesystem information in a file named fsimage
updates to the file system add remove blocks are not updating the fsimage file it will be appended to the edit log fsimage contains mapping of blocks to files and other file system properties called snapshot of namenode

23946526
translation	localization
as shown i worked it out injecting the translation function into all the template as a view helper
this solution is nice and clean as it delegates most of the translation to the templates where i believe it should be. it doesn t either require modifying any view drastically limiting the amount of changes necessary to accomplish the localization on an existing project

23946526
translation	localization
this solution is nice and clean as it delegates most of the translation to the templates where i believe it should be. it doesn t either require modifying any view drastically limiting the amount of changes necessary to accomplish the localization on an existing project
one neat detail as well is you can also inject variable in your interpolation meaning something like this can be turn into something like this for interpolation or even and in the po file msgid my_translation_with_interpolation msgstr my translation with __option__ allowing you to dynamically inject a key which will be localized and then interpolated in the original string

23948253
implements	extends
in abstraction you must implements bodyless methods of abstract-class if you are extends abstract-class while the methods which have their implementation in abstract-class may or may not get overridden in subclass
so in above class if you extends class c you must put implementation of met1 in your class while met2 is optional you can even override it if you want to

23948551
haskell	agda	haskell	idris
this also lets us circumvent the limitation that haskell types cannot depend on haskell values our types will depend on the type index of a singleton but that type index can be in turn determined from the value of the singleton
this somewhat tortuous detour is not present in fully dependent programming languages such as agda or idris where types can depend on values

23948665
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
add the following line to viewdidlayoutsubviews or viewdidappear
the reason it s not working is because you ve added it to viewwillappear method

23950991
implements	extends
firstly your collection class should not implements ienumerator it should implements ienumerable only and return an instance of another class that implements ienumerator possibly carenumerator when getenumerator is called
ienumerator implemented in carenumerator extends idisposable so in cars.getenumerator you can set a private flag perhaps private bool isenumerating to true

23953290
uiview	subviews
in my opinion the best approach to this problem is to create an invisible subviews containing all the elements uiview you want to rotate such as the background image
you then shouldn t apply the rotation to the full view but only to that subviews

23953601
g++	gcc
however in case of g++ no need to link the library so this will work fine g++ filename.c -o filename
gcc does not link the standard libraries by default

23956120
.htaccess	httpd.conf
works in an .htaccess under apache 2.4
that works on my machine in your original script the bits i noticed were the rewriteengine wasn t switched on but it may have been in httpd.conf or httpd-vhosts.conf the rewriterule was only matching digits and not allowing trailing slashes i ve made the rewriterule an ungreedy wildcard match that excludes trailing slashes

23958901
ioexception	fileoutputstream
there are a couple of problems with your code it does not compile since destinationname is commented but referenced when opening the fileoutputstream ioexception s are caught and ignored
if you throw them you would get error messages that could help you diagnose the problem when opening the fileoutputstream you just concatenate two strings without adding a path-separator in between

23960793
calloc	malloc
a second alternative to malloc is the calloc function
because the block of memory returned by malloc is not always initialized it may contain garbage data

23965776
touchesbegan	touchesended
it isn t touchesbegan that is delayed by default - it s touchesended meaning that the gesture recognizer holds onto this until it can decide whether to recognize its gesture or not and this is especially important for a multitap gesture because the first touch may end but the gesture might still recognize if there s a further tap
by default touchesbegan is delivered both to the gesture recognizer and to the view

23974973
nsorderedset	nsset
if it is rather large put the bad words in an nsorderedset and then use the method containsobject
if the number of words to be checked is not small you could also put the words to be checked in an nsset and the bad words in another nsset and use the method intersectsset

23975694
mongodb	bson
you are searching the array for a string book.where authors 5363c73a4d61635257805e00 but 5363c73a4d61635257805e00 and objectid 5363c73a4d61635257805e00 are not the same thing inside mongodb
you need to search for the right thing book.where authors bson objectid 5363c73a4d61635257805e00 you might want to monkey patch a to_bson_id method into various places

23975699
floating-point	fractions
as said here floating-point variables must not be used as loop counters
limited-precision ieee 754 floating-point types cannot represent all simple fractions exactly all decimals precisely even when the decimals can be represented in a small number of digits

23975699
floating-point	fractions
limited-precision ieee 754 floating-point types cannot represent all simple fractions exactly all decimal precisely even when the decimal can be represented in a small number of digits
all digits of large values meaning that incrementing a large floating-point value might not change that value within the available precision

23979829
addition	multiplication
in addition there is no reason to inject the matrices to matrixmoltiplication because you don t do anything with those matrices just allocate them
so you can change this new matrixmoltiplication a b to this new matrixmoltiplication and allocate the matrices only when the executor schedules them another note that does not relate to your question instead of making two random matrices with elements from the 0-9 interval and then multiplying them you can make it in one step it has the same property as the multiplication product of the two 0-9 random matrix

23981094
client-side	server-side
server-side validation is for protecting your database whenever client-side validation fails
you should have both but absolutely do not go without server-side validation

23982279
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
these next two are also the same but just different ways of declaring the same event and in modern browsers these are triggered by the domcontentloaded event which occurs before the above event and is described by mdn as below domcontentloaded is described by mdn the domcontentloaded event is fired when the document has been completely loaded and parsed without waiting for stylesheets images and subframes to finish loading the load event can be used to detect a fully-loaded page
fyi in older browsers that do not generate the domcontentloaded event these functions will be called on a onreadystatechange notification when and in a really old browser it might not be triggered until window.onload occurs

23983510
libstdc++	libc++
in contrast libstdc++ does not need to do this as the empty arrays never exist
the libc++ shrink_to_fit does not attempt to further reduce the memory footprint by shifting the values closer to the beginning of a block via a copy swap operation

23991867
opera	safari	firefox	safari
according to ie safari opera mini firefox for android ie mobile
global support for the date type is currently only at 12.03 the webkit used by ipad safari still does not support it i m not sure what browser android is using

23992055
swift	objective-c
swift 4.2 and note-1 scrollview represents here any subset of uiscrollview uitableview or uicollectionview etc.
note-2 you ll need to remove the tokens manually by invoking the removeobserver _ method when you are about to release the view and the closure-based observers are not necessary any longer objective-c i persume the has been set up properly somewhere before

23993683
oncreate	setcontentview
in oncreate before any findviewbyid
you are not calling setcontentview before trying to find the view need to identify the layout in which you are trying to find the mviewpager

23994517
rdf	owl
if you re doing this in plain rdf not using owl or some other ontology language you just use the uri of the publication class from the ontology
e.g. if you re describing some resource from your data and the publication class in some ontology is you just say if you re creating an owl ontology then you also should include the owl imports statement to state that you re importing or whatever the ontology iri of that ontology is so that you get all the appropriate declaration axioms

23994646
rdf	owl
rdf xml route
that is the xsd is for the owl xml format not for rdf xml

23994646
rdf	owl
that is the xsd is for the owl xml format not for rdf xml
so i suspect that what s happening regardless of whether or not your validator is handling the xsd correctly is that you re attempting to validate an rdf xml file using an xsd for owl xml

23994646
rdf	owl
so i suspect that what s happening regardless of whether or not your validator is handling the xsd correctly is that you re attempting to validate an rdf xml file using an xsd for owl xml
you didn t show any of the content of the owl file that you re trying to validate though so we can t be sure

23997408
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works on google-chrome
unfortunately doesn t work in safari and firefox

23998014
implements	extends
it declared the mock field as simply being mocked which merely gives you a single mocked instance implements the interface and this is not the one used by the code under test
the jmockit api has another mocking annotation however which extends mocking to all implementation classes from a given base type and by default affects all instances of said classes

23998625
dictionary	map
in julia iteration over a dictionary is iteration over key value pairs not iteration over values or iteration over keys as in python so that s why your map is getting -typed args
if you want the values you could ask for those specifically but if you re not returning anything from the function it feels a little weird to use map because you re building an unneeded array of nothing

23999612
verilog	vhdl
a systemverilog may look something like working example of verilog and system verilog here
i m not too familiar with vhdl but this looks like a test bench stimulus
