udp	tcp
we have implemented our own reliable multicast protocol over udp called rsp since we needed something cross-platform and at the time couldn t find a good solution between linux and windows
the windows pgm implementation disconnects slow clients which leave the send window whereas our implementation throttles the sender similar to tcp

12001797
stateless	stateful
main differences between a rule engine and a workflow engine is that rule engine does not track the state of the transaction it should be stateless working only on the inputs you provide it
workflow engine is stateful it must know what current state is the workflow in and must save that state to a database

12002942
uiview	subviews
you can t copy a uiview it doesn t implement the copying protocol
but you can easily make a method that creates a new view then creates a new instance of all the subviews and setup them as the old view

12003375
floating-point	fractions
comparisons result in either 1 for equal or 0 for unequal and you are printing out the result of the comparison as a floating-point number
3.3 is not exactly representable in binary floating point it contains a recurring fractions part

12003677
profiling	debugging
when you run it using the profiling the debugger is not attached
if you try running the .exe by itself or running the program through the ide with debugging start without debugging or just press ctrl+f5 the application should run as fast as it does with the profiling

12006000
google-chrome	firefox
it s also possible in google-chrome but it s a little more work
i m not sure what your ultimate goal is but you can view real-time http header interaction with the live http headers firefox add-on

12010384
ssl	https
if you are using https the query string will be encrypted in the ssl packet along with the rest of the request
if you re not using https anyone will be able to see the query string which so you know makes get just as secure as post when looking at man-in-the-middle attacks

12012864
trie	tree
you can set up something like a trie to uniquely identify and not just hash your polyomino
take your normalized polyomino and set up a binary search tree where the root branches on whether 0 0 is has a set pixel the next level branches on whether 0 1 has a set pixel and so on

12012981
viewdidload	viewwillappear
perhaps set a view background in viewdidload to be the same as your launch image so that while you re drawing your cgimage the user does not see the flicker
create your cgimage on a background thread which you kick off during viewwillappear you ll have the dimensions then

12019733
skip-lists	tree
there are other balanced tree such as b+ tree and other data structures not tree such as skip-lists
you might want to have a look at a list of known data structures especially the tree section

12021122
clang	llvm
eventually llvm and especially clang were mature enough to replace gcc outright which provided an amazing speed boost to compiling and a bump in the quality of the machine code output though many argue that gcc still produces better quality code at the expense of speed
but to address your concern about game performance while clang may provide a better compile experience performance is not the job of a compiler

12022816
prepare	execute
the code will look like this snipped from the docs on prepare
if you are printing to the screen then htmlspecialchars should be fine it converts any potential malicious javascript and html into characters like so that it displays as text in your source code meaning it cannot be execute and to the user it looks like the original input displayed on the screen if you are on the other hand inserting into a database then you will need to do some extra work

12023082
swift	objective-c
this is the preferred method which uses url s to get a link directly to the tmp directory and then returns a file url pkm.jpg for that directory swift 4.1 swift 3.1 note that a possible error is not handled
swift 2.0 objective-c note that some methods still request a path as string then use the to return the path as string as shown above in the nslog . when upgrading a current app all files in the folders are guaranteed to be preserved from the old version excluding the subdirectory

12026632
vbscript	vba
an excel macro is written in vba not vbscript
vba s limitations shouldn t be a problem for you

12030249
implements	extends
to implements the required entity locator methods create an entity locator class that extends locator then associate it with the entity in the proxyfor annotation you ll need to implements all of the methods not just create - and the main one you are interested in is find class long
it may be possible to use one single locator type for all proxies - as of 2.4.0 and 2.5.0-rc1 it is safe to fail to implements getdomaintype and all of the other methods that need to know the exact type are provided with it as an argument

12032153
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg libav is the go-to library for this sort of thing on linux
while there are some ffmpeg bindings for node.js e.g they aren t quite as complete as you d need for this task and in any case ffmpeg is itself not asynchronous in the sort of way that you d need to make this make sense for node.js

12032575
udp	tcp
since you say accepts the connection i assume you re setting up a tcp connection between two machines. if you were talking udp there s no listen connect accept and the data would be sent to whatever is listening at the addr port
but you re not talking udp

12032832
profiling	debugging
note i am not sure about slimtune but profiling you tend to attach to the process how to attach and detach the profiling to running processes
debugger.isattached code is included whether debugging or release build

12034850
swift	objective-c
to get the version number objective-c swift 3.0 swift 3.0 to get the build number objective-c swift 3.0 swift 3.0 if you want both in one you then have to use the use the above lines first
objective-c swift notes the values in the main bundle are not always present for example in a command line application there is no cfbundleshortversionstring or cfbundleversion so the methods will return nil and it will crash because in the code it makes a incorrect downcast. but in normal cocoa ios and mac apps these values are defined and will not be deleted

12037252
daemons	systemd
the 4th step suggests that django-cron runs jobs when the entire codebase is reloaded which mod_python or embedded mod_wsgi embedded would do when apache reloads but mod_wsgi daemons does not
a better solution is just to add your script to the systemd cron

12037506
super	implements
but it will also not work because the first statement inside a constructor must be a call to this super
if we implements a different lock then the first line would have to be something like this lock.lock where lock is reentrantlock the compiler is not going to allow this for the reason stated above

12038819
lisp	scheme
the overarching principles are more or less the same and it doesn t seem like learning clojure will significantly change how you think about programming assuming you already know one of the other lisp
there s a much greater emphasis on immutability and functional programming than you find even in scheme and a few functions are named differently and you need to balance parens brackets curlies rather than just parens but that s pretty much it at the language level

12038846
lisp	scheme
learning lisp isn t a bad thing because you ll get used to learning how lisp dialects differ from algol-c based languages
for that matter the same argument could be made about learning scheme

12040733
vbscript	vba
this is vba code formatted to mostly work with vbscript though i could not get this block to transfer properly
as vba this can be improved some by assigning data types etc

12041131
implements	extends
their appearance has not changed since i started using openlaszlo 3.3.3 in 2006 this is probably why they are still implements the old way
to my knowledge there is no open source component set available most companies end up extends the base components to skin them themselves according to what people have said on the openlaszlo forums

12042156
opera	google-chrome
see dev - opera - background shorthand
also what hasn t been noted yet is that not all browsers including google-chrome supports the new css3 shorthand for background

12042532
google-chrome	firefox
not all browsers support this but firefox will let you drag an image out of the browser to another browser or your computer while google-chrome does not allow you to drag an image out of the browser
this page has a so called dropzone open it in google-chrome and open an image in firefox and you can drag the image straight from firefox to google-chrome however it does not seem to work the other way around

12042680
mp4	webm
you re probably looking for video webm and video mp4 respectively
sites default files videos original webm and sites default files videos original mp4 aren t mime-types

12043996
rdf	owl
you can put properties on specific edges in rdf albeit not as nicely as you can w neo4j
but triple stores have the advantage of a real query language a w3c standard data representation which makes it trivial to take your data to another triplestore and for a number of triple stores the ability to perform reasoning based on owl

12044238
fastcgi	scgi
nginx - does not start applications at all however for fastcgi currently not the best for comet streaming because of buffering so scgi would be better with nginx assuming you are using latest nginx version small note scgi is a protocol that is very similar to fastcgi but significantly simpler
fastcgi is the standard protocol to communicate with the web server

12044238
apache	lighttpd
indeed some web servers start the fastcgi applications but lighttpd allows both to start fastcgi and scgi application or connect to independent one cherokee afair allows both to start fastcgi and scgi application or connect to independent one apache mod_fascgi allows both to start fastcgi application or connect to independent one mod_scgi connects to independent application - does not start application
mod_fcgid always starts application - does not suite you also as general note apache does not suit a pattern of working with many idle connections as it uses thread or even process depending mpm per connection

12046210
g++	gcc
your code is c++ so you need to use g++ to do the linking g++ a.o b.o c.o -o prgm.exe this automatically adds the c++ libraries to the link line resolving many if not all of your missing references
gcc is the c compiler

12046802
adplus	procdump
put up taskmanager and see if you ever get multiple instances of your application showing up if you do then you might have to use the -p pid option instead to get adplus to monitor the right process...not ideal as you have to have started the process first in order to get its pid
also look into procdump which uses a technique called reflected processes...which allows a very quick way to copy the process space and let the dump be completed without holding up things...that might help if debugdiag doesn t

12046866
profiling	debugging
a team provisioning profiling is sufficient if you are just doing development that don t involve some of the specialized ios features icloud storage push notifications in-app purchases game center
if you aren t doing any of this then the team profiling will suffice for development debugging

12048087
super	implements
according to this super does not allow implicit calls of hook functions such as __getattr__
i m not sure why it is implements this way there s probably a good reason and things are already confusing enough since the super object has custom __getattribute__ and __get__ methods as it is but it seems like it s just the way things are

12049135
jquery	scriptaculous
ps if you are developing a new application consider using jquery instead of scriptaculous
sounds like you did not include the prototype and or scriptaculous libraries in the application

12049859
google-chrome	safari
here are four reasons i might avoid data uris 1 there s an overhead with data uris both processing and bandwidth 2 data uris are not cached 3 data uris may leak memory in webkit-based browsers - so google-chrome safari and the big smartphones
data uri leak in safari was memory leak with html5 canvas 4 they might be up to 6x slower

12054164
debian	linux
that s not debian specific the default is from linux
check and the response from david miller this behavior is consistent with the linux ipv4 stack s adherence to the host based model of ipv4 address instead of the interface based model which is pretty much what you are asking for

12054571
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
icmp response is only generated if you send something to the remote end that does not have particular port bound
you are wrong probably thinking in terms of tcp - the remote end does not communicate that its udp socket was closed in any way

12056903
client-side	server-side
the choice is not limited to doing it server-side with a weak parser based on inadequate regexps or doing it client-side with a robust parser
it could be implemented server-side with a robust parser too

12059546
selecteditem	selectedindex
after debugging when the field is added back to the list of fields it still retains the previous selecteditem value - and then the combobox s selectedindex is immediately set to -1
preventing this in the setter for formfield.selectedoperator and by trying selecteditem selectedindex doesn t help

12060319
config	ini
the one backup strategy that is most common but not mentioned in your post is to back up the qmgr config
this includes object definitions authorizations exit directories exit parms ini files from these you would be able to recreate the queue manager config and all of these backups can be done while the qmgr is running

12061658
strcpy	malloc
now in cases where we need to consider only say user level operations and invoke no service from operating system like say copying a string. strcpy . in this case definitely we shall not use any system call unnecessarily if at all something is there since it should be an extra overhead due to operating system intervention which is not needed in this case. so i feel choosing between a system call and a library function only occurs for cases where we have a library function built on top of a system call
like adding to examples above we can have say malloc which calls system call brk

12063038
stateless	stateful
s session calling a cdi session scoped producer method from an ejb stateless session bean contexts and dependency injection in java ee 6 you can inject your stateless ejbs with a session scoped cdi bean but you have to realize that within the same application your ejb bean would be dependent on the http session then something you sometimes want to avoid if your bean has to be called from other contexts as well
for your particular use case a stateful session bean would not be a good choice

12063287
bash	tcsh
another list for other shells as well bash csh tcsh ksh etc. is available
taken from that link and tested with tcsh i do not have csh installed to color the prompt you will want to place this symbol in your prompt

12067626
serializable	deserialization
for your second question take a look javadoc during deserialization the fields of non-serializable classes will be initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class. a no-arg constructor must be accessible to the subclass that is serializable. the fields of serializable subclasses will be restored from the stream.
the problem is -- in java java serialization process only continues in object hierarchy till the class is serializable implements serializable interface in java. and in your class you are calling superclass constructor which is not implements serializable

12071618
mongodb	bson
first of all the problem that this line gives syntaxerror because syntax is a literal for set built-in type which is available since python 2.7.x version so here you re trying to create a set consisting of one string let s see an example of creating set in python 2.7 the second thing is that mongodb python driver i assume that you use pymongo doesn t accept strings as queries
it has it s own api and all queries are made via dict s representing json objects note that mongo stores all objects inside in binary representation of json called bson

12074357
express	node.js
however from looking online i have discovered that express has its own router
node.js per-se does not provide support for routes but express does

12074357
express	node.js
node.js per-se does not provide support for routes but express does
you build your routes in express using the following syntax so your route app.get routes.index will process http get request to url path with the routes.index function

12074411
ssl	https
tcp over ssl is not what you have -- it s ssl that runs over tcp
in https case you have http over ssl over tcp

12076007
phpunit	behat
ian pinged me on twitter and asked me to provide some feedback first i will say that i have not used the combo of phpunit and selenium for doing acceptance testing
i use behat + mink to do that but that s not the issue here i think

12077279
swt	swing
in contrast the swt jface gui framework that eclipse uses asserts the correct thread on each public entry point
swing is not thread-safe and all changes to swing objects must be performed within the event dispatch thread

12078671
gif	png
currently your if statement reads if the extension isn t jpg or isn t png or isn t gif which will always match even if the extension is permitted jpg because jpg
png

12079235
persistent	transient
when i call flush on the entity manager i get the persistent exception as a result of this call but not when i call persistent this is expected behaviour
the persistent call only attaches the transient entity to the current persistent session making it managed

12079976
opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i don t believe that firefox safari and opera users are going to be a problem
there may be a small percentage of users that ignore the auto-update prompts for browsers like firefox but not many

12080196
jsdom	cheerio
cheerio is a new module that came out not a long time ago that is a lot more simple to use than jsdom and access many of the issue you can run with jsdom
jsdom is awesome but it can be really hard to use if you need to parse non valid html you have to play with the html5 parser module which is super slow and the all thing is not dev friendly

12081309
gridview	objectdatasource
well actually i do not want to rebind the gridview if the select param of the object data source do not change
so i keep the select param of the objectdatasource in the session view and i rebind my gridview only when one of them changes - this behaviour is only during the pageload event

12081404
equals	gethashcode
this will confuse any code that legitimately assumes that once x and y have tested equals they will remain equals
the class overrides equals but doesn t override gethashcode

12081598
hex	binary
learning hex is easy - all you need to do is memorizing a short table of 16 rows defining hex-to-binary conversion 0 - 0000 1 - 0001 2 - 0010 3 - 0011 4 - 0100 5 - 0101 6 - 0110 7 - 0111 8 - 1000 9 - 1001 a - 1010 b - 1011 c - 1100 d - 1101 e - 1110 f - 1111 with this table in hand you can easily convert hex strings of arbitrary length to their corresponding bit patterns 0x478fd105 - 01000111100011111011000100000101 converting back is easy as well group your binary digits by four and use the table to make hex digits 0010 1001 0100 0101 0100 1111 0101 1100 - 0x29454f5c
base-16 also known as hex notation is convenient because you can fit four bits in exactly one hex digit making conversion to binary very easy yet not requiring as much space as a full binary notation

12081810
bash	zsh
either slackware does not use bash or its version of bash is too old for this feature. check the value of bash_version on both platforms
a possible alternative for could be this will work in bash ksh93 and zsh and has been around slightly longer

12082247
factors	matrix
i imagine it is something like so i would reshape the data so it looks like xy coordinates with then i would make my cutoff into a factors then call ggplot with
i am not 100 sure if your data is in a matrix and you want a heatmap type plot

12082396
udp	tcp
in any case if this is a video stream you should probably be using udp instead of tcp
in udp packets may be dropped but for a video stream this will probably not be noticeable

12082396
udp	tcp
in udp packets may be dropped but for a video stream this will probably not be noticeable
udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

12082396
udp	tcp
udp doesn t care and thus sends less packets
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

12082447
mp3	ogg
ff doesn t actually play mp3 files but instead plays ogg files
if the demo songs in the above corrected example code from lloyd works but when you change the mp3 path to an mp3 file on your server and it doesn t work then make sure your server has the mime type application ogg without quotes

12082447
mp3	ogg
if the demo songs in the above corrected example code from lloyd works but when you change the mp3 path to an mp3 file on your server and it doesn t work then make sure your server has the mime type application ogg without quotes
the server will see the mp3 file in the code and play it as if it were an ogg application file

12083362
google-chrome	firefox
you ll need to use a style config working demo . tested in google-chrome and ie9
firefox doesn t yet support underline in svg

12085301
arp	icmp
in addition seeing arp being slower than icmp doesn t necessarily mean icmp isn t deprioritized---it might mean bandwidth is insufficient to hit the limiting threshold
arp will almost always be slower because it broadcasts and may suffer port-queuing at the switch

12087177
png	ico
the png icon format is not supported
the function works by constructing the ico file directly

12088666
calloc	malloc
in other words something like the following psuedo-code a as to why calloc on your system may seem to return more memory than you have in swap gnu libc will above a certain threshold size use mmap rather than the heap hence your allocation is not restricted to the swap file size its backing storage is elsewhere
from the malloc documentation under linux normally malloc allocates memory from the heap and adjusts the size of the heap as required using sbrk 2

12090566
bash	zsh
whilst i don t know how to do this in bash or even if it s possible i know that if you change your shell to zsh it can be done
it s not enabled by default and i m not sure how to enable it either but i use the zsh grml config which enables the kind of expansion you re talking about

12092347
mtu	icmp
if you ve exceeded the mtu that s not managed by tcp
it s managed at the ip layer and an icmp fragmentation required message will be sent to the client

12092347
mtu	icmp
edit looking at you packet capture there s nothing indicative of a mtu issue
there s no icmp traffic anywhere so i suspect that it s not an issue

12093562
udp	tcp
anything more reliable requires a protocol on top of udp
tcp cannot transfer messages unless they are one byte long

12095666
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
my git repository converted to bazaar in minutes and i was comfortable with using it in less than an hour
i presently still use cvs and though i have committed to using bazaar i have experienced annoyances in edge cases where i use bazaar in applications that are not usally issues in software development

12095666
bazaar	cvs
i presently still use cvs and though i have committed to using bazaar i have experienced annoyances in edge cases where i use bazaar in applications that are not usally issues in software development
even so as the guy who is most likely to train a group of cvs coworkers in an alternative vcs i do firmly believe bazaar will require the least retraining

12095666
bazaar	cvs
i am annoyed that bazaar operations fail entirely over file-access issues with a single file in a group of files being acted on but this should generally not happen in typical software development use cases
what i m trying to say is i am not blindly enamored by bazaar but i still believe it to be the easiest tool to transition to away from cvs in a small engineering department

12095666
bazaar	svn	cvs	svn
what i m trying to say is i am not blindly enamored by bazaar but i still believe it to be the easiest tool to transition to away from cvs in a small engineering department
as a footnote many years ago joined an svn open-source development team with an express goal of getting comfortable with a cvs-like improved vcs

12095666
cvs	svn
i have worked with svn a lot and have even set up partial checkouts etc but i disagree that svn is cvs done right
after years of use i cannot responsibly select svn as a successor to cvs in my organization for a number of reasons

12096376
consistency	acid
acid restricts how scalability can be improved most of the nosql tools relax consistency criteria of the operatioins to get fault-tolerance and availability for scaling which makes implementing acid transactions very hard
a commonly cited theoretical reasoning of distributed data stores is the cap theorem consistency availability and partition tolerance cannot be achieved at the same time

12096874
postgresql	mysql
the better solution use data-moidifying cte available since postgresql 9.1 to do it all in one statement and save a overhead and round trips to the server
mysql knows nothing of the sort not even plain ctes

12097714
google-chrome	firefox
simple example i built for google-chrome doesn t really work in other browsers example fiddle
solution for google-chrome only maybe webkit in general but i can t test that i tried it in old ie7 8 doesn t work because it cuts off the dropdown to the set width as well. firefox doesn t show the arrow and instead cuts the text off since it left-aligns

12098951
content-length	content-type
the most common quirks with ie9 that often do not bother web browsers are mismatches in content-length well this did bother safari last time i looked possibly content-type this acts in reverse - ie9 sometimes correctly gleans html mimetype even if the content-type is wrong connection close
so yes it could be a problem with http pipelining specifically if you pipeline a request with invalid content-length and not even chunked-transfer-encoding ie might wait for the request to finish

12099806
ssl	https
assuming you have https properly configured using ssl tls your main concern is how to implement authentication for your restful service
since https will use ssl tls to encrypt the communication between client and server encryption is not something you should worry about

12099806
ssl	https
since https will use ssl tls to encrypt the communication between client and server encryption is not something you should worry about
if you need to understand how to properly configure ssl tls read understanding ssl tls best practices for securing restful service is already discussed in restful authentication and best practices for securing a rest api web service

12099824
udp	tcp
stubs for calls over the network be they soap rest corba dcom json-rpc or whatever are just helper classes that give you a wrapper function that takes care of all the underlying details such as initializing your tcp udp whatever transport layer finding the right address to call and doing dns lookups if needed connecting to the network endpoint where the server should be handling errors if the server isn t listening checking that the server is what we re expecting it to be security checks versioning etc negotiating the encoding format encoding or marshalling your request parameters in a format suitable for transmission on the network cdr ndr json xml etc. transmitting your encoded request parameters over the network taking care of chunking or flow control as necessary receiving the response s from the server decoding or unmarshalling the response details returning the responses to your original calling code or throwing an error if something went wrong there s no such thing as raw tcp communication
if you are using it in a request response model and infer any kind of meaning from the data sent across the tcp connection then you ve encoded some form of parameters in there

12101055
ubuntu	debian
that s the case under debian ubuntu friends anyway
using a system user with the necessary privileges apt-get install postgresql-contrib-9.1 if your currently logged in user does not have the necessary privileges but sudo rights sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib-9.1 quoting the postgresql apt repository if the version included in your version of debian is not the one you want you can use the postgresql apt repository

12101094
clang	llvm
clang though also based on llvm does not support cuda
2016-05-01 update clang now supports cuda

12102890
arp	udp
it uses the ip address of the receiver to do an arp request to get the mac address
during this process any udp packets you try to send cannot be send out as the destination mac address is still not known

12107360
gson	jackson
first thing to note about gson is that it does not use getter setter but only fields
its performances were not good especially compared to jackson or genson . with the latest versions it has improved as they also provide a streaming api but its still not fast enough

12109106
daemons	systemd
it s not so much your daemons as its property list plist which matters
launchd will enumerate and execute the daemons in systemd library launchdaemons and library launchdaemons for all users

12111590
http	spdy
the initial handshake for websocket connections is http compatible but once the handshake is completed the protocol is a framed bi-directional full-duplex connection with very low overhead often just 2 bytes per frame of header
the websocket over spdy idea is a proposal that may or may not see the light of day

12112702
memcpy	realloc
use memcpy to copy append data to the htmlbff but you also need to ensure you do not exceed the size of htmlbff
either stop receving data when buffersize bytes have been received or use realloc to extend htmlbff to contain more data

12113158
postgresql	mysql
something like this assuming created_at is of type date this is postgresql syntax
i m not sure if mysql supports date arithmetics the same way

12113873
dictionary	map
so if you instead have equivalences mapping int to int you can replace with the last thing to do after all that would be to not use any python objects at all specifically don t use a dictionary for equivalences
this is now easy since it is mapping int to int so one could use from libcpp.map cimport map and then and replace

12114140
super	implements
here is my poem which includes all of the reserved keywords in javascript and is dedicated to those who remain honest in the moment and not just try to score let this long package float goto private class if short. while protected with debugger case continue volatile interface. instanceof super synchronized throw extends final export throws
- false boolean abstract function implements typeof transient break

12115477
mp4	h.264	mp4	webm
for cross-browser compatibility you should offer the file in mp4 using h.264 codec and webm or ogg
older browsers that do not support html5 videos will use the flash player fallback with the mp4 file anyways

12116760
isotope	masonry
but because of layouting masonry isotope which is the whole purpose here you can not have bleed at all sizes - for that you d need to code boxes with fluid widths also which can be done with some extra effort
voids in isotope layouts can occur because the isotope items appear in a certain order top down in the dom and - if there are items spanning two columns or three or if there are items not conforming to the column width - therefore want to rearrage in that original order when the browser is resized

cassini	iis
you should upgrade to that and see if that fixes the issue before wasting any time dealing with http issues on cassini
vs 2008 s built-in web server isn t iis it is something called cassini

12117695
packery	masonry
last of all on his blog post about packery s release desandro states eventually i d like to port over this and other solutions developed in packery to masonry and isotope. i would not count on that happening incredibly soon
packery has only been released for 7 days as of this edit

implements	extends
this seems clearer and later on you can have executiveflatinterface which not only have bedroom and living room but also guess room then flat102 can implements from it
option 2 is to have flat101 extends from flat then flat implements bedroominterface and livingroominterface

12119758
realloc	malloc
correct -- if realloc can t resize the memory block you pass in it makes a new one copies the data and deallocates the old one
however malloc implementations do not typically operate on a byte granularity

12120365
awt	swing
attempts to use other thread-based services such as the awt event-dispatch thread for example may lead to deadlocks swing runs on-top of awt whose underlying event-dispatch thread may be in the process of shutting down too
trying to use swing or awt while shutting down can lead not only to dead locks but also may just not work at all anyways

12123541
prepare	execute
you have to send your client data email phone etc... with an http get post to the server with ajax forms or whatever you wnat then when your server-side php script receive the data you can prepare mail to be sent and call the sendmail function
javascript is execute on client browser php on server-side. so you cannot call server-side functions from javascript

12124016
equals	compareto
the contract of the comparable interface allows for non-consistent behaviour it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals
so in theory it is possible that a class in the jdk had a compareto not consistent with equals

12124083
equals	compareto
say we have this simple student class implementing but not overriding equals hashcode
of course equals is not consistent with compareto - two different students with the same age aren t equal we can safely use it in the results are easy to predict students are nicely sorted according to their age despite being inserted in different order and fetching student using new student 22 key works as well and returns twenty two

12125303
bash	tcsh
it will execute the c shell and the c shell will process the string and execute ls -l bin ls bin sh bin bash so the problem is how to relay arguments with spaces in them to c shell reliably when the command as a whole is being specified as a single string
you already know that this runs into problems on my machine i get ls a no such file or directory ls b no such file or directory ls c no such file or directory ls d no such file or directory ls e no such file or directory ls f no such file or directory if we do the expansion manually we can get the desired result for this limited example with mkdir . a b c . d e f set -- a b c d e f # two arguments with spaces bin tcsh -c ls -al a b c d e f this yields a b c total 0 drwxr-xr-x 2 jleffler staff 68 aug 25 12 21 . drwxr-xr-x 4 jleffler staff 136 aug 25 12 21 .. d e f total 0 drwxr-xr-x 2 jleffler staff 68 aug 25 12 21 . drwxr-xr-x 4 jleffler staff 136 aug 25 12 21 .. i m going to assume that the two directories a b c and d e f exist from here onwards without creating them each time. so the objective must be to find a way to create a string that will be safe when interpreted by the c shell automatically not manually as shown

12125334
realloc	malloc
the language and library specification makes no such guarantee just like it does not guarantee that a trimming realloc will preserve the pointer value
an implementation might decide to implement realloc in the most primitive way by doing an unconditional malloc for a new memory block copying the data and free -ing the old block

12125381
bash	tcsh
so to correct your assumptions in your original script it is not tcsh which receives only a single argument from bash but it s ls receiving only a single one from tcsh
your tcsh script is wrong

12129326
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you might try searching the internet for .htaccess options not allowed here
a suggestion i found using google is check to make sure that your httpd.conf file has allowoverride all

12129979
scikit-learn	nltk
the problem with the nltk wrapper for scikit-learn is that it actually wants dicts mapping feature names to numeric values so that s not going to solve the problem in this case
the dictvectorizer is scikit-learn is more sophisticated in that it does a one-of-k coding when it encounters string feature values

12132490
jar	war
check the jars that are included in your final war file using jar -tf thejar.jar on whether they include the preconditions class
the exception means you re missing a class on your classpath so you re either missing a jar or one of the jars surprisingly doesn t include its required classes

12133640
implements	extends
you re not implements textwatcher - you re creating a new interface which extends it
so you would write public interface testing extends textwatcher or public class testing implements textwatcher you haven t said what you re really trying to do so we can t tell whether you should actually be declaring a class or just declaring a new interface which extends textwatcher

12134333
realloc	malloc
if realloc doesn t get a null it will try to expand memory starting from that location or may try to free and malloc another part of memory
since uninitialized variables can have any value chances are very high they are not a value realloc likes

12134583
realloc	malloc
there are those who argue it is better to use malloc for the initial allocation and realloc thereafter
there is some justice to the suggestion not least because you probably wouldn t use to free the memory even though you could do so so you don t really need malloc or free because realloc can do all three operations

12134583
realloc	malloc
there is some justice to the suggestion not least because you probably wouldn t use to free the memory even though you could do so so you don t really need malloc or free because realloc can do all three operations
but the c90 standard requires realloc 0 new_size to work equivalently to malloc new_size and i know of no c library that behaves differently but there might be some

12136123
strncpy	malloc
you can fix this with a after the strncpy
the size passed to malloc isn t correct

12136123
multiplying	addition
you probably meant and this is because the argument to malloc is the number of bytes you re asking for so you need to multiplying the length you want by the size of the elements
in addition you should also check that the value returned from malloc isn t null

12136422
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i added the following code to the end of viewcontroller s viewdidload implementation as well as changing the line assigning content size to this view does not get its frame set during makekeyandvisible and is in the correct place
to work around the issue i d recommend setting up the view hierarchy after the window has -makekeyandvisible called possibly in a viewwillappear not sure if that will have the same issue or by otherwise structuring your code to delay the laying out of the scroll view

12138145
google-chrome	firefox
i have the same problem it works in google-chrome but not in firefox and ie
after debugging i found that there is a 1 px difference between document .height - window .height and window .scrolltop in firefox but not in google-chrome

12138357
debian	linux
better compile them on debian 5.0
linux kernel developers provide a backward compatibility not a forward

12139833
awt	swing
update sorry i know this is not answering question but my highlight some other areas of inefficiency from paintng in awt swing programs should not invoke this method painimmediately directly unless there is a valid need for real-time painting
this is because the asynchronous repaint will cause multiple overlapping requests to be collapsed efficiently whereas direct calls to paintimmediately will not further having spent time reading through the painting in awt swing doc again i think your misunderstanding the potentional benefits if the clip

12139845
implements	extends
the interface does not concern itself on how will the code be implements
as opposed to extends classes when you extends a class you are using some predefined code

12140103
qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager
however this rate controller is operating on qtcpsockets to be exact on peerwireclients so you need to change the type of the peers to be qiodevice which i hope isn t that hard since peerwireclient inherits from qtcpsocket which itself inherits from qiodevice note that the ratecontroller from the torrent example controlls both upload and download but you only need to control the download rate
so you can remove unnecessary code. then you need to make requests made by your qnetworkaccessmanager use this rate controller

12140206
innodb	myisam
changing engine to innodb
changing engine from myisam to innodb should not affect your data but safe side you can easily take backup of your table before changine engine

12140377
multiplying	multiplication
as for the vec-mac multiplication aquilarapax is right in that you can only multiplying a mat4 with a vec4
but since you re multiplying directions the 4rth coordinate should be 0.0f not 1.0f

12144417
opera	firefox
from my memory in opera you cannot set the decimal places of the percentage so if you set 33.3 it uses only 33 rather annoying edit opera may have improved on that in current version as it seems in firefox if you have percentages that add up to 100 the pixels don t always add up to the 100 of the pixels you have a outer div with three columns all with width 33.33333
if the outer div has width 100px the columns will have 33 pixels and the sum is 99 pixels and not 100. edit firefox does better than i remember

12148594
png	ico
for the biggest layers 96 and 256 it is pretty safe to use png compression because usually older desktops don t display icons so big
png2ico takes png as source files but it doesn t state that it actually use png compression in the resulting ico file

12148594
png	ico
png2ico takes png as source files but it doesn t state that it actually use png compression in the resulting ico file
i recommend you to use gimp there you can create an image with a layer for each size you want the resulting ico to support

12149415
calloc	malloc
if you re worried about the performance of calloc malloc might be faster simply due to the fact that it does not initialize the allocated buffer as calloc do
i suppose that the argument layout of calloc is to allow the allocation of object sizes greater than the storage capacity of a single size_t parameter type which might be as small as 64kib

12152072
prepare	execute
here s how prepare statements work you send the query with placeholders to the rdbms the rdbms stores the query and pre-computes an execution plan you separately tell the database to execute the statement and pass the values to bind to its parameters the rdbms execute its stored plan using the values
prepare statements are created and execute by the database not by your code

12156046
super	implements
i m not sure if it s exactly what you re after but here are a couple of helpful resources for this sort of core data functionality super happy easy fetching in core data the source for magicalrecord magicalrecord is a small framework for core data that makes it work a lot like activerecord from the ruby world
in particular it implements a lot of the fetching functionality you re after i think

12157340
memcached	apc
my class loader uses memcached as cache for storing the class paths
it turned out that the code for building cache keys were the cause of the problem - and not the apc which it seemed to be

12158012
jax-ws	saaj
from java rocking jax-ws versus saaj from a practical standpoint using saaj means that you don t use tools such as wsimport or wsdl2java
those are for use with jax-ws and are the means by which a client can generate domain objects and operate almost as if they were not using web services at all

12158012
jax-ws	saaj
those are for use with jax-ws and are the means by which a client can generate domain objects and operate almost as if they were not using web services at all
with saaj you have no domain view of a service

12158012
jax-ws	saaj
development with jax-ws can be much quicker and easier and generally does not cause you any loss in control
but jax-ws is a convenience layer and it can be comforting to know that if you wield some command of saaj you ll be ready to do anything that a wsdl interface requires of you

12158112
coalesce	isnull
updated it meant a huge difference in performance marcus culver across 730 000 rows 154 columns being isnull d took 00 02 34 as opposed to coalesce at 01 32 43
first of all you can try isnull which has a better performance but not as much as you need however it is quicker

12160874
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is not noted as a supported distribution in the requirements however redhat is so noted
please refer to the requirements and installation guide for information on installing a load generator on redhat linux

12161048
multiplying	division
you can definitely use that as a sub-query to get the answer noting that to get the percentage you need to divide the cumulative sum by the gross sum you may be able to write just multiplying the colc expression by 100 to get a percentage instead of a fraction
tested against ibm informix 11.70.fc2 on mac os x 10.7.3 both the queries with division work producing the same answer and i note that i get 0.81 instead of 0.71 as required in the question name1 218 0.34603174603174603174603174603175 name2 157 0.5952380952380952380952380952381 name3 134 0.80793650793650793650793650793651 name4 121 1.0 you might have to use a cast to ensure the division is done using floating point instead of integer arithmetic as you can see that wasn t necessary with informix the sum is a floating point decimal anyway just in case the table has billions of rows in it not just 4 of them

12162255
inline	inlining
since your member is not inline it picks the most general type it can obj in this case
inlining your method will allow column to remain generic

12163447
google-chrome	safari
so either make sure your page server doesn t try to enable google-chrome frame on the client compile for ie8 and safari 2 permutations uninstall google-chrome frame or if it s only to speed up iterations while developing testing your app only compile the safari permutation
gwt thinks your ie8 is a safari you probably have google google-chrome frame installed and your page or server sends the appropriate bits to activate it

12164904
prng	random
as a contrast here is the same analysis of 10 mib from freebsd s yarrow prng that i ran earlier while there seems not much difference in the other data the χ² precentage is much closer to 50
martijn s answer is a pretty succinct review of the random number generators that python has access to

12164954
sudo	passwd
the script requires sudo which as i m sure you know will require that the users of it know their root passwd
maybe some more bash savvy folks can suggest a way around sudo if this is not an option for you

12169058
innodb	myisam
if you do then here is a another so answer that details how to enable innodb on mysql how to enable innodb in mysql
if you need transactions then you need transactions and myisam isn t going to cut the mustard

12169109
innodb	myisam
you can often either enable the engine install the innodb components manually or simply re-install a version of mysql that includes that engine by default
myisam is the crazypants database stupidly fast but also unreliable and prone to complete destruction if your system isn t shut down properly

12171951
serializable	deserialization
through the serializable deserialization loop you will get a different object which is however semantically identical
imo serializable of enumeration does not really make much sense

12176698
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
i d use a gridbaglayout instead
firstly i d personally avoid grouplayout its not really meant for hand coding

12179345
innodb	myisam
whenever you re deleting many rows and the number of rows that you are keeping is a much smaller portion than those you are deleting this trick from mysql documentation works really well if you are deleting many rows from a large table you may exceed the lock table size for an innodb table
to avoid this problem or simply to minimize the time that the table remains locked the following strategy which does not use delete at all might be helpful another method to improve delete time with myisam is to use delete quick and then optimize table afterward also from mysql documentation if you are going to delete many rows from a table it might be faster to use delete quick followed by optimize table

12182327
bash	subshell
it s also possible to use a bash subshell instead
another way not using tee is to simply use a bash command group with a single redirection of stdout to a log file use the operator to append to the log file or use the operator to append both stdout and stderr

12182622
junit	testng
unfortunately junit is not very well suited for integration tests - mainly because you cannot have before class and after class non-static methods
i see two choices for you switch to testng - i know it s a big step encode your setup tear down logic in a spring bean included in the context only during tests - but then it will run only once before all tests

12184181
google-chrome	firefox
some browsers like google-chrome and ie7 8 recognize arial narrow bold
but ie9 and firefox do not

12188588
floating-point	fractions
the root problem is that you cannot exactly represent the square root of a non-square as a floating-point number
if ξ is the exact value and x the approximation which is supposed to be still quite good so that in particular still holds then the difference after the next step of the continued fractions algorithm is thus we see that in each step the absolute value of the difference between the approximation and the real value increases since

12189397
strcpy	strdup
your strcpy s should be strcpy key str and not the other way around
you can just use strdup btw and save the malloc+strcpy

12190604
uiview	subviews
and in the implementation add you should be doing it as a uiview not a uiviewcontroller
the general rule in ios development is that view controllers take up the entire screen and views are used for subviews that take up part of the screen though this is less the case for ipad

12191054
google-chrome	safari
and if it works with google-chrome hope it works in safari too
jquery s unload works well in google-chrome too with the exception that google-chrome doesn t allow alerts within it

12191976
cassini	iis
cassini visual studio development server is x86 application that s why it does not support x64 web applications to run
you must host x64 web applications only on iis which support both x86 and x64

12194353
profiling	debugging
the solution for me was to make sure that my profiling scheme was using the debugging and not release build configuration
in xcode 4 select product edit scheme from the top menu then click on the profiling button on the left

12195222
rpm	yum
in case you don t have internet access from your centos 6.3 machine download the openssl package from here copy it to your machine then install it using this command # rpm -uvh openssl-1.0.0-25.el6_3.1.i686.rpm
if not try to use # yum -y install openssl from command line it s straight forward to install using yum it s use the internet to download and install the needed rpm packages

12195783
primes	modulus
a couple of additional comments and things to think about of course if you do choose two 512-bit primes you ll end up with either a 1023-bit or a 1024-bit modulus
that s probably not worth worrying about but if you really cared about getting exactly a 1024-bit modulus you could either restrict the range of p and q further say to or just throw out any 1023-bit modulus and try again

12203712
division	addition	division	modulo
the last step which involves modulo division by 2 10 - 1 has the effect of merging together each set of 10 bits from positions 0-9 10-19 20-29 ... in the 64-bit value
they do not overlap so the addition steps underlying the modulo division behave like or operations

12204603
apache	nginx
normally php runs in apache nginx via fastcgi or on microsoft iis via fast cgi
with apache and iis this may be a problem as it s not really built with persistent connections such as websockets in mind

12204603
apache	nginx
with apache and iis this may be a problem as it s not really built with persistent connections such as websockets in mind
i m not sure about nginx

12208500
implements	extends
you ll have to implements your own usage of course like extends this will work with any number of objects -- not just 2
working demo that s not how extends works

12211332
vim	textmate
textmate 1 you need to create a symbolic link i have textmate 1 i use vim now ln -s applications textmate.app contents resources mate usr local bin mate
by adding the following to the core section in .gitconfig update ok if it s already there then the issue is probably with textmate and not git

12213303
implements	extends
i have this scenario implements in a few of my apps and it works perfectly
i assume you are using some custom preferences implementations which does not extends from preferenceactivity

12216920
sum	coalesce
here you go select jobname sum case countername when kilos then productioncounter else 0 end as sumkilos sum case countername when bars then productioncounter else 0 end as sumbars min startdate max coalesce enddate undefined date max stage from vwoeeinterval where countername in kilos bars group by jobname
not sure if this max coalesce enddate undefined date works in sql server since datatype s might clash

12218771
png	ico
internet explorer does not support a png favicon
what you should do is setup your tag like so for ie and legacy browsers also keep a less-pretty by the fact it s an ico not intentionally

12220513
client-side	server-side
clientid is used to get the client-side id thats generated by asp.net and use it server-side
it s not clientid thats an server-side property use this.id

12221360
move	drag
in the mousereleaseevent i check to see if the overall move was greater than at least a tiny amount
if it was then it was a drag and we ignore the normal event to not produce a clicked signal

12222040
ienumerable	iqueryable
update in response to your comment it seems that your question is as much about the iqueryable ienumerable duality being dangerous from the point of view of introducing ambiguity
it really isn t c# sees the lambda as an first and foremost so if t is an iqueryable then the iqueryable extension method is selected

12228697
quicksort	timsort	mergesort	timsort
for example the algorithm used by sort does not have to be a mergesort but it does have to be stable. for sorting numeric primitives jdk 7 uses dual pivot quicksort
beginning with version 7 oracle s java implementation is using timsort for object arrays bigger than 10 elements and insertion sort for arrays with less than that number of elements

12228857
udp	mtu
furthermore i was led by the misconception that gnu linux can send udp packets only to the interface s mtu which is not true
even though the standard only guarantess 576 bytes at least in my case it seems possible to send and receive udp packets up to 65507 bytes after which the message too long error is returned by the sendto call

12231766
single-quotes	double-quotes
using single-quotes for a multi-character string gives you an error such as encountered i 105 after m and this is because beanshell was expecting another after the m to end the character literal but it got i instead
string literals in beanshell like in java must use double-quotes not single quotes bsh x missing

12233583
stateless	stateful
php is not stateless http is
to state it simply we have essentially built a layer on top of a stateless technology upon which we can implement stateful designs

12234909
exponent	modulo
you re computing powers with very large exponent which is extremely slow if the results are not reduced in process
for example a naive computation of requires creating a 10000000-digit number and taking modulo 11

12236630
qtableview	qtablewidget
however i d advise you to start using a qtableview s instead of a qtablewidget as it offers far more flexibility
assuming that you could append a new row to your table with something like if you have a qtablewidget and not a qtableview you could use the same mo append a new row with self.insertrow self.rowcount use the .setitem method to modify the data of your last row

12236809
rdf	owl
is my humble opinion that you don t know rdf altogether and your are struggling to get things working by asking random questions here on so when you are not able to figure out what s wrong by yourself
there s nothing wrong with this attitude however it would be way better if you tried to carefully read the documentation owl rdf and jena

12237897
sudo	passwd
for ubuntu set root passwd if it not defined yet sudo passwd change user to root su install tower npm install tower -g this way works for me
note not work if you change user to root with sudo -s command

12238408
implements	extends
class user extends baseuser implements ldapuserinterface
seems that your user class is not extends from the fos users s base class

12240038
ienumerable	iqueryable
as for the first query that s deferred execution.you created an ienumerable of train s noticed that it did not have the include method so cast it to iqueryable added the include and added the tolist to prevent lazy loading
but as per msdn on dbextensions.include this extension method calls the include string method of the iqueryable source object if such a method exists

12240068
google-chrome	firefox
at the root of the problem is the difference in the way that webkit browsers specifically google-chrome and safari and other browsers treat the onpopstate event
the current version of both google-chrome and safari fire an onpopstate event for the initial page load both firefox and opera and possibly others do not do this

12240688
consistency	acid
in the case where you need to have the same data d such as prop_info in your case returned by two separate queries against two separate collections a and b you have to choose between the following three strategies duplicate d in the documents of both a and b and enforce consistency with your code
this is typically the design choice of high-performance systems that want to eliminate the need for a second query even if that comes at the cost of additional code complexity on the insert update side and with some potential consistency problems since mongo is not acid

12241117
mongodb	bson
the on-disk storage of documents in mongodb is in bson format
there is a detailed description of the bson format here - while there is some disk savings from using short key names since as you can see by looking at the spec the key name is embedded in the document it looks to me like there d be almost no net difference between the two designs in terms of on-disk space used -- the extra bytes you use by using the delimiters - get bought back by not having to have string terminators for the separate key values

12241137
mp4	h.264
which mp4 files delivered over http almost certainly do assuming they re using the h.264 video codec and a non-crazy audio format
if you have a native android app then you shouldn t need to rely on flash or a webview to play mp4 videos in android at all

12242891
hex	binary
you re not converting to hex
you re packing the integer as binary data.

12245145
consistency	acid
in this case however acid turns out to be difficult to satisfy the cap theorem states somewhat similar that availability consistency and partition tolerance can not be achieved at the same time
if we give up acid satisfying base for example scalability might be increased

12247038
spweb	spsite
of course you better not do this on every page load as creation and disposing of spsite spweb objects is relatively expensive
you can do it by opening an admin web instance creating a spsite object and passing system account s user token to it

12247577
hex	binary
the hash computed by sha256 is binary not hex string
there are two in my opinion reasonable ways of fixing this convert the hash read from the file to binary before comparing convert the hash computed at runtime to text before comparing you can see that the two solutions are each other s complement which seems natural to me

12248011
hex	binary
the reason it is not working is that one is a pointer to an ascii string that contains a hex value
and the other is an array of binary value which you are printing as hex

12248457
dbcontext	objectcontext
ef has this mechanism as well but it is not exposed on dbcontext api
you need to get back to objectcontext

12250129
serializable	deserialization
however a interface pointer in a record is not easy to serializable anyway it contains a pointer instead of a full json encoded string - so i am not sure if the record serializable fails for a different reason
you could wrap the json serialized object in a container object which has two properties type name the wrapped object then in the deserialization first read the type of the contained object and then load the serialized object into a delphi object variable of the corresponding type

12256161
awt	swing
i ve used awt swing and javafx for major projects in audio including waveform drawing and editing
here are my thoughts awt is not being developed or taught

12258061
gif	png
use appropriate image formats - png versus jpeg android prefers png for bitmap image files accepts jpeg and discourages gif
however png and jpeg are not equivalents

12258446
postgresql	mysql
mysql i wouldn t recommend because you are really tying everything to one app only that can write to the db sql mode soup means relations are basically a private api instead of the public api they are in postgresql firebird and ingres and this means less flexibility down the road
however with postgresql you get a top-notch extensible development platform in a box

awt	swing	swt	swing
there is awt swing swt javafx android gui
the most common is swing and while its not the prettiest i would start with that unless you have specific requirements

12262553
vb.net	vb6
quite apart from the fact that the language vb.net is far more feature rich than vb6 the fact that you have developed in vb.net means that you have made extensive use of the .net class libraries including system.security.cryptography that you give as an example
these are simply not available to vb6 code

12266008
division	multiplication
read this article on how matrix multiplication works and you can backtrack and figure out what is going on under the hood of a matrix division
matrix division with octave explained a formal description of octave matrix division from here what that means is that these two should be the same first understand that octave matrix division is not commutative just like matrix multiplication is not commutative

12266360
equals	gethashcode
in .net all objects have a equals
whether that s a good thing or not is debatable some would prefer the c++ approach where an object need not have any sense of being equal to another but once done it does make sense that all objects also have a gethashcode because of the link between one and the other

12268632
client-side	server-side
assuming there is a client-side component typically this component cannot be trusted to have the database connection
this would therefore require a server-side component running that could serve as a gatekeeper for the database

12269063
hex	binary
when i open the notepad in a hex viewer i see the corresponding hex value for each character
but why not the binary values hex is just another representation of bytes

12269063
hex	binary
but why not the binary values hex is just another representation of bytes
the following three are equal 10 decimal value 10 0xa hex value 10 00001010 binary value 10 a computer only stores binary values

12269224
implements	extends
specifically it assumes that all of the java collection interfaces are also implements but does not actually extends those interfaces
so it s possible to forget to implement some of them and then have things work fine until you get to some code that assumes they re implements

12272540
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not appear to currently have a limit but they re refactoring the websocket code and it looks like they ll be adding a limit of 30 connections per group which i assume means 30 connections per origin
yes there is a limit for firefox

12272916
memcpy	strcpy
for a bunch of bytes in general you would use memcpy
note that lalla 0 is equivalent to lalla all string literals are zero-terminated in c.¹ since strcpy does not perform any size verification you must make sure that the string including its final null character fits in the memory that you ve allocated for the targets

12273672
super	self
super foo self .somemethod or in python 3 just super .somemethod
however if you have a need to directly call inherited methods from two base classes super might not be a good fit

12273983
implements	extends
you ve stated that i have class which likes to keep reference of object that either implements a or b but the field called object is actually a class not an object instance of a class
your code works if you were truly trying to have your setter accept any interface that extends a

12276557
sudo	passwd
so try sudo dvtcolorconvert.rb themes obsidiancode.xccolortheme if this doesn t work try adapting the permissions sudo chmod 755 dvtcolorconvert.rb sudo chmod 755 themes obsidiancode.xccolortheme
you should run the script as superuser just add sudo in front of the command and type your passwd when prompted

12281112
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
using a relative location my session variable showed up in the next page in internet explorer safari google-chrome opera and firefox
using an explicit location it showed up in ie and safari but not in google-chrome opera and firefox

12282252
backgrounding	multitasking
app crashed -- no way unless opening the app user exited the app -- app is sitting in the backgrounding
there you have a maximum of 10 minutes restriction of fully using your app like the app pastebot does user started using other apps so our app isn t running in the foreground anymore -- same as user exited the app on multitasking apple says the following real multitasking only for certain kinds of usage as there is audio backgrounding playing voip like skype navigation applications all the other apps can request a specific amount of time after the app is closed in the backgrounding to finish certain tasks as sending an email sms or uploading downloading important data important quote from dev docs your app delegate s applicationdidenterbackground method has approximately 5 seconds to finish any tasks and return

12282373
profiling	debugging
you cannot debugging or run your application on the device when it has been built with an app store provisioning profiling
the entitlements disallow debugging through the get-task-allow value and the provisioning profiling does not include any allowed device ids

12282373
profiling	debugging
the entitlements disallow debugging through the get-task-allow value and the provisioning profiling does not include any allowed device ids
if you are archiving your app using the standard xcode archive command you can resign the archive with your developer identitiy and provisioning profiling for testing on the device

12282599
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer and google-chrome automatically make global variables for dom elements with id values
firefox doesn t because no standard says it should and it s a goofy idea anyway

12282676
intersect	contains
this doesn t necessarily include any of the corners but it does require that the polygon intersect one of the four sides of the box
one way you could find the pixels where the polygon intersect with the contains box is with the following algorithm so for example say we re looking at and

12282903
prng	random
or better still use a real random number source or a crypto-quality prng instead of random
for the record the javadoc java 7 does not specify how random seeds itself

12284288
set	bag
this isn t the right way to do it - it might work if you have your unsaved-value mapping right for the primary key but the proper way to do it is to use session.load viewmodel.locationid see there are a number of ways of dealing with this but it sounds like you want your relationship to be mapped as a set to prevent duplicates rather than a bag
if you map it as a set and use iset for the property type of the relationship the duplicates will be handled for you

12285141
gif	png
another thing is that you should use png as your resources not gif
if you want animation please convert your gif animation to separate images and use frame animation feature of android

12285141
gif	png
but then it will be rejected because it is gif not png
my suggestion is to load this gif into gimp save each frame as separate drawable ajax_loader_01.png ajax_loader_02.png etc

12286859
multiplying	subtract
by multiplying the second point by 10 you re not maintaining the x to y ratio
you need to subtract the origin before multiplying

12291220
clgeocoder	mkreversegeocoder
clgeocoder isn nt available in ios earlier than ios 5.0
if you really want to use ios 5.0 there s an earlier geocoder mkreversegeocoder

12292219
http	spdy
protocols like spdy have it but you re out of luck if you re restricted to http
you re looking for server push it isn t available in http

12298344
super	extends	super	self
if you really really have good reason to do it you can just use hasattr on the super object like you would with any other object class cat mammal def walk self if hasattr super cat self walk super cat self .walk do_something_here you would only want to do this in unusual situations though such as subclassing classes from a third-party library where you can t rely on certain methods being present for some reason
generally speaking you ll probably want to provide at least a stub method in whichever superclass is the most generic class mammal object def walk self pass then extends it in subclasses by calling super class cat mammal def walk self super cat self .walk # or just super .walk in python 3+ do_something_here making the super call conditional is not hard but it s probably a bad idea it s verbose fragile and only encourages bad practices

12300820
matlab	simulink
but i do not think this method will be good to use neural network for other programs to me the better solution is to use of neural network formula like this try to simulate neural network in matlab by myself and use of weights of network that exports from trained network in matlab be used in yourself program because it s easy and clean
itnoa if you can generate a simulink model of the network then you can export your network to c language like it s simple

12301029
decimal	ieee
when the source text 6.25e-05 is interpreted as a decimal numeral and converted to double it is not exactly representable because floating-point values have limited precision and each bit has a value that is a power of two not a decimal digit
the ieee 754 double-precision value that is nearest to 6.25e-5 is 6.25000000000000013010426069826053208089433610439300537109375e-05 or in hexadecimal floating-point 0x1.0624dd2f1a9fcp-14

12301347
mp3	ogg
t firefox support the mp3 file format in audio
you can t play mp3 files in firefox it does not support them you need an ogg version for firefox

12301673
jar	war
during war step the servlet jar is not included
i m not 100 following your message but providedcompile is only allowed for war plugin

12301812
bufferedreader	filechannel
you can t mark reset the bufferedreader to resolve it because once characters are read into the reader s buffer they will not be reread from the file only regurgitated every time you try and read again
getting the underlying filechannel and reading and setting position also fails because your position in the file includes characters read into the buffer that you may not have seen yet and you will end up skipping that unseen data

12303778
ssl	https
that s not the way ssl proxies work
if you set your https proxy to localhost 8080 then your browser will dutifully connect to localhost 8080 and use the connect verb to tunnel ssl traffic through the http proxy connection

12303778
ssl	https
if you set your https proxy to localhost 8080 then your browser will dutifully connect to localhost 8080 and use the connect verb to tunnel ssl traffic through the http proxy connection
without doing this ssl wouldn t be particularly secure and any proxy server administrator could trivially read one s credit card details next time someone decided to buy something from amazon or check their bank balance or sign up for a recurring-payment adult entertainment web site or whatever it is that people do that requires ssl these days

12303978
inline	inlining
it s never inline in the il - it s only done by the jit
you can explicitly force a method to not be inline using methodimplattribute you can also sort of request inlining as of .net 4.5 .

12305574
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i think the problem is not with your ad rotator but with your timer and updatepanel
can you check removing all the unnecessary code you have at the top scriptmanager timer and updatepanel

12306443
serializable	deserialization
common references to objects made by various markup extension formats such as staticresource or binding will be dereferenced by the serializable process
conclusion that i made out now is you cannot directly load the usercontrol as whole by serializable - deserialization procedure of xaml

12306472
spaces	delimiter
here s what got me down the wrong path do not create any sessions in putty as outlined here do not use any host aliases you might have defined in .ssh config here s how you get it working obviously make sure gitextensions is set to use putty not openssh make sure plink.exe the one available with gitextensions or specifically installed with putty is in a path without spaces set your env variable git_ssh to point to plink.exe it might be pointing to ssh.exe by default make sure there are no apostrophes since the value will be used as-is that s why you can t use spaces as stated above use the full command to pull no host aliases that would allow you to not specify the port etc. in the example above
if the port is missing and there s just a colon git treats it as a path separator and ssh as port delimiter so they bite each fairly bad

12307728
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 10.0.4 12.0.4 etc
the swt libraries are different and newer versions of linux using gnome 3 may not be as stable and robust as older versions

12310519
profiling	instrumentation
when you run in instrumentation mode the profiling injects a bit of code at the entry exit points of every method to record the performance data
however it only injects this profiling code into the assembly you re actually profiling your c# application and not any of the referenced assemblies

12312611
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you should not display the alertview in viewdidload displays the alertview using animation
we should avoid animation performance when we are not in screen view display the alertview in viewdidappear instead

12313500
translation	localization
the advantage is usually that users can add modify translation and switching language on the fly easier
the disadvantages are this technique is more intrusive it has to hook string loading display and may require code changes tools are usually limited to string localization and don t offer broader control images sizes etc. and may not work with unknown controls libraries they could not hook correctly

12314945
ubuntu	linux
i assume you have ubuntu linux
try this sudo apt-get install php5-curl see also ubuntu forum and afterwards restart your apache. normally in linux extensions are not called .dll but .so

12317245
inline	inlining
in the general case at higher optimisation levels this call could be either inline or if the call sites always pass in constants values known at compile time the result can be calculated at compile time and any runtime overhead completely avoided
the general cases under which case an optimising compiler will choose not to inline functions are recursive functions when it is favouring size over speed or if inlining would greatly skew the size of the end binary one more issue to note is that inlining will change the linkage of a function

12318494
innodb	myisam
with an innodb table this will work but myisam doesn t support transactions and ignores the start transaction statement
change the storage engine for your table to innodb

12320222
viewdidload	viewdidappear
my presumption is that the view controller s view is not in the window s view hierarchy at the point that it has been loaded when the viewdidload message is sent but it is in the window hierarchy after it has been presented when the viewdidappear message is sent
caution if you do make a call to presentviewcontroller animated completion in the viewdidappear you may run into an issue whereby the modal view controller is always being presented whenever the view controller s view appears which makes sense

12323476
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
while this works for selecting it in ie firefox google-chrome safari and opera it won t let you edit it by clicking a second time in firefox google-chrome and safari
not entirely sure but i think this may be due to those 3 browsers re-issuing a focus event even though the field already has focus thus never allowing you to actually insert the cursor since you re selecting it again whereas in ie and opera it appears it isn t doing that so the focus event didn t get fired again and thus the cursor gets inserted

12325375
profiling	instrumentation
once inside xcode hold down the run button click profiling which will open up instrumentation and add the automation widget like in the link i provided
this is not titanium specific it can be used for any ios app and seems like a great tool for every ios developer along with allocators and memory leak widgets inside of instrumentation

12327364
required	placeholder
when passing the data in for execution the corresponding array keys can optionally include the leading but it is not required
a placeholder name should contain only alpha-numeric characters

12330001
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
ok just so you know it s very bad practice to put a uitabbarcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller - apple recommends for good ui design that you only should ever put a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller and not the other way round
either way you should be able to change the title from the uitabbarcontroller like this

12330791
mvp	presenter
code splitting and mvp are 2 differents things it means that you don t need mvp for code splitting but it s a very good thing to do with mvp
broadly speaking a ui with gwt it s lot of components view presenter put together each component can be code with mvp or not

12330791
mvp	presenter
broadly speaking a ui with gwt it s lot of components view presenter put together each component can be code with mvp or not
and when a component call an other component you must use gwt.runasync if you want to split your code. so for the first question yes asyncprovider works with mvp

12331383
queue	fifo
no task queue is not a scheduler so you can not schedule a task to run at certain time
tasks put into a task queue are served immediatelly in a fifo fashion

12332715
implements	extends
as long as you are not in the class that has al methods implements make the class abstract
abstract classes can not be instantiated and there must be another class thats extends the abstract class with a implementation

12338033
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview	setcontentview	findviewbyid
inside oncreate ... add this line setcontentview r.layout.my_layout
i think that you did not set content view inside oncreate method and therefor findviewbyid is unable to find view objects and so returns null

12338430
backgrounding	multitasking
i really think there is no other way then abusing the backgrounding audio playback system to keep your app running in the backgrounding then present a local notification with no sound and play the sound out of a call in your backgrounding app with a system library core audio etc...
consider reading the ios app programming guide - app states and multitasking read the following part implementing long-running backgrounding tasks and playing backgrounding audio you can t do that with normal local notifications as they have a limit of 30 seconds and you cannot let the user choose the file

12339506
mdpi	hdpi
720dp a 10 tablet 720x1280 mdpi 800x1280 mdpi etc. . it is taken straight from stack overflow question android screens size hdpi ldpi mdpi
i am not sure what you are looking for exactly but here are some sizes in pixels 320dp a typical phone screens 240x320 ldpi 320x480 mdpi 480x800 hdpi etc

12339506
mdpi	hdpi
i am not sure what you are looking for exactly but here are some sizes in pixels 320dp a typical phone screens 240x320 ldpi 320x480 mdpi 480x800 hdpi etc
480dp a tweener tablet like the streak 480x800 mdpi

12341354
serializable	deserialization
side note it would be much easier but less problems and bugs to read old data append what you need and serializable back as whole file
the resulting file is invalid xml so you will not be able to use it directly for deserialization as valid xml

12344862
svg	vml
i believe ie10 supports svg natively now
internet explorer does not support svg you need to use vml for vector graphics in ie

12349097
vmware	virtualbox
many advanced features such as vsphere are probably not required by most users and vmware will provide the same core technologies and 3d acceleration as the esx workstation solution
from my experience vmware 5 is faster than virtualbox 4.2 rc3 and has better smp performance

12350954
innodb	myisam
i m using tables with 150m rows and queries are still performing well under .005s i m suspecting you re using myisam and not innodb
with myisam each insert or update locks the entire table

12352541
persistent	transient
you don t have to persistent it in the same tables or even in the same database instances as the more long-term persistent data
maybe create tables or a database for transient data or data that isn t intended to persistent long-term until it reaches a certain state

12352541
persistent	transient
maybe create tables or a database for transient data or data that isn t intended to persistent long-term until it reaches a certain state
or perhaps store it in the same tables as the long-term data but otherwise track state to mark it as incomplete or in some other way transient

12354765
google-chrome	safari
well for me google-chrome is not an option and there is a solution i was having the same problem and found that if i did exactly the following procedure i managed to set the height of the docked inspector open any web page call the inspector command-option-i undock the inspector by clicking the dock undock icon change its undocked height and width to roughly a height that you would like when it is docked and roughly the same width as your browser window
make sure to change its position too move it a little in any direction to make sure all params are recorded close the undocked inspector call the inspector again command-option-i --hasn t changed dock the inspector quit safari

12357544
jar	manifest.mf
reference from background most developers reasonably assume that putting a dependency jar file into their own jar file and adding a class-path attribute to the meta-inf manifest will do the trick jarname.jar | meta-inf | | manifest.mf | | main-class com.mydomain.mypackage.main | | class-path commons-logging.jar | com mydomain mypackage | | main.class | commons-logging.jar unfortunately this is does not work
the java does not know how to load classes from a jar inside a jar with this kind of class-path

12359451
persistent	transient
when hibernate sees your getter-annotated persistent class and finds a method isvacant it assumes that there is a property vacant and assumes that there is a set -method as well
so to fix it you could either add the transient annotation or you could change the name of your method to something that doesn t start with is

12359947
union	distinct
using union is like adding and implicit distinct requirement which takes up processor cycles and makes the query plan more complicated
the reason it is not going in the order you expect when using union is that union attempts to impose uniquness so it is processing all of those rows together and bringing them out in the order most convenient for the engine

12361637
postgresql	mysql
well with postgresql partitioning tables is at least possible if you want them to still look like a single table or not to the front-end
i don t believe this is elegantly doable in mysql without a lot of view maintenance

12361956
tcplistener	tcpclient
if you re not sure if you need a socket and are using tcp - i d strongly suggest starting with tcplistener client as it s a much easier to use interface
a tcplistener wraps a socket and is the server-side analog to the tcpclient which also of course wraps a socket

12363961
listview	gridview
here filtering a listview with baseadapter filters text not images
although my specific question concerned a gridview the concept and the code can be substituted for a listview

12365321
boost	stl
if you re not already using boost in your project there is no reason to use boost thread in favor of std thread
that is unless you are using some feature from boost not available in the stl

12366687
postgresql	mysql
it s not the most intuitiv and beautiful tool but has many useful features too mysql workbench this is not for postgresql but my answer is quite generic so i wanted to add this as well
mysql workbench is the officiel tool from oracle for connecting to mysql

12366810
mdpi	hdpi
the sizes should be 0.75 x original_size for ldpi original_size for mdpi 1.5 x original_size for hdpi 2 x original_size for xhdpi update tablet are hdpi not xhdpi
your drawable folder contains folders ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi - it s for different density per inch

12366853
equals	gethashcode
so that you can understand the contract for gethashcode implementations the following is an excerpt from msdn documentation for object.gethashcode a hash function must have the following properties if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

12366853
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

12368590
prepare	execute
see what s new in postgresql 9.2 particularly prepare statements used to be optimized once without any knowledge of the parameters values
with 9.2 the planner will use specific plans regarding to the parameters sent the query will be planned at execution except if the query is execute several times and the planner decides that the generic plan is not too much more expensive than the specific plans

12369006
aggregate-functions	sum
you probably want to do an order by instead no group by in the query group by functions are commonly used when you want to use an aggregate-functions on a particular column such as get an average row value or a sum and the like
if you are not using any aggregate-functions then using group by will not do anything

12369778
kerberos	ntlm
ie is using kerberos and not falling back on ntlm like google-chrome and firefox
you must force ntlm authentication in iis7.5 by following these steps select your site

12371440
client-side	server-side
the gwt modules are only about client-side code to be processed by the devmode and ultimately the gwt compiler
if you only want to reference classes for use on the server-side not by gwt actually then you don t need all that stuff

12373131
subtraction	addition
notice how the subtraction operator - is not overloaded and will always cast the operands to numbers
the addition operator + will cast things as strings if either operand is a string

12374381
strdup	malloc
replacing strdup and free with more new and delete should be easy i m leaving it to you as an exercise
you need to change your constructor so it s making a copy of the c string for example if you use strdup above you should change your destructor appropriately so instead of using delete you use free it would be a good idea to change your other constructor so it s not acquiring the c string but making a copy of it as well this way behaviour of all constructors would be more consistent and safer in general if you make it this way it will work correctly whether the client code is passing you pointer allocated with malloc or new

12374690
3des	aes
the 3des key is created by xoring the session key with 24 zero bytes
here is an example in java output 2923be84b149546100000000000000000000000000000000 f2f13994d24714ca880fe38ab9e8a8d3 you ve not supplied enough information to understand what is required to compute the aes cmac example nor what your problem actually is

12376436
profiling	debugging
also the initializer syntax is converted to something like the debugger is notoriously bad at stepping through code like that so it could be that the compiler just is generating enough information about it for the profiling or the debugger
much of what the profiling can tell you about what is and what isn t executed is based on what the compiler tells it in the debugging information

12377629
implements	extends
you can implements multiple interfaces but this is not what you re looking for
you should have a class that extends applet then one that extends keyadapter

12380215
avr	microcontroller
not doing a custom pcb at first use a development board to prototype your project important note i don t know the criteria you chose the target processor on but consider using an avr 8-bit microcontroller if the project don t need the arm m3 32-bit processing power
avr is much easier and cheaper to start with especially for beginners

12385528
google-chrome	firefox
what i found was that onscroll did not fire as often on firefox as on google-chrome ie
when i initially tried this it would be on firefox 5 or 6 though

12386665
google-chrome	safari
it does work in google-chrome and the solution is really silly
both the parent and the element onto which you want to control page-breaking must be declared as position relative check out this fiddle this is true for page-break-before page-break-after page-break-inside however controlling page-break-inside in safari does not work in 5.1.7 at least i hope this helps

12391069
vbscript	vba
vba will complain if the declare statement is inserted after a sub declaration for example this will work declare function getcurrentprocessid lib kernel32 as long sub update ... ... end sub but this will not work sub update ... ... end sub declare function getcurrentprocessid lib kernel32 as long here is how we display the pid in a messagebox in vbscript hope this helps someone
as a vba n00b some other things i did not know the declare statement goes at the top

12394226
apache	nginx
pay attention to comment out the apache_setenv line if you use nginx web server instead of apache
update for nginx so op is using nginx that makes things a bit trickier as nginx doesn t let to disable gzip compresion from php

12396560
jar	war
this process can still slow down especially when redeploying large applications with multiple jar files and war files and all the classpath has to be refreshed
some changes are not possible to reload especially when changing jar files classes without having to reload or restart the server whatever server you are using

12397695
haskell	agda
moreover infinite processes are programmable in agda just as io processes are programmable in haskell the only restriction is that infinite processes cannot be unfolded indefinitely when being executed in the course of typechecking
you can implement a turing machine simulator in agda you just can t tell the lie that it s guaranteed to terminate or persuade the typechecker to run it in an unbounded way

12398785
vim	emacs
regarding auto-completion you can try something like the snipmate plugin for vim
also as stated by ivan if you end up using emacs ensime seems to be widely liked - unfortunately there doesn t seem to be an ensime port for vim yet at least to my knowledge

12402567
lisp	prolog
this is a very famous old and not so hard computer algebra problem solutions have been initially written for example in lisp
a prolog version is straight forward

12404460
voip	sip
not all android-powered devices support voip calls using sip
you should always call isvoipsupported to verify that the device supports voip calling and isapisupported to verify that the device supports the sip apis

12407236
bash	subshell
this is because you are using a pipe into a while loop which runs in a subshell in bash
you are returning from the subshell not the function

jsf	seam
jsf2 has however a new resource handling mechanism which allows automatic resource inclusion using resourcedependency and so on in components renderers but this is already taken into account by the facesservlet itself and the new jsf 2.0 and components
i m however not sure if that s related to whatever seam 2 did i ve never really used seam

12408574
sublimetext	aptana
i personally used aptana 3 eclipse + pydev before moving to sublimetext 2 one year ago
setting up eclipse for plone tutorial old some sample integration scripts for eclipse for plone no longer work with the latest aptana as it doesn t ship with monkeyeclipse how to tune sublimetext 2 for plone and python here are the pros and cons why i moved from aptana to sublimetext 2 aptana + pydev integrated git and svn explorer you can click tracebaxk in a console window and it will take you to the line in that exception autocompletion linter warns on the background about bad code hard to integrate with other python tools buildout eggs

12411906
move	drag
i found the following description from a cached page in a google search in windows explorer right-click and drag the file from its old location to its new location then select svn move versioned item from the context menu
this will not only move the actual file itself but it will also make sure that all the file history stays with it after you check in your changes

12411949
directx	gdi
newer directx apis basically do it for you when you call the appropriate present method though i believe there are options to not wait for the vsync
neither gdi nor gdi+ give you access to the vsync signal

12412950
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you should also keep in mind that sortedlist performs worse than sorteddictionary during construction if the items are not inserted in already-sorted order although in this particular case it is highly likely that dates are inserted in chronological sorted order which would be perfect
since sorteddictionary is sorted on the key you can create a sorted list of keys with and then efficiently perform binary search on it as the documentation says if index is positive or zero then the key exists

12413468
tabcontrol	tabitem
the tabcontrol template i usually use looks something like this
the default behavior of wpf is to unload items which are not visible which includes unloading tabitem which are not visible

12414229
inline	inlining
of course if you define the function only in a source file non-inline the compiler will be able to inline it in that one source file but not in any other translation unit
generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining

12414229
inline	inlining
generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining
many compilers are getting really good at deciding when to inline functions or not as long as the function body is visible at th4e point of call

12414241
inline	inlining
enable warning c4710 this will warn you if a function which you define as inline is not inline by the compiler
enable warning c4711 this will warn you if the compiler inlines a function not designated for inlining

12417545
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
if this code has the only reference to that list under the name a and you re using cpython the reference counter will immediately free that memory
other implementations pypy jython ironpython might not kill it right away because they have different garbage collectors

12417876
calloc	malloc
however because you called malloc and not calloc you have no guarantees about the contents of
the c standard doesn t define what is stored in memory allocated with malloc so is filled with garbage

12417898
getchar	fgetc
or then the compiler does give you a useful warning. also while converting the code into a compilable unit i notice that you do not take care of eof and you assign the result of getchar to a char
you shouldn t because it returns an int see fgetc checking eof amongst many other questions for another discussion of this issue

12419883
nexus	artifactory
i do not know if there is an online nexus or archivia hosting service
now for the disclosures jfrog creators of artifactory is a partner of my employers and we use the artifactory hosting service sonatype creators of nexus is a partner of my employers i am a member of the apache software foundation creators of archivia i do not recommend which mrm you use

12420919
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
hey man do not do this you cannot push uiviewcontroller again because there is no uiview related to it
it will make a crash in uinavigationcontroller because there is nothing actually to push

12421303
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
actually this parameters are using for building correct interface and even if you will set this bars in xcode interface builder they will not appear if you are not using you uiviewcontroller inside some uiviewcontroller containers
as example if you will add your uiviewcontroller into uinavigationcontroller then you will see navigation bar as top bar. this simulated metrics have no effect in the program but they will help you to build correct interface if you expect to use uiviewcontroller inside container

12421527
awt	swing
as hinted at in the fest answer by mdma above a custom repaintmanger can be used simply override the methods addinvalidcomponent jcomponent component and adddirtyregion jcomponent component int x int y int w int h and use swingutilities.iseventdispatchthread to check if we re on awt you can integrate this into junit fairly easily by adding a org.junit.assert.fail awt thread violation in your checking routine
the logic here is that most but not all swing operations cause a repaint which eventually calls into these methods in repaintmanager so we can catch these and do our checking

12422218
calloc	malloc
malloc takes a single argument memory required in bytes while calloc needs two arguments
secondly malloc does not initialize the memory allocated while calloc initializes the allocated memory to zero

12422218
calloc	malloc
secondly malloc does not initialize the memory allocated while calloc initializes the allocated memory to zero
calloc allocates a memory area the length will be the product of its parameters

12424231
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
what you need to do is this make sure your uisplitviewcontroller has a navigationcontroller as part of its detailviewcontroller namely the viewcontroller that is on the right of the screen should be an uinavigationcontroller not a regular uiviewcontroller
the rest is then easy as it works the same way as any regular uinavigationcontroller

12427299
udp	tcp
either udp but then you lose reliability or stcp where i am not sure that java is capable of this
it is the nature of tcp connections that they transport a stream

12429241
backtracking	greedy
by contrast a is a backtracking it explores choices possibly in some depth but then is capable of abandoning these choices later and trying other possibilities
so if your problem has dead ends local maxima where no further progress towards a solution is possible then greedy algorithms are most likely not suitable

12429831
memcpy	memmove
memcpy is not obliged to work correctly if they overlap
it is relatively unlikely that they ve got anything faster than memmove memcpy available

12430552
translation	localization
machine translation gets things wrong far too often and can easily phrase something in a way that is offensive or embarrassing
it also doesn t take into account localization at all

12431055
innodb	myisam
basically you d have to do this or this check this converting tables from other storage engines to innodb for considerations on the matter specially innodb does not have a special optimization for separate index creation the way the myisam storage engine does
therefore it does not pay to export and import the table and create indexes afterward. the fastest way to alter a table to innodb is to do the inserts directly to an innodb table

12432095
cpython	pypy
this means for instance you have to manually close your files they will not be automatically closed when your file variable goes out of scope as in cpython
pypy is a compliant alternative implementation of the python language

12433607
ienumerable	icollection
these methods are written to work on ienumerable and thus cannot assume anything about the underlying collection
from looking at the implementation some linq methods will check if the input is an icollection and if so call the corresponding method on that i believe count works this way to possibly avoid doing a linear scan but in this case there is no way for linq to detect that your array is sorted so it will cannot take advantage of that fact

12433992
daemons	systemd
i m sure you could find ruby interfaces to systemd v ipc semaphores to coordinate them but if you want a job queue look at something besides daemons
also to add to sigurd s answer above here s the code in question that implements the force option which is conveniently undocumented source so basically zap as i found in the source does absolutely nothing when you specify force daemons will delete all non-running applications from applications if multiple isn t set

12435307
clang	llvm
clang 3.1 does not come with xcode 4.5 dp1
apple clang version 4.0 tags apple clang-421.10.42 based on llvm 3.1svn was a cut from clang trunk between 3.0 and 3.1 before i replaced the broken partial implementation with a working one

12435965
.htaccess	httpd.conf
an error in .htaccess will take down the directory not the server
this makes it much less of a liability than changing the httpd.conf file

12443046
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
note this is not complete and while it works seemingly in most browsers opera i know has a problem with something and i haven t really thrown that much variable text at it
it seems to work best in google-chrome and firefox

12443219
g++	gcc
it does not reproduce on linux using g++ ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5.1 4.4.3 and gdb 7.4 unfortunately figuring out which tool is to blame here will be somewhat hard you ll need to examine the debuginfo generated
instead you may try to reproduce the problem with different versions of gcc and gdb

12443397
daemons	systemd
daemons are allowed to have filehandles but you should close stdin stdout and stderrr because you shouldn t really use them anymore
a lot of this has to do with the way fork works in nix systemd

12444226
ffmpeg	libav
the most visible differences between ffmpeg and the fork for general users are the different binary names ffmpeg ffplay ffprobe vs avconv avprobe avplay etc
ffmpeg merges most commits from libav but it s not as reciprocal so libav does not have as many features

12446763
prepare	execute
just define the ruby implementation version mode you re using in your gemfile along with your other dependencies and heroku will ensure the environment is prepare
now with all this in place heroku should create binstubs through bundler in app_root bin so what you can do is for example this just don t use bundle execute since jruby doesn t play nice with that

12447159
jlist	jlabel
if you want to know more about how a jlist actually displays elements read
jlabel cannot be displayed by jlist

12448174
sudo	passwd
type sudo make install without quotes
now you need to type your administrator passwd the terminal will not display anything you are typing so don t worry if it seems it is not working properly and press enter

12451815
udp	tcp
if you implement reliability on top of udp by necessity you will need to implement something functionally equivalent to tcp and then several factors will penalize you your implementation of reliability has to run within your application not in the operating system kernel
your implementation of tcp has to do all the same stuff as tcp otherwise you will face mysterious bugs in unanticipated network environments

12452402
profiling	instrumentation
the time profiling instrumentation isn t the best tool for profiling opengl code
if you re writing a mac app the opengl profiling tool profiles opengl code better than instrumentation

12452415
imperative	declarative
a declarative language requires you to code for what you want to happen rather than in an imperative language where you code how the computation should be done
in general this means that a declarative language does not allow for side-effects whereas imperative languages almost require coding with side-effects

12453032
postgresql	mysql
postgresql for instance will generate a hash of your password and send it
that depends on how the jdbc driver is implemented the mysql jdbc driver will not transmit your password in clear text

12453669
spaces	delimiter
the urls your looking for need to be delimiter by something such as spaces or new lines
just add your delimiter to the regexes so the the last regex is not too greedy

12455437
firefox	safari
so one such tool probably one of the best is firebug which comes as an add-on for firefox
chrome ie9 safari has some built-in developer tools they appear when you press f12 on your pc on mac i am not sure - so here are some steps install firefox install firebug load your page enable firebug for your page

12456321
octal	hex
if contains 000000002257 you could write you ll need to on postgresql 9.0 and below iirc to get the bytea back out in hex form not the icky old octal escape format
newer versions default to hex

12457287
queue	fifo
to dispatch one of these blocks in the queue dispatch_async myfifoqueue myuploadblock
dispatch_async guarantees you that your blocks will be added in the serial queue but your current thread usually the main thread will not wait for the block to complete. using a serial queue guarantees you that all blocks will be executed in fifo order

12457819
comparator	comparable
if you then wanted to sort those objects by first name and then last name such that john smith comes before stephen jones you would use a comparator which you use depends on what control you have over the classes and the instances
for example if you have a class that does not implement comparable but you can subclass it to implement the interface and you are sure that you will be the only person creating instances then you can use comparable

12458415
prng	random
check this to understand pseudo random generation and seeds pseudorandom number generator a pseudorandom number generator prng also known as a deterministic random bit generator drbg is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers that approximates the properties of random numbers
the sequence is not truly random in that it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values called the prng s state which includes a truly random seed

12459283
implements	extends
i m not aware of any way you could configure this interceptor to implements the behaviour you need but you always have the option of extends the interceptor
so you could create your own interceptor by extends the parametersinterceptor class

12459951
direct3d	directx
d3dx is not considered the canonical api for using direct3d in windows 8 and therefore isn t included with the corresponding windows sdk. investigate alternate solutions for working with the direct3d api
for legacy projects such as the windows 7 and earlier directx sdk samples the following steps are necessary to build applications with d3dx using the directx sdk modify the project s vc++ directories as follows to use the right order for sdk headers and libraries

12460624
prng	random
of course this may not be a general solution at least if you are looking for something dynamic since you would have to pre-create the prng and how you do this depends on n
in theory if you built a random number generator whose period was exactly n and covered all values in 0..n then running through this once would give you what you like

12462053
clang	llvm
in fact in the clang compiler it plays a major role but that s entirely internal - what comes out of clang is pure native arm ios machine code
llvm is not a virtual machine in that sense of the word

12463719
pthreads	fork
here is a link to some documentation showing how to use pthreads timers which provide support for callback functions
regarding multiple timers in a process the documentation says this a program may create multiple interval timers using timer_create . timers are not inherited by the child of a fork 2 and are disarmed and deleted during an execve 2 . the kernel preallocates a queued real-time signal for each timer created using timer_create

12465062
dictionary	map
for example a hash map dictionary in .net might fail on collisions two objects with the same hash that are not equal or it doesn t if it handles collisions that depends on the exact implementation
fail in that case means if you add a new object to the map and there is already an object in the map that has the same hash value as the new object then the new object will override the old one instead of just being added

12466778
super	extends
your class hourlyemployee which extends from employee is not abstract so it should override all abstract methods of the super class as a concrete class can not have any abstract methods
the reason is that your methods in the hourlyemployee class have a different signature than those in the super class

12467949
google-chrome	firefox
i was also getting the problem of not being able to enter text into a combobox in firefox but i could in ie and google-chrome
after a day of looking into the problem i found that setting the maxlength property to something greater than 0 allowed firefox to accept entry in the text field for the combobox

12468641
oncreate	onstart
if however the application process is killed then when you return oncreate will be called again because all of your resources will have been released
as long as your device does not kill the activity for example due to low system resources then any time you leave your app and go back onstart is called

12469898
backtracking	greedy
makes the + lazy instead of greedy hence giving you the shortest pattern capturing group 1+ backreference with quantifier to denote that pattern should repeat atleast once anchor for end of string line test it here rubular the above solution does a lot of backtracking affecting performance
if you know the which characters are not allowed in these strings then you can use a negated characted set which eliminates backtracking

12475682
draggable	droppable
the droppable should also have the accept option suitably set to accept the draggable
set the revert option of the draggable to invalid so that they return to their original position if not dropped on a compatible droppable

12476771
jruby	mri
the only downside with jruby is that some mri gems cannot be used as they use native code though this is not something i have been blocked by recently
as people mentioned jruby will probably be faster but more importantly it will allow you to have a tighter integration with java you can call java code from jruby and vice-versa

12478363
google-chrome	firefox
the only alternative would be importing netutil and fileutils via google-chrome authority something like this
firefox doesn t support writing files via file api yet and even when this will be added it will probably be accessible to web pages only and not extensions

12478817
prepare	execute
pdo_mysql uses emulated prepare statements by default performance reasons so prepare will not throw an exception
pdostatement execute will though

12479021
apache	nginx
edit in the unlikely case that you are using apache with fcgi i want to put the parameter for apache too
504 gateway timeout you are probably using nginx is web-server-related not php-related

12479151
google-chrome	firefox
see here are 2 tutorials for deploying touch4j apps to ios and android google-chrome does have a gwt plugin for windows and mac for that matter so you should be able to use that to develop in either titanium4j or touch4j
the key to the latter being that it is webkit-based and hence it doesn t work on firefox

12480008
bmp	png
afaik bmp format doesn t support transparency
check changing your format to say png on bmp.save ms imageformat.png

12484624
move	drag
if touched then it turns red until it is move
the reluctance reduces sensitivity to movement so that a touch event is not changed into a drag by small movements

12487338
client-side	server-side
as jordan mentioned there is no way to use an api key to access bigquery from the client-side - since the javascript application will not be able to keep the client secret hidden a user must authorize access to the api at some point
i am interested in your server-side use case

12488384
apache	nginx
again this is for nginx not for apache but maybe something similar is out there for apache
edit here is a simple django code snippet assuming you are using same settings as above for nginx

12488534
division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
then the result of the multiplication is converted to the type of b since that is an unsigned type and - in c terminology - its integer conversion rank is not smaller than that of int for the division
conversion to an unsigned integer type means reduction modulo 2 width

12488723
multiplying	multiplication
when using column vector column major vectors and matrices you want to multiplying a matrix and vector by placing the vector on the right hand side of the matrix
so your multiplication should ultimately look like this having said that i m not sure why you had the position on the left in the first place so i wonder if you re doing some matrix transpose somewhere in your pipeline

12489862
thin	unicorn
if you want minimal memory you should try thin
it does not have master worker as unicorn or passenger thus uses less memory. suppose you have a very small app that needs to run on a small vm then you can use 1 thin worker + nginx

12491012
arraylist	treeset
example using integer output before subset 1 2 3 4 5 after subset 3 4 5 alternatively if you do not know the elements and want to return the elements between two points you can use an arraylist constructed with the set and use the sublist method
you could use a treeset and use it s subset method returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements range from fromelement to toelement

12493409
postgresql	mysql
i would like to have them swapped the constraint on least greatest and the index on the bare columns but postgresql does not seem to allow this yet
result i don t know if mysql allows and enforces constraints or indexes on expressions

12494339
dbcontext	objectcontext
the generated context is also based newer dbcontext api instead of objectcontext api used by visual studio 2010 that is the reason why it doesn t have the method - the equivalent method in dbcontext api is
both t4 and dbcontext api are currently recommended approach for using ef

12494467
spaces	delimiter
a list type in an xsd doesn t define a sequence of elements but a single element that can have a list of values delimiter by a spaces
the resulting xml from this schema defination would look like this the xml is effectively an unbounded list of strings of any length separated by a spaces

12496235
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
it breaks in opera and safari if using a width that is not a multiple of 100px
personally i think it s overkill but it can be done like this demo html css it works in firefox google-chrome opera and safari i was afraid to test it in ie9 though both transform and background-clip work but only if the width for .outer has a value that s a multiple of 100px

12496269
implements	extends
if you really need a non-generic ilist return then implements the interface and handle non- mydatarow values appropriately
does not extends ilist because it s not reasonable to expect every implementation of the generic version to offer the same contract as the non-generic one

12496867
cdr	cons
first of all car and cdr are not defined within the scope of cons
in your snippet of code all three cons car and cdr are defined at the top-level

12497670
super	implements
from the second part of your question i guess that you don t want a zoomable view but a viewgroup which is the super class of all views that can contain other view layouts
here is some code you could start from building your own viewgroup most of it comes from this blog post what this class should be able to do is dragging the content around and allowing pinch to zoom double tap to zoom isn t possible right now but it should be easy to implements in the ontouchevent method

12498921
thin	unicorn
that could be thin unicorn a delayed_job worker etc
since rails is not thread safe by default thin can only handle 1 request at a time which means your dyno can only handle 1 request at a time

12500165
implements	extends
as for linq to sql outside of wrapping your request in a task.factory.start operation i wouldn t hold my breath hoping that task based async required for async await will be implements by microsoft for linq to sql
you could use the iqtoolkit and extends it adding your own async support if absolutely necessary

12501131
cloudant	couchdb
i like this cloudant web page i was surprised to see the embedded erlang capability .
i did not know couchdb was written in erlang as this seems unusual to me in the apache community my ignorance

12502166
viewmodel	caliburn
i found that this works nicely i ve made the assumption here that the viewmodel you re binding are true viewmodel not usercontrols and that you have separate views usercontrols that caliburn.micro is binding for you
the caliburn binding for a tabcontrol is easiest if you have a conductor that you bind by convention set the datacontext to the conductor instance and name the tabcontrol items . the issue here is that a tabcontrol instantiates a single content presenter that is shared by all tabs but you need to somehow tell caliburn.micro to find the view for the viewmodel when it changes the content

12504071
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
rather than setting them true in the adapter s getview does what i think the original question wanted and means that an onitemclicklistener gets called provided that an onclicklistener is not set in getview
i m assuming that anything you can do in an view s onclicklistener you can do just as easily in a listview s onitemclicklistener . setonclicklistener on a view implicitly sets the view to be clickable which prevents the listview s corresponding onitemclicklistener getting called apparently. the behaviour is as one would expect in terms of the imagebutton s visual state when the item is pressed or rolled over

12505740
implements	extends
check this article on implements callbacks if you want to follow my advice now for the relationship between the manager and the view i do agree that you should use an observer pattern this will allow you to create different views that react differently to the same events
this means that it s datamanager that should extends observable and every view listening it should implement observer finally i have to say that if you plan on having different types of events the jdk observable and observer java.util mechanism is not very clean

12505939
recvfrom	datagram
in the case of udp this results in an ip datagram containing an ip header normally 20 bytes for ipv4 and 40 bytes for ipv6 an 8-byte udp header and no data. this also means that a return value of 0 from recvfrom is acceptable for a datagram protocol it does not mean that the peer has closed the connection as does a return value of 0 from read on a tcp socket. since udp is connectionless there is no such thing as closing a udp connection
and if it can what is it s meaning it means a 0-length datagram was received

12509624
union	distinct
your code looks fine although it could be shortened no need to use copyto union already removes duplicates like distinct
the reason why the objects are not detected as duplicates is probably because they are distinct

12512772
icollection	iqueryable
the result of t1.table2 is an icollection and it is loading all rows to get the count. by the way even if you use only t1.table2 without asking for the count rows are loaded into memory
the first method is not loading all rows since the count method is invoked from an iqueryable but the second method is loading all rows since it is invoked from an icollection

12512772
icollection	iqueryable
the result of is a class that implements icollection but it is not loading all rows and has a property named isloaded
the result of the query method is an iqueryable and this allows calling count without preloading rows

12512915
jtextfield	jtable
point to use filtering in jtable with one column and or without jtableheader placed in the undecorated dialog or jwindow undecorated by default in case that you want to display pop-up window with long list of sentences in the scrollabel contents that could be clickable use swing timer 5 -10 seconds for autohide for pop-up window share use the same model for jtable and autocompleted jcombobox jtextfield based on vector or arraylist to check focus lifecycle nothing better aroung for pop-up window as java calendar by kai toedter download codesource
still not sure you can to use autocompleted jcombobox jtextfield afaik ther no issues with document focus caret and selection hightlighter and to combine with a.m

12518237
google-chrome	firefox
there are other solutions which include running ietab extension similar to google-chrome frame here s a so link which describes the necessary configuration i ve tested this and it appears to be working
windows integrated authentication is not enabled by default for firefox

12518297
implements	extends
i.e. a pojo should not have to extends prespecified classes implements prespecified interface contain prespecified annotations
normal class a java class java beans all properties private use getters setters a public no-argument constructor implements serializable

12521164
implements	extends
it is first important to note you have implements a comparator not a filter
if you really want a filter what you need to do is extends org.apache.hadoop.hbase.filter.filterbase if you look into the hbase logs you might see something like the following this is because the comparator class is not available in the classpath of the hbase server

12521746
memcpy	memmove
update here is a compact version of the jonathan leffler shuffle method which does not maintain the original order update thanks to jonathan leffler the memmove should really have been memcpy since it is impossible for the buffers to overlap
gcc 4.6.1 needs -minline-all-stringops to inline memcpy

12524960
ssl	https
javax.net.ssl.sslhandshakeexception sun.security.validator.validatorexception pkix path building failed sun.security.provider.certpath.suncertpathbuilderexception unable to find valid certification path to requested target when i got the error i tried to google out the meaning of the expression and i found this issue occurs when a server changes their https ssl certificate and our older version of java doesn t recognize the root certificate authority ca
if you can access the https url in your browser then it is possible to update java to recognize the root ca

12528707
vim	emacs
emacs and all its variants and vim and all its variants remain excellent powerful but quite baffling to anyone not used to them
still you should know at least the vim basics for when you inevitably find yourself needing to edit files on a unix machine

12529478
nsmutablestring	nsstring
but an nsmutablestring is not an nsstring wrong
nsmutablestring is an nsstring because it can do whatever nsstring can

12530455
client-side	server-side
your code does not work because you re trying to mix a server-side language php with a client-side language js
i suggest doing some research on the differences between serer-side and client-side languages to help you understand your issue

12533448
django	web2py
i was in a similar dilemma but at the end decided to use django django-cms or feincms
although web2py community is nice there is simply not a single actively developed cms with some significant number of developers community etc

12533649
onchange	onblur	onchange	onfocus
if the value of an element is changed via script then your onchange will not be triggered
in such cases you need to save the value onfocus and check the value onblur and trigger onchange manually

12533721
client-side	server-side
of course you can t fully rely on the client-side javascript validation but that s not a reason to avoid it completely
with or without it you have to do the server-side validation anyway since the client can disable javascript

12534797
ffmpeg	libav
im actually working on providing stagefright to my ffmpeg library on android
i made some changes to original libstagefright.cpp from ffmpeg libav but it is still not stable

ffmpeg	libav
i made some changes to original libstagefright.cpp from ffmpeg libav but it is still not stable
after stabilizing it i will create pull request for ffmpeg libav team

12537994
udp	tcp
the ssdp is based on a udp broadcast
it is afaik not possible to multicast via tcp because tcp needs a session

12538118
equals	gethashcode
it is perfectly legal for two objects that are not equals to have the same hashcode but it is not valid for two objects that are equals to have different hashcodes
the dictionary style collection classes use the hashcode value the gethashcode value returned from the object specified as the key to put the key value pair into a hashbin

12538602
backgrounding	multitasking
see this document in particular paying attention to the stuff from implementing long-running backgrounding tasks onward
this isn t possible on the iphone it s incompatible with apple s multitasking model

12541243
ssl	https
should redirect to https is not working it s likely that you ve already visited ssl for a custom domain - google app engine google developers but it s possible that you may have overlooked a few points that would cause ssl urls not to function as intended under the activating heading you must have an app engine application with billing enabled that has cleared at least one billing charge
use this application when enabling ssl also under the uploading and configuring certificate heading and to configure a certificate after you have uploaded it subheading work with your dns provider to update cname records

12547685
strtod	malloc
read entire lines with getline if you don t have it it s not hard to implement extract individual number-strings from the line with a hand-coded parser and convert them to machine integers with strtol strtoul or strtod as appropriate
you will need to use the malloc and realloc functions from for this

12549237
portrait	landscape
however i still don t know why the original code just doesn t work on ios 6.0 on iphone and ipad portrait mode
since this problem also occurs on iphone with ios 6.0 so it might not be related to uisplitview portrait mode. although uisplitview landscape mode is fine

12550661
google-chrome	firefox
some times some code will run in google-chrome but not in firefox because the web-kit engine is different
make sure the java script is enabled in firefox

12551077
persistent	transient
if the variable is declared as transient then it will not be persistent
that is the main purpose of the transient keyword

12551862
bmp	png
changing your images to the bmp file format could make a little improvement in performance because jpg is a compressed bitmap image that needs to be decompressed when rendered but it s usually not worth the major increase in filesize
i would recommend using the png bitmap format because it s light in both rendering and filesize

12552329
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the exception is telling you that uinavigationcontroller doesn t have an appearance method
if you want to change the appearance of all navigation bars in your app you can call the uinavigationbar proxy with uinavigationbar.appearance.setbackgroundimage .

12552875
spaces	delimiter
it is not possible to escape a spaces such that it is not interpreted as a parameter delimiter
the only way to include a spaces in a parameter is to enclose it in quotes

12553201
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome can install extensions without restart
edit as of 2012 firefox can install some but not all extensions without restart

12553229
octal	decimal	octal	binary
for example the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010 which can be grouped into 00 1 001 010 so the octal representation is 112
011 is treated as an octal number not decimal

12553229
octal	decimal
011 is treated as an octal number not decimal
the conversion of 011 octal to decimal is 9

12554106
prng	random
when not using the os s pseudo-random value generator which on linux and bsd gathers real randomness from the times at which ethernet packets or keypresses arrive it re-seeds the random module s mersenne twister predictable prng at each call with a combination of the current random state the current time and presumably constant secret key
so for two identical passwords to be generated both the state of the random generator which is about 8 kib in python and the time at which they are generated measured in seconds since the epoch as per time.time have to be identical

12555064
allocator	stl
this means if you create an instance of std allocator or your own this instance should not contain any info about allocated blocks etc - this info must be static and shared across all std allocator instances
breaking this rule may lead to undefined behavior in stl libraries

12555072
serializable	deserialization
an alternative would be to be use applet deserialization serializable through url data using the object attribute of applet element
as mentioned in the html4 specification there is no active support for applet and object attribute and jre doesn t seem to support object deserialization from url data too

12557530
cpython	ironpython
the range is -5 to 255 if i remember correctly though this is a cpython implementation detail that should not be relied upon
i am pretty sure jython and ironpython for example handle this differently

12558784
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
appears to work on google-chrome safari firefox ie opera tested on win 7 with newest versions
the code in the question should work too but it does not work for some reason on webkit browsers google-chrome safari

12558951
express	node.js
ps stylus and express - stylesheets are not re-compiled when modified may be of interest to you
when you run the express binary it bootstraps a node.js express application for you

12566486
division	modulo
well will iterate from 1 to 5 which means you can make another variable that is equivalent to but of course it would result in the count of 3 4 5 6 7 which is where the modulo comes in the modulo gives you the remainder after division by the second number 3 5 3 7 5 2 if you iterate from 1 to 5 and add 2 3-7 and take the result mod 5 you d get equation this is close to what you want but not quite
so instead of adding 2 initially add 1 initially and again after the result of the modulo which will give you a series of 3 4 5 1 2

12568485
layoutparams	viewgroup
if you had a layout file with the root a merge tag and attachedtoroot was set to false then the inflate method will have nothing to return as merge doesn t have an equivalent. also as the documentation says the inflate version with attachtoroot set to false is important because you can create the view hierarchy with the correct layoutparams from the parent
this is important in some cases most notable with the children of adapterview a subclass of viewgroup for which the addview methods set is not supported

12568650
margin	text-align
and set the padding margin as you wish
for your first issue i am not sure if same was your question change the property of h2 from text-align center

12569605
persistent	transient
running on ebs-backed volume which you would need to do to be able to persistent the physical data files will subject you to slow disk i o
if you are not running on ebs-backed ec2 then your data is transient and can not be considered as being on reliable physical storage

12570993
equals	gethashcode
otherwise it returns an that uses the overrides of equals and object.gethashcode provided by t
t is struct keyvaluepair does not implement so it uses equal and gethashcode method of struct keyvaluepair

12571621
rvm	bundler
you could uninstall the newer version s of bundler though this is a crappy way to deal with the issue or since you re using rvm just create a gemset for rails 3.0.1
note this requires that bundler not be in your global gemset for the ruby version you re trying to use

12572577
uiview	subviews
uiimage is not a subviews of uiview so you cant add a subviews to it
also nsstring is not a subviews of uiview

12572577
uiview	subviews
also nsstring is not a subviews of uiview
if you want to show things on the screen they should inherit from uiview

12575058
portrait	landscape
an engineer from apple has explained this bug and a workaround here this is happening because the application wants landscape orientation only but some cocoa touch view controllers require strictly portrait orientation which is the error - not that they should be requiring more then portrait but their interpretation of the applications requirements
an example of this can be the following ipad app supporting landscape only displays a uiimagepickercontroller via a uipopovercontroller

12575308
vbscript	vba
vbscript doesn t support lookbehind negative or positive
it is particular to vbscript and hence vba

12577225
jar	war
in your war file just mention the dependency of your jar file
i dont think you can create a jar file from some packages because pom file belongs to one java web project and not for individual packages in java project

12577225
jar	war
i dont think you can create a jar file from some packages because pom file belongs to one java web project and not for individual packages in java project
you can create a new java project named e.g xyz-common which should have the code which will be shared with other war files

12580110
moq	moles	moq	typemock
moq and other dynamicproxy -based mocking frameworks are unable to mock anything that is not a virtual or abstract method
sealed static classes methods can only be faked with profiler api based tools like typemock commercial or microsoft moles free known as fakes in visual studio 2012 ultimate 2013 2015

12582270
floating-point	fractions
the problem is that most decimal values cannot be represented exactly as floating-point values
so having a decimal value that only has a couple of digits doesn t guarantee that multiplying by ten enough times will produce a floating-point value with no fractions part

12586452
viewdidload	viewwillappear
frame of view controller s view is not final in viewdidload method and probably does not takes navigationbar size into account - so when navigation bar is displayed most likely your toolbar goes out of the lower boundaries of the screen
to fix that you can set toolbar s frame in the viewwillappear method controller s view will have correct frame then

12588833
fileoutputstream	filechannel
i recommend using a bufferedoutputstream wrapping a fileoutputstream
i do not believe you will see any performance improvement by mucking with bytebuffer and filechannel and that you ll be left with a lot of hard-to-maintain code if you go that route

12592606
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
there are exceptions which extend from runtimeexception
these are known as unchecked-exception and they do not have to be declared in your method signatures

12592608
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
long#parselong throws a numberformatexception which is-a runtimeexception
thus it s an unchecked-exception and does not need to be caught

12593967
decoder	encoder
listing them all here create a new encoder decoder object when needed for each operation not efficient as it could lead to a large number of objects
or use a threadlocal to avoid creating new encoder decoder for each operation

12594977
crossover	mutation
in my case when apply inversion i choose two random points it could be the whole string but not the same points.the best results where with a rate of 0.2 0.3 for mutation and 0.8 for crossover but this will depend on your selection mechanism
i think the best choice is use inversion for mutation and for crossover use ox ordered

12595206
implements	extends
second thing - this list contains list hashmap and hashmap does not implements comparable
list contain t must extends comparable

12599696
udp	tcp
first off you ll want tcp streams not udp datagrams
datagrams are limited in size and udp is inherently unreliable

12602853
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
as for requestfactory rf well it s a different client-server protocol than gwt-rpc with its own set of features and limitations
if you don t have an issue with gwt-rpc you shouldn t switch though i d recommend you look at what rf is

12604144
uiview	subviews
see this thread for more detail interaction beyond bounds of uiview
for the record a subviews doesn t have to be inside the parent view s frame to receive touches if you override the proper methods of the parent view

12604535
ssl	https
you ll have to get an ssl certificate for your app domain
even if it is that s no solution to your problem because the iframe content will be pulled over https first if the user is browsing facebook over https and since you app does not support https this will fail already

12605355
google-chrome	firefox
mdn refers to and the current firefox version does support this but google-chrome does not
google-chrome wants you to leave out the t character

12608440
union	distinct
the peculiar things happen when you get into using calculated expressions complicated joins access does not implement some kinds of joins but you will see arguably the most important--inner join union
for instance the behavior of distinct is different in access than other database architecture

12611017
serializable	deserialization
because of this as you note in your question your custom jsonserializersettings are used for serializable on the server but not for deserialization on the client
in the next release of signalr we plan to add a dependencyresolver to the .net client that will allow you to provide your own newtonsoft.json.jsonserializer or newtonsoft.json.jsonserializersettings to be used during deserialization

12612670
profiling	debugging
note that for whatever reason the build target is not set to the same build configuration as the profiling target and this has tripped me up more than a time or two
solved it myself edit your scheme where it says whateverprojectnameis ipad 6.0 simulator then click on profiling on the left on the info tab change build configuration to debugging probably set to release that should do it

12613872
opencv	emgucv
everything is working fine on my computer winxp 32-bit but not on win7 64-bit computers. this was because on my computer i already have opencv 2.4.2 installed and when i execute my program the path to the opencv dll points to the opencv folder and not to the dlls in the emgucv folder
the original opencv dll don t have this dependency on nvidia s driver

12616084
vb.net	vb6
i m assuming you are referring to vb6 and vba as indicated by your title not vb.net as indicated by a keyword
in vb6 and vba the memory consumption of a string variable consists of a fixed part for the string s length and a terminator and a variable length part for the string contents itself

12616112
profiling	instrumentation
on some platforms __builtin_return_address does not work beyond the current function so the call site information may not be available to the profiling functions otherwise. the first argument is the address of the start of the current function which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table
this instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other functions

12620218
innodb	myisam
some keypoints will be innodb does acid-compliant transaction
innodb does referential integrity foreign key relations myisam does full text search innodb doesn t i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

12620218
innodb	myisam
innodb does referential integrity foreign key relations myisam does full text search innodb doesn t i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research
default configuration does not work very well for innodb needs to be tweaked accordingly run a tool like to help you

12620218
innodb	myisam
default configuration does not work very well for innodb needs to be tweaked accordingly run a tool like to help you
notes in my opinion the second point is probably the one were innodb has a huge advantage over myisam

12620218
innodb	myisam
notes in my opinion the second point is probably the one were innodb has a huge advantage over myisam
full text search not working with innodb is a bit of a pain you can mix different storage engines but be careful when doing so

12621128
keystore	jks
java has build-in support for work with pkcs#12 keystore work with this containers doesn t much differ than standart jks keystore
for example code to load jks keystore and code to load pkcs#12 keystore after that you have unlimited accsess to keystore content

12621727
moq	typemock
i believe typemock rewrites the assemblies at runtime to achieve this something moq definitively doesn t do
if you want to achieve similar results with moq you could mock both methods you would have to extract both methods to different dependencies so as to mock one dependency and not the other

12624858
oncreate	findviewbyid
add this to code above to make it work in the oncreate method mviewpager.setid 888889
the viewpager results in a call to findviewbyid for each page which tries to get the parent the viewpager id which always fails for views that do not have their id set

12625646
moq	moles	nmock	moles
the ms fakes framework supplies stubs and moles shims whereas nmock rhinomocks and moq all provide stubs and mocks
i really don t understand ms s decision to not include mocks and i am personally not a fan of moles for reasons described below

12625646
moq	moles	nmock	moles
to clarify the difference in what the frameworks provide nmock rhinomocks and moq all provide two types of test doubles stubs and mocks
the fakes framework provides stubs and moles they call them shims and unfortunately does not include mocks

12625646
nmock	moles
i find the nmock and especially the rhinomocks examples to be more expressive
moles shims to be frank i do not like moles because of their potential for misuse

12625667
postgresql	mysql
fyi postgresql has a way of doing this built into the language select distinct on method timestamp method id response from rpc_responses where 1 # some where clause here order by method timestamp desc
use this solution with caution it is not guaranteed to work in future versions of mysql it is not known to work in mariadb 5.5 this can query may perform well because there are no joins

12626118
justmock	moles
there is also a free light version of justmock not sure what it includes
although i m not a fan of moles in general i understand the help they can be in getting tests around legacy code

12627079
portrait	landscape
imaging an iphone5 that is in portrait on page load reporting width as 640px but not portrait unfortunately the iseries do not support those queries .
you then decide to turn the iphone sideways and the browser now activates the pseudo landscape mode again triggered from width 1126 rather than landscape

12630645
monkeyrunner	adb
considering monkeyrunner being very unstable you can directly trigger events using adb shell
e.g for triggering input for installing use for starting services and activities to start an activity adb is more reliable since you get the feedback immediately unlike monkeyrunner which does not provide reliable exceptions in case of any failure in triggering the event

12631076
super	implements
you are not accessing the private variable in your super class directly
you are implements the concept of encapsulation

12632227
cpython	pypy
well i suppose there s one more alternative hack up a different nicer python implementation than cpython
and pypy really isn t ready for prime time on embedded systems

12632289
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
i had the same problem but with uitapgesturerecognizer not working on qlpreviewcontroller
in ios 6 that thing is like a black hole for uigesturerecognizer objects...nothing makes it out of there

12641322
jasmine	qunit
christopher bennage has a blog post that describes the basic set up here and i have a few blog posts that head a little further down the path if you don t like the idea of running a separate project for your tests or if you want qunit instead of jasmine or mocha check out qunit-metro - it runs in-project with your real app and gives you a context menu in development mode to run the tests for the page you re on
i m not a fan of qunit or the way qunit-metro works in-page

12641784
google-chrome	firefox
so perhaps you did in fact forget to write gl_fragcolor but google-chrome s interpretation happens to work firefox is incorrectly compiling your shader your gpu is incorrectly executing firefox s compilation of your shader but not google-chrome s you are using a different broken shader on firefox due to your conditional on the presence of some extension .
i can t say what the actual cause of your problem is whether it s your bug or firefox s bug but just in case it s helpful i ll say that the patterns you are seeing remind me of the kind of shader output i got once on my macbook pro late 2011 when i forgot to write to gl_fragcolor in my fragment shader

12642174
client-side	server-side
it s not possible to use rails caching to cache the html that is generated by a client-side js app
there are people who are doing server-side template rendering however i haven t seen examples of anyone running ember server-side yet

12642808
comparator	comparable	implements	extends
by implements a comparator of list or a comparable as it works on the same purpose here what you are telling the jvm is that you want to compare different list s
you could also achieve your objective by implements a comparable in the class to sort but you can t as long as string is final so you cannot extends

12644573
queue	fifo
most database servers prefer unix domain sockets over other types of ipc. if you want to be able to store a persistent queue where applications can independently enqueue and dequeue messages then you will need to use ordinary files
unfortunately playing around with a fifo is not much to go on

12644939
factors	mean
casual descriptions of complexity like polynomial factors algorithm generally refer to the complexity with respect to the size of the input not the interpretation of the input
so when people say no known polynomial factors algorithm they mean there is no known algorithm for factors n -bit natural numbers that runs in time polynomial with respect to n

12644952
symfony	silex
i ve done it in other projects that do not have a good data model but in symfony you can create your models and define the validation associated with it
the way to validate an array is easy i ve learned it in silex documentation or you can create directly forms with constraints this code can solve your second point but for the first point i suggest you to write a custom class that transforms your yaml definition to a valid constraints array with instantiated validation constraint objects or maybe that gives directly a form

12646302
equals	compareto
anyway the following points from the javadoc should be enough for you to decide equals compares this bigdecimal with the specified object for equality
unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equal only if they are equal in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by this method

12649192
equals	gethashcode
if the gethashcode are not equals then two objects are not equals
if gethashcode is equals then two objects may or may not be equal. equals is the tie breaker

12649192
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode is equals then two objects may or may not be equal. equals is the tie breaker
for speed first gethashcode is compared

12649727
ssl	https
for example your web-inf resin-web.xml might look like the first matches on your xxx and checks if it s an ssl connection
if isn t an ssl connection it redirects to the https for the host

12650295
bower	npm
if not also try adding sudo sudo npm install -g bower
npm install -g bower give that a try

12650631
matlab	simulink
now based on the input going to the matlab fcn block and the fact that you have a video viewer block connected to the output vidfunc should be structured such that it operates on a single image frame as its input and outputs another single image frame
if vidfunc is not structured in this way you will need to edit it or just re-implement the same functionality using simulink blocks

12650941
inline	inlining
vs2012 will work the way that you expect if you structure the header like so so that the constructor isn t inline
the paragraph from the standard i quoted above does include the following note note the intent is that an inline function that is the subject of an explicit instantiation declaration will still be implicitly instantiated when odr-used 3.2 so that the body can be considered for inlining but that no out-of-line copy of the inline function would be generated in the translation unit

12650954
ssl	https
remember that ssl also secures the identity of the web server and not just the channel
if a man-in-the-middle spoofed the address of your script s location for instance https would prevent you from unknowingly executing unintended scripts

12651036
ssl	https
data transferred over ssl will not be cached by the visitor s browser instead will be downloaded each time a page is loaded
using ssl https is recommended if a page contains sensitive data personal data or offers interactions like contact forms etc

12652226
firefox	safari
24ways.org doesn t display the selection color properly in firefox either not because of combined selectors but because there is no -moz-selection selector in the first place
as to why chrome and safari leave blue areas of highlight in certain areas in the first site i really don t know

12654863
inline	inlining
as daniel kurka already mentioned the resources can be inline in the js file a file where the rest of the compiled gwt code lives
inlining does not occur for all resources in a client bundle

12655096
inline	inlining
using llvm as an example let us play with the following program the main function emitted therefore the compiler has the ability to understand which function gets selected with a combination of inlining and constant propagation and did inline the call
unfortunately i demonstrated in my e-mail that passing though virtual tables this does not work the optimizer somehow lost information and was not able to inline the call

12655096
inline	inlining
unfortunately i demonstrated in my e-mail that passing though virtual tables this does not work the optimizer somehow lost information and was not able to inline the call
so while it is perfectly possible that inlining does work through std function it may very well depend not only on the compiler but also on the particular implementation of std function that you happen to be using

12655928
mediarecorder	audiorecord
the documentation for mediarecorder states if setaudioencoder is not called the output file will not contain an audiotrack so amr_nb is not the default encoder for mediarecorder
audiorecord uses pcm

12657949
rspec	capybara
if you want to test aspects of your application which are exclusively api-like then i d recommend using rspec request specs for that which are essentially integration tests but focused on one-step request response. you can use get requests and analyze the response using capybara matchers
if you use capybara s visit you cannot access the response status because capybara does not provide that info

12658048
hash-collision	key
if you are using md5 or sha1 hash an attacker could easily find a hash-collision and make you slip on a banana skin
if you are encrypting without a random initialization vector an attacker might be able to deduce your key after uploading a few hundred files and encryption is probably not the best approach

12658212
google-chrome	firefox
so i wrote a script that will try every trick in the book and i was astonished to see that in google-chrome 22.0.1229.79 and ie 9.0.8112.16421 garbage collection doesn t even seem to work
firefox 15.0.1 managed without any major drawbacks apart from one see case 4f down below

12661380
rsa	dsa
rsa keys are symmetrical you can use any of them as a private key or public key it is just a matter of your choice but dsa keys are not symmetrical
the program below generates two 2048 bits long rsa keys then it saves them to files and reads them back into memory

12661937
inline	inlining
i m not aware of any easy way to determine whether strictness analysis has done what you think it has other than wading through the core output. inlining if you call a function and the compiler can tell which function you re calling it may try to inline that function - that is to replace the function call with a copy of the function itself
the overhead of a function call is usually pretty small but inlining often enables other optimisations to happen which wouldn t have happened otherwise so inlining can be a big win

12662966
jar	war
now in-the-sense-of-a-packaging jar files are not the only use of in-the-sense-of-a-container jar files
war ear and rar files and more besides are all jar files used for particular purposes

12664282
google-chrome	firefox
for further information on recent enhancements the following is a good post google-chrome seems to win out in terms of support and speed with safari not far behind
sadly firefox does not support much of the linked to page save for anything that relies on svg

12666896
spaces	delimiter
it has the following line of code within your definition of ant_home includes enclosing quotes so the code is trying to execute the spaces is not quoted and you have your error
all you need to do to fix everything is to remove the quotes from the definition of ant_home and then add quotes to your call statement forward-slashes are not always reliable as folder delimiter within windows

12668106
vsto	add-in
also check out vsto compatibility table on wikipedia which might be useful info
not sure if you have seen this or not but here s some of the explanations office 2010 32-bit should run vsto 2005 se add-in without modifications but office 2010 64-bit will not load vsto 2005 se add-in

12668505
implements	extends
you can keep digging into those referenced bugs and the actual links i provided where there s discussion as well as possible workarounds but i think that gets at the reasoning though why a new method reflecting java s oop in reflection as well has not yet been implements i don t know
in terms of workarounds i suppose that for the one-level-deep version of inheritance you can just call getsuperclass on each class whose name is that of the extends class but that s extremely inelegant and tied to you using it only on your classes implementing in the prescribed manner

12668507
comparator	comparable
if fromindex toindex the range to be sorted is empty. all elements in the range must be mutually comparable by the specified comparator that is c.compare e1 e2 must not throw a classcastexception for any elements e1 and e2 in the range
you can define a comparator and use it

12669778
equals	compareto
if you just want to check for equality use equals
compareto returns an int not a boolean

12669945
inline	inlining
they must declared in the main method body the reason getcallingassembly is susceptible is because you re looking for the caller s caller and the local variable only guarantees that the caller is not inline which means that the grandparent method can be inline leading to an unexpected result
the getexecutingassembly method is not susceptible to jit inlining because of the same reason methodbase.getcurrentmethod is also not susceptible since they are implemented in a similar way

12671109
super	extends
the super keyword is used in generics methods for consumer generic objects
example remark integer is a final class and cannot be extended so the extends keyword is unnapplicable

12673051
antialiasing	transparent
also take note of this user s note on that same page a transparent background with text doesn t seem to work very well because of the antialiasing
that is what you have specified here if you want to use some other color for transparent choose some other color

12673643
google-chrome	firefox
i strongly recommend that you redesign your webpage or at least build a better looking one that doesn t have quite the functionality as google-chrome s version but is still useable by people with ie and firefox
limiting your webpage to people with google-chrome is a very bad idea

12673817
serializable	deserialization
version tolerant serializable covers this in more detail
to sum it up yes if you do not have strongly named assemblies then the only difference is in how tolerant deserialization is

12677994
tabcontrol	tabitem
if you look through the template of tabcontrol you will find that the content of tabcontrol will only be the selected tabitem this is done to optimize the performance of tabcontrol
since the controls other in tabitem are not in view hence could not be found in visual tree

12678556
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i use google-chrome desktop for development then test on device
it s webkit only so if you only care about google-chrome safari it works fine but it does not work on firefox opera ie currently

12679347
innodb	myisam
make sure you re using an innodb table and not a myisam table as myisam is not transactional
to use an innodb table when you create it after the closing paren add

12679476
google-chrome	firefox
thanks to the comments elsewhere on this page i discovered that the order matters for google-chrome but not for firefox
this is possibly a bug in google-chrome

12679917
fread	strcpy
a probable cause for the behaviour is that strcpy requires the source string to be null terminated which is not the case here as fread does not append a null terminator for you nor could it in this case as fread is reading the exact buffer size
strcpy also appends a null terminator which means the strcpy call will definitely be writing beyond the buffer

12680563
hash-collision	key
valuetype.gethashcode tuple is technically not a value type but suffers from the same symptom hash-collision and is not good candidate for a key
if the key is part of the class then use keyedcollection

12684393
implements	extends
and no object implements no interfaces
according to java object superclass java.lang.object does not extends object

12686116
padrino	ruby-on-rails
most likely a real full-blown web application will require padrino
sinatra and padrino are not automatically faster than ruby-on-rails

12686116
padrino	ruby-on-rails
sinatra and padrino are not automatically faster than ruby-on-rails
they are just smaller than ruby-on-rails and supply the developer with a smaller more focussed toolkit

12690203
kombu	celery
edit any message consumer using kombu connected to the same redis url will help restoring unacked messages so you have to make sure all of them are configured with the same visibility_timeout value
a common mistake is starting the flower monitor like this celery flower -b redis somewhere instead of like this celery -a proj flower as the former means the flower instance will not be configured with the celery configuration and then be missing broker_transport_options and the visibility_timeout setting

12690507
associativity	operator-precedence
your question is about associativity and as the operator is associativity it doesn t make any difference
there is no operator-precedence here

12692543
queue	fifo
among the exceptions are priority queue which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements natural ordering so priorityqueue is an exception and it becomes a fifo queue only if the comparator sorts in that order
from the queue interface queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner

12694596
profiling	instrumentation
when i searched for instrumentation in spotlight only this version appeared because later versions of xcode hide their tools inside the xcode.app package. your circumstances may be different but i suspect that you did not run instrumentation from the profiling command in the xcode ide
to verify if this is the problem check the version of instrumentation in about instrumentation and verify that it is the same version as your xcode ide

12695207
pascal	delphi
much like in this example where int1 and int2 are not of the same type the actual problem is not with type inference but with the types not being compatible per the strict rules of pascal delphi
my guess is that comes from the strongly typed nature of delphi

12695220
uiview	subviews
just subclass uiview and add the following method to its implementation
this approach is quite clean and allows that transparent subviews are not reacting to touches as well

12697070
explode	substr
explode would do what you re asking for but you can make it one step by using current
i would not use a regex here that involves some work behind the scenes for a relatively simple action nor would i use strpos with substr as that would effectively be traversing the string twice

12697070
explode	substr
the only exception to that is if you happen to know that the string is excessively long i would not explode a 1 gb file
instead i also feel substr isn t quite as easy to read in current explode you can see the delimiter immediately with no extra function calls and there is only one incident of the variable which makes it less prone to human errors

12701807
ssl	https
client certs are usually used for 2-way ssl so not just the server but the client is also encrypting the traffic with it s private key
if you don t want to enforce https across the board then the one thing you can try is to accept the client cert see ssl settings then implement the cert validation in your application

12703324
cpython	ironpython
in cpython if you use open without assigning the result to a variable the file is closed again immediately
on other python implementations ironpython jython etc this may not be the case

12706441
mvp	presenter
no that wouldn t be mvp
do nothing it s usual to have cycle between those packages in mvp the cycle that necessarily remains is the cycle on instantiation you can t have both the presenter as a constructor param of the view and the view as a constructor param of the presenter

12708117
prepare	execute
looks to me like the pl pgsql execute for dynamic sql trumps the regular sql execute for prepare statements
code test outside pl pgsql it works fine i m not sure how you d execute a prepare statement within pl pgsql

12710285
prepare	execute
as you can see people suggest you use prepare statements at the most
it s not wrong but when your query is execute just once per process there would be a slight performance penalty

12713624
dictionary	map
had to use integer so that it can be determined if there is no match when checking the dictionary map trygetvalue of suffixs in which case it ll be null
if ints are used instead then the out param will be 0 which corresponds to the first entry of the map which obviously doesn t work

12714385
super	extends
one of the cases that is retained and not erased is the super class of a class
so if you create a class that extends you can access that information at runtime

12715513
apache	nginx
anyway you are not using apache so you can t haphazardly throw cakephp installations around expecting them to just work
the correct document root to use in production environments for performance and security on any web server apache iis nginx etc is the aptly named app webroot directory

12716314
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
- bool shouldautorotate of uiviewcontroller under any container like uinavigationcontroller will not be called from ios6
tried a solution with using category to add method to existing uinavigationcontroller class

12716343
config	ini
by doing so you could provide two xml config phpunit-sqlite.xml phpunit-pg.xml and run phpunit -c phpunit-sqlite.xml it doesn t have to be env
any of the methods listed in the doc section setting php ini settings constants and global variables will work

12717284
xlib	xcb
xlib is not the only way to access an x window server
there is also xcb

12719012
google-chrome	safari
however federico viticci has posted an interesting hack that will allow you to call safari from google-chrome for ios
it s not as functional as a chrome-to-safari bookmarklet but it does show it s possible to launch mobilesafari from google-chrome for ios

12719012
google-chrome	safari
it s not as functional as a chrome-to-safari bookmarklet but it does show it s possible to launch mobilesafari from google-chrome for ios
original answer it turns out you can t open a link in safari using just a uri scheme

12722951
division	subtract
same applies for subtraction and integer multiplication imul but not integer division after which all arithmetic flags are undefined
carry bit is used in machine instructions to test less_than greater_than conditions for unsigned variables for example or loop termination condition as subtract 1 from 0 leads to setting carry bit

12724145
equals	compareto
if the ordering imposed by c on s is inconsistent with equals the sorted set or sorted map will behave strangely. in particular the sorted set or sorted map will violate the general contract for set or map which is defined in terms of equals
typically if 2 objects are equal from an equals perspective but not from a compareto perspective you can store both objects as keys in a treemap

12725287
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in current versions of google-chrome and opera transition end event one of webkittransitionend otransitionend otransitionend will not fire if element is hidden has display none style
firefox ends its transition more successfully but also may not fire event under some circumstances note the transitionend event doesn t fire if the transition is aborted because the animating property s value is changed before the transition is completed

12725529
ssl	https
2 - keep wshttpbinding keep transport security and add message authentication you get to keep your ssl security layer but your client will have to provide credentials of any form and even if you don t validate them at the service side fake ones must still be provided as wcf will reject any message not specifying credentials
3 - use a custom binding with reliable messaging and https transport i can t see any downside to this except the threat explained in msdn and it depends on your application

12725863
prepare	execute
if you re looking for a bit more speed use prepare fetch so the sql engine doesn t have to parse out the text string each time
it s counter-intuitive that you do the binding outside the loop but this is one reason why this method is so fast you re basically saying execute this pre-compiled query using data from these variables

12728978
strcpy	malloc
the assignment operator is not defined for array types so you have to use library functions like strcpy to assign string values as above
if you don t know the max length of your string member you would do something like in this case you have to allocate the memory for myobj.name manually using the malloc library call and you have to deallocate it using the free library call

12730083
inline	inlining
historically it may have been used as such but optimizers have gotten better and better at deciding when to and not to inline and the inline hint has little effect nowadays
compilers usually provide specific keywords attributes to require more inlining

12731001
catransition	calayer
the only way to customize catransition beyond the built-in types and subtypes is by using a cifilter from ios 5.0 or osx 10.5
and the only way to create a custom cifilter beyond chaining and configuring built-in filters is according to the doc you can subclass cifilter in order to create a filter by chaining together two or more built-in core image filters ios and os x a custom filter that uses an image processing kernel that you write os x only so doing this based on calayer animations is not possible

12732462
floating-point	fractions
but for anything to do with floating points i have to point you at obligatory reference what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic
in java int and long do not have fractions parts so a string like 3000.1 cannot be covnerted to one of these

12733872
google-chrome	safari
i don t know how to reload a give google-chrome page from shell however i agree with chiel92 that if you need to see your changes when file changes you can do that from browser
see livereload works with windows mac not for me then and supports safari google-chrome

12735051
super	self
there are two issues at hand here super and old-style classes class reqboxfileparser does not inherit from object as a consequence super reqboxfileparser self will always yield the error typeerror must be type not classobj
improper super call in inheriting classes you re doing super reqboxfileparser self but you re passing the inherited class reqboxfileparser as first argument not the inheriting class

12735051
super	implements
improper super call in inheriting classes you re doing super reqboxfileparser self but you re passing the inherited class reqboxfileparser as first argument not the inheriting class
as a consequence python would try to find a class that reqboxfileparser inherits from which implements what you re looking for you re looking for f

12735051
super	self
your solution you probably guessed by now that you should be using super reqboxfileparserng self instead
plus you should always be using new-style classes but that alone wouldn t solve your issue you would get a different error complaining that attributeerror super object has no attribute f which would be true as object does not provide f

12741881
rdf	owl
the two forms of your rdf are basically equivalent
the second form contains some addition information namely the extra triple that won t hurt although thing is not a standard term in the rdf namespace - you possibly meant owl thing

12741881
rdf	owl
the second form contains some addition information namely the extra triple that won t hurt although thing is not a standard term in the rdf namespace - you possibly meant owl thing
the general rule of thumb with rdf is to not worry about the exact syntactic form of the output since a given rdf model may have many different serialisations that all parse to exactly the same set of triples and hence have the same meaning semantically

12744358
jsf	seam
a lifecycle is either started by a jsf request an asynchronous execution or manually by yourself
so you cannot use in inside your thread because it is not a component and seam will not intercept calls to it

12746994
jpql	hql
again jpql is a standard language and is not only tied to hibernate
however if you are only using hibernate you might find hql to have more options and be more flexible

12747377
cube	skybox
the camera must be in the exact center of the cube and the cube faces being rendered using a planar center perspective projection with a 90 fov
if you create your skybox that way it should not feel like a cube

12747524
google-chrome	firefox
i m afraid that most of the browser s mozilla safari google-chrome does not yet support access-control-expose-headers so your getallreponseheaders will not work
its been raised as a bug in mozilla firefox forums

12749193
rar	zip
i am not aware of truezip in particular but at least in terms of zip rar and tar you can access single files and retrieve details about them and even extract them without touching the rest of the package
additionally does random reading mean that it first uncompresses the entire archive if truezip follows zip rar tar format then it does not uncompress the entire archive

12751227
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if not believe you can put this into .htaccess
you can use proxy pass reverse assuming that you activate listen on port 8080 in your httpd.conf file or virtualhost file assuming you re using apache httpd and have root access

12752263
clang	llvm	libstdc++	libc++
clang is a c++ compiler which on most linux distributions will use the libstdc++ implementation which is usually bundled with the gcc compiler
the llvm project which hosts clang has its own implementation the libc++ library but it is not ported to many linux distributions yet

12753160
shadowing	named
note i am ignoring your shadowing issue as it is not related to the problem just a bad practice
i m going to make a wild guess since i am not familiar with eventemitter and say that emit s first parameter is the named of the event and the remaining parameters are passed to the handler

12755221
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
according to opera the css3 standard does not define the use of border-radius on tds
my experience is that firefox and google-chrome support it but opera does not don t know about ie

12760582
dbcontext	objectcontext
it s only possible to use external types for enums if you re using dbcontext based t4 templates
it s not supported for entities that derive from entityobject or use objectcontext directly

12761627
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
it seems like this is pretty well documented in javadoc of treeset bold mine note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

12761804
punctuation	words
you might want to filter out punctuation as well as zero-length words
filter out punctuation that doesn t count

12762058
super	self
however the modularity of this solution is not as great as it might first appear because you can override self types as so although if you override a member of a self type you lose access to the original member which can still be accessed through super using inheritance
so what is really gained over using inheritance is now i can t claim to understand all the subtleties of the cake pattern but it strikes me that the main method of enforcing modularity is through composition rather than inheritance or self types

12763422
comparator	comparable
std map requires that the key be comparable either with or a provided comparator
conceptually random-access iterators are comparable but bidirectional iterators aren t

12764734
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the correct way to trigger an event for modern browsers is in dom level 3 events here s jsfiddle that works in google-chrome safari firefox and ie9
if you take a look at the html dom level 2 specification the click function is only defined for htmlinputelement so while certainly not very user-friendly safari doesn t need to implement that

12765399
strncmp	strcmp
use strncmp instead which takes a length argument or preferably actually write c++ and start using and friends
your problem is two-fold strcmp returns 0 on success not on failure

12765924
multiplying	subtract
your example appears to have done both - subtract 0x40 from each value and multiplying by 1.33
using your second color we can subtract 06 from each resulting in #d0000a but this is not dark enough

12767328
pthreads	fork
fork is not a unix command but a syscall documented in the fork 2 pthreads man page
the linux man page is fork 2 -linux- here

12769983
prepare	execute
a typical example would be in the example above the query cannot be prepare and prepare will assign false to
trying to call the execute method will then result in the fatal error because false is a non-object because the value is a boolean

12771723
comparator	comparable
alternatively you can implement comparable interface directly in person class and override comparator object obj method
in this case you would not need to create new class for comparator

12773071
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you might want that when creating lightweight uiviewcontroller with bar and buttons but do not want navigation overhead
there is actually another answer which is not listed here but might be very useful in many cases. if you do not want to use uinavigationcontroller then self.navigationitem is not an option for you

12774837
g++	gcc
you can check this by typing the following in a terminal which g++. the response ought to be usr bin g++
if you find g++ installed in eclipse go to project- properties- c c++ build- discovery options under tools gcc c++ compiler put the exact path to g++ instead of g++ if g++ alone does not work

12776036
serializable	deserialization
serializable - should not serializable the static variables
deserialization - instance will get the static fields that was loaded with the class

12780476
notepad++	sublimetext
notepad++ is also not great at detecting it but when you know the encoding you can set it manually
sublimetext is as far as i know best at detecting the encoding also in large files

12781210
implements	extends
second not allowing it could have the side effect of making impossible sometimes to extends a class and implements an interface at the same time about your second question you can do nothing about it
you have to trust that the person who implements the child class doesn t do anything that breaks your implementation

12781264
ftp	telnet
for the directories and files use a ftp client from your server if it allows you to if not just download all the content to your computer and upload it to the new server
for the users and passwords i guess they are in a database connect to the database using ssh telnet or mysqladmin or any rmdb client system and export a dump file then log in to the new server s sql system and import that dump file

12782838
ati	nvidia
an aside but personally i am considering switching from nvidia gpus to ati for production purposes partly based on amd s investment in opencl and also arguments comparing bang for buck between nvidia and the latest amd cards nvidia vs amd gpgpu performance
nvidia s latest sdk v4.2.9 does not support opencl 1.2 with regard to the header files or library it provides

12784926
punctuation	words
what it says is a words character or any character that is not whitespace or certain punctuation
but the class of characters that are not whitespace or certain punctuation already includes all of the words characters

12787152
prng	random
basically the algorithm will produce an even distribution of numbers within the range in fact so even that prng s are often criticized for not being random enough
a prng can be started from an arbitrary starting state using a seed state

12787616
stateless	stateful
stateless protocol eases the replication concerns as the state itself doesn t need to be stored on the server
stateful protocols are logically heavy to implement in internet reliably

12787616
stateless	stateful
stateless servers are also easily scalable while for stateful servers scalablity is problematic
stateless request can be sent to any node at any time while with stateful this is not a case

12787616
stateless	stateful
stateless request can be sent to any node at any time while with stateful this is not a case
http as stateless protocol increases availability for stateless web applications which otherwise would be difficult or impossible to implement

12787719
super	implements
you can t do this while overriding __tostring because you ll have a hard time accessing the super s __tostring and if you call pair s __tostring a stack overflow occurs from the recursion
i think that the __tostring that prints table 0xaddress isn t actually implements in straight lua

12787738
hive	hdfs
you have several workarounds disable permissions at all for hdfs hdfs use storage based in this case you will not be able to create tables if you don t own database directory on hdfs submit all jobs under hive user sudo -u hive hive create database create database hadoop
and create needed directory in hdfs with correct permissions hdfs dfs -mkdir user hive warehouse hadoop.db

12789655
scheme	racket
it s like that because scheme is lexically scoped
i tested the code in the question in racket and the first line fails with the error expand unbound identifier in module in x - meaning that it s not even a valid definition as interpreted by racket

12790044
implements	extends
what you can do is provide the definition of the extends type close to the use and implements the capture manually
the simple answer is no you cannot use lambdas to implements interfaces

12790683
vim	notepad++
vim is great if you can learn how to use it
if that s not worth your time you can go for something simpler like notepad++

12790911
opera	safari	opera	firefox
demo works in ie9+ safari 5+ google-chrome and opera does not work in firefox - see this
html css edit another better compatibility solution only browsers in which this doesn t work are opera mobile and opera mini would be not to use a textarea but another div with a contenteditable attribute

12792463
implements	extends
i know that the class implements an interface must supply all the implementations of methods in that interface not true in case of an abstract-class
only concrete classes are supposed to provide implementations for all the abstract methods in the superclass which would be abstract that it extends and all the methods in the interface it implements

12795277
jar	manifest.mf
create a manifest.mf file for your jar and specify the class that has the main method using format main-class mypackage.yourpackhage.ourclass update when you are creating the jar follow define jar manifest to include a manifest file in your jar update 2 structure should be like yourjar meta-inf manifest.mf class1 class2
the problem you are mentioning is because the compiler can not find the main class within the jar

12796158
jar	war
not so sure about idea but typically a web project will have packaging type of war rather than jar
also research the maven war plugin so you know which files to add and into which folders

12797286
uiview	calayer
use uiview instead
calayer is not a subclass of uiresponder so they can t handle any touches

12802663
memcpy	strcpy
try to call memcpy like this
the value 0x4db80b5ce3c9e316ull is not a string so strcpy treats is as a pointer and with a value like that it s pointing way wrong

12803558
udp	tcp
i m not an expert in udp but i don t understand how seeing the size of the buffer will help you and i don t understand why you want to use select to do it
i think one of the main properties of udp as opposed to tcp is that you will sometimes lose messages

12804125
super	extends
don t use the super keyword to refer to other methods which aren t overridden
it makes it confusing for other developers trying to extends your classes

12805343
oncreate	setcontentview
assuming you have an xml file called edit.xml feel free to check out the android docs on fragments to get a better understanding of why i chose to do it in that method instead of the fragments oncreate etc
well you need to inflate an xml file or create one from scratch though i wouldn t recommend it unless you like the extra work but with an activity the setcontentview inflates your xml file and subsequently in oncreate you can access it the way you are use to

12805343
oncreate	setcontentview
well you need to inflate an xml file or create one from scratch though i wouldn t recommend it unless you like the extra work but with an activity the setcontentview inflates your xml file and subsequently in oncreate you can access it the way you are use to
mind you if you try accessing a layout view outside of oncreate without the parent view you will be getting the same issue

12806275
bash	zsh
there are two known problems with loading rvm default ruby login shell go to terminal emulator preferences and enable login shell sometimes it might be required to use bin bash --login instead
zsh + oh-my-zsh go to .zshrc and comment out any lines starting with or it is still possible to use those but they need to reference itself like or - which update and not reset path

12810428
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
in particular this is probably done to keep your machine and any others in a multicast environment from spamming the sender with icmp packets
if you re running wireshark at the wire which is generally how you run it you should see all packets udp tcp w e else regardless of local firewall settings and whether or not a port is open

12813049
octal	decimal
another difference when using parsefloat is that the string must represent a floating-point number in decimal form not octal or hexadecimal
this method ignores leading zeros so the octal number 0908 will be parsed into 908 and the hexadecimal number 0xa will return nan because x isn t a valid character for a floating-point number

12815136
opera	safari
i m not entirely sure what the reasoning behind this sentence is but as you see both opera s carakan engine and safari s es engine have chosen to implement an exception if a reference to eval is defined on some object and called from there
later editions of the ecmascript standard have removed this having an optional exception in a spec is a very bad idea in the first place and opera will be adapting in some future carakan-version

12815388
profiling	instrumentation
this is crude and perhaps there are better ways to get exact numbers but i would then suggest you use a profiling like instrumentation
but this is a good measure as it is quite simple and does not take away any cpu power like a profiling would do

12816532
comparator	comparable
well if you look at the class it s designed to be used in one of two ways you can provide a custom comparator or it will use the natural ordering of the objects
if the latter you are supposed to provide things that are comparable to themselves but this is not enforced at compile time in any way

12817927
firefox	safari
it does not work in firefox 14
this works in ie9 ie 8 ie7 chrome 22 safari 5.7.1

12821049
nunit	mstest
nunit has testcases for parametrized tests
mstest does not

12821049
nunit	mstest
with nunit you have to take care of instance variables eventually shared between tests though this shouldn t be a bis issue a well designed test should be isolated by design with nunit an abstract classes can be a test fixtures and you can inherit other test fixtures from it
mstest does not have this feature

12822504
dictionary	map
if you tolerate a bit internal mutable state here is a memoize function which creates a dictionary per function the approach isn t that bad since the mutable dictionary is hidden
a purely functional approach could be using map to hold values and a kind of state computation expression to hide map values passing around

12823626
shadowing	named
i recall reading one or two coding standards but i don t recall which that designated this kind of shadowing as a should but not shall practice
one final option is to use shadowing in the function declaration so as to give readers a hint as to what the function does but use distinct named in the implementation

12824427
oncreate	setcontentview
you re going to end up with an npe after you fix the intent bit i m not sure which class the posted oncreate is in so i m going to split this into the two scenarios scenario 1 posted oncreate belongs to game in this case when you replace the new coregame lines with the intent launching method you ll still get a nullpointerexception when you try to use findviewbyid
this is because you only called setcontentview in the game activity and now you ll be trying to access the views from a different activity

12826043
realloc	malloc
assuming that realloc is working as expected the amount of bytes you have allocated will be equal to your variable size
just a few other things i noticed in your code you should always check the return value of malloc to ensure that it succeeded the next part of your code that caught my eye this is actually not needed

12826959
passenger	webrick
suppose your web server is apache 2 you can use phusion passenger
see rails comes with its own little web server called webrick that isn t really suitable for production for various reasons

12827680
queue	fifo
the only way to share a queue across different apps or different instances of the same app is if all things reading from the queue use selectors and that the selectors effectively segregate the messages so they go to the right app
if even one instance is running fifo then it doesn t work

12833405
noexcept	throw
if the boolean is true then the noexcept sticks
if the boolean is false then the noexcept doesn t stick and the function may throw

12833410
noexcept	throw
noexcept isn t checked at compile time
an implementation shall not reject an expression merely because when executed it throw or might throw an exception that the containing function does not allow

12835140
factors	matrix
if your code is slow this probably means that your factors is not that sparse sparse anymore
you need to make sure that your matrix is properly reordered to minimize the fill added non-zero entries during sparse factorization

12840653
serializable	deserialization
objects which are stored in the http session needs to be serializable including all of its properties
however an ui component like htmlform isn t serializable with the simple reason that its state is sensitive to request-based changes which would in case of being serializable only cause possibly corrupt unsynced state after deserialization

12843558
google-chrome	firefox
i tried several tests of google-chrome v ie9 and google-chrome would not work under any configuration with the root password set
i also tested firefox it also worked fine the issue is only with google-chrome

12847270
implements	extends
first this magic class does not implements the logger so typehinting which is a good thing will not work
second because of your magic class not implementing or extends logger any ide will also not show autocompletion on the magic class

12859023
tiff	png
plus the conversion will be slow because imagemagick isn t calling ghostscript in a way that causes direct pdf- tiff conversion but it calls ghostscript to do a pdf- png conversion at 72dpi
first and then imagemagick itself does the png- tiff translation at 300 dpi .

12861407
implements	extends
if you need to execute code in another class that does not extends activity you can simply implements your own method and call it from inside onactivityresult
you can only get the result from an activity inside another activity or fragment. therefore you can only extends onactivityresult from a class that extends activity or one of it s descendants this is actually java-related and not android-related . also you must extends and define onactivityresult in the same activity where you call startactivityforresult

12867428
cpython	pypy
pypy is not a fork of cpython so it could never be merged directly into cpython
theoretically the python community could universally adopt pypy pypy could be made the reference implementation and cpython could be discontinued

12867428
cpython	pypy
cpython runs on more architectures than pypy and has been successfully adapted to run in embedded architectures in ways that may be impractical for pypy
cpython s reference counting scheme for memory management arguably has more predictable performance impacts than pypy s various gc systems although this isn t necessarily true of all pure gc strategies

12867428
cpython	pypy
cpython s reference counting scheme for memory management arguably has more predictable performance impacts than pypy s various gc systems although this isn t necessarily true of all pure gc strategies
pypy does not yet fully support python 3.x although that is an active work item

12867732
sudo	passwd
if you started it with sudo you ll have to have root privileges to kill it
basically you ll have to do os.system sudo kill d pid also i would suggest for security purposes that you create your bash script as root put it wherever it s convient not give the user write access to it and finally setup sudo to run it without needing a passwd

12868220
cdr	cons
lst acc loop cdr lst cons car lst acc loop lst either way this works
your solution is performing the cons operation in the wrong order that s why the result is not a well-formed list

12869119
rspec	capybara
long answer rspec creates dynamic methods that translates calls like to and in your case page.should have_selector title content my awesome content to
method which basically just passes its parameters to its test unit style assertion assert_selector assert_selector then passes its parameters again to the capybara finder method all returning true if it found any matches and raising an exception if it doesn t which has_selector

12873043
memcpy	malloc
the contents of the malloc ed memory is unspecified so when is interpreted as a in memcpy that almost certainly doesn t yield a valid pointer and the probability that it is a null pointer is not negligible
if you just want buf to contain the two pointers after the malloc is the simplest and cleanest solution but would also be valid also with instead of buf + 1

12878700
innodb	myisam
whilst this doesn t help you on innodb it s worth pointing out that myisam natively supports this functionality
as documented under using auto_increment myisam notes for myisam tables you can specify auto_increment on a secondary column in a multiple-column index

12879155
quicksort	radix-sort
the main advantage of quicksort is that you can write the algorithm stl style without knowing anything about the datatype being sorted at all other than how to call a function to compare two values
the same cannot be said of radix-sort

12880860
viewdidload	viewdidappear
because you set delegate of mkmapview in viewdidload method
but when you look at viewdidappear you re allocating new mkmapview and you re not setting delegate there

12884028
union	distinct
union performs a distinct on the result set eliminating any duplicate rows
union all does not remove duplicates and it therefore faster than union

12887760
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
for example sandy bridge has 6 execution units p0--p5 floating point multiplication division runs on p0 floating point addition and integer multiplication runs on p1
also division takes 3-4 times more cycles then multiplication addition and is not pipelined the execution unit cannot start another instruction while division is being performed

12887760
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
also division takes 3-4 times more cycles then multiplication addition and is not pipelined the execution unit cannot start another instruction while division is being performed
so in test2 while the vector code is waiting for the expensive division and some multiplication to finish on unit p0 the scalar code can be performing the extra 2 add instructions on p1 which most likely obliterates any advantage of vector instructions

12888377
aggregate-functions	coalesce
wrapping the aggregate-functions with coalesce should return 0 rather than null ie a function that returns the first parameter if it is not null and the second parameter if the first is null
i don t know what function to use with webmatrix but coalesce is pretty standard

12890210
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a completely different system than mysql
so do not assume things will be like mysql

12890280
jtextfield	jlabel	jtextfield	jtable
for your case you can use jtextfield not jlabel edit heres related question enter link description here
i still searching for this answer too here s i try so far.. i create jpopup and put the jtable in there.. then i use jlabel not jcombobox when user click jlabel then the popup jtable will show in that jlabel location.. when user select value on jtable then the popup will dispose then the jlabel will show the result

12893713
client-side	server-side
i find that providing clients with a service interface dll to be the cleanest approach - it avoids having to generate client-side code via svcutil add service reference but you seem to have your reasons for not doing this
the alternative would be to refactor your server-side code to avoid passing around a directoryservicescomexception

12900164
ienumerable	iqueryable
because ienumerable operators accept func which cannot be formed dynamically
the answer to this question lies with how iqueryable operators work

12900770
memcached	apc
if anyone else runs into this my solution was to ditch cacherouter did not perform as expected authcache too beta and boost simply to avoid hitting apache at all for cached pages proceeding with memcached api the drupal module memcached the caching system apc and varnish 3.0
memcached api allows me to cache both to ram via memcached and to the drupal db as backup in case memcached is not available via memcache.db.inc

12903030
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
make sure you are setting the outlet on a regular view controller a subclass of uiviewcontroller that is currently visible and contained in the viewcontrollers property of the uitabbarcontroller instance you are using
do not subclass uitabbarcontroller see the apple documentation which explicitly prohibits it

12903383
google-chrome	safari
since safari didn t like the trailing lf in your header i tried removing it i.e when i make this change google-chrome is able to see your response message i.e got hello shows up in the javascript console
safari still doesn t work

12903383
google-chrome	safari
your python code wasn t working with google-chrome because of an extra lf in your header response
there s still something else going on because the code the works with google-chrome doesn t work with safari

12903445
google-chrome	firefox
it s not present with other browsers such as ie google-chrome or safari
this evidently occurs due to a bug incompatibility in firefox up through at least version 16

12903628
serializable	deserialization
you can do everything that serializable supports except control over how the object is serializable outside of setting the name and the order
using datacontractserializer has several benefits serialize anything decorated with a even if it s not public visible can t serialize anything unless you specifically tell it to opt-in you can define the order in which the elements are serializable using the attribute on the doesn t require a parameterless constructor for deserialization is 10 faster than xmlserializer

12908882
jboss	glassfish
edit in order to control the server and deploy from eclipse you will have to tell it where your application server is - there are according plugins for glassfish and for jboss
i m not sure about jboss integration with netbeans - never done it but nb intagrates seamlessly with glassfish

12908882
jboss	glassfish
i m not sure about jboss integration with netbeans - never done it but nb intagrates seamlessly with glassfish
glassfish incldes a derby javadb distribution and jboss includes a h2 db distribution which both will be enough to start

12909101
ssl	https
shopp see s that ssl is required and then checks for ssl
if is_ssl is not set shopp will attempt to redirect to https

12910766
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining
if any of the method s formal arguments are structs the method will not be inline

12910980
prepare	execute
note also that a ddl statement such as create table cannot be prepare so there is no point in using prepare
you might as well just use query or execute

12911726
inline	inlining
keeping track of what code is inline where is just too much work for the ide to be doing so as a result it doesn t
to get round the issue either run in debug where inlining won t i think occur or don t inline the function

12913535
ecobertura	eclemma
no idea whether ecobertura has the same issue though
one factor may be that eclemma does not measure coverage correctly for exception handling code - it may tell you that code is not covered when in fact it is executed if you step through with the debugger the code is indeed executed

12920674
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
at the call to realloc neither or have been initialised
from the reference page for realloc it must be previously allocated by malloc calloc or realloc and not yet freed with free otherwise the results are undefined

12920726
nstextview	nstextstorage
it s not possible to use a custom nsformatter with a nstextview
that appears to be the province of nscontrol of which nstextfield is a subclass. however it is possible to set up a delegate for your text view s text storage nstextstorage and implement -textstoragewillprocessediting a method of nstextstoragedelegate

12923383
postgresql	mysql
that s because in the rails cast you sent sqlite is used as a database while you re using postgresql
so the problem is that database like sqlite and mysql let you add fields that are not in the group by clause but postgresql don t

12926770
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i m not entirely sure on this scenario though. in your scenario open optionsviewcontroller for the first time - tab bar controller s delegate is optionsviewcontroller open calculatorsviewcontroller for the first time - tab bar controller s delegate is now calculatorsviewcontroller go back to optionsviewcontroller - tab bar controller s delegate is still calculatorsviewcontroller as the viewdidload is not called again if you must change the delegate you can do it instead in the viewwillappear method
by calling on each viewdidload method you are basically telling the tab bar controller to use abandon the current delegate and use the current view controller as delegate

12928386
opera	google-chrome
firefox and opera fully support it though firefox needs an extension named greasemonkey
google-chrome has one small exception you will need to add the library and your code to the document itself if the library is not active on the page

12930043
arp	udp
the reason why is because when your pc is turned off it doesn t have an ip address assigned so the router does not have the binding with mac address ip adress in the arp table and can t forward the packet
3 port forwarded my router on udp port 7 to my pc you need to forward upd 7 and or udp 9 to lan broadcast address not to your pc s ip address

12931451
uiview	subviews
changing uiview s transform parameter you don t need to bother about subviews scale coreanimation does everything for you
i would leave the scale of uiscrollview as it is and reach the goal with the help of subviews adjusting its size not scrollview s where i would place all the subviews and the images you work with

12932858
primefaces	trinidad
apparently you re mixing trinidad with primefaces and it s not working very well
since you didn t mention anything about trinidad in your question it s perhaps a leftover of previous experiments to play around with several component libraries

12933804
uiview	subviews
the scroll view and anything inside it will zoom in this case the image view . in the uiview below the scroll view in this case an image view with the default.png image will not zoom when the scroll view is zoomed
edit to have the button remain in the same place relative to the image add it as a subviews to your scroll view add uiscrollviewdelegate to your view controller header

12934872
cpython	pypy
a golden rule to optimize code in cpython note cpython not python
i m talking for the official implementation and not alternatives such as pypy jython etc. is to do as much computation as possible at c level

12937106
operands	scalar
you need to be consistent in the way that you treat the operands either they express two s complement values or one complement s values it is not ok to mix both
it is merely a convention very much akin to the difference between signed and unsigned scalar types in various programming languages

12943712
equals	gethashcode
from msdn notes to implementers section a hash function must have the following properties if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

12943712
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

12945878
implements	extends
the real key here is that people should never build up from the mutable objects except to implements further-down interfaces
if you re extends and then returning an immutable subclass then it s not immutable if it exposes a mutable object by definition

12946583
viewdidload	viewdidappear
but i suspect that moving the code to viewdidload would solve the problem
i m not sure entirely what s going on but note that after you dismiss the modal view controller viewdidappear gets called again

12947590
xdebug	xhprof
i measured this recently and found that having only xhprof_flags_memory is the best option for minimal overhead i just run xhprof on a small number of requests like so but unlike xdebug simply having the extension enabled doesn t seem to add any overhead at all
although xhprof does add overhead to the request if it s enabled via the function called not just having the extension enabled it varies depending on which flags you use

12947633
comparator	comparable
comparator raises nullpointerexception if passed null
java doc of comparable note that null is not an instance of any class and e.compareto null should throw a nullpointerexception even though e.equals null returns false

12949706
google-chrome	firefox
the problem here was that cookies do not work locally with google-chrome
tried with firefox and worked well

12949796
profiling	instrumentation
all the jvms started by the selected user are shown and you can either start a full profiling session or just take a low-overhead hprof heap dump and open it in jprofiler
the easiest way to profile a remote jvm on a system without a gui is this extract the jprofiler archive not the installer somewhere on the remote machine in the installation directory call bin jpenable and select the jvm you want to profile on your local machine start jprofiler and create a new session of type attach to profiled jvm local or remote in the session configuration enter the host name and the port as given by jpenable start the session and profile tip to find a bottleneck use sampling not instrumentation

12952949
translation	localization
however it does not explain how to translation a localization module because ironically localization modules seldom need to be translation
a bit of context contrasting with the way generic openerp modules are written the localization modules of monolingual countries have the names of the taxes g l accounts etc

12952949
translation	localization
check out the documentation about openerp translation for more details on the po pot file format and organization as well as dreispt s related question already mentioned
after performing the above steps the translation should be loaded automatically in each database where you install your localization module but make sure to install all the relevant languages before installing the chart of account this technique is still a bit experimental so don t hesitate to report bugs if it doesn t seem to work as described

12952949
translation	localization
after performing the above steps the translation should be loaded automatically in each database where you install your localization module but make sure to install all the relevant languages before installing the chart of account this technique is still a bit experimental so don t hesitate to report bugs if it doesn t seem to work as described
ps obviously all of this should be mentioned in the official openerp localization documentation so if someone feels like doing it remember that the documentation is open and anyone can directly contribute to it

12953096
implements	extends
imaging if class a implements i1 and class b extends a
by default b implements i1 even though it does not need to implements any method in i1

12953714
aggregate-functions	sum
when using any aggregate-functions you will need to add the non aggregated fields into a group by clause
so in your column you need to list those fields that are not listed in the aggregate-functions sum in the group by clause

12953714
aggregate-functions	sum
so in your column you need to list those fields that are not listed in the aggregate-functions sum in the group by clause
therefore your query should be as following select flask_code sum nvl bin1 0 + sum nvl bin2 0 + sum nvl bin3 0 as total from ... t group by flask_code this is just an example

12954855
thin	webrick
if you want to mimic what heroku sets up automatically you add the following to the procfile depending on whether you are using the thin web server which heroku recommends or not
with thin in your gemfile without a special web server eg you are using webrick the rails default once this file is in place you can run foreman on your local machine and it will start your web server and delayed_job workers automatically

12955309
heroku	engineyard
the read-only filesystem which is a platform feature of heroku also forces you to learn some new tricks. i now have several apps small to medium on heroku and happily have my assets served up from s3. in the end i would encourage you to try them both
engineyard offers a 500 hour trial though that is computing hours not necessarily real-time hours and heroku let s you get started right away for pretty much free

12955959
daemons	systemd
double-check that your window manager or a hotkey daemons isn t consuming your f1 s before they hit your process
this works fine f1 closes the program on my systemd i did notice that keycatch was undefined

12957419
jar	war
when code from the post was in running mode it couldn t find nothing like src main resources beans.xml due to the fact that beans.xml was in the root of jar copied to beans.xml in created jar ear war
when using classpathxmlapplicationcontext the proper location declaration for beans xml definitions in this case was beans.xml since this is path where it belongs in jar and later on in classpath

12957840
google-chrome	firefox
i was confused because popstate was firing on every page load i use google-chrome
from browsers tend to handle the popstate event differently on page load. google-chrome and safari always emit a popstate event on page load but firefox doesn t

12957840
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
from browsers tend to handle the popstate event differently on page load. google-chrome and safari always emit a popstate event on page load but firefox doesn t
so in google-chrome and apparently safari the jquery ready method will execute followed by the popstate event. it doesn t matter if you attach the event within ready or body.onload for that matter the popstate event will happen after your ready method is complete

12959179
cvs	svn
cvs doesn t use it eg.
just wanted to say that the tagbase parameter is just relevant for svn

12960941
udp	tcp
note connect is not required for use with udp datagram sockets only tcp ip
udp is a broadcast protocol and connect does not even require that a socket is listening to the other end

12961710
jax-ws	saaj
if you don t use the jax-ws implementation provided by axis2 then you don t need axis2-saaj so depending on your use case removing it may be a solution
this is not a conflict between saaj and axiom-dom but a conflict between saaj and axis2-saaj.jar

12963935
inline	inlining
it can t know until runtime whether it will be calling derived1 foo or derived2 foo so there s no way to inline it
if you want to insure that inlining is possible make sure that the function you want to inline isn t virtual

12964493
jar	manifest.mf
your jar file is incomplete or depends on additional jars which have not been copied along with your main jar file
the manifest.mf points to the main class logic.start which is not available in the expected location

12965182
firefox	safari
i can verify that this is a problem for java 1.7 update 7+ on the safari 6 and firefox running on mountain lion
curiously it is not a problem on earlier versions of safari that run on lion but it is a problem in firefox on the older os

12966048
implements	extends
since your class cannot inherit from multiple classes java doesn t support it your class could implements runnable interface in that case
in terms of functionality there is no difference between implementing runnable interface or extends thread class

12966187
required	placeholder
also verify that it doesn t need to have a result column name as well e.g select calculateprice .. as colname which is required in at least sql server
the program is passing in a bogus query string due to sql string injection and lack of placeholder

12966787
accelerometer	gyroscope
linear_acceleration is nothing but accelerometer - gravity component
on devices without gyroscope fusion is not possible by definition it requires accel+gyro

12967018
onclick	onchange
i do recommend you use onclick event
actually ie especially ie7 8 doesn t support onchange event very well

12968143
google-chrome	firefox
update at the time of this edit 6 apr 2015 this is now working in google-chrome
before and after seem to allow the cursor property in firefox but not in google-chrome

12968651
interpolation	splines
if this is not the case which i suspect it s not you have to do one more step create an interpolation in the dimension of time for each xy point
that can be done easily using splines

12969060
wadl	wsdl
suppose you already know that wadl is not standard not supported widely
and when somebody needs wadl may be then better to use ws soap service + wsdl

12973361
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
use instead if you simply need malloc 3 and related standard functions free calloc realloc ....
notice that is defined by c89 and later standards but not look into usr include malloc.h you ll find there some non-standard functions malloc_stats 3 etc... - in addition of malloc ..

12975190
configobj	configparser
configparser seemed cumbersome to me maybe even dare i say it unpythonic and with configobj i encountered an esoteric problem with lists i d prefer to be able to align them vertically since mine get really long and it didn t help that the latest version was published more than two years ago
the api of configparser however looked as spiffy as that of configobj albeit not as feature-rich and when we move to python 3 i can probably switch to the built-in version easily

12975355
division	modulo
this means that the result of the operations is not dividing but obtaining the remainder of the division like this kind of logic is fairly frequently used when dealing with numeric operations
is not the same as the operator is for the modulo not division.

12976744
udp	tcp
i was assuming that statsd not only recieved udp but also sent udp to carbon
after i realized that statsd sends tcp instead i was able to adjust my firewall and it works great now

12977120
division	multiplication
if your compiler is not smart enough though or if there are floating point accuracy issues then you can always do the optimisation explicitly change to note that this is most likely a case of premature optimisation - you should only do this kind of thing if you have profiled your code and positively identified division as being a performance bottlneck
usually division is a lot more expensive than multiplication but a smart compiler will often convert division by a compile-time constant to a multiplication anyway

12978232
profiling	debugging
if you can not profiling your application you will be bound to the cooverage approach
another thing you might have a look at is decorators you can write a debugging decorator and apply it to set of functions you suspect

12978783
gridview	repeater
if this select element is inside a gridview row or a repeater the selector will match them all
say you have this gridview i ve removed fluff from it it ll generate html that looks something like this again i ve removed a lot of the markup that isn t needed to show what i m talking about

12978933
serializable	deserialization
overall you re correct javascript doesn t have any built-in way to serializable anything beyond plain objects so going to and from json will not produce a particular class when you deserialize it
so you need to either work out serialization deserialization yourself or use a library that provides some support

12982435
pdfsharp	itextsharp
not sure what the advantages of itextsharp are but i found a solution that is working perfectly so far using pdfsharp
as documentation seems to be a little on the light side for pdfsharp i also found this thread to be very helpful.

12984095
google-chrome	firefox
i just wrote this function that does what you want try it out let me know if it doesn t work correctly for you working example tested in google-chrome i can t guarantee full browser support - you will have to test this
it creates an object that contains the tree structure of the html page in the format you requested and then uses json.stringify which is included in most modern browsers ie8+ firefox 3+ .etc

12984349
google-chrome	firefox
bummer that google-chrome kind of destroys the page property this way
that said firefox still does not support page as of now so it s not a perfect solution to begin with

12985111
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works in latest firefox google-chrome safari opera 18+ ie10 ie11 ie9 and below do not support css3 transitions or animate.
google-chrome added the webkit bug fix to version 27.0.1453.110 m this webkit bug was fixed it is possible to animate pseudo before and after here are a couple of examples for animating the psuedo-elements before and after

12987097
comparator	comparable
from the documentation - all elements inserted into a sorted set must implement the comparable interface or be accepted by the specified comparator
furthermore all such elements must be mutually comparable e1.compareto e2 or comparator.compare e1 e2 must not throw a classcastexception for any elements e1 and e2 in the sorted set

12988322
vb.net	vb6
if you are converting vb6 projects to vb.net especially with ui be prepared to encounter a lot of errors because many vb6 tricks are not compatible with vb.net
there is a way to manually edit form designer code in vb.net solution explorer - show all files

12991633
qthread	qobject
only real reason to subclass qthread is to override run method with one which does not call exec
related reading additon if you override qthread run you have to call qthread exec there or event loop won t be running and no non-direct signal gets delivered to any qobject with that thread affinity

12992284
qthread	qobject
you could add a call to qthread exec in run to run that event loop if you were using qthread or create and start a qeventloop whose quit slot has to be connected somewhere to stop the loop for example a finished signal in the class httpclient that you would emit when the work is done also since qt 4.8 qnetworkaccessmanager is multithreaded so you might not need to use threads yourself
since the httpclient and qnetworkaccessmanager objects are created within the thread they automatically belongs to that thread see qobject movetothread and they both needs an event loop running in that thread for qnam to do any work at all and for your qobject derived class to be able to execute the slots

12992329
union	distinct
better solution will be to use union all so server will not be checking for distinct values select name phone users as table_name from users union all select name phone vendors as table_name from vendors
select name phone users as table_name from users union select name phone vendors as table_name from vendors

firefox	safari
edit checked this and confirm that ie9 and firefox leaves the original path s path1 segment list intact when it s segment s are appended to other path s segment list so also the indexes are preserved
the behavior in safari chrome and opera is different the item is removed from original list when appended to other list and so far of course the indexing is updated also the old indexes are not valid anymore after appending

12993074
comparator	comparable
alternatively the constructor that does not take comparator should enforce type parameter
use comparablecomparator from apache commons that takes arbitrary two object s and compares them if they implement comparable

12993581
strdup	malloc
if one doesn t understand how a function works it s very likely the person is going to mess up something this is applicable to any function not just strdup
in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

12995721
ssl	https
stunnel acts as a wrapper which can be used to provide ssl encryption for services which do not support it natively
an example 4mlinux server a linux distro uses httpd from busybox and stunnel is used for the https protocol

12996196
haskell	ocaml
to do the same in ocaml you can use a functor not a haskell functor
in ocaml the word functor denotes a higher-order module that may depend on other modules functors

bluestacks	android-emulator
this works on mac and i see no reason why it should not also work on windows start bluestacks run mosyncdir bin android adb connect localhost 10001 where mosyncdir is your mosync installation directory in the mosync ide click the tiny arrow next to the select target device toolbar item and in the dropdown select scan for android usb device if properly connected a dialog pop-up with a list of connected devices
select localhost 10001 and click ok to actually run on the android-emulator select a project in the project explorer usually the leftmost panel in the ide

12997749
postgresql	mysql
i was bored so here s a rewritten version of your query - based on a postgresql port of your schema - that calculates the matches for all user pairings at once i ve checked and it produces the same results for the user pair 1 5
there s no reason you couldn t port this back to mysql as the cte is only there for readability and doesn t do anything you can t do with from select ...

12999399
ember.js	backbone.js
if your next project pushes all the interaction into the browser environment use ember.js
contrary to popular opinion ember.js isn t a more heavy weight approach to backbone.js

12999817
bluestacks	android-emulator
to install an app on your you computer using the bluestacks device android-emulator you simply click on the apk
when i have a client that want s to show an app at conference for example i always use bluestacks it s not perfect but it allows you to run android apps on your computer without doing all the technical stuff like installing an android-emulator etc

13000734
oncreate	onstart
this started as my first project and in a ham-handed attempt to solve a database problem months ago i had extraneously overridden onstart and onrestart with pretty much the same code in oncreate
oncreate has changed over time and those methods did not

13004400
sudo	passwd
the error message comes from sudo and has nothing to do with postgresql at all
to log in as database user jason psql -u jason you need to supply a passwd of course as long as password-less access is not set up

13004973
apache	nginx
people use nginx for #1 because its a very fast proxy and it doesn t come with the overhead of a comprehensive server like apache
you are free to use apache if you are comfortable with it

13004973
gunicorn	uwsgi
binding gunicorn uwsgi to this address is not recommended in production
if you bind your backend process gunicorn uwsgi to 0.0.0.0 it may become accessible directly bypassing your front-end proxy nginx apache etc

13006260
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in order for loadview viewdidload viewwillappear to be called you need to something like you should not rely on your iboutlets until the uiviewcontroller is actually on the screen
if you want to have your iboutlets have some default values on the beginning you should pass them on the init method save them as ivars and then set them in viewdidload for example

13008266
boost	allocator	boost	stl
if you want a circular buffer implementation where you can insert or delete anywhere std deque would not be the most efficient to use std list would be although there are circular collections available in boost you could use
yes as with every stl collection one of the templated parameters is an allocator

13014806
serializable	deserialization
binaryformatter works on an all fields basis unless they are explicitly marked not for serializable
you could use the same approach but if you re using automatically implemented properties which is fine then note that you cannot add attributes to the backing field - unlike field-like events the following is not valid c# this means that your only sensible choice is to decorate the property because if you change the automatically implemented property to a regular property you will have broken binaryformatter s deserialization since the field-name will have changed

13020184
innodb	myisam
it provides a number of advantages anyway so i d say yes make all tables innodb unless you have a good reason not to you need myisam geospatial extensions or fulltext and your innodb version doesn t support those features
innodb is preferred over myisam and if you have foreign key constraints then you should use innodb anyway since myisam doesn t support foreign keys

13020184
innodb	myisam
innodb is preferred over myisam and if you have foreign key constraints then you should use innodb anyway since myisam doesn t support foreign keys
also if you want to use innodb its usually recommended that all tables use innodb

13020721
directx	direct2d
you do need to use directx direct2d directwrite if you want to render any text
it is not too hard to do with directx if your ui is simple

13021056
equals	compareto
this will as you can see return 0 if they are equals negative if other.sin is greater than cust1.sin and positive if cust1.sin is greater than other.sin
you do not actually need to use a compareto method inside your own compareto method

13021630
innodb	myisam
suggest you use innodb instead
you are using myisam but as documented under foreign key differences for storage engines other than innodb mysql server parses the foreign key syntax in create table statements but does not use or store it

13021856
portrait	landscape
it will not see where you forced the other viewcontrollers into portrait
here is how i do it in the project file make sure you are supporting the landscape orientations now in all of your viewcontrollers that should still be portrait only add this code i have put in both the ios5 and ios6 calls so that my code will run on both

13022668
udp	tcp
udp is used mostly for sending distinct datagrams or when a longer connection is not needed
tcp is also called a streaming protocol and is often used for data that has no fixed end

13024015
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this is happening because apple has changed the way of managing the orientation of uiviewcontroller
in ios6 oreintation handles differently .in ios6 containers such as uinavigationcontroller do not consult their children to determine whether they should autorotate

13026205
comparator	comparable
your code with my edits compiles properly you should however make a separate class or a static final class of the comparator so that it is more intuitive to use also does not increase the weight of each pair instance
i would declare my class as such meaning that objects are comparable with objects of the same type as they are your error means that the compiler cannot make sure objects are compared to other objects of the same type

13032761
equals	compareto
so you should probably override equals to be consistent with your compareto because otherwise two different objects e1 and e2 with equals score and getitemname will have but not e1.equals object e2
quote from the java api of the natural ordering for a class c is said to be consistent with equals if and only if e1.compareto object e2 0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals object e2 for every e1 and e2 of class c

13032761
equals	compareto
quote from the java api of the natural ordering for a class c is said to be consistent with equals if and only if e1.compareto object e2 0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals object e2 for every e1 and e2 of class c
and for using compareto the api further says it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals

13032761
equals	compareto
and for using compareto the api further says it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals
this is so because sorted sets and sorted maps without explicit comparators behave strangely when they are used with elements or keys whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals

13033663
google-chrome	firefox
if you give your checkboxes specific id s that all start with the same thing you could do the following html css probably modern browsers only though. edit i have just tried a fiddle link and it works in google-chrome and ie 8 9 but not 7
i did not try it in firefox

13034978
strtol	atoi
edit note that it s impossible to detect errors with atoi since it returns 0 on error in some implementations and doesn t set errno afaik so it s probably better to use strtol see this link converting strings to numbers
you don t need to tokenize the string or use sscanf if all you want is the first number return atoi str

13035238
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
to answer the question you meant to ask cpython 3.x or otherwise does not never did and likely never will contain a jit compiler
some other python implementations pypy natively jython and ironpython by re-using jit compilers for the virtual machines they build on do have a jit compiler

13037661
libstdc++	libc++
but opencv is expecting to be built against the gnu libstdc++ gnu c++ standard library
is apparently a gnu extension and isn t part of the llvm libc++ standard library

13038245
serializable	deserialization
you might need a different view on deserialization and not just on serializable and that would be a jackson 2.0 feature - supported by spring 3.2 and backported into spring 3.1
using a view on serializable only is a feature since jackson 1.4

13039324
rvm	bundler
it also appears you aren t using bundler so make sure to switch to the gemset you are currently using for your project looks like it s dmstaffing with the command rvm 1.9.3-p194 dmstaffing then run gem install jasmine -v 1.2.1
i would suggest using bundler over gemsets because i find it a bit more dynamic and easy to make changes

13040027
floating-point	fractions
actually you have to get used to the fact that most fractions decimal numbers you will encounter in everyday life will not be representable precisely in binary floating-point types regardless of how large these floating-point types are
floating-point values represented in binary format do not have any specific decimal precision

13041132
orientdb	neo4j
since both support gremlin and orientdb is 100 compilant with blueprints the tutorial is applicable to it
maybe the tutorial that you are looking for is this one is not with orientdb but neo4j

13043056
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload will only get called when the controller is created
so if your global get infovc is not allocating and returning the controller returning an already created controller viewdidload will not be called. in viewdidappear it is safe to adjust the views related to your controller

13043056
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so if your global get infovc is not allocating and returning the controller returning an already created controller viewdidload will not be called. in viewdidappear it is safe to adjust the views related to your controller
if you created them in viewdidload they will already exist

13047224
client-side	server-side
you re rather looking for a mix of server- and client-side pagination and dynamic loading
in there i d recommend to go with the library and server-side framework that you re most familiar with because the amount of data you re transferring does not justify going for performance optimization

13048494
viewmodel	caliburn
the viewmodel do not need to be aware of each other
i suggest using any mvvm framework of your choice for example caliburn micro

13049715
asterisk	ivr
people have turned asterisk into ivr s but there is a huge learning curve there it is somewhat limited in ivr capabilities hard to maintain your voice application and it does not support open standards for ivr s like voicexml
to know what ivr platform to recommend i would need to know more specifics about your ivr requirements

13051170
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy
instead you should use memcpy and then terminate the new string memcpy does not check for 0 and so is faster
matthew when you already know the length of the string you are copying you don t need strcpy or strncpy which check each character looking for the 0 at the end

13051195
memcpy	strncpy
the fastest and safest way to copy strings is through memcpy
do not use strncpy it is plain dangerous

13051771
udp	tcp
your question implies that udp is probably what you want for a low latency game and there is truth to that
you may be aware of this already since you are writing a game but for those that aren t here is a quick primer on tcp vs udp for real-time games tcp is an in-order reliable transport mechanism and udp is best-effort

13051771
udp	tcp
you may be aware of this already since you are writing a game but for those that aren t here is a quick primer on tcp vs udp for real-time games tcp is an in-order reliable transport mechanism and udp is best-effort
tcp will deliver all the data that is sent and in the order that it was sent

13052450
ubuntu	freebsd
you would be hardcoding your app to work on ubuntu which might use different crypts not just from osx but from other unix and bsd flavors like redhat freebsd etc
if you re running in osx you d want the osx version crypt and if you re running in ubuntu it ll use ubuntu s crypt

13052993
g++	gcc
since this is pretty ugly it s probably better to use forward slashes set cmake_c_compiler c mingw bin gcc set cmake_cxx_compiler c mingw bin g++
you have to use four backslashes to get a literal backslash in a set set cmake_c_compiler c mingw bin gcc set cmake_cxx_compiler c mingw bin g++ this applies whether or not you use quotes around the argument

13054470
memcpy	memmove
of course if you are sure about your source and destination not overlapping then memcpy is fine
memcpy works but you can use memmove also which handily does not explode if you have over-lapping memory locations not likely in your example but if you the logic to a clone function for example it could happen

13054470
memcpy	memmove
memcpy works but you can use memmove also which handily does not explode if you have over-lapping memory locations not likely in your example but if you the logic to a clone function for example it could happen
memmove a b sizeof a

13054742
setinterval	settimeout
you should use settimeout instead of setinterval as setinterval will not stop until you stop it using clearinterval or by unloading the page
at the other hand settimeout will run only once for each loop with delay of 6000ms

13055641
prng	random
you should use dev urandom because android already makes sure the prng is seeded
the only advantage of dev random over dev urandom is that dev random is safe even if the prng isn t seeded

13055641
prng	random
the only advantage of dev random over dev urandom is that dev random is safe even if the prng isn t seeded
but android always seeds the prng

13057443
postgresql	mysql
sqlite can use this technique but postgresql doesn t like it it uses a technique called analytic queries which are both standardised and more general
mysql can do neither

13057916
bazaar	git
it interoperates with a plethora of other vcs including svn mercurial bazaar .
for git it will even show three panes if some but not all changes are staged

13058841
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox you don t need to install a driver but for google-chrome and ie you do
that may be why your tests are running using firefox and not google-chrome

13059640
ssl	https
https is simply http over ssl with the minor addition of hostname checking to ensure that the hostname in the certificate agrees with the site you connected to
specifically one of my seniors told me that https does not actually use ssl tls but only their the encryption algorithms wrong

13061518
client-side	server-side
if a client-side method calls other methods these secondary calls are not remoted to the server
the server-side version will either call the same methods on the server or not as it sees fit

13062766
ubuntu	linux
see this stack overflow question installing cuda 5 samples in ubuntu 12.10
ubuntu 12 is not a supported linux distro yet

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse
ubuntu 12 is not a supported linux distro yet

13062906
scrollable	panels
that much of space we had to leave for the header so that its not going to eat up any space of the grid content.with the panels control we can control the width height and scrollable option
for our code example we set the height as 300px the width as 100 and set the panels to scroll while showing only the vertical scrollbars

13063077
namenode	hdfs
if you followed this tutorial the relevant directory is app hadoop tmp dfs data reformat the namenode note all hdfs data is lost during this process
restart the cluster when deleting all the hdfs data and starting from scratch does not sound like a good idea it might be ok during the initial setup testing you might give the second approach a try

13065228
implements	extends
how can i implements clone method in this typical case where we cannot add any method in parent class to have super.clone to call object clone method
well since clone method is a protected method in object class so it is accessible in your super class unchangeablebaseclass also since it extends from object class

13069002
uiview	subviews
i will not create a transparent uiview like you are mentioning
i will add a uiswipegesturerecognizer to the uisplitviewcontroller s view this is already the view that contains all your subviews

13069982
memcpy	strcpy
use memcpy instead but give it the size length+1 of the string being copied not the size of the buffer or you risk undefined behavior segfaults
strcpy doesn t take a size length argument

13070280
ssl	https
so if your server doesn t have proper ssl certificate or you have provided wrong secure url in app settings the tab could not be loaded in https and only users with that setting on could have the problem
suggestion - there is a user setting in facebook to use always https

13070855
oncreate	setcontentview
so asynctask worked better for this ui need to load an overly large layout file later with setcontentview - later meaning after the oncreate so a progressdialog could be shown
progressdialog doesn t show up until oncreate is done

13071466
realloc	malloc
c11 n1570 7.22.3.5 the realloc function if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

13072160
voip	sip
i believe your query about cti and jtapi are answered pretty well by bdk let me answer you query about sip integration of call manager in voip deployments with a different perspective not involving cti or jtapi
to begin with sip session initiation protocol is used to establish voip connections across a network

13077670
dbcontext	objectcontext
this will completely disable the create of proxy objects for every query to the specific dbcontext
this does not affect the cached object in the objectcontext

13078648
google-chrome	firefox
i beleave you are testing on google-chrome so you are most likely logged in
but when you go to firefox or ie and you are not logged in auth.statuschange nevers gets called test by login out of facebook on google-chrome and youll see it doesnt work there either

13079343
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload - called after the controller s view is loaded into memory at this point the view isn t within the view hierarchy
viewwillappear - notifies the view controller that its view is about to be added to a view hierarchy

13079355
cube	skybox
the above method is actually really similar to what i m doing for an app right now except i m only using projective texturing to mask off replace a small portion of the cube map
i need to pixel-match the edges of the small square i m projecting so that it s seamlessly applied to the skybox so that s why i feel confident that this method will actually reproduce the cube map behavior -- otherwise pixel-matching wouldn t be possible

13083635
realloc	calloc
when extending a region allocated with calloc 3 realloc 3 does not guaran- tee that the additional memory is also zero-filled
realloc enlarge the memory size where reserved for your string

13083635
memcpy	malloc	memcpy	realloc
if it cannot it malloc a lager memory plage and memcpy itself the data contained in the previous memory plage
in short it is normal that you dont have to call memcpy after realloc

13083635
realloc	malloc
if there is not enough room to enlarge the memory allocation pointed to by ptr realloc creates a new allocation copies as much of the old data pointed to by ptr as will fit to the new allocation frees the old allocation and returns a pointer to the allocated memory
if ptr is null realloc is identical to a call to malloc for size bytes

13083662
memcpy	realloc
so in short the memcpy is unnecessary and indeed wrong
wrong for two reasons if realloc has free d your previous memory then you are accessing memory that is not yours

13083924
drawimage	putimagedata
what you want is to use drawimage and then use another as source instead of
getimagedata and putimagedata are provided for raw pixel operations and thus scaling is not possible unless you write a custom scaler in javascript

13088641
vb6	vba
most of what you can learn about vb6 is completely applicable to vba particularly in regards to classes and udts which are kind of like structs in the .net world
start at the source -- msdn visual basic 6.0 when you search use vb6 rather than vba if you re not finding what you need for example google vb6 class inheritance -- from my own experience i would say that user-defined types declared using the type keyword are rarely useful except for private use within in a single module for the purpose of native function declarations which require a pointer to a certain structure

13088641
vb6	vba
start at the source -- msdn visual basic 6.0 when you search use vb6 rather than vba if you re not finding what you need for example google vb6 class inheritance -- from my own experience i would say that user-defined types declared using the type keyword are rarely useful except for private use within in a single module for the purpose of native function declarations which require a pointer to a certain structure
their fundamental drawback is that they cannot be cast to and from variant which is a killer for advanced vba

13088641
vbscript	vba
post script this will not help you when learning about classes or user defined types so i add this merely as a post script you can also find lots of good information by searching for vbscript
most vbscript can be pasted directly in to a vba project and it will run with small exceptions like not having access to the wscript object

13091795
spaces	delimiter
if the format of the data in that field is guaranteed to have comma delimiter before and after each value with no spaces then the position scalar would find it this is not very efficient though and is fragile
if there are spaces between the values and the commas or if the first value is not preceded by a comma or if the last value is not trailed by a comma it will fail

13095552
memcmp	strcmp
well you use strcmp because it knows how to deal with strings memcmp does not
memcmp is all about comparing byte sequences

13096722
quicksort	mergesort
further mergesort is also stable which means it preserves the order of equally valued elements so it s good for sorting first by this then by that where s quicksort is not
the biggest drawback to mergesort is that most implementations must be done with 2n space whereas quicksort can be done in-place in case space is a problem in your application

13097514
apache	nginx
nginx + mongrel nginx + passenger apache + mongrel apache + passenger there is phusion passenger standalone but that s really an nginx + passenger compiled together so i m not counting it although it may be a good option for some people. a larger site may then add specialized layer 7 hardware netscaler f5 ... in front of the servers
the easiest to set up for production will probably be apache and mod_rails passenger

13100042
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
if you look at the revision history of this answer you can find basic examples using nsurlconnection and asihttprequest although it should be noted that asihttprequest is no longer being maintained and should not be used for new projects
nsurlsession lets start with nsurlsession which was introduced in ios 7 and greatly improves the ease with which networking can be done in ios

13100786
mongodb	bson
on the other hand mongodb actually uses a bson document to specify a query an object
if you keep to the basic common sense rules i gave you above you should never have a problem with an attack vector like also mongodb only supports one operation per command atm without using eval don t ever do that though so that wouldn t work anyway.

13101512
ssl	https
the one thing to keep in mind is that all requests to the api must be made over ssl https not
instagram require that you always pass through https

13104225
g++	gcc
and here s how the gcc c one went when profiled and here s how the g++ one went when profiled
while i couldn t get the same results on my i5 m520 gcc ubuntu linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 4.6.3 i did see differences in the disassembled output

13106313
viewdidload	viewwillappear
since it is working the first time and not subsequent times i m guessing that you are displaying the camera view controller in the viewdidload method of the tab s view controller
move that code to viewwillappear and it should display every time that you go to the tab

13106409
rdf	owl
to get rid of the two errors you mention you should first of all define it to be an owl objectproperty rather than an rdf property and second of all the domains and ranges should point to not
but heed the advice in the comments don t write rdf xml syntax by hand

13106595
hex	binary
it is not sent in hex
it is sent in binary

13109411
mongodb	bson
here is how i solved the problem. unfortunately since mongodb none-rest api doesn t come with a strict or js mode for document retrieval as opposed to its rest api in which you could specify the format you wanna use to retrieve a document we are left with no option but to do the conversion manually
the awesome observation is that even with one extra step of json.dumps messagepack serializer is faster than bson encode not 3 times though

13110095
apache	nginx
the performance is quite good so far but i have not done any direct comparisons with an apache setup
memory usage is quite small nginx takes about 10mb memory and gunicorn about 150mb but it also servers more than one app

13110705
ssl	https
in applicationcontroller and then in your controllers this does not satisfy your second requirement of automatically choosing the https protocol on path helpers but that s not achievable with a controller-specified ssl enforcement since the route helpers don t care about what s happening on a controller level
that is actually mutually exclusive with controller-enforced ssl because if your routes specify https then they won t resolve a non-https url to a controller action which means that your force_ssl filter would never be hit

13111086
comparator	comparable
that means you need to write the comparator event method
there is no natural ordering for objects which do not implement comparable

13111342
thin	webrick
changing to another server such as thin which doesn t alter the headers would be the easiest fix there are other benefits with using thin over webrick as well
if you really need to keep using webrick you could look into patching webrick httpresponse

13111378
dictionary	map
i want to re-emphasize that the important thing here as ashwini chaudhary has already pointed out is that there is no reason to refer to variables via strings in this way because if you need to map strings to values you can simply use a dictionary - which is exactly what you re indirectly doing anyway if you use globals or locals since those functions each return dictionary
anyway as a postscript i mentioned that things don t quite work right if you modify the locals dictionary which is not meant to be modified as noted in the docs which remark note the contents of this dictionary should not be modified

13115263
scrypt	pbkdf2
use pbkdf2 if you cannot use either bcrypt or scrypt
see this answer for a comparison of pbkdf2 bcrypt and scrypt

13123733
webclient	webrequest
once you have that class substituted for your webclient instances it should work as normal you might have to set up the proxy in each case where you use it though
socks is not supported directly by the webrequest webresponse classes and by extension the webclient class it relies on webrequest to do its work

13123733
webclient	webrequest
socks is not supported directly by the webrequest webresponse classes and by extension the webclient class it relies on webrequest to do its work
it really can t as it works on the transport layer tcp ip and not through a simple redirect to a server that forwards http requests which is the level that the webrequest webresponse classes work on

13125572
dictionary	map
output with the data in the updated question willy 67.0 georgy 94.5 addi 60.0 lisy 52.0 willy 70.0 sums per person if that s not what you re looking for you want to sum multiple lines with the same name you could try the following dictionary based approach as you will see this combines the two lines for willy willy 137.0 georgy 94.5 addi 60.0 lisy 52.0
sums per line another slightly different version without fancy imports or map

13125905
sudo	passwd
you have configured sudo to ask for a passwd which it cannot do in a the post-commit hook
fix seems simple reconfigure sudo so it will not ask for a passwd in your case

13127057
cvs	svn
forget about cvs and file-level versioning welcome to subversion world where we operate with global repository-wide revisions use last-change-of-file revision as informational data not operational data
because you must operarate with revision of repository for any part of repository tree every stored set of changes commit add new revision to repository revisions forms history of changes of repository as integral object each revision is frozen slice of tree for you tree defined part my_repository file01 revision 105 my_repository file02 revision 110 my_repository file03 revision 125 my_repository folder01 file01 revision 100 you ll use remember and manipulate later with my_repository 125 url common path most recent revision and when and if you ll want to return to exactly this state you ll svn up your working copy for my_repository to revision 125 and all objects in tree below root will appear in the exactly the same state as it was initially

13128319
implements	extends
to implements this custom behavior you shouldn t add a textwatcher but build a custom adapter
you can still extends arrayadapter or simpleadapter

13129024
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome in an ipad has issues with clearing the cache even when using the option to clear the browser data
for now the best is not to use google-chrome and use safari instead

13129093
jar	war
file my-lib.tld you will also have to put the .tld file into the meta-inf directory of a jar file
the jar file with this taglibrary must be just a jar file included to your war file otherwise taglibraries will not be detected

13129270
boost	allocator
boost mutex was set for me which is why in my threaded tests i had no issue - i would guess that this will be set correctly for you also
but if not then you could have an issue because since the size of t is used to determine the type of the underlying pool each allocator for different types of the same size will share the same underlying pool

13131247
ilist	icollection
the sorted collection types in the .net framework the sortedlist tkey tvalue class sorteddictionary tkey tvalue class and sortedset t class all implement icollection t but not ilist t
i d say the icollection t interface is suitable for implementation by sorted collection types because a sorted collection can be enumerated added to removed from cleared and checked for its contents

13131665
implements	extends
4 yep and you should implements those methods in the class when extends your superclass
1 no if you implemnt them in your superclass its not required to implements them in your subclassing 2 if you dontimplement the methods in your superclass then you havetomake it abstract and then make your concrete subclassing implements those methods 3 yes but absolutely redundant as your superclass is already implementing thrm

13131979
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
otherwise is wouldn t work for flash in browsers which don t support html5 firefox one more important thing - look at this issue - google-chrome safari setsrc - play
it should be some timeout to show video properly in google-chrome

13132774
awt	swing
i would however suggest you discard awt and use swing components instead if for no other reason they re double buffered
you take a look through creating a gui with jfc swing performing custom painting 2d graphics you could also have a look at java bouncing ball the images are not loading for some examples

13137188
hex	binary
although i wouldn t consider mt_rand as one of those contexts especially as the lower bound is decimal and it s only the upper bound that s hex in your example
if your code is doing binary manipulations using hex values like this is a lot easier to understand in the context compared with decimal

13140252
google-chrome	firefox
doesn t change line-height in google-chrome while it changes on firefox
you can see a difference in google-chrome between 36px and 37px or between 38px and 39px but not between 37px and 38px

13141459
fgets	strncpy
this is incorrect as it is using buf in the event that fgets fails and is the probable cause of the output being a mess
it should be note that strncpy does not append a null terminator but may copy it from the source buffer to the destination buffer

13142366
qthread	qobject
it doesn t matter that it was called by a qthread
the correct way to execute code on another thread is to first move a qobject instance to a qthread using qobject movetothread and then connect the started signal of the qthread to the slot of the qobject instance that you want executed

13143005
octal	decimal	octal	hex
an int value isn t in octal or any other base - it s just an integer
the number ten is the number ten whether that s exressed as 10 in decimal a in hex or 12 in octal

13143595
decoder	encoder
i used the following binary to get libpng and libjpeg installed systemwide on osx libpng libjpeg for osx because i already had pil installed via pip on a virtualenv i ran pip uninstall pil pip install pil --upgrade this resolved the decoder jpeg not available error for me
update if encountering the error encoder jpeg not available you may need to install libjpeg

13143884
octal	decimal
if wish to convert an integer into it s octal string representation you could simply use the following method and if you truly want to return an int that represents that octal string parsed as if it was decimal you could simply do this
since your method accepts an integer commonly represented in a string representation as decimal and what you re outputting is also an integer you ve not really turned into an octal integer you ve changed it into some other integer completely

13143884
octal	decimal
since your method accepts an integer commonly represented in a string representation as decimal and what you re outputting is also an integer you ve not really turned into an octal integer you ve changed it into some other integer completely
you re trying to correctly convert your integer into an octal and then incorrectly interpreting that octal as a decimal

13144439
factors	mean
for example if it were logarithmic it should take around 180 iterations to reach 1e181 give or take some fairly small constant factors
that s clearly not the case here at all -- as is easily visible by looking at the exponents of the results in scientific notation this is approximately doubling the number of digits every iteration where logarithmic would mean it was roughly adding one digit every iteration

13144950
equals	compareto
you should define your compareto consistent with equals from java doc of sortedset check the highlighted part
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface

13144950
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equal

13146156
cpython	pypy
unfortunately it requires cpython 2.4-2.7
it doesn t work with cpython 3.x pypy jython etc

13146156
cpython	pypy
it doesn t work with cpython 3.x pypy jython etc
again from the docs rubypython has been tested with the c-based python interpreter cpython versions 2.4 through 2.7

13148096
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
use webm for google-chrome firefox and opera + wav for firefox ie safari and opera
html js to explain javascript find out users browser and if it is google-chrome it serves webm and if it is not than it use wav note using this code you need only both webm and wav audio with same name in audio folder

13148266
multiplying	addition
so you can accumulate rotations by multiplying unit quaterions
addition in this case isn t as useful

13148715
octal	decimal
there is no such thing as an octal number per se
an int isn t decimal or roman numerals or octal - it s just a number

13150759
google-chrome	firefox
however google-chrome seems to just ignore these bits and assume that both h.264 and vp8 video are using bt.709 color primaries even for vp8 sd video which the vp8 spec says should be bt.601 although it will convert that to the color profile of your monitor
firefox on the other hand seems to skip the output conversion for vp8 video elements and just assumes that your monitor is srgb so the colors are not consistent between monitors with different color profiles and are likely to be way off on a wide gamut monitor

13151385
octal	decimal
for further reading on this back to your problem with jsch the decimal integer 775 s octal representation is 0o1407 my suspicion is that the decimal 775 is actually sent instead of the octal 775 and filezilla may very well be truncating the stuff to the left of the 3rd least significant digit of 0o1407 because it s not unreasonable for it to assume there s nothing past the 3rd least significant bit now 509 is the decimal representation of octal 775 try using that with jsch instead
the file permissions code in unix 777 for example are octal not decimal

13151385
octal	decimal
the file permissions code in unix 777 for example are octal not decimal
as in when you do something like chmod -r 777 the digits are interpreted as octal input instead of decimal input

13154077
thin	unicorn
for example to implement rolling restarts in mongrel and thin you need quite a lot of steps in your deployment scripts
unicorn doesn t require as many steps but still significantly

13154422
uiview	subviews
i had subclassed uiview added it inside uiscrollview and the gesture recognizers of my subclassed uiview s subviews were not firing - except for the ones that were initially visible as before any scrolling
the simple fix was to add the uiview s subviews directly to the uiscrollview instead of my subclassed uiview

13155162
udp	tcp
whether or not the datagrams that your udp receiver is expecting will correspond with what you get by receiving on a tcp stream only you can tell but you need to be aware that it is highly problematic
there is no such thing as a tcp packet and therefore no way of receiving one

13157395
ienumerable	icollection
an icollection is an ienumerable with easy access to things like add remove and count
an ienumerable is anything that can be enumerated even if the list of those things doesn t exist until you enumerate it

13158626
voip	sip
so to initiate sip calls you ll need your own native library and integrate the wp8 voip api on top of that
the voip api doesn t come with any specific communication apis it s merely a api for integrating into the phone service for getting incoming calls while the application is not running and running calls while the application is in the background

13161328
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
you are trying to display jpopupmenu pop relatively to the jmenuitem menu1 component
but jmenuitem is not visible in the moment when you call popupmenu show method and it fails to determine jmenuitem location on screen ofcourse it is not shown on the screen yet

13163438
client-side	server-side
even if you use the crypted trusting message there is no guarantee that message is even legitimate when coming from the client-side
you should always validate on the client-side so the user will not have to wait for the server response to be informed something is incorrect in the form just submitted. you must always validate any input from the client on the server-side

13167062
client-side	server-side
even that is not entirely temper proof though as anything client-side
checking the http referer server-side is an option as well but is easily subverted as well by anybody who really wants to

13167695
thin	webrick
the simplest way to stop this would be to switch to another server that doesn t add its own logging such as thin
if you want to continue using webrick you ll need to find a way to pass options to it from your sinatra app

13168005
rdf	owl
as owl files are rdf any rdf triplestore will do for storing them - though not every triple store will support owl reasoning but then again you might not even need that
some popular open source choices for rdf storage querying are openrdf sesame apache jena openlink virtuoso redland 4store and dotnetrdf

13168242
ienumerable	icollection
if you want to have sure some side-effect gets called on elements of your ienumerable use foreach even then i d consider caching the result of the linq expression in a field or a variable if you need objects you know are initialised the reason for this is that an ienumerable isn t guaranteed to return the same items every time it s enumerated
obviously it will if the underlying type is a collection but if you know it is you should use icollection instead of ienumerable to express this

13169427
implements	extends
if you re using a custom playercontroller alternatively if you want more than just the player s pawn locked to the x axis say you wanted enemies locked to the x axis too you could implements it in one or more subclasses of pawn depending on what you re trying to do however you may run into problems with this approach since the player can still turn and his velocity and acceleration vectors may not point strictly along the x axis
you could try disabling turning by extends the playerinput class and always setting aturn to zero in the playerinput event

13170233
ubuntu	debian
the trick is to modify the nunit-console which on ubuntu 10.04 using badgerports looks like usr bin cli usr lib nunit nunit-console.exe to tell usr bin cli to use .net 4
so when i do this command i get this output nunit version 2.5.10.0 ... runtime environment - os version unix 2.6.32.44 clr version 4.0.30319.1 2.10.8.1 debian 2.10.8.1-1 dhx1 lucid1 processmodel default domainusage single execution runtime default .. tests run 2 errors 0 failures 0 inconclusive 0 time 0.040103 seconds not run 0 invalid 0 ignored 0 skipped 0 if you are only ever going to use net 4 you could edit usr bin nunit-console to always set this

13173779
rdf	owl
owl full syntax is rdf
the structural specification of owl does not even contain any rdf triple

13173779
rdf	owl
the structural specification of owl does not even contain any rdf triple
now in owl dl it is invalid to relate two classes with an object property

13174325
des	aes
please refer to the wiki. aes is based on a design principle known as a substitution-permutation network and is fast in both software and hardware. 6 unlike its predecessor des aes does not use a feistel network
aes is a variant of rijndael which has a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128 192 or 256 bits

13178890
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you come back to the view if it is already loaded say by popping a view from a navigation controller or dismissing a modal view controller viewdidload will not be called
thus if you want to change something background add a label change the background of a label etc. based on something that might have happened since the view controller was initialized you have to use viewwillappear

13178979
kerberos	ntlm
solution ie is using kerberos and not falling back on ntlm like google-chrome and firefox
you must force ntlm authentication in iis7.5 by following these steps select your site

13179098
trie	tree
if that is not acceptable use either a simple trie as explained by beni or y-fast trie
if you want something faster than o log n use van emde boas tree

13181261
dictionary	map
whatever required fields are defined in the form should be present in the data dictionary to instantiate it. it will not use data from instance to populate fields that are not provided in form data
text from django model forms if you re building a database-driven app chances are you ll have forms that map closely to django models

13181682
tiff	png
android s apis do not support tiff directly so you ll have to find a 3rd-party library
you might want to consider using png instead since that s supported by the apis directly

13183563
spaces	delimiter
you can really become disk bound and disk spaces bound so i ve found it helpful to change the path to be a comma delimiter list of directories one for each drive
of course with emr it doesn t make sense but nonetheless points to how you can really run out of disk spaces fast

13185604
spaces	delimiter
any tabs will be converted into 8 spaces if your file does contain tabs and you don t need to preserve empty lines then the following will work but it is slower
as long as you have a true csv and not a tab delimiter file then the following should work

13186525
flask	django
i m going to suggest an alternative that has not been mentioned flask
flask has a really great albeit smaller than django community and there are a lot of extensions available for common web-app extensions in the extensions directory

13186935
postgresql	mysql
edit the comments have identified that postgresql does not allow single-quote for column aliases which matches ansi
consider me surprised since mysql and sql server support it

13186944
super	implements
the class itself is not instantiated however it is used as the parent or super class for other derived class that are actually instantiated as objects
what you would then do is to derive new classes that would implements the eventmessage interface

13188611
google-chrome	firefox
or else google-chrome load them as 0px height which made container with default height of line-height value until they get the file
firefox isn t acting this way and waits for knowing the images size before creating the layout

13189698
ssl	https
so to sum-up the vulnerability requirements the preconditions for a tls or sslv3 connection to be vulnerable are 1 the server acknowledges and accepts full tls renegotiations in the middle of a connection and after the initial handshake and 2 the server assumes that both tls sessions were negotiated with the same client and 3 the server treats both sessions as one and merges them at the application layer that being said based on the requirements above a test against the server on port 443 shows that renegotiation is not allowed generic example of a vulnerable server protected server openssl s_client connect yourserver.com 443 r triggers renegotiation 2860 error 1409444c ssl routines ssl3_read_bytes tlsv1 alert no renegotiation . ssl s3_pkt.c 1053 ssl alert number 100 cheers
to understand the issue in a bit more detail here is some relevant information the official description the tls protocol and the ssl protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier as used in microsoft internet information services iis 7.0 mod_ssl in the apache http server 2.2.14 and earlier openssl before 0.9.8l gnutls 2.8.5 and earlier mozilla network security services nss 3.12.4 and earlier multiple cisco products and other products does not properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an existing connection which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert data into https sessions and possibly other types of sessions protected by tls or ssl by sending an unauthenticated request that is processed retroactively by a server in a post-renegotiation context related to a plaintext injection attack aka the project mogul issue

13192052
trie	tree
the leaf nodes do not contain the entire string usually though they can many time in a trie a leaf node just contains a sign to indicate this is the end of the string
to find the longest word in a trie you can use a bfs on the tree to first find the last leaf

13201310
ienumerable	ilist
if you are using .net 4.0 or greater you can change your ilist t to an ienumerable t and it will work
the ilist t interface s t parameter is not covariant and ienumerable t interface s t parameter is

13202743
backgrounding	multitasking
with these notifications you can tell if some backgrounding task completed or not but you can t tell how your app was terminated
backgrounding applications can be terminated at any time and there s no way for an app to tell whether it was terminated by the user through the multitasking switcher or by the system

13204743
profiling	debugging
i don t have pycuda installed so profiling your script failed as expected.
nsight eclipse edition currently do not support debugging pycuda applications

13204748
serializable	deserialization
unfortunately as there is no version in the original dto it s not serializable onto the wire so it never overrides the implicitly assigned version field
to get around this and keep the implicitly assigned version number in the constructor you need effectively reset the version that s used in deserialization

13208001
mp4	h.264
try transcoding the video specifying baseline profile as suggested in this stackoverflow question if your container is mp4 run ffmpeg -i yourfile.mp4 -c v libx264 -profile v baseline -level 1 yourfile_baselineprofile.mp4 if this works it s not a issue in your code you just have to use supported formats
probably your file is using an unsupported profile notice that official media formats page only lists baseline profile as supported for h.264 avc

13208058
postgresql	mysql
for example the postgresql and firebird drivers do that
on the other hand some drivers just return the last-generated key even if the table does not contain an identity column i believe mysql does not 100 sure though

13209088
bash	subshell
according to the bash manual here if a command is terminated by the control operator the shell executes the command asynchronously in a subshell
and since a process run in a subshell cannot modify the environment of the parent shell i guess what you are trying to do is only possible via temp files named pipes

13212098
uiview	calayer
see apple qa 1620 a view layer s mask is not tied to uiview so it will not receive the core animation transaction that is applied to the view s layer
we are modifying the calayer directly so we can t expect that uiview will have any idea of what we are trying to do so the uiview animation won t create the core animation transaction to include changes to our properties

13214030
force.com	salesforce
there are better analytics options for force.com sites not the least of them being the tag
you should also receive a monthly newsletter typically with 2-3 month s delay summarizing usage of your salesforce instance user adoption areas to explore etc

13214180
google-chrome	firefox
this won t work on google-chrome however as it does not use a separate control for the url window
it might work on firefox or ie

13214972
inline	inlining
the lldb in xcode 4.5.x doesn t have support for stepping over inline functions
the c++11 standard library has aggressive function inlining even when built at -o0 so this problem is especially obvious

13216183
d3.js	protovis
other frameworks include but are not limited to protovis i d use d3.js instead processing.js and countless others
i m not sure if you have any plans on making web-based visualization tools but if you do i d highly recommend using d3.js

13216990
istream	getline
when istream getline stops because it has extracted 20-1 characters it doesn t discard the new line delimiter because it was never read
so the next getline just reads the end of the first line discarding the new line

13217273
udp	tcp
tcp guarantees reliable transmission of data where udp doesn t
this means if they were to implement http over udp they would have to add the reliable transmission mechanism error checking in the application layer which is simply unnecessary

13217486
hex	binary
use a encoding schema e.g base64 hex string
just like others suggested it s not sense to convert a binary dll to string without encoding

13218955
allocator	stl
in general 2d arrays are not that efficient because they require a lot of allocator
instead you can use a faked 2d array here is a simple benchmark windows only except if you change the timer part compiled with msvc2010 release ox ot it outputs for me win7 x64 intel core i7 2600k you can see the stl is equivalent to raw pointers

13220442
cvs	svn
unlike other rcs and possibly cvs subversion doesn t automatically expand keywords
there are two parts to using keywords setting the svn keywords property in the file to the keywords you want to expand

13221933
hive	hdfs
dfs.replication shouldn t impact the run-time of your hive queries
it s a property exposed from hdfs-site.xml that determines how many hdfs nodes does a block of data get replicated to

13223214
jar	war
typically for a web application this means the jar s containing the classes need to be packaged into the web-inf lib directory of the war
with maven you should be using packaging type war not jar

13223214
jar	war
with maven you should be using packaging type war not jar
then the maven s war plugin will automatically package any dependencies into the war s lib folder

13224531
division	multiplication
it certainly does not require you to remember how to do long division
like multiplication we ll do it term by term

13228006
jboss	glassfish
jboss tried to solve this problem by introducing unified classloader which resulted in one big pile of assorted classes and leaks of resources between contexts webapps in default setting
disclaimer i do not have specific experience with glassfish but jboss and other strange environments sporting classloader hierarchies you have to be carefull with classloader hierarchies in java - the same bytecode equal class will not be equal or asignable to if comes from another classloader and while loading classes it is important to find dependencies through loading classloader or his parents

13228858
daemons	systemd
you can do the open before calling daemons but i wouldn t recommend the dup2 and subsequent close until after calling daemons
use the open systemd call to open the file then do this dup2 filefd 2

13230085
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i used to add my annotations to the map in viewdidload which worked fine in ios5 but with ios6 the pins do not drop they just appear
i ve now moved the code to viewdidappear and the pins now animate the drop from above

13231684
interpolation	splines
there is alglib that supports various flavours of interpolation polynomial interpolation rational interpolation splines interpolation least squares fitting linear nonlinear bilinear and bicubic splines interpolation fast rbf interpolation fitting i don t know whether it meets all of your requirements
i personally have not worked with this library yet but i believe cubic splines interpolation could be what you are looking for two times differentiable

13232160
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
by malloc i mean the whole subsystem related to the malloc function - malloc free realloc calloc and whatever special functions your libc might implement
malloc doesn t have to return memory to the operating system

13236146
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
there are many more experienced users of debian and debian derived variants like ubuntu and rh linuxen installations
i did find two postings to r-devel from persons using arch linux so that doesn t suggest widespread knowledge

13239024
mp3	wav
as result i couldn t find any solution to convert a mp3 file to mif
but i could convert wav file to mif

13239662
uicontrol	uigesturerecognizer
uicontrol for example exposes alltargets and allcontrolevents which is basically what you are looking for but it is unfortunately unavailable for uigesturerecognizer as a result i do not believe what you want is possible without using private methods
unfortunately neither uigesturerecognizer nor uitapgesturerecognizer exposes this information

13240686
tiff	png
returns an image for all supported image file formats png jpeg tiff etc. this explains why the first function can fail while the second succeeds
cgimagecreatewithpngdataprovider returns nil if the provided data is not in png format for example jpeg or tiff

13241777
innodb	myisam
myisam does not support foreign keys for storage engines other than innodb mysql server parses the foreign key syntax in create table statements but does not use or store it
so you have to drop all foreign keys in order to use myisam

13241886
noexcept	throw
there is a related defect report 2062 which is still open but it goes in the other direction so to speak namely that there is at least one noexcept that apparently should not be there for whatever the rationale of that is hellip
it may be that the intent is to support callables that have throw move constructors

13244241
interpolation	splines
an example in this case you re doing a bi-linear interpolation
the nearest kind of interpolation is not supported as all this does is a splines interpolation over a rectangular mesh

13245859
move	drag
therefore you do not need to update dragpoint to the last position on move
if you were just moving a shape image you were rendering onpaint you d have to do update the drag point each movement

13247601
memcpy	realloc
calling it twice for contraction and expansion or calling malloc-new memcpy free-old is very unlikely to be as efficient though as with all optimisations you should measure don t guess
keep in mind that realloc doesn t necessarily have to copy your memory at all

13247861
innodb	myisam
innodb implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while myisam implements table-level lock
innodb has transactions while myisam does not

13247861
innodb	myisam
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not

13247861
innodb	myisam
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

13247861
innodb	myisam
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not

union	distinct
one interpretation of it is that you want to union the two select column from table1 union select column from table2
if you really want all rows from both tables and not the distinct values union all will be faster than union

13251790
comparator	comparable
that said you may not even need your custom comparator class
the correct way is the trivial way in this case intwritable already implements the comparable interface the proper way

13253690
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for example the catch here is that you should edit httpd.conf or similar files as directive cannot be used in .htaccess
if you can t update .conf files and .htaccess is the only way around you would have to copy the shown rule in each directory s .htaccess i suppose

13255693
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
a similar approach would be to put the pixmap in a resources file then use style sheets to set it as the background of either the qgraphicsview or its viewport widget i think these have slightly different effects
this doesn t answer your question directly but it should solve your problem i suggest reimplementing qgraphicsscene drawbackground and drawing your pixmap there

13256504
udp	tcp
i implemented http on top of udp for use in the satellite tv broadcasting industry
of course it doesn t necessarily have to be transmitted over tcp

13258422
.htaccess	httpd.conf
when you put configuration directives in a .htaccess and you don t get the desired effect there are a number of things that may be going wrong
most commonly the problem is that allowoverride directive in httpd.conf file is not set such that your configuration directives are being honored

13258888
noexcept	throw
edit i wanted to add that noexcept can since c++11 also be used to declare an function not to throw any exception
this is pretty more comprehensible than throw

13259411
opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
when you hover over the image for the first time and then do not move your mouse in this jsbin which is the one i posted in my question to demonstrate the issue and like the first one has a straightforward hover selector the hover class is not applied in current google-chrome opera and ie
safari also doesn t apply it but interestingly it does if you go on to press a key on the keyboard. in firefox however the hover class is applied immediately

13259411
firefox	safari
safari also doesn t apply it but interestingly it does if you go on to press a key on the keyboard. in firefox however the hover class is applied immediately
since chrome and firefox were the only two i initially tested with i thought this was a bug in chrome

13259563
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
...will output this 1 2 3 you can also pass a comparator instance to a treeset constructor making it sort the elements in a different order. note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

13260168
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew
judging from the google searches the built-in libjpeg library in mac os x has the __cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart while if you use macports fink or maybe compile it yourself you get - _jpeg_resync_to_restart. in this case the devil library gotten through homebrew was searching for the symbol not coming from the mac os x library so i assumed that i should install libjpeg through homebrew
however it turns out that libjpeg was already installed through homebrew

13260745
boost	stl
in the boost iterator facade when the reference is not a real reference it will either use std input_iterator_tag or not provide an stl equivalent tag
it has to do with the fact that strictly speaking all forward bidirectional and random access stl iterators must use a real reference for their reference type

13261639
postgresql	greenplum
here s how it works with a postgresql file_fdw sql med foreign data wrapper the csv file contents are 20121229 2012-12-29 so you can see that postgresql will always accept iso dates for csv irrespective of datestyle
if greenplum doesn t please file a bug

13262680
textview	imageview
the contentview should be some viewgroup defined in your xml layout that contains the textview
the reason it does nothing is because you aren t grabbing an existing imageview and manipulating it by findviewbyid

13263866
uicollectionview	uitableview
i recommend to use uicollectionview and pstcollectionview or you can use the uitableview for this and with your own custom cell which it is not complicated
note uicollectionview is only available in ios 6.0 and later

13271138
jboss	glassfish
as vineet pointed out there is a jboss embedded container
however as long as you do not use as specific classes there should not be a problem when using the embedded glassfish container here is an easy example

13271581
entity-relationship	diagram
what oop calls subclasses goes by the name entity-relationship specialization in entity-relationship modeling circles
this tells you how to diagram subclasses but it doesn t tell you how to implement them

13273127
ubuntu	centos
i took the code from here reference centos 6 started to use upstart like ubuntu but only a few packages are converted to use it
i ve ran into this myself. the reason appears to be that the dkim-milter package on centos 6 is not using the new upstart init daemon yet whereas virtualmin assumes it should be an upstart job because it is detecting the os as centos 6

13274119
prepare	execute
the bindparam method just relates to prepare statements
on its own the query method tries to execute the given query immediately which fails because the parameters have not been substituted

13274397
google-chrome	firefox
here are the results | no eval | direct eval call | indirect eval call -----------------------+-----------+--------------------+--------------------- ie 9.0.8112.16421 | true | true | true firefox 16.0.2 | false | false | false google-chrome 22.0.1229.94 | true | false | true you can see ie and firefox are more consistent the objects are always equal on ie and never equal on firefox
in google-chrome however they re only equal if the function code does not contain a direct eval call

13275077
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient does not support cookies
you need to add support for cookies yourself overriding getwebrequest or simply use httpwebrequest class

13275752
union	distinct
two steps 1 to generate the sum you need to add it to the result set using union all
union adds a distinct operation which isn t required even if in your case it won t change the result

13276442
super	implements
the call to dict.__getitem__ self item would typically be written instead as super autovivification self .__getitem__ item at least in python 2.x
python 3 has better syntax. either way what this does is try letting the default dict behavior run but implements a fallback in case that doesn t work

13276564
tabcontrol	tabitem
however as noted here only that may not be enough if the first item is collapsed when the tabcontrol loads
this case had to be fixed in the tabcontrol itself because tests showed when the fake visility is set for the first time the tabitem does not have access to it s tabcontrol yet

13276564
tabcontrol	tabitem
this case had to be fixed in the tabcontrol itself because tests showed when the fake visility is set for the first time the tabitem does not have access to it s tabcontrol yet
because of that i also used a attached property for the tabcontrol which corrects this issue

13278476
multiplying	multiplication
it s absolutely not enough simply multiplying or divide real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers
you have to use multiplication and dividing formulas in that case i think google contains a lot entries about it

13280235
dbcontext	objectcontext
use objectcontext and compiledquery i m not aware of any way to use compiledquery with dbcontext and there also aren t any plans to make this work
reading between the lines it seems you want compiled queries with dbcontext

13282752
gdi	direct2d
some time ago i ve refused migrating rendering code from gdi to direct2d due to low performance
as i understand from google direct2d performance depends on driver and hardware optimizations and you shouldn t expect the same speed on different hardware

13282752
gdi	direct2d
gdi is pretty old and works equally almost everywhere
must say i ve tried to use it for drawing simple geometry primitives whereas direct2d seems to be much more robust library and maybe there could be performance boost on complex scenarios but this is not my case

13283083
strtol	atoi
implementation notes the atoi and atoi_l functions have been deprecated by strtol and strtol_l and should not be used in new code.
according to the atoi man page it has been deprecated by strtol

13284307
punctuation	words
also if the file is more complicated than a simple list of words for example if it contains punctuation characters that need to be preserved it might be worth using a regular expression to do the job
here is a hint len words returns the number of words on the current line not the length of any particular words

13284356
punctuation	words
to get rid of punctuation rather say
here s why say the first line in your file is hello my name is john then for the first iteration of the loop and you need to check what is inside each words thus for words in words also it might be worth noting that in your current method you do not pay any attention to punctuation

13284356
punctuation	words
here s why say the first line in your file is hello my name is john then for the first iteration of the loop and you need to check what is inside each words thus for words in words also it might be worth noting that in your current method you do not pay any attention to punctuation
note the first words in words above.

13285176
draggable	droppable
if you want only the one that is currently being dropped to not be droppable anymore then reset the draggable attribute upon successful drop
use a flag inside your draggable which would indicate whether it has already been dropped inside your dialog

13285515
strtol	getline
then you can use the older c function strtol c.push_back int std strtol a.c_str 0 10
you can use std getline with a custome line separator using the comma strip the last chars from the string the and use std stoi to convert to an integer edit using std accumulate edit 2 using std strtol instead of std stoi the function std stoi is new in the latest c++ standard c++11 and it not supported in all standard libraries yet

13290574
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in the past i have used two different ways to solve the issue create a custom sub-class of the uitabbarcontroller which forwarded rotation events to uiviewcontroller even if they were not the active tab
have the uiviewcontroller which needs to know about rotations use the nsnotificationcenter and register for the event uideviceorientationdidchangenotification which one i used really depended on how many of my tabs needed to track that information

13291206
innodb	myisam
against on any of the columns in the table you cannot change it to innodb
so according the comments i m sure your problem is caused by the myisam storage engine and its behavior on storing the data

13291920
direct3d	directx
the d3dx11.h file includes extensions to direct3d which aren t necessary to a graphics library but which can come in very handy when writing games or other graphics programs
for the directx headers but i think it should be the same for the lib the files include different things

13297388
primes	modulus
the condition is that some primes factor p of the modulus has to have the property that 2 n | p - 1
3 loss of information only happens when elements aren t multiplicatively invertible which isn t the case for the cyclic multiplicative group of a primes modulus

13297388
primes	modulus
3 loss of information only happens when elements aren t multiplicatively invertible which isn t the case for the cyclic multiplicative group of a primes modulus
if you work in a modular ring with a composite modulus some elements are not so invertible

13297427
awt	swing
as a general rule it is better not to mix old heavyweight awt with the newer lightweight swing components
awt components request the native system to perform its painting and often paint over any swing components that may be used in the application

13298670
postgresql	mysql
more info here so you should do to make sure you index everything properly mysql indexes columns left-to-right so if you have a multi-column index like this you can query this index on col1 col1 + col2 col1 + col2 + col3 col1 + col2 + col3 + col4 so you can query the left-most columns if you need anything else you ll have to create more indexes again that s only for mysql postgresql may work differently
for mysql mysql will be able to use the index foo_column bar_column to query for conditions on both columns and also for conditions on the left column only but not the right column

13300062
boost	stl
i ran into a similar issue with version 4.6.1 of g++ - boost version 1.47.0 the error is very vague does not point to any particular section of code
after a lot of efforts it was traced to addition of pragma pack 1 directive but not closed before declaring stl templates and or boost library data member templates

13303132
portrait	landscape
apple recommends that you set the width to device-width so that the scale is 1.0 in portrait orientation and the viewport is not resized when the user changes to landscape orientation. ie
the viewport retains portrait device width but is scaled or stretched for presentation to fit the landscape width personally i prefer the initial-scale 1.0 with no absolute device-width setting approach since it makes the viewport always fill the device screen without stretching

13305072
noexcept	throw
explanation the noexcept e expression gives false iff e contains a potentially evaluated call to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception-specification unless the call is a constant expression a potentially evaluated throw expression a potentially evaluated throwable form of dynamic_cast or typeid
note that the function template makeprval is not declared noexcept so the call needs to be a constant expression for the first bullet not to apply and this is what we abuse

13305072
noexcept	throw
note that the function template makeprval is not declared noexcept so the call needs to be a constant expression for the first bullet not to apply and this is what we abuse
we need the other bullets to not apply aswell but thanksfully both a throw and a throwable dynamic_cast or typeid aren t allowed in constant expressions aswell so this is fine

13307680
jar	war
when weblogic founds a service file there all other files are loaded from from jar files as espected
at least it behaves like this 6 create a weblogic.xml set to false structure of war file steps for ear file 1 pack your war file in an ear file 2 place a jaxws service finder class under app-inf classes you can use the existing class files from jaxws-rt.jar 3 place jaxws-rt all dependencies and xerces-2.9.1 and xalan-2.7.1 under app-inf lib 4 create an application.xml file 5 create an weblogic-application.xml file attention jars which are in ear file under app-inf lib should not be in war file under web-inf lib structure of ear file now deploy your ear file to weblogic

13311822
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
some collections assume that null is rejected using nullpointerexception rather than illegalargumentexception
for example if you compare a set containing null to a set that rejects null the first set will call containsall on the other and catch its nullpointerexception -- but not illegalargumentexception

13312050
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
for this implementation passing a null list does not produce nullpointerexception
it does however happen to produce an illegalargumentexception because nullpointertester happens to use a default string of

13313344
mef	prism
you could instead change the build output directory in each of the mef module projects to output the module binaries to the main project bin dir or subdir of bin
i m not familiar with prism but with plain old mef with .net 4.0 i construct a mef catalog of the mef module file paths usually from info found in the main project s config file

13313344
mef	prism
i m not familiar with prism but with plain old mef with .net 4.0 i construct a mef catalog of the mef module file paths usually from info found in the main project s config file
loading all dlls found in a directory is an invitation for trouble even though the main project doesn t reference the mef modules you can still get vs to build the mef modules when you build the main project by adding the mef modules to the project dependencies of the main project

13313452
google-chrome	firefox
from all i know google-chrome extensions don t have direct file system access other than by using an npapi plugin - so they cannot get a file from user s disk drive they can merely create a blob with some data
firefox extensions however have the file constructor that allows them to create a file object by path

13313832
bazaar	git
as git does not support mercurial bazaar status between two revisions neither fugitive can do it
git has git diff --name-status instead but simple grep reveals that this feature is never used in fugitive except for checking of some file being clean unmodified when doing gw and friends

13313832
bazaar	git
then status will be viewed with vcsstatus -r topic -r development mercurial don t remember how to do it in bazaar
i am unfamiliar with vcscommand though so can t say whether it offers as many interactive features in status buffer as fugitive or aurum do seems it does not in git status buffer shows nothing

13314907
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this code is likely dealing with problems that occur using a uitabbarcontroller within a uinavigationcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller documentation states that it needs to be the root view controller not within a uinavigationcontroller and using it in other ways can cause problems

13314907
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller documentation states that it needs to be the root view controller not within a uinavigationcontroller and using it in other ways can cause problems
what the code appears to be doing is capturing the event normally passed to viewcontroller checking if it is a uitabbarcontroller and if it is then it checks whether the visible view in the uitabbarcontroller responds to this method and if it does then it passes the method selector call on to that view

13315548
cpython	ironpython
note that this behaviour is specific to cpython
other implementations such as ironpython may not be so fast to close the file so you should really close your files when you are finished using them

13315565
entity-relationship	diagram
in entity-relationship modeling there is a concept entity-relationship generalization and a counterpart concept entity-relationship specialization that parallel the thought process i just presented above as superclass subclassing
entity-relationship specialization tells you how to diagram subclassing but it doesn t tell you how to implement them

13316380
postgresql	mysql
mysql sqlite postgresql and you should care about that if a user refreshes the page this does not count again using a cookie or storing the clients ip
ok seams you start learning so i will give you a hint in pseudo php code what you can do than you need to use a database like mysql or sqlite to store the value

13317604
listview	gridview
you can do it with a plain listview using addfooter but sadly gridview doesn t have this method
also you can t implement your own gridview because it uses a lot of private apis

13317628
postgresql	mysql
however this super-secure function cannot be inlined and may perform slower that a simpler alternative with hard-wired schema related answers with more options how to test my ad-hoc sql with parameters in postgresql query window passing user id to postgresql triggers
postgresql has no built-in way to define global variables like mysql or oracle

13319158
udp	tcp
that is just the way udp works
udp operates on messages not streams like tcp does

13319158
udp	tcp
udp operates on messages not streams like tcp does
there is a 1-to-1 relationship between sendto and recvfrom when using udp

13319765
allocator	stl
you ll want cudamalloc for allocator memory
for example now device_matches is just a plain c array not an stl vector

13322152
prepare	execute
finalize statement will work always with or without executing the prepare statement. so re-write it like
your id type is int. so the problem is with the query don t use quotes for integer values it s for string values. change the query to and there are alot of mistakes in your method like the prepare statement will always execute if the db is not opened

13322153
dbcontext	objectcontext
one of the new features with ef 5 is replacement of dbcontext with objectcontext
ok not replacement because you can still use the dbcontext

13322153
dbcontext	objectcontext
ok not replacement because you can still use the dbcontext
but microsoft wants objectcontext to be the new simpler way to access all your entities instead of dbcontext

13322274
multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for in the long multiplication method if you want to multiplying binary number 1001 by 1011 the procedure would look like 1 0 0 0 x 1 0 1 1 --------------- 1 0 0 0 step 1 1000 x lsb bit 0 of 1011 which is 1 followed by 0 shift to the left + 1 0 0 0 - step 2 1000 x bit 1 of 1011 which is again 1 followed by 1 shift to the left + 0 0 0 0 - - step 3 1000 x bit 2 of 1011 which is 0 followed by 2 shifts to the left + 1 0 0 0 - - - step 4 1000 x msb bit 3 of 1011 which is 1 again followed by 3 shifts to the left ---------------- 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 step 5 add all the above ---------------- now in shift and add method you do not do the addition step 5 in the end rather we keep adding the numbers on the fly as shown below the above algorithm should be more than enough for you to start coding i hope
i assume that you know the standard multiplication method by paper pencil aka long multiplication method binary shift add and long multiplication method method are very similar

13322541
daemons	systemd
and further a program terminates all its activity and exits when one of two things happens all the threads that are not daemons threads terminate
some thread invokes the exit method of class runtime or class systemd and the exit operation is not forbidden by the security manager

13322671
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
update interesting i m not getting anything with firefox or opera but i am with google-chrome
the below are google-chrome results

13322671
google-chrome	firefox
example live copy in my case using google-chrome i see the tag name of the most specific element the anchor if i click the link etc.
it seems like google-chrome is following the spec and taht firefox and opera are not

13322671
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this assertion is backed up if we use this css ...with this javascript live copy with all three browsers i tried google-chrome firefox opera the element gets a red background while the mouse is down and goes white again when i release it
but the mousedown handler doesn t see the active element in firefox or opera just google-chrome

13324421
multiplying	division
if you mean the modulo for integers simply use for floats use fmod math.h if you mean the percent operator you have to remember that taking x percent of something is the same as multiplying it with x 100 edit to answer your edited question that s not how a percentage operator works on any calculator i know
the percentage sign is just a division by 100

13325820
opera	firefox
it does not have support in ie or opera mini
css3 has a new filter attribute which will only work in webkit browsers supported in webkit browsers and in firefox

13328513
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome extension notifications obviously only work in google-chrome extensions don t require any special permission from the user support rich text notifications but disappear automatically and the user may not notice they have been triggered
w3c notifications work in many browsers see support on caniuse require user permission stack on top of the previous notification and don t automatically disappear in google-chrome they do in firefox

13329451
realloc	malloc
realloc changes the size of the allocation it doesn t grow the allocation by the size you specify
so you need to do you don t need to cast the return value of malloc or realloc in c

13329710
client-side	server-side
unless you explicitly intend to use an applet which i do not advise then the client-side of this is not really related to java
for the server-side you might have a servlet that generates the sound using javax.sound.sampled for concatenating pre-recorded parts for the letters and numbers

13331741
mp3	ogg
some things to be aware of you shouldn t use mp3 for html5 games
you will need to dual-encode all your sounds to both aac .m4a and ogg vorbis .ogg to ensure they can be played everywhere since there is no one format which can be played everywhere

13332096
tostring	string.format
as the intptr type doesn t implement iformattable the string.format method will just call the parameterless tostring method to turn the intptr value into a string
for the string.format method to use a format string for an argument the argument has to implement the iformattable interface

13332355
casting	autoboxing
will be compiled to this the problem is that because ob is an object array not an integer or int array you won t be able to do math operations without casting
this feature is called autoboxing

13332726
setcontentview	findviewbyid
your problem is here you cannot use findviewbyid until after you use setcontentview
move this line into oncreate after setcontentview

13332951
qthread	qobject
the canonical way of doing this is to create qobject qthread pairs or multiple qobject and a single qthread if you want multiple functions to run in the same thread. instead of subclassing qthread you subclass qobject create a qthread and move your qobject subclass instance to that thread with movetothread
the intended use of qthread is as an interface to the operating system s threading functionality not as a container that runs your code

13333839
udp	tcp
transport layer is where the decision to use tcp udp is made
among commonly used protocols in this layer tcp is reliable udp isn t

13335753
g++	gcc
instead link with to create a dt_rpath tag containing which means the dynamic linker will look for shared libs in the same dir as the executable or use -wl -rpath origin .. lib to look in .. lib if any parts of your program were built with g++ 4.7 then you need to use the libstdc++.so from gcc 4.7 at runtime
but if the problem is in libc.so.6 it s not a gcc issue and my advice would be do not try to bundle libc .

13336315
operands	scalar
this includes both cases like where the elements of the braced-init-list in the right operands are convertible to t for the above will replace the container s contents with 1 2 3 and when the braced-init-list can be implicitly-converted to the operator s argument type via a suitable constructor on the last line of main the braced-init-list will be implicitly-converted to a temporary a then the assignment operator of b will be called with that temporary as its argument
c++03 list initialization in c++03 you can only use list-initialization for aggregates c++03 dcl.init.aggr and scalar c++03 dcl.init 13 types list assignment you could not use list-assignment anywhere in c++03

13336756
serializable	deserialization
basically instances are serializable not classes
any static fields declared by the class are unaffected by serialization deserialization of an instance of the class

13337324
ubuntu	debian
the manual way will probably need you to first build all the other gstreamer packages have a close look on what . configure tells you i m workin on debian and have already built gstreamer+plugins to backport the recent ones to ubuntu although i m not sure if i did it in a best-practice way
edit i ll try to cover the basic steps for ubuntu here add the source repositories to apt check the source code checkbox in the ubuntu software center s software sources tool sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev devscripts sudo apt-get build-dep gst-plugins-ugly0.10 apt-get source gst-plugins-ugly0.10 change to the newly created gst-plugins-base folder dpkg-buildpackage and make sure it works change the source to your needs you can rebuild it any time using dpkg-buildpackage to simply see if it compiles make might be faster though

13338306
uiview	subviews
also your iteration loop assumes that all the uiview in your .subviews array are uiimageviews although fairly safe to assume this i would check to see if the uiview is a uiimageview with reflection
your problem states that your objects subviews eg the uiimageviews rects size are not initialising to your desired size position

13338493
uiview	subviews
what apple and solid would suggest is to subclass not the uitextview but the uiview
in your custom uicolortextview you will have member uitextview as subviews and your uicolortextview will be it s delegate

13340797
backgrounding	multitasking
wp8 doesn t support for multitaking for apps in the backgrounding
in wp8 a few additions were made to the wp multitasking story

13340945
opentype	woff
update the configuration for your web server with the following mime type per font file extension .ttf font truetype .otf font opentype .eot application vnd.ms-fontobject .woff application x-font-woff if you are using apache configuration you may include the addtype directive for each font type addtype application vnd.ms-fontobject eot addtype font truetype ttf addtype application x-font-woff woff addtype font opentype otf with a specific mime type configured per font and not the generic application octet-stream mime type you should no longer see a warning in your web browser console
this configuration while effective for cleaning up your console does not include the technically correct mime type for fonts like otf ttf and woff

13344275
strdup	malloc
strdup performs a hidden malloc call and you have not to forget to perform a free
this is contrary to all functions of the standard c library which never call malloc or actually that never appear to call malloc

13346376
rvm	bundler
if this command works you ve got a system version of rails that isn t being handled by rvm
btw this is why many rails devs are shifting from rvm toward rbenv + bundler

13348618
opera	google-chrome
so i added a check to make sure the window.navigator.vendor is google inc and not is opera software asa
also thanks to ring and adrien be for the heads up about google-chrome 33 not returning true anymore.

13348732
strcpy	malloc
strlen tells you how many characters are in the string not including the terminating nul but strcpy is going to copy the terminating nul character anyway
you re not requesting enough memory in the malloc call

13350346
freebsd	linux
like this i m still on it because i m porting a lot from linux to freebsd so maybe i find the final point
but my guess is it s not original freebsd source so the makefile syntax isn t too

13354629
jar	war
when you specify system scope it means that it is your responsibility to ensure that the jar is present when the war is deployed
you already have a framework to do that and you do not wish to encumber your build dependency with that jar but you have to make it available thro maven only during development

13360546
daemons	systemd
you probably need to either reboot the phone or manually launchd the daemons with launchctl load -w systemd library launchdaemons dmn.nouidaemon.plist check to make sure the file permissions and ownership of your dmn.nouidaemon.plist are the same as the other launchd daemons plists in systemd library launchdaemons
i m not sure if this is necessary but i think the name of the daemons the label and the name of the plist file are supposed to match the bundle id specified in your nouidaemon-info.plist file

13366686
coalesce	isnull
i ve been told that coalesce is less costly than isnull but research doesn t indicate that
isnull takes only two parameters the field being evaluated for null and the result you want if it is evaluated as null

13368153
sudo	passwd
what i did to make it run was sudo pkill apache2 sudo etc init.d apache2 start i would not recommend removing listen 80 from your apache config
i have had a similar issue where i used ssl keys with passwd

13368683
mongodb	bson
at the time of writing the version of mongodb on npmjs.org is v1.1.11 but the bson dependency has been updated in v1.2.0 which appears to be on the verge of being released see github
this is happening because the version of bson you re using checks for the existence of a window global to see whether or not it s running in node.js

13369167
innodb	myisam
it requires innodb tables and is able to take a hot backup of your primary mysql server without downtime or locks you shouldn t be using myisam anyway
it uses a modified innodb engine with innodb s crash recovery feature to ensure the backups are consistent

13371702
bash	subshell
almost every method bash provides of piping the output of one thing to another or capturing the output of a command has one side working in a subshell
here is one way you can do it without a temporary file but i ll warn you it s not pretty it s not portable to other shells and it requires at least bash 4 i ll break this down for you this creates a coprocess

13374740
hex	binary
if it helps think of it as being a bit like int - an int isn t in hex decimal or binary - it s just a number within a certain range
if you parse 1a as hex that gives an indistinguishable result from parsing 26 as decimal

13375551
inline	inlining
usually it helps but some compilers still may inline the function
so there is no reliable way to disable inlining that is not compiler-dependent

13375689
inline	inlining
this inlining applies to all functions even those not declared inline
-finline-functions as a part of o3 consider all functions for inlining even if they are not declared inline

13377106
google-chrome	firefox
the only reason it works in google-chrome is that google-chrome doesn t correctly implement
from the firefox error console when loading your site 02 31 52.279 downloadable font download failed font-family myriadpro-boldcond style normal weight normal stretch normal src index 1 bad uri or cross-site access not allowed source note that the site is at brinkley.doig.com.au but the font is being loaded from www.doig.com.au

13377114
aggregate-functions	sum
however if you do not have access to those functions this can be replicated using union all to unpivot and then an aggregate-functions with a case statement to pivot create table union all aggregate and case version see sql fiddle with demo the union all performs the unpivot of the data by transforming the columns paul john tim eric into separate rows
then you apply the aggregate-functions sum with the case statement to get the new columns for each color

13379192
ssl	https
they could add their own code and have full access to the dom making the ssl worthless
to be secure you need to load the entire page over https not just the html document

13382410
strncmp	strcmp
when you want to compare strings which are not terminated like in this case you need to use strncmp and tell it how many characters to compare 4 in this case
when you try to use strcmp to compare not null-terminated char arrays it can t tell how long the arrays are you can t tell the length of an array in c c++ just by looking at the array itself - you need to know the length it was allocated with

13382795
prepare	execute
check that the return value of prepare is in fact a pdostatement object and not false
sounds like the prepare failed hence you re attempting to call execute on an invalid object not a prepared statement object like you re expecting

13384230
vb.net	vb6
vb6 documentation vb.net documentation
you don t specify whether it s vb6 or vb.net but for once it doesn t matter much

13384233
ubuntu	debian
grab preview packages from directhex s ppa this way this will install 3.2.1 sudo add-apt-repository ppa directhex monoxide if you use ubuntu saucy 13.10 after adding the repository you need to edit the file etc apt sources.list.d directhex-monoxide-saucy.list and replace the word saucy with raring then after that this will also get you monodevelop 4.x if you had monodevelop installed before
note direchtex is not some random guy that created a ppa he s part of the debian ubuntu maintainer team of all the mono and mono-based packages

13385071
umbraco	dotnetnuke
i m not as familiar with umbraco but your requirements don t sound like there would be anything to exclude a general-purpose cms you may also want to investigate orchard
so far as dotnetnuke goes the ability to have multiple related sites is one of the core concepts

13385541
postgresql	mysql
don t do this to yourself set up postgresql in your development environment if you re going to deploy on top of postgresql and make sure you re using the same postgresql versions in both environments
your second mistake is related to your first mysql s like is usually case insensitive the following two statements illustrate that string comparisons are not case sensitive unless one of the operands is a binary string but postgresql s is case sensitive and provides ilike for case insensitive matching the key word ilike can be used instead of like to make the match case-insensitive according to the active locale

13385541
postgresql	mysql
your second mistake is related to your first mysql s like is usually case insensitive the following two statements illustrate that string comparisons are not case sensitive unless one of the operands is a binary string but postgresql s is case sensitive and provides ilike for case insensitive matching the key word ilike can be used instead of like to make the match case-insensitive according to the active locale
so you want to use with postgresql

13385546
implements	extends
due to checks in other code on your objects not implements an interface can cause a failure
however this is the advantage of interfaces as well your class doesn t need to extends from something to implement an interface so it can arbitrarily extends from any class but implement a particular interface that means it has some other functionality outside of the things it got from it s inheritance chain

13386036
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the reason very likely is that in viewdidload not all of the fancy animations have already been finished whereas in viewdidappear everything s done
in my case it happened when i triggered within a uinavigationcontroller item s viewdidload method

13386439
arp	tcp
basically this means that if something like a continues tcp connection is happening with a lot of successful acks then it assumes the ip mac pair it has is valid and doesn t bother doing a new arp request when the entry in the table would normally expire
from the arp 7 man page when there is no positive feedback for an existing mapping after some time see the proc interfaces below a neighbor cache entry is considered stale

13387321
rvm	bundler
it s as simple as gem uninstall bundler gem install bundler if you are using rvm there may be a little more to it than this you may have to switch to the global gemset first but not much
bundler is just a gem like any gem and there is no need to use bundler to install bundler regardless of what the instructions tell you

13387617
sudo	passwd
i suggest you approach this problem differently such as with different sudo configuration so it doesn t require a passwd from whichever account a suid binary wrapper or something similar
storing your root passwd in your java application is a terrible horrible no good very bad idea

13388300
udp	tcp
i recommend reading up on generic udp principles try implement very simple echo server in udp random good looking start point and only then pile up ssdp multicasting on it
the question is about general principle of tcp udp communication not as much about ssdp specifics

13388300
udp	tcp
the question is about general principle of tcp udp communication not as much about ssdp specifics
if controller as an udp network client opens a socket to a particular remote address doesn t matter whether multicast or unicast the local address is an applicable local network adapter address and some port number assigned by os

13388300
udp	tcp
to receive udp packets you must set up a server on your side
udp doesn t know if some packet is a response to some other packet as with tcp

13388300
udp	tcp
udp doesn t know if some packet is a response to some other packet as with tcp
udp is connectionless but you should already know that

13389335
ssl	https
passing the access token directly in a url param could in theory be possible but the auth sever would have to make sure the redirect uri is using https with tls encryption and a trusted ssl certificate typically from a certificate authority that is not free to be sure that the destination server is legitimate and that the http request is fully encrypted
having all developers purchase an ssl certificate and properly configure ssl on their domain would be a huge pain and would slow adoption down tremendously

13389469
implements	extends
implements interfaces is not inheritance which is when you extends a class
implements interfaces is used to declare that a class looks like something whereas extends classes is used to declare that a class is a something

13393310
eigen	ublas
also increasing n increase the speed difference here n 90 boost.ublas 0.47 s eigen 0.13 s
you benchmark is not fair because the ublas version solve inplace while the eigen version could be easily adjusted to do so compiling with g++-4.6 -o2 -dndebug i get on a 2.3ghz cpu boost.ublas 0.15 s 488184 eigen 0.08 s 488184 also make sure you compiled with optimization enabled and sse2 enabled if you are running a 32 bit system or 32 bits compilation chain

13397030
voip	sip
it s a pure sip implementation with no rtp or audio capabilities which means it s useless as far as a standalone voip client that you can use to make and receive calls with audio
in other words it can do the sip signalling side of things but without the audio capabilities that s not much good for a client side application

13397355
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient isn t the best way when you try to mimic a website behavior
use httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse instead

13402255
mp4	h.264
not all h.264 encoded mp4 files are supported by chrome and slight differences in the encoding process can produce videos that do not work
even if the exact same encoding settings were used h.264 is a variable bit-rate encoder so different videos may exceed bitrate limits

13402284
mp4	h.264
not all h.264 encoded mp4 files are supported by iphone or chrome for that matter and slight differences in the encoding process can produce videos that do not work
even if the exact same encoding settings were used h.264 is a variable bit-rate encoder so different videos may exceed bitrate limits causing some to work and other not

13402351
base	fractions
the 52 random bits give you 52 bit precision which in base 10 is about
according to wikipedia double-precision floating-point format the fractions part is 52 bits and we know that the number will be between 0 and 1 i think not including 1 so the exponent is -1 that leaves us with 52 random bits

13402930
gitolite	gitosis
gitosis or the more recent gitolite makes it easy to use a git server for users not really used to linux and ssh and not having their own access
if they re used to linux and they have to access the server for other reasons and everybody has his own public repository on the server and everybody just pull from other repositories and push to his own ones you don t really need gitosis

13403296
multiplying	multiplication
say you have one function template to multiplying two matrices and so a new compiled function inlined or not is generated for each size combination
then you have some algorithm that does a lot of matrix multiplication well each multiplication will have to jump to or execute inline the specialization for that size combination

13403848
backtracking	greedy
you ll get equivalent run time with divide and conquer dynamic programming greedy which just reduces to backtracking but these algorithms aren t suitable for this problem and would require contrived implementations
assuming you want a list of all possible combinations of a b c d e f that satisfy the specified condition you can t get more efficient than doing a brute force backtracking search

13405443
casting	autoboxing
no new objects are created in the system when you use explicit casting except in your last case where you cast a primitive type to an object wrapper since double is not an object like double is
note that this explicit cast isn t necessary due to java s autoboxing feature

13406535
opera	google-chrome
in opera 12.02 movie looks sort of bleached mixed with big amount of white
so imho that s not a cpecific bug of google-chrome

13406913
super	implements
maybe you should check to see if you forget to call super in your other methods
if you implements layoutsubviews in your custom cell and you accidentally forget to call the corresponding super method you will not see the separator line

13407535
awt	swing
if you need to modify swing components from threads other than the awt event dispatch thread use
swing is not thread-safe

13408860
fgets	fread
you should probably not be using the line-oriented fgets and fputs since you could get nul 0 characters in the output data on encryption and in the input data on decryption and newlines will be
use fread and fwrite

13409041
octal	decimal
in particular the fact that a leading 0 puts you in octal mode can catch you up
it stands for decimal base 10 not integer. you can use x to print in hexadecimal base 16 and o to print in octal base 8

13409143
direct3d	direct2d
direct3d or opengl which you can access via sdl if you want a more complete api that is cross-platform will give you the best performance on hardware that supports it
direct2d is in the same boat but is not available on windows xp

13409241
google-chrome	firefox
on my machine with no tel handler google-chrome simply does nothing ie9 says some content or files on this webpage require a program that you don t have installed
reasonable and firefox says firefox doesn t know how to open this address because the protocol tel isn t associated with any program

13411307
postgresql	mysql
sqlfiddle demos postgresql works fine sqlite3 works fine same query text but needed single-valued inserts due to apparent jdbc driver limitation mysql 5.5 fails two ways
mysql doesn t like a. rowid quoting even in ansi mode so i had to un-quote

13413608
udp	tcp
this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp
if however you are not willing to lose a single bit of your message then tcp was made for you because if you lost a package the protocol will request it again to have your complete message as complete as possible

13413767
nsis	uninstaller
the first 20 are general usage variables and the last ones have a dedicated usage in a nsis script
regarding the stack you can actually push ing and pop ing arbitrary values during the execution of an installer or uninstaller but it is in some way a high level stack as you can push not just numerical registers but also strings

13413780
inline	constexpr
so i expect you re bumping up against language boundary and the way that gcc has chosen to implement constexpr maybe attempting to generate the entire function inline then evaluating executing it
this may not be the definitive document regarding constexpr but it s the primary doc linked to from the gcc constexpr wiki

13416784
google-chrome	firefox
for example an iframe would request a favicon without showing it. worst yet in google-chrome and android an iframe will generate 3 requests for favicons get favicon.ico http 1.1 404 183 get apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png http 1.1 404 197 get apple-touch-icon.png http 1.1 404 189 the following uses data uri and can be used to avoid fake favicon requests for references see here the google-chrome bug behavior will probably be fixed in upcoming versions
here is the bug submission for you to vote update 1 from the comments jpic it looks like firefox 25 doesn t like the above syntax anymore

13417824
implements	extends
the attribute is not defined however you can implements it
extends textview and let s call it mytextview

13418229
config	ini
with your config class you can easily mix them together use global if not user defined and can also mix up storing formats global-config from db machine-config from registry user-config from file
in fact it doesn t matter which storing format you choose ini xml json whatever

13422588
ienumerable	iqueryable
from my understanding ienumerable does not transform the original query information that iqueryable holds
it s almost as if the cast freezes any changes to the iqueryable query at the point of casting

13424022
union	distinct
there are multiple solutions 1 split query and use union - possible sorting and pagination problems 2 add new property that will be used only for this filtering so instead of is_uni.value 1 or beta.product_id is not null you would be querying only feature_filter 1 3 decompose query into multiple queries - i would suggest this as first step since queries as big as this one are really great way to shoot yourself in the foot btw
using distinct on query with so many columns eats a lot of resources mysql needs to compare each column value

13427898
uiview	subviews
you can have a xib file with a uiview and then assign that to the cell s backgroundview property
if i add subviews those will have the whole cell as its parent not contentview this is not true

13431423
factors	matrix
the most confusion part of this trick is to make sure that you calculate the scaling factors with coordinates in the same transformation where absolute ones are convenient
after this you apply the scaling to the transform of the do not replace the whole matrix concatenate it with the actually applied one or append it to the transform list as new item but make sure that you do not insert it before existing item

13431837
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
windows filesystems tend to be case-insensitive while most other operating systems prefer case-sensitive filesystems
since you cannot necessarily predict what os your code will run on in the future it is recommended to always code for case-sensitive fileystems

13434627
jar	war
the problem i found is that when you have a war embedded within a jar the uris can end up being ones that do not work with the default jar uri handler trying to access the war file
there are a number of solutions that i found tell jetty to extract explode the war file into a temporary directory implement your own uri handler that was an interesting exercise but if you need to support the code yourself i would not recommend doing that make the war file an executable war file the same type of trick used by jenkins

13435297
profiling	instrumentation
i m not sure that it has been fixed in the 4.3 but this is a known problem in 4.2 seen here instrumentation there is a known issue with the profiling action from xcode 4.2
after a build in which no source files have changed instrumentation will be unable to gather symbols for the target application

13435297
profiling	instrumentation
set the configuration of the profiling action to debugging
run successive profiles directly from within instrumentation when you do not need to rebuild

13435297
profiling	instrumentation
run successive profiling directly from within instrumentation when you do not need to rebuild
when developing mac apps using the gc monitor template in instrumentation may cause instrumentation to crash

13435470
jruby	mri
the jruby implementation is an attempt to match it using xerces and nekohtml
i think they have done a wonderful job making the jruby implementation almost completely match the functionality if not the speed of its mri counterpart papering over the difference between the vastly different implementations

13436603
prepare	execute
also an sql statement can fail to prepare if you have no privileges on the table or if the table doesn t exist or you form the sql syntax wrong or any of some other reasons
an sql statement can also fail on execute if you give values that are illegal or an insert can fail if the disk is full or other reasons

13436919
innodb	myisam
this is true even in mysql with innodb see detailed explanation and demo in this answer at least in 5.5
if you re using myisam then correctness and reliability are clearly not big concerns for you

13437007
implements	extends
now take the abstract class java does not support multiple inheritance so deriving the benefits of multiple classes abstract or otherwise is not possible you cannot derive the full benefit of polymorphism from an abstract class based design only as interfaces to me are at the top of the polymorphism tree combining both gives you the best of both worlds in that an abstract class can implements an interface
an implementing class can extends your abstract class to derive the benefits of already implemented methods of the interface

13438215
equals	compareto
returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object. your implementation doesn t return -1 in case price of current object is less than price of object you compare with
you haven t implemented compareto correctly

13438361
inline	inlining
inline is a keyword of c++ but inlining is a generic process performed by a compiler backend usually after instruction sequences are already generated
a c compiler will also inline functions and a c++ compiler will inline functions that aren t inline

13438361
inline	inlining
a function that compiles to more than a kilobyte of code will usually not be inline
but a compiler may provide #pragma directives or platform-specific attributes to force inlining in such a case

13438361
inline	inlining
the biggest factor that would stop a function from being inline is if its source isn t available to the compiler at the time of code generation
link-time optimization opens the possibility of inlining functions that are extern and not inline but a function supplied by a dll is certainly off limits

13438410
inline	inlining
the only situation in which a function cannot be inline is if there is no definition for the function in the compilation unit
even that will not prevent link-time inlining by a link-time optimizer

13438689
equals	gethashcode
ideally implement as well as just overriding equals object . you ll then need to call tolist to get the results back as a if you want to get distinct people by some specific property but that s not a suitable candidate for natural equality you ll either need to use groupby like this or use the distinctby method from morelinq
distinct will give you distinct values - but unless you ve overridden equals gethashcode you ll just get distinct references

13439736
stateless	stateful
timers can be created for stateless session beans singleton session beans message-driven beans and 2.1 entity beans 94
timers cannot be created for stateful session beans 95 .

13442849
draggable	droppable
as someone else mentioned you got to rerun draggable on the newly created item but that doesn t work if you defined certain options in your draggable
also what didn t work was putting the in a function and then calling the function after creating a new element this trick does however work with resetting droppable - go figure

13443089
google-chrome	firefox
to animate just the backgroundpositiony as you re doing in google-chrome you can simply animate said property
as firefox does not support backgroundpositiony you can apply a css hook for browsers that do not support it tested in google-chrome firefox ie9

13443834
profiling	debugging
add-on tried push with my current ssh-settings for tortoisehg 2.6 xp sp3 x86 mercurial repo local repo hgrc private key loaded into pageant public key registered on sf in my profiling mercurial.ini relevant part note none of additional arguments for tortoiseplink and nothing more special was done screenshot of pure thg push with log output log of good plink+pageant session for sf-ssh
well i can work with pageant without being asked about password more one once my ssh line and running pageant with loaded private key putty-user-key-file will give me ability to communicate with repo without re-authentication note 1 keyring doesn t help in your case at all debugging pageant functionality with pure-ssh connection ssh or plink note 2 to start pageant with key only password needed you can use extended command-line pageant can automatically load one or more private keys when it starts up if you provide them on the pageant command line

13444423
serializable	deserialization
servicestack just uses .net s xml datacontractserializer under the hood and doesn t add any extra transformations or byte overheads it s just the raw dtos serializable as-is so if you can get it working outside of your services you can put the same dtos back into your service and it will also work over the wire
handy servicestack extension methods servicestack provides convenient extension methods to serialize de-serialize and analyze your data models serialization deserialization extension methods handy dump utils recursively print a object-graph in pretty jsv dump format t.printdump print a string to the console resolving string.format args if any string.print args what do your serializable dtos look like the first step you should be doing when trying to come up with the shape of the dtos is to populate and print them to see what it looks like

13444819
entity-relationship	diagram
it s useful to understand the data pretty well at the conceptal entity-relationship level before switching to the relational level
why doesn t catalogue appear on the diagram

13446074
selecteditem	selectedindex
your code above shows you are trying to set the value to -9 which does not exist and you are trying to set it with a string of -9 will fail unless the value is -9 and you use selecteditem
you should really be using selectedindex or selecteditem instead of selectedvalue

13446673
client-side	server-side
you possibly have two related problems you are using push state client-side using real urls not hash fragments such as app#overview but maybe have not enabled push state in backbone and your express configuration does not respond to those client-side routes
using push state urls you still have to handle those urls server-side since the user may visit your website using these direct client-side urls something that doesn t happen with hash fragments since the hash part is never sent to the server

13446673
client-side	server-side
using push state urls you still have to handle those urls server-side since the user may visit your website using these direct client-side urls something that doesn t happen with hash fragments since the hash part is never sent to the server
so to fix the server-side handling express allows using regular expressions as routes so instead of you could do see here so that no matter which app url is used as entry-point to your web app it gets served the necessary content

13448136
vmware	virtualbox
you can follow this article while installing vmware and wp8 sdk inside it
adding to mdumitru answer you should install virtualbox not vmware

13457195
udp	tcp
you can t rely on messages having a one-to-one mapping to packets to the application tcp not udp looks like a streaming protocol
an application which sends via tcp needs another way to separate messages

13459088
super	extends
it s not that i don t want to change populatecells but i don t want to call super and loop through the array and then do it again in the child
in case you want to be able to extends matrix in a way that you can do extra steps in populatecells you can simply move parts of that into methods that you can override

13460344
client-side	server-side
the op has only ever mentioned php functions and tagged this post with php so there is nothing leading towards client-side
true whilst client-side can and should be used where possible to alleviate processing from the server-side this should not be recommended for core structural tags like headings - which will be relied upon by screen readers and search engine bots

13460344
client-side	server-side
true whilst client-side can and should be used where possible to alleviate processing from the server-side this should not be recommended for core structural tags like headings - which will be relied upon by screen readers and search engine bots
at best client-side javascript should be used to enhance a user s experience

13460579
bash	zsh
here s what i did modified my .zshrc to work with bash ln -s .zshrc .bashrc added to my .vimrc file and now my vim command-line path is equal to my zsh shell path
i was not able to resolve this with zsh and ended up using bash for my vim shell

13460784
division	modulo
generally however sqrt should come at the same speed as division as the internal implementation of div and sqrt are very similar
sin and cosine otoh are calculated with polynomials of up to 10 degrees without any common coefficients and possibly a difficult modulo 2pi reduction -- that is the only common part shared in sincos when not using cordic

13461620
xrange	enumerate
also if you are using python 2.x xrange is generally better for these sorts of iterations as it does not load the entire list into memory but rather accesses it on an as-needed basis
not sure if this is what you re looking for but you can run enumerate on range and get the position in your iteration in this case index + 1 would represent the current point being created index itself would be the total number of points created at the beginning of a given iteration

13461884
innodb	myisam
consequently the associated data pages will load into the innodb buffer pool as well
you should not have to circumvent access to index pages using python perl php c++ or java because of the constant i o needed by myisam or the constant mvcc protocols being exercised by innodb

13462452
isotope	masonry
your need a closing normal quote and not a pipe like so i also don t think i don t think you need isotope to shuffle
the easist would be to reorder the tiles before feeding it to masonry

13462656
charat	indexof
in other words the difference in performance really does lie in accessing the array being slower than calling charat
it s not the huge difference however that you ll get from say using indexof instead of a regex for searching a string

13462870
prng	random
it s not guaranteed to provide a cryptographic prng so you ll have to checked the platforms you care about
libc++ uses dev urandom by default which is a crypto-prng on os x yarrow and linux which uses an entropy pool that can be depleted you may wish to tell random_device to use dev random instead

13464036
oncreate	setcontentview
the original oncreate method is inherited yes but that exact method isn t what this code does
this code wants the original method and it also needs to call setcontentview r.layout.main

13467547
setinterval	settimeout
so simply change setinterval to settimeout which does not repeat and only calls the function provided once
settimeout can emulate setinterval by calling a function that sets a new timeout recursively

client-side	server-side
assuming that the vast majority of your users have javascript enabled and you do not bother providing a great ux to those who don t too you could simplify things by providing detailed error messages involving highlighting of the erroneous fields in your client-side validation logic while just displaying a generic error message if something fails the server-side validation
however in case there are things you cannot properly validate on the client even though that s unlikely in case he has js enabled since you can then use ajax you should make sure that the server-side validation does show a proper error message so the user knows what s wrong

13470367
google-chrome	firefox
by default in google-chrome this is the content-type characters are then displayed incorrectly
when i switch to firefox ua the content-type is changed to this problem might lay hidden in the fact that google-chrome sends accept-encoding but as google-chrome displays it correctly with another ua this is most likely not the case

13471633
punctuation	words
note that the in-word hyphen and the apostrophe are not punctuation
they are part of the words

13472027
aggregate-functions	sum
you can join the table using a left join and apply an aggregate-functions sum to the price field see sql fiddle with demo the left join will allow for the records not in the second table to be included in the final result
i added the isnull to the sum to replace any null values with a zero

13472060
mongodb	bson
this is because mongodb querying does not take this sort of contextual querying into account
first off a hint don t store as number longs store as the bson type using only the lines you will get more functionality from using the specified bson date type and the querying ability is the same across the board

13478432
postgresql	mysql
edit with the help of a_horse_with_no_name the postgresql syntax also works for oracle and i think db2
i think postgresql has the most elegant solution sql fiddle example in sql-server 2008 and onward you can use values to build your tuples sql fiddle example or for a procedure you could create a key-value pair type and pass this as a parameter sql fiddle example for mysql i think you may have to just build this using and or example on sql fiddle my knowledge of other dbms is limited so if it is not one of the above sorry i can t be of more help

13481940
google-chrome	safari
in this case google-chrome does not give any helpful information about error
i ve tried to load same page in safari mac but windows should work as well and i got description that response for specified resource returns 302 redirect and html5 application cache cannot handle it

13482399
realloc	memmove
it is outright undefined behaviour to call realloc on a pointer that was not obtained with malloc etc
as daniel fischer points out it is also undefined behaviour to use memcpy on overlapping regions of memory in which case you should use memmove so you have to be careful

13483804
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if it s not set to all nor lists indexes that .htaccess line is going to get ignored
i ve already modified the httpd.conf file to remove the commented out rewrite mod mod_rewrite has nothing to do with this

13485675
g++	gcc
as per my comment the version of g++ i m using is slightly different 4.7.0
looking at the actual code for their array implementation gives this from constexpr gcc wiki we have that a constant expression is noexcept even if it involves a call to a constexpr function that isn t declared noexcept.

13485675
noexcept	throw
looking at the actual code for their array implementation gives this from constexpr gcc wiki we have that a constant expression is noexcept even if it involves a call to a constexpr function that isn t declared noexcept.
thus it looks like someone has erroneously labelled at as constexpr even though it can throw

13488256
pbkdf2	md5	scrypt	md5
see here for more and here criticizes sha family md5 etc for password hashing purposes and here criticizes bcrypt and recommends scrypt and pbkdf2
in addition to bcrypt and pbkdf2 mentioned in other answers i would recommend looking at scrypt md5 and sha-1 are not recommended as they are relatively fast thus using rent per hour distributed computing ec2 or a modern high end gpu one can crack passwords using brute force dictionary attacks in relatively low costs and reasonable time

13491502
comparator	comparable
eg collections.sort list l comparator c - comparator is also very useful when we want to sort an object on basis of more than on one of its attribute
- your class doesn t need to implement comparable but instead custom java.util.comparator

13492511
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work they did not make height compatible try google-chrome instead
latest firefox today

13492519
ubuntu	debian
i just tested it on our esxi 5 system with debian squeeze and one with ubuntu precise server
on squeeze ruby-1.9.3-p194 has to be compiled and on ubuntu not

13493650
interpolation	splines
clearly your cubic splines is not interpolation through the points whereas the splrep result does and is perfectly satisfactory in that sense
note also that your cubicspline is actually just a single polynomial rather than a splines which are polynomials with breakpoints

13496373
svg	vml
for example to create a rectangle with an id and a working fiddle to see it in action note that raphael may not always use svg
in older versions of ie it will use vml so node will likely refer to a vml element not an svg element

13496434
division	modulo
second your algorithm is trial division not the sieve of eratosthenes and will have time complexity o n 2 instead of o n log log n
the modulo gives the game away

13498197
implements	extends
here is a fixed version of the code with the above implements after button pressed update also for a more reusable layout why not add all components to a jpanel and add that jpanel to the jframe thus if you ever need to add more stuff its simple
a few things to note never extends jframe class unnecessarily or else you might need to extends another class which is very necessary but in java a single class may not extends more than one other class no multiple inheritance

13498848
oncreate	onstart
either use or move the code into oncreate
you are running this in onstart which means that this.getbasecontext will return null as a context is not created until oncreate

13500284
opera	safari
opera this document had an invalid xslt stylesheet
error message from the xslt engine error invalid xml output unexpected start-tag root element already specified the message from safari is especially good -- it confirms that the issue is not in performing the transformation but it is with the generated result

13501360
rsa	aes
rsa is not intended for bulk data encryption
instead use a symmetric cipher like aes to encrypt your large string

13502944
innodb	myisam
innodb tables are much more resistant and can usually be recovered in read-only mode in a typical worst-case scenario if not repaired and restored automatically for you
the simple reason for myisam being faster is it doesn t keep a journal and doesn t need to handle mvcc

13505549
trie	tree
a simple trie is also a tree
there are trie-like structures that aren t tree

13508574
postgresql	mysql
edit as per below comment this is not valid postgresql
this is how it would be done in mysql i just assumed it s standard.

13509171
gunicorn	uwsgi
that is a problem in itself though as gunicorn alone is not a good option for serving static media assets so almost forced with heroku to serve static assests elsewhere
if you want to go the nginx route the best choices are nginx - gunicorn nginx - uwsgi running python wsgi applications on top of fastcgi is not generally as good an experience due to issues with the fastcgi wsgi adapters and how they are deployed with servers

13509621
h.264	webm
a browser claiming to support html5 video additionally has to support the used codecs some support h.264 other support vp8 webm a few support both
streaming formats live video can t be streamed as a progressive http download at least not without some hacks of the common container formats like .mp4 used primarily for h.264 and not to be confused with the mpeg-4 video codec or mkv webm is basically vp8 video in a mkv container

13509915
postorder	inorder
if you have a fully parenthesized inorder expression then you have a uniqe tree and you get pre- and postorder by constructing the tree and then constructing the pre- and postorder terms from the tree
if your expression is not fully parenthesized then this is an indication that there is no difference between the different trees that match your inorder

13509915
postorder	inorder
this however means it does not matter which pre- or postorder you use also ++xyz and +x+yz are the same
now if this doesn t matter you do not need to worry about several posssible representations of your inorder

13510102
prepare	execute
sql prepare statements prepare execute deallocate prepare can be used in stored procedures but not stored functions or triggers
thus stored functions and triggers cannot use dynamic sql where you construct statements as strings and then execute them

13510669
istream	getline
define an istream operator for your types and use these directly there s no need fiddling with an std istream_iterator or directly manipulating the stream buffer
then do not use std getline at all

13513206
floating-point	fractions
binary floating-point number cannot represent exactly 1 proof that it can can be found here
most accurate representation 1.0e0 there could be problems with fractions numbers that would have infinite fractions digits in radix of 2 numbers that are too small to exactly represent without losing precision numbers that are too large to represent without losing precision

13513940
spaces	delimiter
update 2 added an example splitbyindexalt not using splitstring but tstringlist.delimitedtext . this will treat spaces and
as delimiter not the ones enclosed by quotechar

13514755
onclick	onchange
it is however possible to trigger the onclick event in the onchange event
the onclick approach is not entirely bad but as said it will not be triggered when the value isn t changed by a mouse-click

13514999
octal	decimal
the reason why given the commands only the second line prints a match is that perl supports octal numeric literals
as you figured out your shell is eating the quotes so you re actually executing the statements any numeric literal an unquoted number that begins with a zero that isn t immediately followed by a decimal point is treated as an octal number

13516794
scikit-learn	nltk
i wrote both dictvectorizer and the nltk wrapper for scikit-learn
the nltk wrapper for scikit-learn doesn t know about multilabel classification and it shouldn t because it doesn t implement multiclassifieri

13517576
wordpress	expressionengine
that being said wordpress is great but if you re going to seriously alter the purpose for which it exists which it sounds like you are building management modules completely outside of wordpress then i m not sure how wordpress would actually help
although more detail on what you re trying to accomplish would be nice i would personally recommend expressionengine

13517805
equals	compareto
finally its is highly recomended but not mandatory to implement equals
i am not satisified with the other answers you should not check for null in compareto

13519801
factors	matrix
a short benchmark thus apply outperforms matrix multiplication by a factors of 15
just for comparision matlab needed 0.10719 seconds. the results do not really surprise as the apply -version can be done in o n 2 while the matrix multiplication will need approx

13520238
implements	extends
also it s better to extends mouseadapter if you don t need to implements all methods
i would suggest you not to implements listener in the class itself

13521522
linefeed	delimiter
it s not always a linefeed
the easiest way to handle them is with the applescript command paragraphs rather than using the delimiter when reading the file

13522918
inline	inlining
if a class method or for that matter any function has to be put in a header file which is going to be included by several .cpp files then it has to be inline
this inline does not necessarily mean the usual macro style inlining

13522918
inline	inlining
this inline does not necessarily mean the usual macro style inlining
the macro style inlining is decided by compiler and the programmer doesn t have much control over it

13523302
google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
- google-chrome webkit engine shows it in am pm
- firefox gecko engine doesn t show anything but validates

13526466
punctuation	words
for - this line - has words separated by and - now you would need to find all the punctuation used in your sentence
one thing which you can do is use a regex to match a pattern for words only if you are not sure about what all punctuation are used in your line

13526466
punctuation	words
one thing which you can do is use a regex to match a pattern for words only if you are not sure about what all punctuation are used in your line
and add each matched words to an arraylist

13526974
client-side	server-side
the part of the file path which means application root isn t recognised client-side
you have two options - generate the element server-side and populate the href attribute there where is recognised using page.resolveurl or alternatively construct an appropriate relative path that doesn t include the tilde which is probably more efficient

13528694
profiling	debugging
i have had the profiling complaining about uuid mismatch and i have had the infamous entitlements do not match error see more on that here
here is what i did to enable profiling without switching to debugging mode

13529161
factors	matrix
however that s only a constant overhead factors possibly quite big though something in the order of 100
however interestingly the nested-list approach to matrix is not quite as bad as it may seem lists remain the data structure that s most naturally dealt with in a traditional purely-functional manner

13529246
profiling	debugging
profiling the debugging configuration will not give you correct profiling values
the debugging configuration is not compiled for speed and all your nslog statements are still in

13529680
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you could implement it as category on nsmutablestring and if your question is can i write a method xtrim such that replaces the receiver theexamplestring with a new instance no that is not possible
you cannot do that in a category on nsstring because nsstring manages immutable strings which means that the string can not be changed after it has been created

13530287
multiplying	division
you can cast to float better double or multiplying with 100.0 for double precision 100.0f for float precision first or since floating point arithmetic is not associative the results of and may be slightly different the same holds for float but it s extremely unlikely to influence the first two places after the decimal point so it probably doesn t matter which way you choose
integer division truncates so 50 100 results in 0

13532377
implements	extends
for browsers implements the object.defineproperty method the code below generates and returns a function that you can bind to any object you own
this approach has the advantage of not extends object.prototype

13534971
ubuntu	linux
if you re using gdm which you probably are if you re using ubuntu you want to use gnome-session-quit --power-off if you re using kdm the command is kdmctl shutdown other ways of shutting down the computer which may or may not be mostly or completely equivalent but all require superuser rights include sbin init 0 sbin halt sbin shutdown -h now sbin poweroff etc etc
there are very many ways to turn off a linux system

13541241
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
from the javadoc note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

13541711
memmove	malloc
note that you can use memmove to perform the copy instead of the for-loop
also note that the cast of the return value of malloc is not required and should be avoided

13543556
.htaccess	httpd.conf
open config.php set config base_url still in config.php set config index_page create .htaccess on the same directory with your index.php in my case htdocs yourdirectoryname the content of that .htaccess is as above
i have no experience on zendserver but tonight i also got this problem on localhost using xampp without zendserver and finally got it worked check your httpd.conf and make sure loadmodule rewrite_module modules mod_rewrite.so line is not commented

13546387
ssl	https
to allow a single path your index file from this virtual host but require everything else to be served by the ssl protected one you can use mod_rewrite the first rule tells apache not to perform any redirect if the path is exactly like your root path
the second redirects everything else to https which will be handled by your virtual host

13551056
apache-poi	docx4j
if you do not feel like using docx4java or it does not fit your needs you can try these apache-poi open office api
docx4j is a library for creating and manipulating .docx pptx and excel files

13555107
implements	extends
6 use keybindings instead of keylistener 7 use mouseadapter instead of mouselistener 8 do not extends thread class rather implements runnable and create start method to start thread in runnable class i have not implements this in below code 9 not a good idea to do long running tasks like load images or do any other work besides the necessaries for painting objects in paint method you should load picture etc on class initialization or at least outside of a components paint methods
i have not implements this in below code 10 your biggest problem about lines not being drawing correctly was g.drawline x1 x2 y1 y2

13556572
clang	llvm
the llvm clang trunk is always in flux and sometimes you may catch it not fully functional especially on windows which is not a 1st-order concern for most llvm developers
if you don t terribly care about the newest llvm possible i suggest you download and build the 3.1 release which should work on all platforms

13557296
flask	django
again there are packages for flask that provide you with the same functionality but because they cannot make the same assumptions that django can make due to everything fitting together so nicely they will be a little bit harder to get running
if you choose django mongodb is out

13566668
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
if we look at the cpython source code we can see that the object is deallocated immediately and _py_dealloc is defined as so as you can see the tp_dealloc slot which has the responsibility to free the memory is called directly
other implementations like pypy ironpython or jython may not free the memory immediatly this could lead to a termporary increase in the memory usage

13566668
jython	pypy
other implementations like pypy ironpython or jython may not free the memory immediatly this could lead to a termporary increase in the memory usage
in particular i believe in jython everything depends on the java garbage collector which is not guaranteed to free the memory as soon as it can

13566810
cdr	cons
it s perfectly valid if the cdr part of a cons cell is not a list for example when building an association list
the second argument to cons is not necessarily a list

13567121
profiling	debugging
alternatively if you want to do this for debugging purposes it s not the worst idea to use a profiling tool for this
for example valgrind s callgrind emphasis mine callgrind is a profiling tool that records the call history among functions in a program s run as a call-graph

13571222
rsa	aes	rsa	3des
you can encrypt the file using 3des or aes and then encrypt the aes key using intended recipient s rsa public key
you can t encrypt and decrypt whole files with just rsa at least not if they have more then just a small string

13575105
innodb	myisam
innodb does
afaik some engines myisam for example do not support transactions

13575212
setinterval	settimeout
first i have to admit that atk4 had no setinterval and clearinterval functions added in univ library but already had settimeout
i added setinterval and clearinterval and made pull request in github i hope romans will accept that but if not then you can always add these functions in your own js library

13576057
super	extends
edit 2 edit 3 next we ll discuss why it s usually not necessary and in fact often not a good idea to create classes that extends jframe or other components unless you are overriding some of the methods of the super class.
it s not an error it s a warning and it comes from your extends a serializable class one of the gui components that your class is extends and not giving it final serialversionuid field as the serializable interface contract stipulates

13578767
cashapelayer	calayer
so first let s write a calayer subclass that s like cashapelayer but just draws an arrow
i originally tried making it a subclass of cashapelayer but i could not get core animation to properly animate it

13582238
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
basically there are two ways to set its tintcolor the easier option would be to use the appearance protocol ios 5 and later as this will change every navigationbar in the whole app or you do it on every single uinavigationbar of every uinavigationcontroller
you are not talking about a uitableview but about the uinavigationbar on the top

13585252
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
in c you can only free the memory which is allocated by malloc calloc or realloc . so freeing the memory other than that is undefined behaviour i your case it s not clear that what is
and whether it is allocated by the malloc calloc or realloc

13585357
strdup	strncpy
i suspect strdup is actually the most appropriate for what you are doing you seem to want to allocate new memory for the duplicated string
strcpy and strncpy do not allocate new memory

13585357
strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc	strncpy	malloc
strcpy and strncpy do not allocate new memory
strdup returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory exactly as malloc does and strcpy and strcpy take char arguments and do not allocate memory

13586805
realloc	strcpy
when you try to realloc b you are feeding it that address which was not initially allocated by malloc
what you want to do is copy the string from a to b strcpy b a

13588353
super	self
there is no problem referring to mymodelresource in the super call super mymodelresource self .mymethod before mymodelresource is defined because name lookups are performed at run time not at the time mymethod is defined
you are absolutely correct that super self.__class_ self .mymethod is wrong

13590026
debian	linux
debian uses a modified bash which does not do this when invoked as sh.
i guess if you run mount than you need root privileges so maybe this is your case excerpt from man system on linux do not use system from a program with set-user-id or set-group-id privileges because strange values for some environment variables might be used to subvert system integrity

13590943
spaces	delimiter
one more thing you could expect according to your expected output- the same length for each field filling spaces for the rest - that couldn t be done through csv module but you could format your data to the same length for each cell using standard python formats like
you could set your own dialect for csv.writer with your own custom delimiter etc the main cause of the problem with different editors different behaviour - that you should correctly set csv-delimiter to one you really used - in each editor itself

13594646
gson	jackson
i m more versed with gson but i think this should work
see staxman s note below jackson does not automatically detect private fields it can be configured to with jsonautodetect or globally

13595641
allocator	stl
i d question assertions from anybody who wrote say a replace for in a day and claims to be faster for typical use cases of referring to the c++ 2011 version where the allocator can be sensibly used
this question won t get any answer stating that stl is optimal for a number of reasons the are at least half a dozen implementations of the stl out there and there are certainly some which are not optimized while other are optimized but see the next item

13599324
mergesort	heapsort
another possible reason lies in noting that mergesort which runs consistently does not rely heavily on function calls so it does not benefit from inlining
heapsort on the other hand relies heavily on the siftdown method which might be difficult for the compiler to inline

13605879
comparator	comparable
hashset doesn t implement comparable and you re not supplying a comparator so you get a classcastexception
one solution is to create the treemap by passing it a comparator to the constructor

13608790
division	multiplication
with the native code generator substituting that with needs import data.bits of course produces a significant speedup on normal platforms where a bitwise and is much faster than a division
the final result performs not measurably different for the tested values from the result of gcc -o3 -msse2 loop.c except for where gcc replaces the multiplication with a negation assuming all nans equivalent

13608794
apache	nginx
you can do something like sitea.com pdf-items will serve siteb.com edit the reverse proxy can be cross domain the servers do not have to share anything in common except for site b being accessible by site a which sounds like it is already apache has a simple approach using mod_proxy a quick google pulls up a guide for setting it up on apache
nginx has one too iis is a bit more complicated and i ve never set it up but the ability does exist according to the documentation

13610705
client-side	server-side
note that there are three client-side preconditions that do not require client-side information require work item approval require work item and comments descriptive change sets
these are included for backward compatibility since they were made available in the first release of rtc but have since then made available as server-side preconditions as well so you should always use the server-side form of them

13611447
dbcontext	objectcontext
you can get a reference to an objectcontext from a dbcontext though iobjectcontextadapter dbcontext .objectcontext
i m not sure how to make an edmx generate using objectcontext but no it is not deprecated

13616778
boost	stl
actually if you want a container of pointers you re best off using either a in c++11 or something from boost pointer container
for what it s worth the original stl did not use or to implement

13616778
realloc	malloc
facebook folly includes a std vector -like container that doesn t use or note that it doesn t use realloc either because that usually won t work with containers of objects
instead it uses malloc and the non-standard function malloc_usable_size and firefox goes through the trouble to manage memory in a similar manner

13616837
google-chrome	safari
to the best of my knowledge it s not possible right now with any of the browsers though the google-chrome team has said that they re eventually intending to support this scenario see the screensharing bullet point on their roadmap
and i suspect that this means that eventually other browsers will follow presumably with ie and safari bringing up the tail

13616837
google-chrome	firefox
hopefully microsoft s last-minute spanner in the works doesn t screw that up. it s possible that i ve missed something recent but i ve been following the project pretty carefully and i don t think screensharing has even made it into google-chrome canary yet let alone dev beta prod
opera is the only browser that has been keeping pace with google-chrome on its webrtc implementation firefox seems to be about six months behind and i haven t seen anything from that team either about screensharing

13618864
cdr	cons
edit more elaboration say we call deleteelement 3 1 2 3 4 you turn this into deleteelementpos 3 1 1 2 3 4 which falls into the last case of the cond and you get cons deleteelementacc 3 1 1 2 deleteelementacc 3 1 3 4 notice that currpos is wrong for the cdr of the list - it should be 3 not 1
you actually want your code to turn into cons deleteelementacc 3 1 1 2 deleteelementacc 3 + 1 2 3 4 because car list has 2 elements in it

13620446
google-chrome	firefox
keypress event for del end home etc.. is not fired in ie google-chrome and safari
it only works in firefox

13620538
factors	matrix
i m not sure if i got you right but if you need to know if the resulting matrix has a scaling factors less than one or greater than one you could simply check the matrix.m11 and matrix.m22 properties
unless you also rotate they give you the scaling factors in x and y direction

13624151
twig	smarty
with a templating system twig is the best because like hakre said it s strongly implemented
however it s not that diffucult to integrate it into any other template system i quickly wrote a smarty plugin for personnal use it works well

13625691
guava	lambdaj
guava has a nice index method that returns a guava indexed by the expression
the guava itself can be viewed as a map if you need that an even nicer fluent api is available through lambdaj s grouping function however lambdaj s group object does not have any methods that convert it into a map so you must do this from hand

13625912
g++	gcc
try using the -fno-elide-constructors switch in g++ from the definitive guide to gcc -fno-elide-constructors this option when compiling c++ options causes gcc not to omit creating temporary objects when initializing objects of the same type as permitted by the c++ standard
specifying this option causes gcc to explicitly call the copy constructor in all cases

13626158
union	distinct
in the case you have duplicates union is the best in my experience
if you know for a fact that you do not have duplicate values in those 2 tables then you can use union all instead of union by duplicate values i mean something like this table1 var cur_number a 8 table2 var new_number a 8 the difference is that union all is faster than union due to the fact that union eliminates duplicates from the resultset by using select distinct

13627689
persistent	transient
since this a custom interface it will not know how to persistent it
the error is bad you should probably raise a jira issue for that but fundamentally there are 2 problems i can see with the code your persistent classes must have a public no-args constructor as per any javabean by adding a constructor that takes your interface you are no longer providing one your scraper class needs to mark the paginator as transient to tell the persistence engine not to attempt to persistent the paginator property

13629348
macports	homebrew
try uninstalling ffmpeg and using homebrew to install the package instead of macports brew install ffmpeg --with-libvpx or brew reinstall ffmpeg --with-libvpx then your command should work
your configuration of macports was not built with libvpx

13630798
imagick	gmagick
it has a pecl php extension named gmagick and considerably faster at executing image processing operations from the command line than imagick
update graphicsmagick is faster than imagick doesn t means gmagick is better than imagick

13635272
cpython	pypy
pygame isn t compatible with pypy so to use it you ll have to stick with cpython
update april 2018 as pointed out by in this answer the pypy v6.0 release now works with pygame - although not yet with the current stable pygame 1.9.3 release but with the current developement branch 1.9.4.dev0

13639477
implements	extends
in the second case the original object does not implements any interface so a more elaborated trick must be used and this is when cglib appears
according to the project page cglib is used to extends java classes and implements interfaces at runtime

mri	rubinius
so while it s not technically multithreading in the case of mri ree as of 1.9 it does get some of the benefits
a lot of other ruby interpreters jruby rubinius don t actually have gils

13647071
jboss	glassfish
example jboss as7 in jboss 7 jboss wanted to move away from jndi because it was not specified that jndi had to be used and now it happens in approximately the following way you ll first need to put a jboss-ejb-client.properties file on your classpath with the following context and use code as the following so from the code it looks like no url is given but it s statically hidden in a config file
application client container today i have found another example where netbeans 7 java ee 6 and glassfish 3 are used

13650271
prepare	execute
it would be possible to support this sort of structure in the python-cql driver in the plain execute call wherein the query interpolation is done on the python side but you wouldn t get any of the benefits of prepare queries and it wouldn t be much more than just
cassandra is the piece interpolating bound values on a prepare query here and it does not support binding a sequence of values so the answer is pretty much you can t do that yet

13651001
awt	swing
first of all the jwebbrowser is an awt heavyweight component and does not play nicely in swing since it uses lightweight components without some intervention
instantiate jwebbrowser like this for the first step of friendly swing integration new jwebbrowser nscomponentoptions.destroyonfinalization nscomponentoptions.constrainvisibility nscomponentoptions.proxycomponenthierarchy that instantiation alone should prevent the browser from overlapping the swing lightweight components however it will not work as you would expect with transparencies or layers unless you do some additional steps

13652263
implements	extends
it does not extends to the code blocks of methods this includes generator expressions since they are implements using a function scope
this means that the following will fail class a the above means a function body is a code block and a method is a function then names defined out of the function body present in a class definition do not extends to the function body

13654239
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
gridbaglayout isn t that friendly when you are just beginning to learn about layout managers
you should start with simpler layout managers such as boxlayout or even gridlayout

13654396
ssl	https
per the readme file i got from the jsse ssl downloading off the innovation website link from earlier you can assign it to the httpconnection by doing this
innovation httpclient doesn t directly support https

13657971
opentype	woff
as for formats truetype and opentype are common and widely-available but have been superseded by the woff format see
woff is an open format and is in the process of being standardized by the w3c one final word not all fonts are free and open

13658778
equals	compareto
if you don t want them to be considered equals you need to make your compareto method differentiate between them by using name as a secondary sort order
the documentation for treemap explains that if your compareto method is not consistent with your equals method which it s not you won t get normal map behaviour note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface

13658778
comparator	comparable
the documentation for treemap explains that if your comparator method is not consistent with your equals method which it s not you won t get normal map behaviour note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

13659233
serializable	deserialization
this class is as follows the key here is using the serializable to write an anonymous object that includes only the desired properties
note that readjson is left unimplemented - i am assuming that deserialization is not required at this stage

13660894
slug	permalinks
so double check that product and news are categories slug not titles . and try to use debug-bar plugin it can show request parameters
wordpress selects template based on request parse results not only on permalinks structure. when it determines that you request category page then it tries to find file in theme folder

13663464
onkeyup	onkeydown
this works for me you don t need the onbackpressed or onkeyup etc
all you need is onkeydown i think it s because you re not returning the super part

13664274
g++	gcc
g++ does not complain in this case but it silently inserts an implicit try catch around the block of the critical section
for example the following code gets lowered by the openmp processor of gcc 4.7 into reaching the implicit built-in catch-all handler results in quite ungraceful termination terminate called after throwing an instance of int abort trap 6 the implicit try catch is inserted regardless of the presence of an outer try catch construct the exception would never ever leave the critical section

13665386
ssl	https
i m sure someone can weigh in on the overhead for ssl
ok the overhead for https is not trivial but if its really important to have ssl for some things i suggest just making it all ssl

13668722
vim	emacs
but emacs is not vim they have different ideas behind both
vim is just a text editor with programming extensions it s not a place for terminal inside just as for tetris and m-x doctor

13670240
httphandler	httpmodule
httphandler is a extension based logic and can be made to work on custom based extension
what you are referring here can be achieved by httpmodule which is request based logic and not by httphandler

13671391
onresume	onpause
and does not do onstop . it does onresume when the phone wakes up and as you point out it does this while the lock screen is still visible and accepting input which is a bit odd
when i make the activity invisible by pressing the home button the activity does both onpause and onstop

13684042
udp	tcp
since udp-based rpc messages can only hold up to 8 kbytes of encoded data this transport cannot be used for procedures that take large arguments or return huge results. i was indeed using udp and after switching to tcp messages are sent to the server properly
after checking manpages for other rpc commands i found this warning using udp has its shortcomings

13687427
equals	compareto
this is so because sorted sets and sorted maps without explicit comparators behave strangely when they are used with elements or keys whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals
it turns out does not delegate to equals it delegates to compareto

13687427
comparator	comparable
it turns out does not delegate to equals it delegates to comparator
so will return true if a.compareto b returns 0 so in this particular case so therefore but this does not necessarily mean that new integer 1 .equals new long 1 the reason why this is all so weird and confusing is because the contract of comparable does not require that it is consistent with equals though it is strongly recommended

13688112
client-side	server-side
if you re running php server-side it will stop processing in the event of a client-side abort
from what i ve read this isn t the case with other server-side technologies which will continue processing after a client aborts. see but it s best not to assume anything one way or another

13689574
floating-point	fractions
this is not recommended even if it seems to work -- there s the potential for floating-point precision errors
either check if roundeddirection is within a very small range of the target value or in your case just declare roundeddirection as an int since it looks like the expression will only return values with no fractions

13689722
portrait	landscape
just because you perceive it as landscape doesn t mean it s actually not rotated portrait
in short draw your splash screens as if they are portrait but draw them sideways

13690230
client-side	server-side
however javascript may be disabled on the client-side so you want to gracefully degrade to some alternative like a simple label underneath the field or something like that
what is possible on the server-side though is echoing some javascript from the php code albeit this might not be considered good practice

13692582
war	manifest.mf
let s take a look at the contents of the war file so we can fully see all that is and is not in the war
demo.war demo.war meta-inf demo.war meta-inf manifest.mf demo.war web-inf demo.war web-inf classes demo.war web-inf classes org demo.war web-inf classes org stackoverflow demo.war web-inf classes org stackoverflow movie.class demo.war web-inf classes org stackoverflow movies.class demo.war web-inf lib demo.war web-inf persistence.xml basically 3 files movies.class movie.class and persistence.xml test drive we ll use curl as it s easy

postgresql	mysql
the postgresql adapter provides its own quote in activerecord connectionadapters postgresqladapter#quote but that doesn t know about activesupport duration either
the mysql adapter s quote is also ignorant of activesupport duration

backgrounding	multitasking
after the user launches the app they can move it to the backgrounding and have it popup shelltoasts and tile updates corresponding to a user s location
wp7 wp8 doesn t allow for full multitasking

13703606
sudo	passwd
install the module if it s not yet installed sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-authnz-external sudo a2enmod authnz_external add this to http.conf defineexternalauth drupal environment var www drupal-authentication.php add this to .htaccess in protected directory authtype basic authname gitweb authbasicprovider external authexternal drupal require valid-user edit var www drupal-authentication.php or where your drupal installation is this example is working when accessing gitweb directory or any file inside it browser asks for username and passwd
the login is successfull only if username and passwd match drupal s one

13705374
kerberos	ntlm
i think that this is what the server is expecting - when it says the server expects negotiate ntlm that actually means windows auth where it will try to use kerberos if available or fall back to ntlm if not hence the negotiate i m basing this on somewhat reading between the lines of selecting a credential type
try setting clientcredentialtype to windows instead of ntlm

13709023
prng	random
the header provides portable access to random number facilities including potentially a cryptographic prng
std random_device may not be a cryptographic prng on all implementations so you ll have to check your implementation documentation

13709448
realloc	malloc
what you want is a loop that does or maybe use malloc instead of realloc on line 226
the problem is is not initialized since it comes straight from realloc

13714923
client-side	server-side
doing apps where you have both a server-side component as-well as a client-side component makes things a little more complicated then just having a server-side framework
when using a client-side framework like angularjs all your templates are compiled client-side not server-side

13714923
client-side	server-side
when using a client-side framework like angularjs all your templates are compiled client-side not server-side
that s a huge difference from traditional server-side rendering

13715225
spaces	delimiter
for the first solution i assume that the numbers always come in pairs and are separated by a single - and spaces is used to delimit between the pairs of numbers
use this if you are reading from standard input use this if you have a string contains all the numbers and you want to process it let the name of the variable be inputstring then you can read the numbers from the input alternatively you can also use usedelimiter to add - as delimiter and use nextint to read number without having to deal with - separately the code will simply becomes the code is cleaner but whether - appear between first and second or how many - appear or is it the only character between the pair of numbers not is not known now

13716178
bash	subshell
you can set up a bash script that you source for your local environment that is identical to what you would add to .profile in your production slug in its keys not necessarily its values and use fabric.context_managers.prefix to source that file before you run your local commands
you can use fabric.context_managers.shell_env to export a variable to bash for your shell and all subshell spawned from it - but those variables won t persist beyond the shell that they were defined for so you can t set environmental variables for the parent shell from a fabric script the way your example has it

13718528
serializable	deserialization
firstly your serializable deserialize methods are both broken
you are over-reporting the result getbuffer without length and you aren t writing anything into the stream for deserialization

13718927
rpm	yum
here s my recipe for getting postgresql rvm ruby rails all up and running on centos postgresql first follow the instructions on to get postgresql installed sudo vi etc yum.repos.d centos-base.repo get the latest pgdg rpm file for your platform architecture for example curl -o then sudo rpm -ivh pgdg-redhat92-9.2-7.noarch.rpm sudo yum install -y postgresql92-server postgresql92-devel initialize the database sudo service postgresql-9.2 initdb configure var lib pgsql 9.2 data postgresql.conf and var lib pgsql 9.2 data pg_hba.conf as needed
start postgresql server sudo service postgresql-9.2 start rvm sudo yum -y groupinstall development tools sudo yum -y install zlib zlib-devel sqlite-devel httpd curl-devel httpd-devel apr-devel apr-util-devel mlocate man libxml2-devel libxslt-devel libffi-devel readline-devel note not as root curl -l get.rvm.io | sudo bash -s stable logout and back on

a at the time of writing 09 2012 there are a lot of good matrix libraries available mtl4 armadillo eigen .
ublas offers good but not outstanding performance

13723978
jar	manifest.mf
selecting one will create an executable jar remember an executable jar is just a normal jar with a manifest.mf file that specifies the main class to call when executed
export as executable jar will take a launch configuration and pack everything that is needed for the launch into a jar so selecting the files to include is not necessary there

13725171
awt	swing	swt	swing
if you want something that keeps the native look javafx doesn t provide a native skin that i know of at present then you may want to look at swt like awt in that it uses native components but it s much more modern or qt-jambi java bindings for the native qt toolkit. swt is probably the more popular and supported of the two
javafx 2 is the more modern replacement for swing which is currently relatively young but will likely gain much more momentum when java 8 is released next year

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i solve my problem with such category of uiviewcontroller
category for uinavigationcontroller not working for me

13726621
google-chrome	firefox
fiddle update it seems like google-chrome is not satisfied when we just pass in an empty string
firefox still shows the expected behavior i m pretty sure that this also worked in google-chrome a couple of weeks versions ago

13732522
serializable	deserialization
for example even if the class below had the appropriate constructor and attribute the mynewfield property would not be serializable without additional code in both the constructor and in getobjectdata
so the major point here is that if you must rely on proper exception serialization deserialization for some reason should be completely aware that when it comes to any custom code or assemblies there is no guarantee that it will work

13734401
google-chrome	firefox
i made a js fiddle for you here it s semicomplete but shows off how you should go about making your fadeout fadein. this is tested in google-chrome on a mac
not sure about firefox nor ie unfortunately

aggregate-functions	sum
the sum aggregate-functions is expecting a simple column name not an expression
in the .compute expression the convert function is being called inside the sum aggregate

13735460
content-length	content-type
i was able to solve my problem by turning off zlib.output_compression in php and supplying the http content-length header
i am not serving the file with a fake extension but am using audio x-gsm as the content-type header

13736727
backgrounding	multitasking
if the app make use of backgrounding execution and continue to run in the backgrounding it can access the network as usual
you may want to read beyond the basics in apple s technical notes on networking and multitasking sniffing traffic require root access it cannot be done unless eve s app is a jailbroken app

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
ido it is not ubuntu but i do believe it is derived from ubuntu
it is definitely linux and follows a lot of the ubuntu debian conventions

13740810
sse	avx
note that on x86_64 -mfpmath defaults to sse so using this switch is usually not necessary or even harmful if you don t exactly know what you are doing
avx is enabled by either or -mavx

13741637
rsa	aes
or put another way if this helps think of rsa as essentially a key passing scheme not an encryption algorithm per se
you should using the standard encryption library encrypt the data using a symmetric algorithm such as aes see for example my tutorial on symmetric aes encryption in java use rsa only as a means of passing to the remote client the aes etc key that you used to encrypt the data again i ve written about using rsa in java with example code

13743135
ssl	https
i tried to access your image using http that s default redirecting to https so you not need to worry about https ssl
if i understood s3 terminology s3 response always serve as https

13747119
move	drag
the term drag drop in qt is always used to refer to this and should not be confused with the user s ability to move an object around on the screen with the mouse
drag and drop has nothing to do with whether or not an item is movable

13747871
backgrounding	multitasking
ios provides multitasking api s even if your app is in backgrounding some of its api s can be accessed
these services are - local notifications backgrounding audio backgrounding tasks backgrounding location so you can definitely send location updates using corelocation when the app is not in foreground

13747871
backgrounding	multitasking
these services are - local notifications backgrounding audio backgrounding tasks backgrounding location so you can definitely send location updates using corelocation when the app is not in foreground
this link - ios multitasking has code to start your service when app in backgrounding

13749892
rspec	capybara
i found this which explains upon upgrading to capybara 2.0 capybara will not be available by default in rspec request specs
instead a new type of spec--the feature spec--has been created for use with capybara

13751137
onresume	onpause
in reality activites are not so long lived however you get the idea onresume called after onpause which in turn is called when the activity loses the foreground note that this has nothing to do with the activity s content visibility
because onresume is always called after onpause you are guaranteed that it will be called every time the user were doing something else and then switches to your activity which seems just your use-case

13752999
udp	tcp
well the question in op is open ended because it s not like there is one fixed set of protocols tcp udp used in this kind of applications and also its scope is large due to various technologies involved in this end-to-end solution of camera capturem encoding streaming decoding processing
in the case you mentioned if it is going to be likely that the webcam and the web server are going to be on same lan then well you can as well use tcp ip and then server can process it

13755432
comparator	comparable
therefore fields used within treeset.equals method have to be exactly the same no more no less than within your comparator implementation
treeset forms a binary tree keeping elements according to natural or not orders so in order to search quickly one specific element is the collection treeset uses comparable or comparator instead of equals

13755432
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
as treeset javadoc precises note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

13755438
punctuation	words
after editing the question it seems that the punctuation like semi-colon is not wanted in a words
the code above would include punctuation as part of the words

13758037
vbscript	jscript
as vbscript has no native sort it needs a little help from a friend
in your case - because of your more complex sorting criteria - the friend should not be .net s arraylist jscript s sort or sort.exe introduced here but a disconnected ado recordset output a this is an example of a description b description example this an is of a for background start here

13761719

css html javascript september 25h 2013 i can t believe i said both ways required javascript to hide the icon. because this is not entirely true
the most common timing to hide placeholder text is on change as suggested in this answer

xna	spritebatch
even xna s built-in spritebatch does most of its per-sprite work on the cpu everything but the final overall matrix transformation
while it could do per-sprite transforms on the gpu and i think it used to in xna 3 it doesn t

13762318
svg	vml
in svg these options are defined on the svg container s preserveaspectratio property
if you are not supporting the vml lte ie8 option then you could change this property to affect the alignment

13762557
profiling	debugging
another cause of this problem selecting the wrong mobileprovisioning profiling
for example you can have a distribution profiling selected in debugging mode xcode will then not allow the app to start in debugging mode

13762690
hmac	md5
the logic behing hmac is sound and there is as of today no attack that exist on the protocol
even better it was proved than an attack on the underlying hash algorithm doesn t mean an attack on hmac exists that doesn t mean you should use md5 though

13764831
war	manifest.mf
if you have web project which means having a war file all dependencies will be packaged into the war file
furthermore it s not needed to put the dependencies into the manifest.mf file. if you really like having the dependencies into your manifest.mf file you have to configure the maven-war-plugin like this if you define a dependency only in dependencymanagement it will not be a real dependency

13768779
prepare	execute
in fbpreparedstatement however executebatch is overridden to execute the originally prepare statement with batch parameters in your example it won t do anything as you never actually add a preparedstatement-style batch
it will never execute the statements you added with addbatch string but it will also not clear the list of statements in fbstatement and that is most likely the cause of your outofmemoryerror

13769398
postgresql	mysql
postgresql supports update...returning as this feature
per first comment on question this is simply not possible in mysql

13769435
webclient	httpwebrequest
then i ve encountered interesting bug - when i had fiddler launched httpclient started to show its upload progress in unexpected way like in webclient httpwebrequest above so i thinked maybe that was a problem of why webclient showed upload progres not correctly i think i had it launched
so i tried with webclient again without fiddler-like apps launched and all works as it should upload progress has correct values

13769435
webclient	httpwebrequest
so i think that such program like fiddler probably not only a fiddler has some affect on how webclient and other .net classes shows upload progress
this discussion approves it httpwebrequest doesn #39

13769536
bash	subshell
see the shell parameter expansion section in the bash reference manual for more info on the and ## symbols
a proper 100 bash way and which is safe regarding filenames that have spaces or funny symbols provided inner_process.sh handles them correctly but that s another story and it doesn t fork dirname and basename in subshell for each file

13770797
super	extends
after some work i realized that super accesses the __dict__ of classes directly when resolving attributes through the mro it does not do a getattr type of call
the solution is to extends a mock.magicmock object and wrap it with a class to accomplish this

13774454
super	extends
in animal constructor there will be another call to super in the first line
assuming animal doesn t extends any class java.lang.object s constructor will be invoked as java.lang.object is the super class of every object

uicollectionview	uitableview
read on if this is of interest in the ib created a uiviewcontroller in which i inserted see screenshot a view for layout purposes -- in which i first dropped a uisearchbar and display controller. in the same view side by side i dropped a uicollectionview with a custom uicollectionviewcell
then i dropped in a uitableviewprovider with a custom uitablecell but that s not required you can also ignore the uitabbaritem and the nav item in the screenshot that s inconsequential i set the height of the uitableview to 0 and wired all the outlets and delegates and the net result is the following when the cursor enters the uisearchbox the uitableview overlay on top the uicollectionview as one types the shouldreloadtableforsearchstring del gets called and the results appear in the tableview

13774518
uicollectionview	uitableview

on searchbarsearchbuttonclicked i simply set the datasource of the uicollectionview and call reloaddata on it s outlet et voila

13777646
implements	extends
interfaces do not just specify a method signature after all but also a contract how they should be implements which a compiler cannot enforce though
then you cannot really extends both interfaces because your implementation can only provide one method so it has to choose one of the two contracts to fulfill

13777799
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i had the same problem when i need to present my login view controller from another view controller if the the user is t authorized i did it in viewdidload method of my another view controller if not authorized - presentmodalviewcontroller
when i start to make it in viewdidappear method i solved this problem

13778155
bash	subshell
if you want a 100 bash solution
you can parse the proc net arp file using awk but i m not sure it s simpler it saves one fork and a subshell though

13778633
move	drag
also creating public controls on other forms is not very good idea - if you really need to update some value on form2 then its better to declare public method property in form2 class which will update label also consider to move timer to form2 let this form update itself
what you want to do periodically update label is achieved by usage of timer component you can drag it from toolbox and place on your form

13779771
onclick	onchange
also using onclick doesn t factor in tabbed access to the field.
why not just use the onchange attribute instead

13779820
spaces	delimiter
the issue is that cmd recognizes a spaces tab comma semicolon or equals sign as command line delimiter unless they are wrapped in doublequotes
delimiter some characters in the command line are ignored by batch files depending on the dos version wether they are escaped or not and often depending on their location in the command line commas are replaced by spaces unless they are part of a string in doublequotes semicolons

13779820
spaces	delimiter
delimiter some characters in the command line are ignored by batch files depending on the dos version wether they are escaped or not and often depending on their location in the command line commas are replaced by spaces unless they are part of a string in doublequotes semicolons
are replaced by spaces unless they are part of a string in doublequotes characters are sometimes replaced by spaces not if they are part of a string in doublequotes the first forward slash is replaced by a space only if it immediately follows the command without a leading space multiple spaces are replaced by a single space unless they are part of a string in doublequotes tabs are replaced by a single space leading spaces before the first command line argument are ignored i know of several occasions where these seemingly useless features proved very handy

13780196
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
that s not how to use uinavigationcontroller and dialogviewcontroller . keep the basic concept of uiviewcontroller in mind one controller handles a screenful of content on iphone
this means you should push controllers on the uiviewcontroller s stack

13782511
google-chrome	firefox
this helps on google-chrome and ie but not on firefox
adding white-space nowrap deals with the issue on firefox

13788993
trie	tree
of course if you want only words and not all substrings a map tree hash based will probably be enough and much easier to implement and use the type should be for example with the tree based approach and it will map from each word to a list that contains all the books containing this word in the title . you can also use a trie to implement the map
suffix tree is an efficient data structure for substrings search

13791152
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the div contains an inline style of display block and a background-image
but in firefox the div it doesn t have the display block only the background image

13792143
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the method viewdidload only gets called when your view controller is first loaded
if you want your animation to run when you return from other view controllers to this one you should call the animation method in viewwillappear not viewdidload

13794675
google-chrome	firefox
you ve only included the prefixes for webkit in your css so consequently it works fine in google-chrome and most likely safari as well but not anywhere else
you ll need to include the mozilla vendor prefix to get it working in firefox same goes for opera which uses -o- as its prefix

13795276
n-gram	words
then if i understood you correctly you re dealing with the task of handling n-gram
as in your situation you re not putting any explicit limits on the prefixes it can be assumed that the generally reasonable limits apply and those are 4-5 words n-gram

13795276
n-gram	words
as in your situation you re not putting any explicit limits on the prefixes it can be assumed that the generally reasonable limits apply and those are 4-5 words n-gram
there s a lot of such n-gram from a real-world corpus you d easily get gigabytes of data

gruntjs	package.json
the scripts property allows to run custom scripts including gruntjs when certain things happen in a package s lifecycle
for example to echo some text and run the gruntjs command whenever anyone including heroku runs npm install add this to your package.json important caveats you might have to change the path to the gruntjs binary in the postinstall script check the error output if the gruntjs command doesn t execute

13796081
gruntjs	package.json
for example to echo some text and run the gruntjs command whenever anyone including heroku runs npm install add this to your package.json important caveats you might have to change the path to the gruntjs binary in the postinstall script check the error output if the gruntjs command doesn t execute
gruntjs and grunt-cli must be listed as a dependency in your package.json so it gets installed by heroku

multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition
we used on vector1 and vector2 which have their vector constructor still intact because we can t multiplying lists of doubles
in your original code you tried to add or multiplying lists of doubles which won t work because your instance only defines addition and multiplication on vectors not raw double s

13796582
multiplying	multiplication
in your original code you tried to add or multiplying lists of doubles which won t work because your instance only defines addition and multiplication on vectors not raw double s
in the let clause i ve taken the result of this multiplication and matched it with vector list3

13798438
oncreate	setcontentview
because you are defining spinner sp in above oncreate so android doesn t find the spinner sp from layout xml file
it should be after setcontentview so android nut shell has a reference of that spinner for particular activity

13798835
multiplying	multiplication
in the case of scalars you multiplying v with time
but scalar multiplication with a matrix will just scale it not rotate it

13798848
urllib	httplib
but if you are if you re using urllib urllib2 it does not have any way to do what you want so you can t do that anymore
you can drop down to httplib which lets you pass a source_address a host port tuple that it will use to bind the socket before connecting

13799079
magento	joomla
i had to stop the joomla session do my stuff with magento and start again the session in joomla all of it during the same script process
here is a sample of what i did for a joomla plugin you can get an inspiration of that because i m not aware of drupal framework but here you will find the code i did for the joomla plugin the most interesting part in the code provided are the methods destroytemporaryjoomlasession loadandstartmagentobootstrap restartjoomlasession startmagentosession and stopmagentosession

13801075
google-chrome	firefox
nexus 7 4.2.1 and samsung s3 4.1.1 google-chrome next button shows but does not function firefox mobile works as expected i ve also tested input types email text tel
in google-chrome they either show a non-functional next button or no next button

13801580
mp4	webm
if it can t find one it does not then fall back to the flash version automatically so for firefox and opera - which also doesn t support mp4 you ll need to also provide a webm format and ogg if you want to support firefox 3.6
firefox doesn t support mp4

13802548
vbscript	vba
in vbscript under wsh you ll have to create or access those objects yourself see this answer with the createobject or getobject functions
wsh has its own set of built-in objects. in the case of excel you d need to start with keep in mind that in vbscript variables do not have a type so all statements such as dim i as integer dim wks as excel.worksheet need to have the as clause removed dim i dim wks for exact details on the differences between the two see info visual basic for applications features not in vbscript and info vbscript features not in visual basic for applications . vba has a built-in ide and debugger which you don t have when running code under wsh but you can use visual sudio to debug the script file

13803934
multiplying	subtract
that means multiplying the attrib_position variable with the model matrix not the modelview matrix and using this vector as the basis for your light computation
it looks here like you re subtract light_position which i assume you want to be a world space coordinate since you seem dismayed that it s currently in eye space from position which is an eye space vector

13805329
implements	extends
update as guillaumepolet stated a better game design would be implements jpanel s as parent class for most of the game entities see this similar answer for more
in the entity class which could be map player etc to be drawn have a draw method that accepts a graphics object thus allowing it to access the graphics object of the jpanel and draw to it something like other suggestions do not extends jframe class unnecessarily override jpanel paintcomponent and not paint +1 to trashgod comment swing components should be created and manipulated on event dispatch thread via swingutilities.invokelater .. block

13805513
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload occurs before the view is visible so it will move just not animated
you could try putting it in the viewdidappear method

13807114
hex	binary
this isn t the same style of binary representation that you want but this will convert an ieee 754 into it s sign mantissa and base which can be used to create a hex representation in a fairly straightforward fashion
note that the value of the mantissa is 1+binary where binary is the binary representation - hence the -1 in the return

13814609
apache	nginx
if you came from apache like me and used mod_fcgid you will find that you have many php-cgi.exe processes in the system
because nginx does not spawn the php process for you you will need to start the process yourself

13815551
mvp	presenter
i have not worked much on the mvp design pattern but will surely try my hands on it
approach1 databinding in this case you can also create individual properties in iview and bind these properties in presenter to the model properties

13817309
nhibernate	queryover
so first option is to extend the man-in-the-middle object then we can navigate create pathes from translationcontentreference to contentreference from contentreference to contentlibrarysearch the second option which is less nhibernate and more sql is to create isqlquery
if i do understand your scenario correctly join over man-in-the-middle foreign key reference cannot be achieved via queryover api

13819830
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
backbone.js is a javascriptmvc framework
unlike standard mvc backbone.js doesn t have controllers instead it has collections

13821009
google-chrome	firefox
i found out the real problem was that i hadn t explicitly set the z-index for the two canvas i had two layers . it looks like the z-index if not set in the css is set by google-chrome according to which element appeared first unlike firefox or ie
those two create elements in the order of the html code this is why i didn t encounter any problems of this kind with ie9 or firefox

13821285
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i would try calling the animatebars_v1 method in viewdidappear instead of viewdidload
by the time viewdidload is called the view is loaded in the memory but may not have been drawn

13821935
super	implements
3 you have a super class which derives from base
you will notice that the derived class does not need to explicitly implements ibase as it s done at a lower level

13826064
xuggle	vlcj
the only library i know which is not outdated is xuggle
vlcj also seems to be outdated but some claims it works with majority of web cams

13826758
cypher	gremlin
however there are some types of queries that are simply not possible with cypher or where cypher can t quite optimize the way you can with gremlin
gremlin is built over groovy so you can actually use it as a generic way to get neo4j to execute java code and perform various tasks from the server without having to take the http hit from the rest interface

13828133
uicontrol	uibutton
if you really must use a drawrect method i d subclass uicontrol rather than uibutton
it is better and advised by apple not to subclass uibutton if you can

13828655
uiview	subviews
the uiview class reference definitely suggests a system for making sizetofit relevant to your custom views
override sizethatfits not sizetofit your custom uiview s needs to override sizethatfits to return a new size that fits the receiver s subviews however you wish to calculate this

13829748
dictionary	map
we could use an array of integer as a map versus a dictionary that contains only the filled string warning test needed
dictionary does not seems necessary here because you don t have any key to index your data

13830251
multiplying	multiplication
the reason you re getting these errors now and not with the default matrix sizes is that the original matricies were smaller and thus required a lot less operations to multiplying
matrix multiplication of n x n matricies requires on the order of n 3 operations so the number of operations required increases much faster than the size of the matrix and the accumulated error would increase in proportion with the number of operations

13830366
flask	django
so in short you can do in flask but beware this way you can only assign the entire dictionary at once
not even django a bigger python web framework than flask doesn t support this by default

13830366
flask	django
not even django a bigger python web framework than flask doesn t support this by default
but in django you can install it it s called a jsonfield

13830698
bash	subshell
you mean that you are entering the command bash at the command prompt you are not refreshing the environment variables
you are launching a new subshell of the current shell

13831940
implements	extends
instead of thinking about the problems in terms of design patterns i d suggest describing your classes clearly so that you can implements the patterns that exist naturally among them
when you have 6 classes extends from one class where 5 of them have similar behavior and one doesn t perhaps the inheritance model of your classes is not right

13834045
spaces	delimiter
the value of the first array item is not a spaces but an empty string
the following snippet demonstrates the behaviour and provides a workaround i simply strip leading delimiter from the input

13834931
queue	fifo
page replaced when not availbe in queue
go to this link fifo here explained all page repalacemnt algo

13836462
memcpy	strncpy
copy iv to this memcpy iv2 iv 16
copy iv that s memcpy instead of strncpy because the iv is random data which can contain the string terminator 0 and the first argument to both of these functions is the destination not the source

13836585
cypher	gremlin
in gremlin you can better define the exact traversal pattern or your own algorithms whereas in cypher the engine tries to find the best traversing solution itself
i personally use cypher because of its simplicity and to date i have not had any situations where i had to use gremlin except working with gremlin graphml import export functions

13836585
cypher	gremlin
i personally use cypher because of its simplicity and to date i have not had any situations where i had to use gremlin except working with gremlin graphml import export functions
i expect however that even if i would need to use gremlin i would do so for a specific query i would find on the net and never come back to again

13837311
postgresql	mysql
function for postgresql i do not know
for mysql please see the load xml syntax docs

13839922
dbcontext	objectcontext
database in dbcontext api doesn t have executestorequery - that is a method from objectcontext
dbcontext api uses just sqlquery method

13841565
google-chrome	firefox
if not you can manually create the directories needed by running google-chrome under the system user yourself from the terminal for instance
more than likely the problem here is that the download location is associated with a specific user profile and the google-chrome driver follows the same pattern as the firefox driver in that by default it uses a copy of a completely clean user profile every time it is run so the download location you set for your user is never picked up by selenium

13841791
noexcept	throw
n3050 introduces a new kind of exception specification noexcept the specifies that the function will not throw any exceptions
unlike throw noexcept does not require the compiler to introduce code to check whether an exception is throw

13841791
noexcept	throw
unlike throw noexcept does not require the compiler to introduce code to check whether an exception is throw
rather if a function specified as noexcept is exited via an exception the result is a call to std terminate

13841833
alarmmanager	timertask
the alarmmanager is intended for cases where you want to have your application code run at a specific time even if your application is not currently running
from in androidmanifest.xml application-part you can use timer class to schedule periodic task using timertask

13845857
oncreate	onstart
you do not have to implement oncreate onstart onresume onpause onstop ondestroy onsaveinstancestate onrestoreinstancestate and many other methods
those methods are not abstract and the default implementations are reasonable with the typical exception of oncreate

13846842
innodb	myisam
for innodb on mysql 5.6 this will not work and you will need to do this manually like this note in that last case the two queries will need to be run with the same database connection
this depends on your storage engine for myisam and for innodb on mysql 5.6+ you can set the auto_increment value for the table to say 1

13848399
imagemagick	magick++
the magick++ api has likely not kept up with imagemagick api changes
the imagemagick api is still available via a magicklib namespace and if you study how the magick++ image class works you will see that it is possible to use the c api and pass the result into image

13850973
persistent	transient
chats are normally not something people persistent
so a transient database might be just the ticket

13852650
intersect	contains
any edge of the triangle intersect any edge of the rectangle
the first two conditions cover the possibilities that one of the shapes is entirely contains with the other in which case the edges will not intersect

13858848
vsto	add-in
it turns out that the vsto runtime is not installed with office 2007 it is installed with office 2010
the it user who could load the add-in already had it because he d installed something else that included it i guess

13860895
weka	libsvm
if it doesn t work with the c++ version then we can definitely check that if it does work with the c++ version we can be sure that the problem is the 1 interaction with weka 2 an old bug in libsvm java that has not been fixed 3 what you call wlsvm.jar which i m not sure what it is or a mixture of these things
libsvm is a great library

13861486
super	implements
perhaps what you need here is to not have your view call super layoutsubviews but uiview the ancestor call its super layoutsubviews
this can be achieved not by subclassing but implements a category of uiview which would have layoutsubviews function implements calling super

13862909
dictionary	map
since you say that most of the queries will be resolved by looking at the first dictionary your fastest solution would be to do something like however that is certainly not the most maintainable of solutions and i don t recommend using it
you could create a function which you would call like get_from key d1 d2 d3 this is a simplified slightly less clean version of the already very simple chained map recipe suggested by martijnpieters in the comments on the original question -- i would advocate using that over this code posted here

13863243
persian	farsi
persian farsi is not supported in android up to version 4.0 but there are some things that might help you listed here
i also came across this stackoverflow question about persian numbers in sql though i m not sure that will help at all

13865316
jax-ws	jax-rs
to write a web service with servlet technology you can for example use jax-ws for soap
in order to write restful services you can either use jax-rs with the reference implementation being jersey or alternatively you can use spring webmvc but afaik that is not the main purpose of this framework and jersey is considerably easier to use

13866024
ubuntu	linux
i am using the aws stock version of ubuntu 12.04 in my qustion i mentioned that i needed to change the putty settings in case somebody needs the settings - under window- translation- set the recived data to win1252 western counter intuitive as it may seem setting the encoeding to utf-8 made the and appear as # or de pending on the drawing char selected option
apparently on my machine ubuntu 12.04.1 lts gnu linux 3.2.0-32-virtual i686 grep --version grep gnu grep 2.10 bash --version gnu bash version 4.2.24 1 -release i686-pc-linux-gnu the solution was to use the -p switch and match or non printable chars btw the new lines are result of the multiple matches and not misprinting the currency signs few notes melpomene showed in his answer that his console or version of grep handles the currency signs better

13866146
mp3	ogg
many browsers today like google-chrome and firefox will not play mp3 or mp4 files due to ip restrictions
you can either transcode your files to compatible alternatives like ogg or you ll have to rely on plugins to get universal browser support

13869821
spaces	delimiter
fortran uses spaces to fill the rest of the string if it is declared longer than its stored text
it is not zero delimiter the declared length is stored in a hidden variable

13870126
opera	firefox
here s the code if you want to apply this to firefox opera only you can resort to css hacks it goes without saying the caveat is the scrollbar will be visible at all times which might be an okay compromise
firefox opera follows w3c spec which is to include scrollbar width in media queries width the reason might be to avoid infinite loop as described in a comment here while webkit does not possibly coz they think it makes no sense there is a workaround i ve only tested this on firefox apparently if you force scrollbar to be visible all the time then the width will now be consistent with webkit

13871203
division	modulo
first the armv7-a architecture doesn t provide integer division instructions
your modulo will be computed in software every time through the loop which is going to slow you down a bit

13872211
g++	gcc
the gnu toolchain doesn t support microsoft s wmain function d dev test g++ bar.cpp d bin mingw bin .. lib gcc i686-pc-mingw32 4.7.1 .. .. .. libmingw32.a main.o main.c .text.startup+0xa3 undefined reference to winmain 16 collect2.exe error ld returned 1 exit status d dev test _ the link error message here about winmain is because the gnu toolchain does support that function presumably because so much ancient code uses it and searches for it as a last resort after failing to find a standard main

13872459
rspec	capybara
update confirmation from david that there is no way to do this presently with rspec capybara
the correct answer is with webrat does take a block and capybara does not

13876670
prng	random
if you use rand seed 4 this actually switches to an earlier version of the prng used previously in octave which prng is not mt19937 at all but rather the fortran randlib
it is possible to get the same numbers in numpy and octave but you have to hack around the random seed generation algorithm in octave and write your own function to construct the state vector out of the initial 32-bit integer seed

13878078
super	extends
every java class by default extends object of object class and object of object class is the root object means super class for all classes
but here class c having two super classes of object so giving error means java does not support multiple inheritance by using classes

13879828
ienumerable	iqueryable
you should understand the idea behind the linq ienumerable iqueryable interface
ienumerable used for lazy loading of sequences so if you create an extension method for loop like this and try to use lazyforeach in ienumerable-returning method linq chain your code in provided action will not execute until you force enumeration maybe partial with tolist toarray elementat first last any take skip .

13880834
ember.js	backbone.js
i implemented a canvas-based interactive time-trend chart using ember.js and had a positive experience
you are not required to use html backbone.js html templates with ember.js

13880834
ember.js	backbone.js
you are not required to use html backbone.js html templates with ember.js
ember.js s automatically-propagated properties and computed-properties are a good match to a scene graph api such as jcotton

13882310
move	drag
the entire usercontrol and all of its contents move smoothly when you drag the border keeping up with the mouse
and the entire usercontrol does not move if you click anywhere else on its surface

13884841
ioexception	filewriter
parameters file - a file object to write to append - if true then bytes will be written to the end of the file rather than the beginning throws ioexception - if the file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file does not exist but cannot be created or cannot be opened for any other reason since 1.4
instead of doing this do as follow as to append on a existing file filewriter needs an extra argument as true here filewriter public filewriter file file boolean append throws ioexception constructs a filewriter object given a file object

13885418
daemons	systemd
meinberg made a port of the ntp daemons for windows
if your windows systemd is part of a domain you might not be able to independently update your computer time

13886892
google-chrome	firefox
and my google-chrome browser was signed into my gmail account personal gmail.com
however my analytics account which is under my work gmail.com was open in firefox try not to laugh to hard

13888787
super	self
however it s probably not wise to call super init twice as this could have bad side-effects. there are cases where you would not call super init but would instead call a version of init in your own class
basically if you have initwithjunk and init you can have initwithjunk call instead of so that the stuff that self init would do gets done and doesn t have to be reproduced in initwithjunk

13888787
super	self
understand that the super init method is not usually replacing the existing instance with a new one but rather is initializing instance fields in it that belong to the superclass
the reason for receiving the self value back from the super init call is two-fold the init routine can return a nil in the event that some sort of error occurs

13894513
exponent	modulo
i tried this approach and it works fine for extracting the exponent
it is 3 bytes in size as expected but the extracted modulo is not the correct size

13895113
realloc	malloc
the main difference when writing is that it is uninitialized and no memory is allocated so you ll have to take care yourself this is called dynamic memory allocation as opposed to static allocation and it allows you nice things like changing the amount of allocated memory at runtime using realloc or using a variable in the malloc call. also note that memory allocation can fail if the amount of memory is too large in this case the returned pointer will be null
technically sizeof char above isn t needed because 1 char will always be 1 byte in size but most other data types are bigger and the multiplication is important - malloc 100 allocates 100 bytes allocates the amount of memory needed for 100 int s which usually is 400 bytes on 32-bit systems but can vary

13899338
vbscript	vba
this is not possible in vbscript
you have to define xltoleft const and to make sure that you pass xltoleft at the correct position use the vba docs to check the number and order of the arguments to .delete

13899371
queue	fifo
it s important that tasks submitted to the global queue are thread-safe and minimize side-effects
tasks are submitted for execution in fifo order but order of completion is not guaranteed

13899386
queue	fifo
it s important that tasks submitted to the global queue are thread-safe and minimize side-effects
tasks are submitted for execution in fifo order but order of completion is not guaranteed

13899480
mp3	ogg
perhaps you could convert the ogg files to a different format and keep them as temp data might help with this java - convert ogg to mp3 this of course seems like a lot of overhead to play back some files but at least they re usually small files
might not be a satisfactory answer but it seems the engineers are not inclined to change the behavior of mediaplayer and the metadata tag for ogg files

13904555
.htaccess	httpd.conf
make sure there are no .htaccess files in library webserver documents
make sure you have not modified your httpd.conf file in any way from its default settings

13904808
daemons	systemd
program exit a program terminates all its activity and exits when one of two things happens all the threads that are not daemons threads terminate
some thread invokes the exit method of class runtime or class systemd and the exit operation is not forbidden by the security manager

13904962
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you should not initialise ui geometry-related things in viewdidload because the geometry of your view is not set at this point and the results will be unpredictable
as you have discovered viewwillappear is the correct place to do these things at this point the geometry is set so getting and setting geometry-related properties makes sense

13906125
equals	gethashcode
2 since you re having your own equals now override gethashcode and to be consistent with various equality checking override equals as well
3 overloading and operators need not be religiously done since the compiler will warn if you unintentionally equate a struct with another with a or but its good to do so to be consistent with equals methods

13908059
client-side	server-side
some things to consider the speed of the heartbeat is not dependent on your client-side javascript code alone
there may be issues with your server-side php code

13909801
postgresql	mysql
you might have some issues with postgresql not standing for the sort of sloppiness that mysql will though
you can do the same sort of thing but you ll have to switch to the pg gem as mysql2 only knows how to talk to mysql

13911760
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6
for a short intro to porting vba vb6 to vbscript see here
the primary point to remember is most of these topics adodb excel scripting runtime are not vbscript specific

13912794
implements	extends
another option is looking for businesstask which is implements in activiti this will keep you inside activiti and bpmn which has the advantadge of being a standard
in case you still want to extends it i think it makes more sense not to mess up with the code

13914781
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
when viewdidload is called the view has only been loaded into the memory and has not been drawn to the screen yet which causes such problems
i would suggest doing it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

13915359
ienumerable	icollection
ienumerable is fine that can t alter the collection
icollection is not

13916017
equals	gethashcode
that will just put the two images in the same bucket and use the equals method to find the right image
it doesn t matter what data you use for key in a hashset or dictionary but you need to implement a gethashcode and an equals method for it

13926793
super	extends	super	implements
for example i had to extends the osmdroid mapview then implements my offline map tile source from the super entirely
note you have to super the 1st line in an extended constructor because object methods aren t available until after the inherited constructor is complete so any super method calls have to be to static methods

13928669
coalesce	isnull
however it isn t part of sql standard - as some of the answers on isnull vs coalesce suggest
or edit over a large number of rows isnull seems to be faster

13931958
bufferedreader	ioexception
i suggest you use bufferedreader and printwriter and as little else as possible
btw printwriter doesn t throw ioexception which is not ideal you have to checkerror to see if it failed or not

13934318
prepare	execute
secure all business services with rolesallowed admin_role user_role annotations prepare your own clientsideacessdeniedexception that can be used on client side in a case of spring acessdeniedexception propogate clientsideacessdeniedexception to client side on client side set up uncaughtexceptionhandler via gwt.setuncaughtexceptionhandler in uncaughtexceptionhandler detect customacessdeniedexception and then show error to user
pure gwt solution do not use http element at all http tag from config namespace define your authenticationrpcservice add authenticationrpcservice.authenticate user password method inject into authenticationserviceimpl authenticationprovider bean from security-context.xml implement authenticationrpcservice.authenticate user password as ensure that spring security filter chain is execute during processing of each your gwt rpc call to be sure that securitycontext populated into securitycontextholder

13934444
ienumerable	iqueryable
i also advice you to see what is the deference between ienumerable vs iqueryable
i m not 100 sure but as i remember you get an ienumerable result when you call an sp using ef datacontext.

13942709
factors	matrix
x and y can be modified by multiplication with a scaling factors
my approach uses the first and the fourth equation assuming that matrix a b y can be inverted solution of equations 16 - 19 can be found via gaussian elimination. from y calculate x via 8 the resulting solution - if the set of linear equations 16 - 19 has a solution - is not unique

13943940
google-chrome	firefox
you can find many articles of indexeddb performance but mostly reserches and developers are saying that idb perform faster with sql as a backend. comparing to google-chrome implementation where idb is implemented on the top of leveldb which is nosql is much more slower comparing to firefox
on the another end websql depreciated is performing fast in google-chrome in firefox not supported anymore

13945123
ssl	https
so have several q a answers regarding this process two-way password encryption without ssl secure login public key encryption in php and javascript however options #2 is not really an options if the encryption key are also submitted in plain text over the internet
you have several options here use https protocol to send the login informations

13945807
pascal	delphi
the pascal is a line-by-line port with with unsigned char going to byte
i have only run the pascal in free pascal with delphi option turned on not delphi itself

pascal	delphi
i have only run the pascal in free pascal with delphi option turned on not delphi itself
both c and pascal have simple file processors

google-chrome	safari
and will work on any web page if jquery is not included also on google-chrome firefox and safari browsers where returns first element of selector passed
here is document.queryselector is document.queryselectorall they are native functions of google-chrome and firefox browsers you can see and definition in safari as well

backgrounding	multitasking
your app cannot request additional backgrounding execution time from this method
there is no way to prevent the app from showing up in multitasking bar

13957816
clang	llvm
this can be done in several ways i do not remember offhand whether they work with 3.1 but they definitely work with 3.2 make a link from clang to your-target-triple-clang to arm-none-linux-gnueabi-clang and compile everything via it provide -target option clang -target arm-none-linux-gnueabi
-march is llvm s internal tools command line option and is not connected with clang at all

13960155
openssl	m2crypto
finally use ctypes to hack at ssl context at runtime and load cert ket from a buffer following the c recipe read certificate files from memory instead of a file using openssl things like these have been done before but it s not for the faintest of heart
if you are not picky on ssl implementation you can use m2crypto tls lite pyopenssl or something else

13960625
octal	hex
octal does not map well to 8 bit bytes because each octal digit represents three bits so there will always be excess bits representable in the octal notation
an all-true-bits byte 1111 1111 is 377 in octal but ff in hex

13962761
apache	nginx
if memory isn t an issue on your dev box choose apache it s faster to get up and going
if you need your server go as fast as possible nginx is a good choice

13962949
sudo	passwd
although your ssh login works without a passwd you also need to configure sudo on your target server so that it doesn t require a passwd
since you only need for the master user to be able to run commands as the appmanager user you can handle this completely through sudo

13963881
implements	extends
my first question is when i remove implements serializable from any of my classes a notserializableexception is not thrown
they are all extends serializable classes but shouldn t they themselves have to be serializable as well

13964362
cpython	pypy
probably none of these will affect you but you should check. if there s any heavy application logic as opposed to all of the work being networking files database ironpython is much faster than cpython at a few things and much slower at a few others so you probably need to profile and perf-test before you go too far down either path
and consider at least pypy if not jython while you re at it but usually this isn t an issue for servers

13964806
setinterval	settimeout
and if you do use setinterval settimeout in animations clocks etc always measure the really elapsed time with date objects via date.now
the rate of setinterval cannot be trusted

13964977
oncreate	setcontentview
you cannot call oncreate manually it is the same reason why you won t call setcontentview twice
as docs oncreate bundle is where you initialize your activity

13965061
heroku	engineyard
but at small scale especially during the early rapid iteration of a product using something like heroku means you can focus entirely on your application and have a minimum of worry about infrastructure
one exception is if you have a lot of linux sysadmin chops then heroku may not be worth the cost even early and in that case you might be more comfortable with something like engineyard that still provides you with a full rails stack out of the box but keeps you closer to the metal

in any case though heroku is a great place to start for a rails beginner

13965387
macports	homebrew
macports uses a separate opt local as it s root as samuel indicates while brew will use usr local homebrew also avoids using sudo unlike macports
homebrew while having less packages available it still my packager of choice early experiences of it are not so nice but at this point it s mature and stable bear the dates in mind when you do your research

13965794
lxml	beautifulsoup
see this section in the docs for a better overview but the likely reason that it works for two other people is that they have lxml or another parser that handles the html properly installed meaning that beautifulsoup uses it instead of the standard built-in side note your example works for me as well on a system with lxml installed but fails on one without it
also see this note in the docs if you re using a version of python 2 earlier than 2.7.3 or a version of python 3 earlier than 3.2.2 it s essential that you install lxml or html5lib python s built-in html parser is just not very good in older versions

13967517
google-chrome	firefox
pdfs in firefox are forced as a download while in google-chrome they are displayed to the user you
if you had a browser plugin in firefox for pdf rendering you wouldn t get the download dialogue there either

13976475
google-chrome	safari
there is 3 things to take in consideration the margin of the page s rule unfortunately has no effect on safari 6 where it does in google-chrome 23
as i know as long as safari is not supporting this there is no solution it seems to be fixed to around 10mm

13980135
spaces	delimiter
spaces
function trim ws-s4 end-display but i like the string verb delimiter by answer as it ll work with most if not all compilers

13982508
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
appdelegate.m - this method is not available pre-ios6 unfortunately myviewcontroller.m - return whatever orientations you want to support for each uiviewcontroller
the best way for ios6 specifically is noted in ios6 by tutorials by the ray wenderlich team - and is better than subclassing uinavigationcontroller for most cases

13985703
git-svn	svn2git
so one can directly use git-svn for cloning fetching changesets and etc.. but it s better to have one single script tool to help us do all our operations during the migration and hence the need for such tools
i used svn2git wrapper script hosted on for subversion to git migration and it helped for sure especially when we wanted to pull changesets from our subversion repository at periodic intervals as we did not completely shutdown the subversion repo for obvious reasons

13986604
gif	png
so if you do not want to make an animated gif which you suppose it is you can just do it inside your xna code
take a png or gif with alpha-channel so that the non-text is transparent

13988551
nsstring	nsobject
actually there is the traditional way from the time before there was nsobject to not not use nsstring literals but instead work with the cfstr macro like so cfstr c_string is the shortest method to create a cfstringref and much shorter than __bridge cfstringref nsstring also if somebody sees this code you get higher geek cred for knowing cfstr
it smells of n00b to create an nsstring literal then convert that into a cfstringref and needing to add arc memory management ownership transferance tags..

13989286
factories	presenter
the easiest solution would be by introducing the view as property on the presenter downside of this is that you need to configure each presenter as it is injected into the view so you could also move this to a base class another option is to inject a presenter factories into the view and request it from there downside is that this constructor calls a factories which is not the cleanest thing to do but manageable
there are several solutions to this problem but all of them break the dependency cycle by removing either the presenter or the view from as constructor dependency

13993216
client-side	server-side
client-side validation isn t a security measure it s just a better user experience
server-side validation is the only real validation

13993732
udp	tcp
using udp using udp corruption shouldn t be a surprise
you probably don t want to be using udp here you should switch to tcp

13993732
udp	tcp
you probably don t want to be using udp here you should switch to tcp
here s why udp is not appropriate here packets may be lost but others could still reach their destination

13993732
udp	tcp
here s why udp is not appropriate here packets may be lost but others could still reach their destination
packets may be duplicated packets may arrive in the wrong order note that switching to tcp will involve some refactoring of your code it s a bit more complicated that just replacing sock_dgram with sock_stream but in your case you have to do it

13995354
namenode	hdfs
add to this that the namenode is probably getting hammered by all of these different threads and so it might become a bottleneck
so to answer your question yes if you use hdfs for something it s not designed to be used for it s going to be slow

13995985
google-chrome	firefox
when you access the app within facebook https is used to transfer the data but google-chrome has blocked content delivered over normal http as a result and insists that everything be transfered securely whereas firefox isn t so fussy
here s what the console is showing in google-chrome google s js api has been blocked and the javascript fails to run

13997865
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome will clear with a 403 forbidden or a 401 not authorized
safari will always prompt you if you want to cache or not

13998072
hex	binary
just take two characters from the string treat them as hex convert them to the correct byte and write them to a file
write binary not textually you don t want to add additional line-breaks in there pdf is too binary to let that work

13998152
bash	subshell
will do this set the variable for the following command run bash with the 2 arguments -c and echo hello since the last argument is enclosed in single quotes anything inside it is not expanded the new bash in turn will run the command to run echo hello in the new bash subshell bash first expands anything it can hello in this case and the parent shell set that to hello world for us
the subshell runs echo hello world if you tried to do this the current shell would expand anything it can which is nothing since hello is enclosed in single quotes run env with the 3 arguments hello hello world echo and hello the env command will run and set the hello hello world in its environment env will run echo with the argument hello in this case there s no shell that will expand the hello so echo receives the string and prints out that
