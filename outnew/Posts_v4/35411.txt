implements	extends
we will put sfinae in that trait and use that trait after the type void_t can be implements like this with c++11 compatibility now we can implements the operator++ of your class in a mixin now to conditionally implements the operator++ function you can use std conditional with our trait now since you extends the mixin only if the type is matching the type trait you only get the operator++ if tid has the increment operator
you end up extends dummy if not which don t have the operator implements

40004855
multiplication	modulo
however in those cases you can speed it enormously again by rewriting it as print sum pow 3 k 8 for k in range 201000 8 internally pow 3 k 8 still does a number of multiplication proportional to the number of bits in k but doesn t need to retain any integers internally larger than about 8 2 the square of the modulo
the only optimization at work is that each instance of is evaluated using a number of multiplication proportional to the number of bits in k it does not multiply 3 by itself k-1 times

40008588
swift	objective-c
string.encoding is a swift struct which cannot be passed to objective-c world
when swift find such things in any it generates _swiftvalue which is completely useless in objective-c

40008745
shadowing	named
the correct mindset is to design your function to consume input from and only from its parameters in signature that way you don t need to care what is or will be in global scope and then shadowing becomes not an issue at all
in other words shadowing problem only matters when your function need to use the same named local variable and the global variable

40008789
postgresql	mysql
for oracle use ora format etc to_char postgresql function to convert date value to string begin_exam the date field to be formatted the format string cannot be passed as is so that the literal method is used to wrap it
note the above example is tested on mysql database with mysql function and corresponding date format

40015596
onresume	onpause
here we ve registered the broadcastreceiver in onresume method and unregistered it in onpause so its not active when the activity isn t
we re also updating the isconnected status in onresume because we may or may not receive a networkstatechange before the isconnected is first used

40016189
realloc	malloc
if there is not enough room to enlarge the memory allocation pointed to by ptr realloc creates a new allocation copies as much of the old data pointed to by ptr as will fit to the new allocation frees the old allocation and returns a pointer to the allocated memory
if ptr is null realloc is identical to a call to malloc for size bytes

40020822
swift	objective-c
unfortunately swift s struct types do not bridge to objective-c
to use the swift-to-objective-c bridging you will need to write swift code to further process the newsresponse type

40023586
swift	objective-c
you can make it as macro for convenience. code swift class
objective-c class but as i understand it is not supported and you may have any sort of bugs because of it

40025022
build.gradle	gradlew
i generated a sample project to exemplify with gradlew init --type java-library then edited build.gradle to this has the following result note that the hamcrest dependency is shown by gradlew dependencies but it s not printed
this is because the dependencies are not resolved at configuration time so gradlew does not yet know about the transitive dependencies

40027223
swift	objective-c
indexpath is a value type in swift defined with the struct keyword so it cannot have an objective-c associated object
so even if you have set a value to subrow of an nsindexpath in objective-c code the value is lost when that nsindexpath is casted to swift s indexpath

40027292
qthread	qobject
as noted by mike the qthread s used by qtconcurrent run do not have event loops
qthread is not documented to automatically move any qobject s when it finishes so i think we can already conclude that it does no such thing

40027292
qthread	qobject
when a qthread is destroyed the objects that lived in it cease to have any thread affinity
the documentation doesn t guarantee this and in fact says you must ensure that all objects created in a thread are deleted before you delete the qthread . let s say i call qtconcurrent run which runs a function in a worker thread and in that function i dynamically allocate several qobject for later use

40027292
qthread	qobject
the qthread does not terminate in this scenario
when a task spawned by qtconcurrent run finishes the qthread it was running in is returned to the qthreadpool and may be reused by a subsequent call to qtconcurrent run and qobject s living in that qthread continue to live there

40028839
libstdc++	libc++
libstdc++ treats the source elements as const because begin and end are called on they return constant iterators
libc++ treats the source elements as non- const __begin_ and __end_ are pointer s and since const is shallow the const -ness of __x doesn t make the pointee const

40029146
swift	objective-c
i totally see the point for this and i d like this feature too but to my knowledge swift 3 at least does not offer it neither does objective-c to my knowledge
one solution for this would be to deprecate the entire protocol and produce a new protocol you need to declare conformance to in your swift 3 code

40031187
google-chrome	safari
if you select the debug in google-chrome or debug in safari options from the rage shake menu + +z it will log to the browser s console instead
option #2 as of react native 0.29 you ll be able to simply run the following to see logs on the command line react-native log-ios react-native log-android option #3 cmd + d to bring up the debug menu set debug in safari turned off and some messages would be printed to the output message but not console messages

40031316
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the reason i ask is that we used to write code that assumed that viewwillappear of the prior vc and viewwilldisappear of the current one would always precede viewdidappear and viewdiddisappear respectively
but this is no longer true with interactive transitions because viewwillappear disappear will be called when you start a transition but the corresponding viewdidappear disappear may not if the interactive transition is cancelled

40031316
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but this is no longer true with interactive transitions because viewwillappear disappear will be called when you start a transition but the corresponding viewdidappear disappear may not if the interactive transition is cancelled
in fact when introducing this concept at wwdc 2013 the presenter joked that they should rename viewwillappear to viewmightappear or viewwillprobablyappear or ireallywishthisviewwouldappear

40033033
keystore	jks
explicit 2 read just the cert from a file using certificatefactory of type x.509 create a keystore in memory no keystore file and put the cert in it and then proceed as in explicit 1. if you need multiple trusted certs you can read each one and put them all in memory but this quickly becomes more work than reading a single keystore file containing all of them
middle put the cert in a keystore file and set system properties javax.net.ssl.truststore and ...truststorepassword and ...truststoretype if not the default jks or in java8 also pkcs12 to point to it before the first creation of an ssl socket

40034071
super	self
calling super methods from already constructed type is impossible you can do it only from the inside
in your example you re trying to call foo on the instance self which is constructed in runtime so foo is virtual and could be overridden - compiler doesn t know which actual implementation is going to be called formal vs real type problem

40035189
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
note you need to set tag with you imageview not with you uitapgesturerecognizer
the problem is with your method declaration and with assigning tag to the object of uigesturerecognizer

40037689
qthread	qobject
implementation of makes clear that qobject s thread affinity is not changed by qthread
no qt doesn t automatically move qobject into the parent thread

40038928
apache	nginx
although such an option exists in typo3 cms it is not a cms job but rather server s job apache nginx etc.
so if you have an nginx server it can be done with following configuration and probably it is already turned on in etc nginx nginx.conf gzip on

40042473
portrait	landscape
to do that take help of media queries and check the orientation in the landscape stylesheet style_landscape.css hide everything and show a message that your app can t be opened on landscape and the user must revert to portrait mode to continue
sorry you can not force orientation on a web page but you can show some information in content when user is in landscape mode

40045726
xslt	schematron
note that when you run the schematron stylesheets for xslt 1 processors a different code base is used which does not have this bug
the xslt 1 equivalent to iso_schematron_skeleton_for_saxon.xsl is iso_schematron_skeleton_for_xslt1.xsl

40047235
client-side	server-side
so while yes the ringcentral php sdk can be used with authorization flow i personally would recommend against using it for any end-user client-side multi-tenant application development unless you have properly prepared for mapping the sessions to the sdk subscription instances as i described earlier
if you do not want to manage all of that on your server-side you could use the ringcentral js sdk on the client-side of your php application but this might get a little messy and require some re-architecting of your solution depending upon how you have things built

40048457
spaces	delimiter
to deal with the new types of white spaces introduced in unicode utf-8 a more extensive string is required to match and removed modern white spaces
because regular expressions by default do not recognize multi-byte characters only a delimiter meta string can be used to identify them to prevent the byte segments from being alters in other utf-8 characters x80 in the quad set could replace all x80 sub-bytes in smart quotes this accounts for and removes tabs newlines vertical tabs formfeeds carriage returns spaces and additionally from here nextline non-breaking spaces mongolian vowel separator en quad em quad en spaces em spaces three-per-em spaces four-per-em spaces six-per-em spaces figure spaces punctuation spaces thin spaces hair spaces zero width spaces zero width non-joiner zero width joiner line separator paragraph separator narrow no-break spaces medium mathematical spaces word joiner ideographical spaces and the zero width non-breaking spaces

40052293
sml	scheme
for example sml has an exception due to the overloading of operators has the two types and and the overloading resolution rules cause the compiler to decide on if the context does not impose float
a value whose principal type scheme contains at least one variable is said to be polymorphic

40052590
lisp	scheme
insisting on car and cdr allows scheme to be a lisp but nil being the list terminator and false rules it out
so based on the above ecmascript isn t a dialect of lisp

40053023
ubuntu	linux
the ubuntu 14.04 ami doesn t have the aws-cli tool installed nor the unzip command out of the box nor docker for that matter -- so you d need to read over and run in order to get up and running
the aws linux ami has a lot more bells whistles out of the box

40055926
vim	emacs
vim s closest equivalent vim doesn t have any direct equivalent of this but here is a way to get the same effect
this method takes four more keystrokes than in emacs

40056444
swift	objective-c
to the podfile to say that you are fine with making them all frameworks in order to support swift
the swift pods being used are alamofire googleplaces and objectmapper you may be writing in objective-c but the pods you want to use are not

40058601
sum	coalesce
you just need to sum the results wich can also be done combining the two queries
first of all - the part case when d.report_date is not null then d.report_date else t.billed_date end can be written shorter as coalesce d.report_date t.billed_date or as ifnull d.report_date t.billed_date in your first query you are using a column alias in the where clause wich is not allowed

40061350
bash	zsh
1 technically bash is in violation of posix here as is zsh since eval is a special shell built-in the preceding assignment should cause the the variable to remain in scope after the command finishes but that s not what happens
however when you run bash in posix compatibility mode it is compliant

40062926
spaces	delimiter
consider using stata s insheet command specifying the spaces delimiter
do note this is a coded solution to be used in .do file or command window and not via stata s gui menu per your screenshot clear insheet using path to data.txt delimiter initial output below uses your linked file and you will notice an unnamed v9 column outputs

40063696
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the results see on codepen and on my server perfect result on google-chrome 53 opera 40 firefox 49 eye icons are 30 below the screen on but may look like intended
safari for windows 5.1.7 i couldn t test it on safari 10 since i don t own any apple device

40063696
google-chrome	safari
samsung browser samsung galaxy s3 really subtile jumpy effect of the background image on when animation triggers google-chrome for android samsung galaxy s3 bad strangenesses in the animation but both minimised and expanded states are ok explorer 11 i hate ie
for browsers that doesn t support viewport units vh vw etc. like safari for windows and samsung browser i found saabi a css polyfill to almost get it right

40063998
ionic	angular
i ve been exploring the same thing and it seems as though the angular 2 aot compiler at least the version used by ionic 2 rc0 isn t exactly compatible with pre-release builds of typescript 2.1 at this point
if you revert to typescript 2.0 which is the version used by ionic 2 rc0 it will work

40065549
google-chrome	firefox
in this case it seems the image in the input determines its implied minimum size in google-chrome but not in firefox
if you use min-width 0 in google-chrome it will behave like firefox

40069762
swift	objective-c
i think the problem is that your objective-c code does not know the open var s datasource and delegate of the liquidfloatingbutton swift code
to make them known a objective-c header file is required that exposes these swift infos to your objective-c code

40070460
tiff	bmp	tiff	pgm
this pixel values mis-match can happen for compressed image format like jpg png tiff etc
it should not happen for uncompressed format like pgm bmp or in raw format

40073804
client-side	server-side
angular is developed to work on the client-side
hence you cannot use it on the server-side for templating

40076764
bash	subshell	zsh	subshell
you don t need to turn to setting the prompt to reproduce it bash doesn t share zsh s behaviour here
the annoying bit is that prompt expansion also happens in a subshell so you can t just fix this by referencing in say precmd

40077115
factors	matrix
xts is based on zoo and the zoo faq question 4 has this line about differing data types a zoo object may be 1 a numeric vector 2 a numeric matrix or 3 a factors but may not contain both a numeric vector and factors
so as long as your 0s and 1s are numeric not factors you should be ok

40077700
jar	war
avoid webapp folder with spring boot spring boot documentation says do not use the src main webapp directory if your application will be packaged as a jar
although this directory is a common standard it will only work with war packaging and it will be silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar

40082246
client-side	server-side
if your public key was hard-coded and un-obfuscated in the app it may be able to replace it with its own public key enabling any client-side validation to return truthy
of course any server-side validation would still fail the google play developer api wouldn t even recognise the purchase token

40088246
ssl	https
also check that your ssl certificate is valid
looks like your port is 443 because your url protocol is https and you aren t specifying a port so it must be the default ssl port

40088342
swift	objective-c
swift initialisation is one of the most confusing part of the language especially if you re coming from objective-c
the short answer is that unlike objective-c initializers swift initializers do not return a value

40091373
bash	tcsh
for instance to set the merge message to hello world you could use git merge --no-ff -m hello world assuming a typical shell such as bin sh or bin bash that allows embedded newlines in quoted strings
this method does not work in tcsh for instance

40093737
richtextbox	textblock
update i think you originally were talking about a textblock not a richtextbox
if the solution absolutely requires a richtextbox you ll need to look into finding a usable rtf parser somewhere

40096028
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
if the value returned by malloc calloc realloc isn t null then it s a valid pointer value and using it will not invoke ub regardless of the bookkeeping behind it
the funny part is that every modern malloc implementation out there will happily reuse allocations that have been previously freed

40097644
onkeyup	onkeydown
so you need onkeydown which can cause problems if enter is down even after the next page loads or onkeyup
dijana s solution is right but the action onkeyup should be used and not onkeypress

40100586
move	drag
working fiddle if you want to move the iframe around the document you need to move the entire iframe not the event.target
to move a iframe when to drag an element inside iframe you need to call a method in the parent document to move the entire iframe

40106542
implements	extends
implements services using atl is covered at atl services
to handle control requests that a default atl-generated service wouldn t you need to extends the default-generated handler implementation

40108507
swift	objective-c
you can mix objective-c and c++ code in objective-c++ and can expose objective-c methods that don t reference c++ in their declarations to swift via the bridging wrapper
these functions can still use c++ in their implementations which are not visible in swift via the bridging header

40112262
fgets	fread
using fread and fwrite would give you direct binary i o no null termination for example but would use the same i o buffers as functions such as printf and fgets
you get hybrid behaviour when using these it is normally best to use either fread fwrite or the text i o functions on a single file stream and not both but mixing them is permissible relatively simple to understand and occasionally useful

40112598
ssl	https
there s no sense of using ssl if you re planning to bomb all ssl certificates that comes
a better solution would be not using ssl or a better solution would be creating a custom trustmanager on your app + using android volley for http https connections

40112598
ssl	https
a better solution would be not using ssl or a better solution would be creating a custom trustmanager on your app + using android volley for http https connections
here s a gist which i created with a basic loginapp performing https connections using a self-signed certificate on the server-side accepted on the app

40112847
equals	gethashcode
then it was only a matter of tweaking the parameters so that 32bit and 64bit platforms give a similar but not equals result
once i managed to debug the udf running on sql server i was finally able to figure out that the algorithm i m using to hash a given string relies on .net s gethashcode method

40113431
google-chrome	firefox
you cannot -- liveedit plugin works with google-chrome browser only
if it has to be firefox

40114427
ubuntu	linux
i had something like this and it was working on my environment mac os but not on the deployment server ubuntu
remember that linux is case sensitive

40117897
hex	binary
your needs may vary but in my experience a serial bootloader using uart using xmodem and decoding an image in intel hex format takes about 4kb of flash
on an stm32l0 you may want to use something simpler - 1kb is probably feasible if you simply stream raw binary the data and use hardware flow control you need to control data flow because erasing and programming the flash takes time and also stops the cpu from running because you cannot on stm32 write flash memory while simultaneously fetching instructions from it

40121901
build.gradle	gradlew
this is not an answer for the op but may be of use to others who get the error gradlew dsl method not found apply in my case the problem turned out to be the encoding of the build.gradle file
i had edited the file in a text editor and it got saved as utf-8-bom which gradlew apparently doesn t accept

40126764
client-side	server-side
jst is a server-side thing not client-side
this mean that you compile unserscore template on server side by some server-side script and save the result in a file

40129680
email	dkim
even if your servers are not yet in rbls if you send a forged email like that and proper email security is set up at the recipient end your email will still have a good chance to get classified as spam
have a look at things like spf and dkim

40134499
mongodb	bson
the following example shows this for mongodb versions which do not support the operator as an alternative you can get the top 5 by limiting the number of documents getting into the pipeline using the operator and this should be placed after the pipeline on ordered documents
because the ground_speed field has a mixture of numerical and string values empty string the operator returns the maximum value since it compares both value and type using the specified bson comparison order for values of different types

40136432
firefox	safari
the border width of the machine div is not reported correctly in firefox
you should replace with when testing in safari the lines were not positioned correctly and the start position of the pallets was at the top of the window

40136948
prng	random
in particular your numbers will not have any appearance of randomness at all if you seed the prng with the same seed before generating each number
but more subtle problems arise even if you seed the prng with different seeds before generating each number including if you instantiate a new random instead of reusing an existing one

40141741
google-chrome	firefox
there are also some parts that firefox has implemented that google-chrome has not for instance
ie and firefox implement the svg 1.1 definition of rect elements where x y width and height are attributes google-chrome implements the svg 2 definition of rect elements where x y width and height are mapped css properties when you create the x axes you specify the d as an attribute rather than a css property so that s why that works svg 2 is still in draft uas are experimenting with implementing different parts of it

40142673
ssl	https
one thing to note when checking the scheme be warned that this wont work if you decide to offload ssl to a load balancer
in that case your application will always receive http not https requests

40143074
swift	objective-c
since swift 3 the first parameter is no longer longer unnamed by default
you cannot call donothing squared and sum from swift code like this donothing 5 squared 5 sum 5 5 you must include the argument names donothing num 5 squared num 5 sum a 5 5 argument name not required for b because it is _ those methods get the objective-c selectors donothingwithnum squaredwithnum and sumwitha

40143264
swift	objective-c
my original swift 3 answer is below
you said but in thinking about this i don t think this will work for primitives of swift objects such as int which i assume do not inherit from nsobject and unlike the objective-c version won t be boxed into nsnumber when placed into the change dictionary

40145452
postgresql	mysql
django does not run on postgresql it can work with it as a database
but django can work with many other databases as well mysql sqlite etc

40147177
httpclient	okhttp
use the okhttp library instead of httpurlconnection or httpclient
okhttp does not support digest out of the box but there s a library okhttp-digest that implements a digest authenticator

40148138
margin	text-align
centering a block in css using margin 0 auto does not work
note on ie up to ie 7 setting align center in html or text-align center in css for a div incorrectly centers any inner block element as a whole even in standards mode

40150371
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so what you should do is push all the uiviewcontroller in a single uinavigationcontroller or use uitabbarcontroller if you want multiple uinavigationcontroller and this should solve your problem
if you try to push a uinavigationcontroller in another uinavigationcontroller it does not do push it does present that is why you are not able to see a back button because back button only appears in push

40152067
dictionary	map
i m using python3 which means that i have to do a lot of ugly list casting this produces this is not pythonic at all filter and map are much more at home in list comprehensions like the following let me know if you also need to flatten the list after getting the dictionary values
it looks to me like you are trying to do a map operation with your filter showing a bit of a misunderstanding

40156648
ng-switch	ng-show
if i need both conditional and boolean logic i prefer to put in the conditional logic using ng-if as the first check then add in an additional check for the boolean logic with ng-show and ng-hide howerver if you want to use a conditional for ng-show or ng-hide here is a link with some examples conditional display using ng-if ng-show ng-hide ng-include ng-switch
i generally try to avoid expressions with ng-show and ng-hide as they were designed as booleans not conditionals

40159647
floating-point	fractions
because binary floating-point math cannot precisely represent numbers that are nice in decimal such as 0.16
in binary this is a repeating fractions that never terminates and as such cannot be precisely represented in finite memory

40164163
build.gradle	gradlew
here is how i import a grails 3 app into community edition first use sdkman to get grails - sdk use grails 3.2.1 grails create-app mytestapp then import existing project select the build.gradle file check use auto import use gradlew wrapper you can run it by using the bootrun gradlew task in the gradlew toolbar or going to the application.groovy file and running the main method
to see some of the run configs in action you can watch - though i would recomend running gradlew from inside intellij not via the command line

40167648
namenode	hdfs
if your file is raw text binary you can try the concatenation api which only manipulate metadata in namenode without copying data
but if your file is parquet gzip lzo or else these files can t not be simply concated you have to download them from hdfs merge them into one and upload the merged one

40177740
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
- docker it is great at building and sharing disk images with others through the docker index docker is a manager for infrastructure today s bindings are for linux containers but future bindings including kvm hyper-v xen etc. docker is a great image distribution model for server templates built with configuration managers like chef puppet saltstack etc docker uses btrfs a copy-on-write filesystems to keep track of filesystems diff s which can be committed and collaborated on with other users like git docker has a central repository of disk images public and private that allow you to easily run different operating systems ubuntu centos fedora even gentoo - virtualenv it isolates the python interpreter and the python dependencies on one machine so you can install multiple python projects alongside each other with their own dependencies
but for the rest of the machine the virtualenv doesn t do anything you still have global dependencies packages that are installed using your mac os x linux package manager and these are shared between the virtualenvs

40178757
innodb	myisam
creating tables with innodb s engine makes everything work perfectly
solution found the default storage engine myisam that i ssetted while creating a mysql table cannot deal with multiple statement transactions

40181634
build.gradle	gradlew
add latest gradlew version properly in build.gradle file and latest distributionurl in gradle-wrapper.properties file
refer for the latest gradlew version of android studio make sure network connectivity is proper network connection should not block upgrading gradlew in android studio

40181905
division	subtraction
not as elegant as sehnsuchts use of the division style and problably not as efficient the euclidean meat is the last three matches while the first four take care of values lesser than or equal to zero
just for the sport here is a version using the subtraction version of the euclidean algorithm

40183215
union	distinct
if you are content to let union handle removing duplicates you can do alternatively you can exclude pre-existing data2 matches and use concat otoh i couldn t resist some timings
if we call using union as 1 using concat varies from 73 of the time creating hashsets uses 827 of the time and pulling the unique pair set out takes 54 and skipping the distinct takes 27 though the dataset is too slow to tell differences in some of these

40185238
vmware	virtualbox
other than the mac-like weirdness of the unity interface ubuntu is easy to get used to and vmware is free
i wouldn t bother with virtualbox the versions i ve tried including the latest have been flaky

40187463
super	self
if the base classes don t also all use super it won t work and unless the method is in object you have to use something like a common base class to terminate the chain of super calls
class foobase object def foo self pass class a foobase def foo self super a self .foo print a.foo class b foobase def foo self super b self .foo print b.foo class c a b def foo self super c self .foo print c.foo c .foo # run this but it is also worth to point out that the method calling order may not seem intuitive at the first thought

40191587
getchar	fgetc
people prefer getchar only in situations when they read from standard input
there is no reason why one wouldn t replace it with getc fgetc when reading from a file is needed

40191721
google-chrome	firefox
what you described is a known issue of google-chrome related to the fact that google-chrome doesn t support the sizes attribute
firefox also used to be impacted and it still doesn t support sizes

40192264
exponent	modulo
one might guess that the exponent is 65537 but you need to verify that
you can turn your rsa modulo into a biginteger by using the sign-magnitude biginteger constructor and then create an rsa public key via the rsapublickeyspec class not the x509encodedkeyspec class

40192586
google-chrome	firefox
rounding up means the calculated values would become 63px and 67px and this wouldn t visibly show any problems because the color on all sides are the same and so they just overlap and fill the space google-chrome also shows no issues when we explicitly set these values for background size - refer second div
firefox seems to have a comprehensive rounding logic which seems to round up some while some other get rounded down in-order to completely fill space and hence shows no issues too

40192708
xslt	xquery
its disadvantage is that a it s very oriented to xslt 1.0 and that makes it hard to take advantage of new capabilities in xslt 2.0 and xslt 3.0 and b it doesn t integrate especially well with apis for related tasks such as schema processing and xpath evaluation
the s9api api is much more closely matched to saxon s capabilities across a variety of tasks including xslt xquery xpath and xsd validation but isn t portable

different data sources can access rdf files .trig files or be totally dynamic - meaning they re built on the fly from some other source of data - databases remote urls - this is dependent on the specific data source and not a characteristic of rdf itself
in short if by data you refer to assertions about individuals what in owl is known as an abox this data can be contained in the rdf itself but this is simply how it s presented to code using it

build.gradle	gradlew
in previous version i haven t this problem and default gradlew path was ... sdk tools proguard update way 2 in below image and step 4 you can browse and select proguardfile for debug or release and in build.gradle module app file proguardfile path add automatically
way 1 finally test several way i found should set complete path to proguard file like below config in build.gradle module app and not need to using getdefaultproguardfile before path

40197576
build.gradle	gradlew
way 1 finally test several way i found should set complete path to proguard file like below config in build.gradle module app and not need to using getdefaultproguardfile before path
too you can paste your config file to ... appname app and chnage gradlew file to proguardfile configfilename.txt actually default path is ... appname app and if you put just configfilename this search file name in default project path

40197880
viewdidload	viewdidappear
first of all if you use autolayout in viewdidload method which is related to uiviewcontroller and its subclasses and awakefromnib which is related to uiview and uitableviewcell etc all views frames have not been rendered yet while those methods called
so if you want to resize any of outlets you should call it in viewdidappear for uiviewcontroller

40198149
nfa	dfa
in the state table of an nfa each will transit to a set of states
when you take a dfa reset it to it s start state a sequence of input symbols and you know exactly what end state it s in and whether it s a success state or not

40207104
dplyr	purrr
in this case multidplyr isn t really important since the normal dplyr code gives the same error
error in eval expr envir enclos object arr_delay not found using map from purrr on the other hand works fine

40208951
touchesbegan	touchesended
to have the skspritenode rotating add this to touchesbegan to rotate in the opposite direction change cgfloat.pi to -cgfloat.pi you can fidget with the duration to change the duration for a complete rotation
in touchesended to stop the action call removeaction forkey rotatewheel this way the wheels rotation doesn t get affected by the physics world

40209549
ssl	https
https works with respect to domain name not ip so you can organise access but you cannot organise ssl access to
as possible solution if you have certificates self-signed or real for domain example.org you can add to hosts file windows c windows system32 drivers etc hosts or linux etc hosts line like 192.168.99.100 example.org then add those ssl files to nginx configs and run your app

40215138
build.gradle	gradlew
in your project bar left side of your screen goto gradlew scripts and double click on build.gradle file inside that file check your dependencies if your have something similar to this compile com.android.support appcompat-v7 24.2.1 there if you don t have it just copy and paste this there and then rebuild your project
first rebuild your gradlew by doing this if that doesn t work

40225842
sudo	passwd
lets change the root passwd since you cannot understand hashed passwd even if we can see it sudo service mysql stop sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --skip-syslog --skip-networking then run mysql in a new terminal mysql -u root and run the following query after changing the passwd quit the mysql safe mode and start mysql service by mysqladmin shutdown sudo service mysql start
centos redhat from what i read in docs when you run mysql_secure_installation a temporary root passwd is generated and is stored in some log file

40227220
hive	hdfs
you need to understand working of sqoop hive import
import data to hdfs create hive table if not exists load data inpath into table you are getting the error at step 1

40230290
swift	objective-c
as stated in swift documentation you cannot import c++ code directly into swift
instead create an objective-c or c wrapper for c++ code. see

40232296
persistent	transient
according to jls-8.3.1.3 variables may be marked transient to indicate that they are not part of the persistent state of an object
making it transient will exclude it from serialization public transient someclass lastupdatedat

40232991
http	spdy
the client sends the list of protocols that it is capable to speak in order of preference h2 spdy 3.1 http 1.1 and the server picks one protocol among those in that list that it also supports and that match security required constraints
for example if you have an older browser that does not support h2 it will send spdy 3.1 http 1.1 and the server will never pick h2 even if it supports it . if the server does not support spdy the only option left is http 1.1 and this is what constitutes the graceful degradation to http 1.1

40232991
http	spdy
for example if you have an older browser that does not support h2 it will send spdy 3.1 http 1.1 and the server will never pick h2 even if it supports it . if the server does not support spdy the only option left is http 1.1 and this is what constitutes the graceful degradation to http 1.1
there is never the possibility that if the client requested to speak spdy and not http 2 the server replies with http 2 unless gross implementation errors on the server

40232991
http	spdy
there is never the possibility that if the client requested to speak spdy and not http 2 the server replies with http 2 unless gross implementation errors on the server
spdy is being phased out in favor of http 2

40236454
rtp	rtsp
source in contradiction to rtp a rtsp server negotiates the connection between a rtp-server and a client on demand link
the gst-rtsp-server is not a gstreamer plugin but a library which can be used to implement your own rtsp application

40236728
gunicorn	uwsgi
never worked with gunicorn and im not sure if it supports this feature
but with uwsgi when i know that the app is going to be under a heavy load i run uwsgi with --processes can also run in multithread mode or both uwsgi just spins up multiple instances of the flask app and act as a load balancer no need for different ports uwsgi takes care of everything

40244430
rsa	aes
but it is may not necessary to rsa encrypt the symmetric key unless a public private key pair are required
in the general case one just uses symmetric aes and that key

40246751
prepare	execute
the whole idea of a prepare query is that it reduces the overhead of setting up the query each time it s run prepare once execute repeatedly
that means there s not going to be a huge amount of difference from the pov of the database between running a prepare statement in a loop or passing one giant query

40248580
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ended up getting around this by not using a uitabbarcontroller instead creating a customtabbarcontroller which inherits from uiviewcontroller
the custom controller has a uitabbar at the bottom of its view and multiple other uiviewcontroller s embedded in container views

40248813
ssl	https
the problem indicates that port 80 is not handling ssl
https is default port 443 and port 80 is reserved for http

40249858
google-chrome	firefox
with this approach if your next action is to click on any element sometimes you will get an error org.openqa.selenium.webdriverexception element is not clickable at point 411 675 with google-chrome browser
it works fine with firefox

40251997
war	manifest.mf
note there are 3 files present in your new assembled war file that you should be aware of as these files can be downloaded by a web client as static content if you use this setup
jetty bootstrap jettybootstrap.class jetty bootstrap livewarclassloader.class meta-inf manifest.mf the example project is setup in such a way that information present in these bootstrap files should not reveal private or sensitive information about your server or its operations

40252235
haskell	agda
the other answer is super clever please take a moment to upvote it but as someone not familiar with agda how this would be implements in haskell was not obvious to me
here s a full haskell version

40257771
sudo	passwd
if not just set the root passwd by sudo passwd root
cause permission denied seems to be the issue of the passwd maybe you need to double check it

40258319
swift	objective-c
in swift the nonatomic is the default and only choice so it is not required unlike objective-c where atomic is the default but often not the desired behaviour
as for why swift does not offer atomic well i guess it has not been seen as a necessary feature by the language designers

40258844
stateless	stateful
adt is not precisely anemic model as it applies to immutable stateless data
if you read the article martin fowler s approach is oop ood which is stateful by default - that s what he assumes in most of the part of his article by implying that service layer and business layer should have separate states

40261854
ssl	https
it tried to open a new connection which failed silently because of an invalid ssl certificate
you may run into this when you serve using https you do not have a valid ssl certificate which may happen often when you just run a quick local node.js https server your https server closes the connection fast or immediately especially when your https server sends connection close in the response headers you may run into this

40263547
prepare	execute
so for example we could have the following arrays now lets create our prepare statement the variables and are now bound to this statement
now let s create a loop to execute the query multiple times note sqlsrv_execute returns a boolean result as to whether the query was successful or not

40263695
imagemagick	graphicsmagick	imagemagick	libtiff
update and upgrade packages if you want to update your copy of homebrew and update all your packages use remove packages if you want to remove imagemagick use brew rm imagemagick re-install packages with different options if you want to re-install imagemagick with quantum depth 32 q32 for example use brew reinstall imagemagick --with-quantum-depth-32 troubleshooting if you have any problems at all with homebrew just ask the good doctor what is wrong and you will get a report on everything that is not good brew doctor neat packages some of my favourite packages are ack ansiweather arpack astyle atk atkmm autoconf basex bash boost c-ares cairo cairomm cimg cmake coreutils cpanminus libcurl dbus dcraw doxygen eigen epstool exact-image exiftool exiv2 faac feh ffmpeg fftw findutils flac fltk fontconfig fortune freeimage freetype fswatch gawk gcc gd gdb gdbm gdk-pixbuf geoip gettext ghostscript giflib gifsicle gl2ps glib glibmm glpk gmp gnu-sed gnuplot gnutls gobject-introspection graphicsmagick grep gsettings-desktop-schemas gtk+3 harfbuzz hdf5 hicolor-icon-theme hiredis icu4c ilmbase imagemagick imlib2 isl jasper jbig2dec jhead jpeg jpeg-turbo jq lame leptonica lftp libagg libbtbb libcroco libepoxy libevent libexif libffi libgcrypt libgpg-error libgsf libmpc libogg libpng librsvg libsigc++ libsvg libsvg-cairo libtasn1 libtiff libtool libusb libusb-compat libvo-aacenc libvorbis libxml2 libyaml lighttpd little-cms little-cms2 llvm lua lynx lz4 mad matplotlib metis mpfr nanomsg net-snmp netpbm nettle ngrep nmap node numpy octave oniguruma opencv3 openexr openjpeg openjpeg21 openssl orc p7zip pandoc pango pangomm parallel pcre pdfgrep perl perlmagick php56 php56-amqp php56-imagick pixman pkg-config platypus plotutils pngcheck pngcrush pngquant poppler popt potrace pstoedit py2cairo pygobject3 pyqt pyqt5 python python3 qhull qrupdate qscintilla2 qt qt5 rabbitmq-c readline redis rename rocksdb ruby sane-backends sdl shared-mime-info sip smartmontools snappy sox sqlite sqliteman suite-sparse suite-sparse421 svg2png swig szip tag tbb tesseract tmux transfig tree ufraw unixodbc utf8proc veclibfort vips webkit2png webp wget wireshark x264 xmlstarlet xvid xz youtube-dl bar

40265307
google-chrome	firefox
the .close method closes google-chrome and it doesn t throw the nonetype error in firefox but it leaves firefox open
the .quit method closes both browsers but it throws the error for firefox

40265407
ssl	https
serving the page containing the passwords with ssl https helps to protect the passwords inside the page
but the links you provide are for ftp sites and the passwords will be sent unprotected if the user follows the ftp link since ftp itself does not use ssl

40265481
stateless	stateful
these differences with examples are explained in this drools stateful vs stateless post
stateless session that forms the simplest use case not utilizing inference

40265481
stateless	stateful
in case of stateless session it does not respond to changes in the facts post-execution
in case of stateful session is necessary to call the dispose method when you are done with a stateful session unless you are making use of the runtimemanager runtimeengine to get your kiesession

40265481
stateless	stateful
stateless session does not require calling the dispose method
in case of stateful session it provides a variety of methods to cause the engine to fire execute the consequences of rules scheduled for activation

40268519
mvp	presenter
the actually solution is using model viewer presenter pattern mvp which can be visually described using these images for more you can read for an example on javafx have a look on james_d answer here applying mvc with javafx last but not least have a look at the comments here finally if anything is inaccurate feel free to edit
actually the answer for this question seems a little bit complicated it has to do with mvc pattern and it s evolution until now.we will use mvp pattern

40269472
inline	inlining
besides provisions about linkage and duplicate definitions it states the following about the actual inlining of functions with the inline specifier the inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the point of call is to be preferred to the usual function call mechanism
an implementation is not required to perform this inline substitution at the point of call

40278283
decoder	encoder
easiest is to copy timebase from now opened decoder since you are not changing framerates or anything
open encoder

40280126
pdcurses	ncurses
i assumed that the question was about ncurses and the problem is confusion about what the library function does resize terminal and scrolling problem with ncurses back to pdcurses it is odd that it makes the same two calls twice
the pdcurses function makes possibly several tries reducing the given values until they fit - or not the code looks .

40280276
inline	inlining
inline does not mean that function calls are replaced by function bodies
at least it hasn t meant that for the past fifteen-something years optimizers are now way beyond taking orders from the developer and will perform inlining whether or not you specified inline

40280276
inline	inlining
at least it hasn t meant that for the past fifteen-something years optimizers are now way beyond taking orders from the developer and will perform inlining whether or not you specified inline
inline actually means this function may be defined multiple times and the linker should sort it out and keep at most a single definition at the end

40286482
pickle	dill
i think what you wanted to do is to pickle the class instance and bundle up the class description in the pickled object
pickle doesn t pickle a class description but dill does

40292426
g++	gcc
you are invoking gcc instead of g++
this is wrong too calling gcc on c++ files misses several options required to compile and link correctly including but not limited to linking against the c++ standard library

40292535
intersect	contains
to test if a sphere is on one side of the plane or the other project the sphere center onto the plane normal add the radius of the sphere and if that sum is less than the plane distance then it has not intersect
for the other plane lets say the lower plane subtract the radius and test if the sum is greater therefore if both the above tests are true the sphere is contains

40292729
gulp-sass	node-sass
gulp-sass is a wrapper around tool node-sass which is node.js binding to libsass a c c++ implementation of a sass compiler
the above answers did not work for me since i am using gulp-sass

40294092
swift	objective-c
beside the technical reason that the compiler most likely has no means of disambiguating between the module and the clashing class name there it s also confusing for a programmer following platform conventions think of the module name as the name of a product and the types inside as the constituent parts whilst aelog is a good name for a logging framework in swift it would not be an idiomatic name of a type in swift code
name prefixes like ae are just not used in swift for types they re not even necessary for objective-c subclasses you make in swift because the fully qualified name of the class seen by the objective-c runtime actually includes the module name as a prefix

40295694
hive	hdfs
if the hive table on top of hdfs is queried we would see null for both integer and string columns not n
sathiyan- below are my findings after many trials if null string property is not included during sqoop import then nulls are stored as blank for integer columns and blank for string columns in hdfs

40297661
opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
so now i know the difference between any version of ie vs edge google-chrome firefox opera safari
more details here note that i m not really concerned about opera mini false negatives

40299938
tostring	string.format
when you want to do instead is give a specific format for when printing using string interpolation of c# 6 which is just syntactic sugar for string.format you can do it like this using another overload of the console.writeline 3.or if you project to a defined type and not an anonymous type you can override the tostring of the object and then your code from the question will work
when you print it this way it uses the tostring implemented by .net for anonymous types generated by the compiler

40301106
prepare	execute
one major difference between those two and spark s rest interface is that livy and sjs doesn t require jobs to be prepare earlier and packed to jar file
you are just submitting code which will be execute in spark

40304671
setinterval	settimeout
keep only one interval an alternative is to only have one interval active and maintain a state so you can have something like use setinterval when the song finishes
i m not familiar with the api you use for playing the sounds but if it s possible to hook onto the end event you might be able to use simple settimeout when that occurs like so more than one of these if the api does not provide a way to hook onto the finished playing event a better alternative is to combine the last two

40307323
ubuntu	linux
some linux systems will not automatically mount devices that are connected to them like ubuntu but in versions that do you can poke around at the system to get this information
unfortunately i can only answer this for the linux cli as i don t know python well enough first you can get the uuid of your device using blkid determine which uuid is your disk

40308085
g++	gcc
thus you need to use the g++ command to build a c++ program
bluf use g++ not gcc

40309252
libstdc++	libc++
i m not sure why they made that decision needless to say it s understandable in gnu linux because most of the time gnu linux is shipped with libstdc++ from g++
you need to pass this option to select libc++

40309804
udp	tcp
that is actually completely normal as udp does not guarantee the message datagram order not ordered if two messages are sent to the same recipient the order in which they arrive cannot be predicted
just use tcp instead or implement an application level algorithm to buffer and reassemble your data as appropriate

40321073
invokelater	invokeandwait
assuming that this is done within a background thread you first of all wouldn t even use invokeandwait but rather would use invokelater
you d wrap the label5.settext ... in a runnable and pass it into invokelater ...

40321149
ssl	https
when running a website behind ssl all content must be provided behind the ssl protocol
this means that all images css javascript fonts svg and i hope i didn t forget any other external optional content must also be with https and not http

40322256
libstdc++	libc++
your command line does not use libstdc++ it will use libc++
to force use libstdc++ you need

40325113
swift	objective-c
the realm objective c and realm swift apis are not interoperable and using them together is not supported
my recommendation to you anyway is using realm cocoa objective-c from swift so there s no major problem with your application using the database

40325929
ubuntu	debian
my debian builds get ported ie rebuilt for ubuntu by michael rutter and are generally available the next day -- via cran see the readme r 3.3.2 comes out monday you will have a new ubuntu version by tuesday or wednesday at the latest
for several ubuntu releases so it does not matter which ubuntu version you run similarly johannes rebuilds for debian into a repo available via cran i have already made two prebuilds of r 3.3.2 for debian -- but these we generally do not port but just wait

40330267
profiling	benchmarking
in short 1 where most of the time is lost executing an algorithm use a profiling tool 2 whether writing inline assembly will really enhance execution speed maybe but very difficult and most likely not worth the effort
use a profiler to determine where the time is spent for some pertinent benchmarking

40332091
amd	umd
when importing a umd module it will first check to see if define amd exists and then exports commonjs
webpack has an easier time parsing commonjs nodes native format so setting define to false explicitly tells webpack to not parse it as an amd module

40332194
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
you can style google-chrome opera and ie s scrollbars
unfortunately firefox doesn t support it

40334054
spaces	delimiter
the rules the rules for parsing escapes are documented here microsoft c c++ startup code uses the following rules when interpreting arguments given on the operating system command line arguments are delimiter by white spaces which is either a spaces or a tab
the caret character is not recognized as an escape character or delimiter

40335274
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it would be better to do this in a subclass of uiviewcontroller and add an instance of that subclass as the rootviewcontroller of the uinavigationcontroller you make key and visible in didfinishlaunchingwithoptions
you also likely do not want to remove the root view of a uiviewcontroller from it s super view

40338340
srp	ocp
the first example violates srp of all things
it may also violate ocp on the assembly level if your classes are not internal and someone outside of your assembly may extend them and now they have to go change your code to make it work

40338340
srp	ocp
if they are internal then it s debatable whether it violates ocp or not but the violation of srp is even worse anyway
the second example definitely violates ocp

40339060
g++	gcc
a lot more so please take a look for for your project it can be look like all myprog main.o main.cpp classes class1.h classes class1.o classes class1.cpp classes class1.h myprog main.o classes class1.o g++ main.o classes class1.o -o myprog
what you are searching for is not related to the compiler gcc itself but to a build environment

40342882
namedtuple	dictionary
what you wanted is probably second of all to get a class with two properties i would recommend looking on namedtuple
first of all - the error you are not returning a list of dictionary

40343731
ecdsa	rsa
they already have logic in the dsa and ecdsa cases for mpint asn.1 that i might argue is equally ugly. or if the server has another usable key request that by configuring server_host_key to not include ssh-rsa -- easiest just get the existing default list split remove ssh-rsa and check not empty and rejoin instead of possibly confusing your users and or co maintainers by listing today s specific algorithms
although it would be nice to have the stacktrace to confirm i ll bet the server is using an rsa host key to authenticate and is wrongly trimming leading zero in rare cases

40345373
super	extends
super is clothing in this case
also since you are extends from the clothing class you do not need to redefine the size and color properties in your extended classes

40346161
multiplying	multiplication
matrix multiplication requires a lot more addition and multiplication than you need to just multiplying each row of the matrix by it s corresponding entry in the vector you will only need a single call to np.dot to get overall
if the vectors you use to select the row are indeed the unit vectors you are much better off not doing matrix multiplication at all for from_a from_b from_c

40346742
implements	extends
sometimes you don t want this but you still can implements any even multiple interfaces in the child class
the only thing that does not work is to extends an interface just like a class or an abstract class cannot be implemented

40349999
spaces	delimiter
it clearly can contain characters other than letters and numbers eg the dash but some of the items have dots preceding so it cannot be defined as being delimiter by a spaces
i defined a word as a string that starts with a letter or digit and ends with a letter or digit contains both letters and digits might also contain any other non-space characters except a comma to do this i first replaced all the commas with spaces and then applied an appropriate regular expression

40350965
ssl	https
generating an ssl cert is probably outside the scope of this question and there are a lot of guides out there for this i would post links but don t have enough rep
the config you have shown is a valid way to force your application server to only communicate over https however it is not sufficient to actually enable https for your tomcat server

40365773
udp	tcp
where tcp is a stream oriented protocol ensuring that all of the data is transmitted in the right order udp is a message oriented protocol
udp does not require a long-lived connection so setting up a udp socket is a little simpler

40365773
udp	tcp
udp does not require a long-lived connection so setting up a udp socket is a little simpler
on the other hand udp messages must fit within a single packet for ipv4 that means they can only hold 65 507 bytes because the 65 535 byte packet also includes header information and delivery is not guaranteed as it is with tcp

40367296
stateless	stateful
stateless is just not stateful
if newthread is stateless then in both cases the outcome will be the same - underneath executorservice executes the run method in new thread and as there is no state of variables anyway we won t have any problems

40367986
bash	zsh
you are either using dash not bash or your bash shell has the xpg_echo option set
the zsh built-in echo though behaves according to the posix specification which replaces certain escaped characters

40368263
factors	mean
additionally the lowest possible big-o doesn t necessarily mean there aren t faster algorithms with better constant factors
in practice constant factors do matter so they might just be asking you if you can improve upon the constant factors in your implementation

40369330
swift	objective-c
this documentation-based guidance is equivalent to declaring a class as final in swift
however hkhealthstore and most other apple framework classes are defined in objective-c which doesn t have anything like a final keyword so such classes are limited to just saying please don t subclass in documentation

40370701
division	multiplication
fp division is also slow but is decoded to a single uop so it doesn t bottleneck the front-end
if fp division is rare and not part of a latency bottleneck it can be as cheap as multiplication

40370701
division	multiplication
if fp division is rare and not part of a latency bottleneck it can be as cheap as multiplication
but if execution does have to wait for its result or bottlenecks on its throughput it s much slower. integer division and other micro-coded instructions can give the cpu a hard time and creates effects that make code alignment matter where it wouldn t otherwise

40372578
google-chrome	firefox
section 5.3.1 of rfc 7540 covers that part here s the example they give when adding a new stream d to a not exclusive exclusive example let s take this page for example google-chrome only uses the exclusive dependencies so the dependency tree might at first look like html | png | png when the javascript is discovered google-chrome reprioritizes it above the images because the javascript is more likely to affect how the page is rendered so google-chrome puts the js right below the html html | js | png | png because all the requests are daisy chained it might look as in the waterfall you posted that requests are executed one after another like in http 1 but they re not because they can be re-ordered on the fly and all the requests are sent to the browser asap
firefox on the other hand will have resources of the same type share the same priority so you should be able to see some interlacing there

40375605
nunit	mstest
visual studio 2015 any runner provided teamcity addin for nunit is installed mstest 2005 2008 2010 2012 2013 and since teamcity 9.1
mstest 2015 on-the-fly reporting is not available due to mstest limitations vstest 2012 2013 2015 mspec you can even custom testing frameworks if there is no teamcity support yet for your testing framework more details please refer the official documentation from teamcity testing frameworks for test in tfs

40375761
vsto	add-in
see vsto add-in have to be distributed by yourself
no it is not possible. also the office store accept only web based office add-in so this is not an option

40376746
build.gradle	gradlew
you can also disable boot repackaging all together in the plugin build.gradle if you never plan to use the plugin as an actual application or runnable jar file
what you are seeing is that if you run gradlew assemble on a plugin then the bootrepackage task is run which re-packages the plugin jar as a runnable jar which is not what you want when you plan to use the plugin from an application

40376819
client-side	server-side
read option 2 - http-only cookie pros it s not vulnerable to xss the browser automatically includes the token in any request that meets the cookie specification domain path and lifetime the cookie can be created at a top-level domain and used in requests performed by sub-domains cons it s vulnerable to csrf you need to be aware and always consider the possible usage of the cookies in sub-domains cherry picking the requests that should include the cookie is doable but messier you may still hit some issues with small differences in how browsers deal with cookies if you re not careful you may implement a csrf mitigation strategy that is vulnerable to xss the server-side needs to validate a cookie for authentication instead of the more appropriate authorization header usage you don t need to do anything client-side as the browser will automatically take care of things for you
option 3 - javascript accessible cookie ignored by server-side pros it s not vulnerable to csrf because it s ignored by the server the cookie can be created at a top-level domain and used in requests performed by sub-domains allows to use the most semantically correct approach to pass token authentication credentials in http the authorization header with a bearer scheme it s somewhat easy to cherry pick the requests that should contain authentication cons it s vulnerable to xss if you re not careful with the path where you set the cookie then the cookie is included automatically by the browser in requests which will add unnecessary overhead in order to perform authenticated requests you can only use browser library api s that allow for you to customize the request pass the token in the authorization header usage you leverage the browser document.cookie api to store and then retrieve the token when performing requests

client-side	server-side
this usually is used with paged grids where not all data is available client-side which is a common scenario in extjs when used for big data applications
so first you have to check whether you really want to sort server-side and then you have to implement it there using your existing server technology

40380873
ssl	https
if your ssl certificate is not valid or can not be handled by your openssl library and your website is also available over http you can add the following line to your wp-config.php file define algolia_loopback_http true
this will force the loopback calls to happen over http instead of https

union	distinct
be deterministic union is a set is the set of all distinct elements in the collection
this definition is well defined mathematically which doesn t leave nonuniqueness option the result must be unique for every well defined mathematical operation not only for union

40387547
debian	linux	centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
you can follow the instructions here which i ve summarized below fedora redhat centos or scientific linux # yum groupinstall development tools debian or ubuntu linux then you can try rerunning sudo pip install numpy
if you are running a linux distribution you may need a c compiler especially if you see telltale log lines like sh gcc command not found

40388418
lxml	elementtree
i suggest you to use lxml to efficiently parse an xml file
from lxml import elementtree your xml sample is not well-formed i fixed it like this to parse a file you can use etree.parse

40389498
tensorflow	tensorboard
expanding on steven s link i cannot post comments yet here are a few tricks to monitor control memory usage in tensorflow to monitor memory usage during runs consider logging run metadata
you can then see the memory usage per node in your graph in tensorboard

40391510
swift	objective-c
otherwise the swift function signatures will not be properly mapped to the objective-c function signatures not sure why this is the case
in swift versions prior to 3.0 the underlying objective-c function signatures matched the signatures in the swift uitableviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource protocols

40391836
ffmpeg	libav
okay firstly i wasn t using ffmpeg but a fork of ffmpeg called libav
not to be confused ffmpeg is more recent and libav was used in some distributions of linux

40393261
fgets	getchar
therefore you enter the size of the buffer and ignore the null byte as fgets will do that work for you
nad s hack of adding a getchar seems to fix it but i wouldn t use scanf for reading strings if i were you

40395587
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the alternative if you must use the built-in function for whatever reason is to turn all checked exceptions into runtimeexception s this will allow your code to compile but is certainly not a generally recommended best practice
the built-in function class doesn t allow you to throw unchecked-exception as you can see from the signature of the apply method

40398324
swt	swing
you can use the swt_awt class to call swing code from swt but this should be a last resort
you are not running the swt event dispatch loop you must run this for asyncexec and many other parts of swt to work

40405841
build.gradle	gradlew
it s located under yourproject app build.gradle
you have to put the dependency in the module gradlew and not in the project gradlew

40406695
octal	binary
the octal representation of numbers consists of digits 0-7 exclusively similar to how the binary representation of numbers consists of the digits 0 and 1 exclusively
as such 010895401 is expected to be the octal representation of a number but it isn t

40407914
lodash	underscore.js
so that here is its implementation taken from lodash source also it s worth noting that lodash makes single methods available as standalone modules so in case you need only this method you can just install it without the rest of the library npm i --save lodash.clamp
this does not want to be a just-use-a-library answer but just in case you re using underscore.js lodash you can use .clamp _.clamp yourinput lowerbound upperbound

40408196
swift	objective-c
.view.addsubview mybutton i m sure you can figure out how to do this in swift 2 1 or objective-c
actually you can add uibutton to stick in bottom or header of the view it doesn t matter if you re using uitableviewcontroller or uiviewcontroller swift 3 create button for x and y i apply the entire view size this will allow me to add margin with - the amount i like

40410381
ssl	https
instead of disabling ssl certificate checking which could be by-passing your corporate security policies not a good idea i think the correct solution is as follows this solves the unable to verify the first certificate error without disabling ssl certificate checking
note the cert_authority_file_base64.cer file can be obtained in chrome from any https accessed website external to your organization s network using the green lock icon and navigating to the details link from the menu that comes up when clicking on the green icon

40411295
rpm	yum
i used this command rpm -qa | grep openssl and received output looking like this libopenssl1_0_0-32bit-1.0.1k-2.39.1.x86_64 openssl-1.0.1k-2.39.1.x86_64 both openssl and libopenssl are required for nrpes ssl support to function correctly
i strongly recommend that if these are not installed to use your systems package installer aptget yum zypper ... to fetch and install them

40415723
hive	hdfs
note that for hive command line sql standards based authorization is disabled
this is because secure access control is not possible for the hive command line using an access control policy in hive because users have direct access to hdfs and so they can easily bypass the sql standards based authorization checks or even disable it altogether

40415820
vsto	add-in
in our stack overflow post here about our vsto add-in some users seem to indicate that we can upload my vsto add-in to office app store and not to windows app store
firstly office store only accept web based office add-in so you re not able to upload your vsto developed add-in to office store for official publishing

40415820
vsto	add-in
firstly office store only accept web based office add-in so you re not able to upload your vsto developed add-in to office store for official publishing
you might refer to office add-in platform overview

40416518
google-chrome	firefox
the short answer is no you can t detect the compositing backend in firefox at least not from javascript in google-chrome you can use the webgl_debug_renderer_info extension
as for why it s not available in firefox and is available in google-chrome is there is a difference of opinion on which is more important privacy or usefulness

40433714
png	tga
you could try including all the necessary loaders like including and however it might be simplest to just batch convert all the tgas to just use images like pngs using a converter and replace all instances of tga with png
if you check your mtl you might notice it is trying to use tga or some other sort of textures that aren t plain images

40436995
qtwebengine	qtwebkit
my solution is to use qtwebkit at the moment i need to support qt4.8 so i am not using more moder qtwebengine module which is expected to deprecate qtwebkit in the near future in qt5.x
the lines of code to show pygal generated svg are these update qt is going to deprecate qtwebkit soon

40439555
swift	objective-c
as you correctly say double and string are not reference types in swift they are struct s
therefore you cannot directly store them in an you would first need to bridge them to objective-c in order to do so

40439576
prepare	execute
these triggers fire when any valid event is fired regardless of whether or not any table rows are affected we can create trigger like this a stored procedure is nothing more than prepare sql code that you save so you can reuse the code over and over again
so if you think about a query that you write over and over again instead of having to write that query each time you would save it as a stored procedure and then just call the stored procedure to execute the sql code that you saved as part of the stored procedure

40439903
swift	objective-c
that would be error objects in swift or ojbc methods with an parameter objective-c exceptions you could catch with try catch blocks but they disrupt memory management and shouldn t be used for runtime error handling or c++ exceptions
so far swift objective-c don t have the concept of a nullreferenceexception for a number of reasons but exc_bad_access also occur when accessing already freed invalid memory which was a common programming error before objective-c arc and swift

40442037
gson	jackson
libraries like gson jackson or the java persistence api jpa generally use a no-argument default construtor to instantiate an object and set its fields via reflection
in newer versions of gson you do not even have to declare a default constructor anymore see here

40442770
ubuntu	linux
so if i am on a fedora 24 host i can build a container that uses an ubuntu 14.04 userspace by starting my dockerfile with from ubuntu 14.04 processes running in this container are still running on the host kernel but there entire userspace comes from the ubuntu distribution
this isn t another operating system -- it s still the same linux kernel -- but it is a completely separate filesystem

40443243
mvp	presenter
short answer single presenter can be used with multiple views long answer in general there is no one single definition of mvp mvc - there are many approaches to implementation of these architectural patterns
you did not provide the definition of your mvp therefore i can only guess what you have in mind

40445713
setcontentview	findviewbyid
this is because the view is not inflated until you have set it with setcontentview
this means any findviewbyid call before will return null

40449036
sudo	passwd
the article while not explicitly saying it implies that using the root user is the same thing as sudo
the apple article includes some warnings about use of the root user but if you think about it it s no more risky than deliberately disabling the passwd required by sudo

40449114
octal	decimal	octal	binary
decimal-literal is a non-zero decimal digit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 followed by zero or more decimal digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 octal-literal is the digit zero 0 followed by zero or more octal digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 hex-literal is the character sequence 0x or the character sequence 0x followed by one or more hexadecimal digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a a b b c c d d e e f f binary-literal is the character sequence 0b or the character sequence 0b followed by one or more binary digits 0 1
a 0 prefix in c means octal not decimal

40449307
kerberos	ldap
in a homogenous microsoft-only active directory environment in which kerberos is the primary authentication method it is by default keytabs are not used
microsoft application servers can without a keytab natively decrypt the kerberos ticket to determine who the user is and parse that same ticket for user s group information as well without any need for ldap calls back to the directory server

40450538
kerberos	ntlm
else the authentication mechanism might immediately try ntlm instead of kerberos which is not what you want
in a simple environment consisting of just a single dns domain and single kerberos realm and having the kerberos realm to dns domain mappings are already set usually by etc krb5.conf when on unix linux windows handles that automatically but if it doesn t then it will try c windows krb5.ini if present while you would not need to qualify the kerberos realm as part of the spn when running setspn -a or setspn -s you should do so inside your kerberos creation command

40453073
swift	objective-c
the only way i can get the behavior you describe is if i try to add it to an objective-c project without any swift code
in that case it would appear that when you fire up the workspace it doesn t find the legacy version setting because there were no swift build settings at all

spaces	delimiter
your first problem is that your csv file has spaces after each comma
this is a mal-formed file in a true csv file spaces are the delimiter not comma-space

40455740
move	drag
sorry for not coping with your exact code but just to show you how i d create resizable sibling containers jsbin demo will handle any number of resizable boxes and keep them responsive thanx to the width conversion back to on resize end as you can see i move the handlers inside each box
on handler drag move i target modify the width of the handler s parent box and the width of the next sibling box

40456372
swift	objective-c
swift 2.3 you can write it in a more swifty way like this or even as an extension for completion sake swift 3.0
objective-c translation non-idiomatic the closest you can get to the code you provide is the following though i do not recommend you use the code above

40458487
bash	zsh
. a.out zsh no such file or directory . a.out the specific command not found message is something i think bash prints
i use zsh myself

40460652
slug	permalinks
i am also guessing that you want to use the slug in order to have a more url friendly permalinks for each post
in the previous case the slug would be something like this-is-my-first-blog-post so given a slug your post would be available at the posts unique-post-slug route and not posts title

40463882
union	distinct
not sure how this output is useful but to get it you need union not a join
note - union also does a distinct operation so you don t need to add it separately. select p_code c_code null as proj from p_master union select p_code c_code proj from c_proj the results may come in the order you showed or in any other order

40466846
onclick	onchange
if you want something to happen when clicking on the select element use onclick
onchange will only fire if the value of the select element changes html doesn t have dropdowns

40470351
gmail	hotmail
this will depend on the recipients email provider gmail do ignore . in the first part of the email as you say
but i wouldn t assume that hotmail yahoo corporates etc do the same

40471297
hex	binary
but the number value is always the same whether you write is as 10 decimal 0xa hex or 1010 binary
use hex2dec documentation here internally the value 0xa is not stored as hex or decimal but as binary

40473500
nunit	mstest
i do prefer nunit to mstest but mstest seems to get the job done just fine
update it just doesn t seem like entity framework is built to support nunit

40473500
nunit	mstest
update it just doesn t seem like entity framework is built to support nunit
i built and ran the exact same test using the mstest platform and it works

40474021
factors	matrix
you should put in a factors with the same set of levels as the factors used to fit the model not some random phrase -- that s the only way the design matrix makes sense
predict.lm recovers the factors levels from the fitted object i don t remember this being around in 2002 but i might be wrong

40474106
mayavi	matplotlib
also the barchart in mayavi is much more convenient making this only 5 lines of code
solution usiing matplotlib first of all if you do not want to have single cubes but cuboids there is a much simpler solution - using matplotlib bar3d

mockito	jmockit	mockito	jmock
caption tell jmock tag tells jmockit your code looks like mockito and not like jmock nor jmockit so i assume your using mockito despite what you wrote in your description.
mockito lets you either enumerate the return values in order or chain the methods either this when employeeendpoint.submit employee .thenreturn new response error new response error new response success returned at 3rd call and all following

40481890
google-chrome	firefox
i have found a nice description from the developer from firefox about this topic there you e.g find the following firefox and internet explorer consider frames mixed active content while google-chrome considers frames mixed passive content
this means that firefox and internet explorer block iframes while google-chrome does not yet

40483089
google-chrome	firefox
to add my 2 cents chromedriver acts as the bridge between google-chrome and the selenium jar so on one side you have the protocol and interface webdriver that is backward compatible and on the other you have dependency on browser s releases which isn t.
so compatibility wise tim-slifer s answer is sufficient except that now firefox also has a driver

40487024
junit	testng
test method is annotated with - it is clearly a testng annotation org.testng.annotations.test because junit s equivalent does not have element called groups
however you are using junit s before annotation on setup method therefore this method is never invoked

40491128
textview	imageview
now here comes the 2nd part of the trick since constraintlayout guarantees that the framelayout will use all the space we have and never more or less i can now use a linearlayout inside like so astute readers will notice that the linearlayout has wrap_content in its width that s very important for then the child textview can have a width of 0dp and a weight of 1 meaning it will take all available free space after all the other widgets have calculated their width
in this particular case the other child imageview caret has no weight specified and a fixed width therefore the textview doesn t have to share split the free space with anybody else and it can take it all but only free space remember its width is 0dp

40494953
spaces	delimiter
as the question was not about reading the data or writing it back this is only the replacing part option a unstring statement move 0 to t1 t2 t3 t4 unstring yourtext delimiter by all #rt# or all #lt# or ... into target-1 count in t1 target-2 count in t2 target-3 count in t3 target-4 count in t4 ... end-unstring move spaces to translated-text string target-1 1 t1 target-2 1 t2 target-2 1 t2 target-2 1 t2 ... delimiter by size into translated-text end-string option b a simple perform varying with two pointers combined with a simple if statement
the inspect yourtext replacing by spaces leaves spaces

40496498
ecto	elixir
ecto s queries rely on macros to provide the powerful dsl that we use
that means that whatever comes after from is not regular elixir code but a dsl which will eventually get transformed to sql query

40498054
bufferedreader	filewriter
you re not closing the filereader but the bufferedreader same thing for the writers
since you don t close the filereader filewriter fr.close and fw.close the handle stays active

40500945
rvm	bundler
if you are using rvm you probably need to run rvm use system to set the version of ruby to use. see ruby -v will tell you the version you are currently using
go inside your app directory and type gem install bundler if it does not work try sudo gem install bundler ...but generally you can do it without sudo if it does not fix the case then probably you have multiple ruby version installed

40507278
factors	matrix
let s generate some toy data first since f is not an ordered factors generates design matrix by replicating s x for all levels of f your second model m1 has only a smooth term s x the design matrix of which is x0
here is how we can see that your m1 is nested in m0 as design matrix of s x and have the same column span thus s x is nested in

40512297
google-chrome	firefox
sometimes google-chrome firefox ie etc show events in wrong way or have different properties names
in your example property .toelement in firefox is undefined thats why its not working

40513419
swift	objective-c
the swift programming language this was created in a playground to give you an idea without any errors
has has stated the most likely reason this protocol was given the objective-c is because swift doesn t allow you to use optional protocol requirement methods

40513419
swift	objective-c
has has stated the most likely reason this protocol was given the objective-c is because swift doesn t allow you to use optional protocol requirement methods
the swift way of doing this would be ofcourse then you have the problem of a default implementation i suppose but you can use protocol extensions to provide a default implementation to any method or computed property requirement of that protocol

40514288
n-gram	words
for what remains of the sentence that is not matched as named entity by spacy you can create a list of n-gram from the sentence starting with the biggest ngram you use the wikidata search api to lookup wikidata topics
pos tagging can be put to good use that said syntax parse informations is more powerful since you can know the relations between the words

40514681
strdup	malloc
instead you can use strdup posix function to copy the lines you are interested in
if strdup not available you can use malloc + strcpy to do the same

40515697
stateless	stateful
in your case since you want the optionscomponent to track its own tooltip state it really isn t even stateless
it is stateful so make it a component

40516801
floating-point	fixed-point
at the very core we do not even know if float refers to a floating-point type or some sort of internal type that supports many of the same operations
for example many microcontroller applications routinely use fixed-point arithmetic to avoid the complexity of implementing a real floating-point type

40517100
hex	binary
sample of memory representation of variable hexvalue 01000010 #byte 1 chars b 00000000 #byte 2 00110110 #byte 3 chars 6 00000000 #byte 4 with you convert again the string to a number 00000000 #byte 1 00000000 #byte 2 00000000 #byte 3 10110110 #byte 4 the type int doesn t store the numerical base store only the value as binary in memory hex or decimal is only a way to represent the value and this can be done only when you convert the value in a readable string
when you declare you allocate 32 bit in memory 4 byte . since a memory can store only binary values you store 182 in memory like this 00000000 #byte 1 00000000 #byte 2 00000000 #byte 3 10110110 #byte 4 when you do you allocate in memory an array of chars to represent a string

40521742
implements	extends
if you call it multiple times you should implements runnable because the same thread should not be restarted
in the rare case you only run it once you should extends thread because of dry

40525433
strcpy	strncpy
for example windows is currently rewriting most strcpy to strncpy if at all possible
i say if possible because not all areas of code that use strcpy can successfully be changed over to strncpy

40527796
shadowing	named
you are not shadowing anything no named is being reused here
the named publisher was not being used in your namespace until you created that instance with

40536205
serializable	deserialization
i m not sure if that s a bug or a feature but there is another way of handling custom serializable objects - called transform with matcher and it works both with attributes and with elements
instead of using the converter s you define a transform class that handles serialization and deserialization as you can see it is more straight-forward than implementing the convert interface

40539612
strtol	strcpy
you can use std strtol or std stoi or even a std istringstream eg
you cannot use strcpy to convert a string to an integer

40542225
bower	npm
hovewer with yii2 installing and using bower is not required
yii2 is dependent on composer asset plugin - plugin that allows you to manage project assets css js etc. in your composer.json without installing npm or bower

40542267
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
nsurlsession also provides nicer interfaces for requesting data using blocks in that it allows you to combine them with delegate methods for doing custom authentication handling redirect handling etc. whereas with nsurlconnection if you suddenly realized you needed to do those things you had to refactor your code to not use block-based callbacks
nsurlconnection and nsurlrequest are the provided cocoa classes for managing connections

40548645
mvp	presenter
by the way even in the aforementioned implementation of mvp i wouldn t use context in order to get access to sharedpreferences in presenter - i would still define a wrapper class for sharedpreferences and inject it into presenter
this question was answered some time ago and assuming that the definition of mvp is what op used in his code the answer by jahnold is really good

40548645
mvp	presenter
however it should be pointed out that mvp is a high level concept and there can be many implementations following mvp principles - there is more than one way to skin the cat
there is another implementation of mvp which is based on the idea that activities in android are not ui elements which designates activity and fragment as mvp presenter

40548645
mvp	presenter
there is another implementation of mvp which is based on the idea that activities in android are not ui elements which designates activity and fragment as mvp presenter
in this configuration mvp presenter have a direct access to context

40550469
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
xjb for it is very simple as you can see it defines conversions from xsd datetime xsd date and xsd time types to java.util.calendar
i do not recommend to use java.util.date

40551422
super	implements
if you want to have an implementation in the abstract method you should not declare method as abstract and remember to override it in child classes calling super method if needed
because abstract method purpose is to have its definition in super class and force child classes to override and implements it

40557219
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	modulo
multiplying these together and you get these numbers will rapidly become enormous in regular arithmetic but if you perform all your multiplication modulo m then this isn t a problem
finally multiplying the vector 0

40557263
implements	extends
you can achieve the same result with a trait you can decide if you want to implements the id field in the trait or not
the other answers are somehow correct but i doubt they will work with slick your id has to be a rep of some parameter and not an int the best way would be to have an abstract table with and id field and make your concrete table extends that note that i made the id primary key

40560520
equals	icomparable
dictionary uses equals and object.gethashcode by default for checking the keys
you don t want icomparable icomparable is about ordering things not checking for whether they are equal

40560520
equals	compareto	icomparable	compareto
you don t want icomparable icomparable is about ordering things not checking for whether they are equals
technically just because compareto returns zero doesn t mean 2 objects are the same

40562001
swift	objective-c
your objective-c method has nullable pointers as parameters in swift 3 that would be an optional unsafemutablepointer so you can pass nil as an argument
what you can not do in contrast to objective-c is to pass the address of an uninitialized variable rect must be initialized here

40563432
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is right
according to the mysql documentation the second assignment in the following statement sets col2 to the current updated col1 value not the original col1 value

40564577
queue	fifo
like a real queue you have items added at one end and removed at the other or fifo
javascript does not have a special array type for a queue but it has all the functions needed to implement a queue

40566727
comm	grep
comm expects the files to be sorted by the columns to compare and the space before its arguments isn t optional
but you can extract the third column of file 1 with cut and extract that values from file 2 with grep if they can t appear in any other column cut -f3 file_1 | grep -ff- file_2 the order of the lines corresponds to file2 though

trie	tree
yet another characteristic of his patricia trie is that it doesn t store the keys which means such data structure will not be suitable for answering questions like list all keys that match a given prefix but is good for finding if a key exists or not in the trie
nonetheless the term patricia tree or patricia trie has since then been used in many different but similar senses such as to indicate a compact trie nist or to indicate a radix trie with radix two as indicated in a subtle way in wiki and so on

swift	objective-c
example for swift 3 assuming that funcptr is a unsaferawpointer containing the function s address of course the type alias must match the actual function signature and the function needs to be a pure c function not an objective-c method
the same approach as in swift how to call a c function loaded from a dylib should work here

40573513
addition	multiplication
if they weren t one would need to make them square by repeating them as needed if the above addition doesn t broadcast correctly
if xfactors and self.matrix are both numpy.array and not numpy.matrix in other words if you are using element-wise multiplication and not matrix multiplication in calculating newx and newy then this should do the same thing a lot faster in the original code it was not clearly stated that xfactors and yfactors were square

viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
you have to put the alertcontroller in the viewdidappear method of your viewcontrollers lifecycle because in the methods viewdidload und viewwillappear your current view is still not in the window hierachy
if you want to present further viewcontrollers like the alertcontroller you need a full loaded view in which your new viewcontroller could be rendered this is what the apple documentation is saying about viewcontroller uiviewcontroller methods get called as follows viewdidload called when the view controller s content view the top of its view hierarchy is created and loaded from a storyboard

40577158
implements	extends
the common solution is that your interface would also require to implements a registering method vuforia does that for instance so any new instance registers itself
you could also extends mb class with your own mb system it does not have the magic of unity but you cannot achieve the magic of unity with monobehaviour

40592666
spaces	delimiter
include a subroutine to print all words spaces delimiter that aren t within quotes continually read until the next quote character taking advantage of find full code live demo if you need to store the quoted characters within a variable the line should be easily modifiable to obtain that
i don t think std quoted is the right tool for the job here because there s no easy way to tell if the next string had quotes that were stripped before you print it it discards your delimiter which is by default i think we can safely fall back on std string s find method

40592915
super	self
the descriptor will be bound to self without super
the same applies to the other attributes on self super is only needed to access descriptors that would not otherwise be reachable via self

40592915
super	implements
super can t be used to bind data descriptors in an assignment or del obj.attr statement because super objects do not implements __set__ or __delete__
in other words using super .attribute works for reading the attribute only never for writing or deleting

40593057
dictionary	map
but you can specify a route summary with the routesummary dictionary on swaggerfeature e.g
you can use or to add a description to a single service although this doesn t always map directly to a swagger route description as the swagger ui groups multiple routes under a single top-level route which covers multiple different services sharing the top-level route

40593378
portrait	landscape
you should turn them on their side in order to pick the best one for the onmeasure method to measure the view in a portrait orientation based on the screen and space you want the preview to occupy
ideally - turn them after you confirmed the camera s mounting angle and the current phone s angle are not compatible one landscape and one portrait

40604386
google-chrome	firefox
workaround for a firefox webnavigation.oncommitted bug there is a change needed to your ontabload code for using a webnavigation.oncommitted listener to inject scripts using tabs.executescript in firefox this is not needed in google-chrome
this is due to a bug in firefox which causes tabs.executescript to fail if executed immediately from a webnavigation.oncommitted listener

40607458
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
take a look at a complete example as a junit test case if you are using maven you have to put at your pom.xml webdrivermanager does magic for you it checks for the latest version of the webdriver binary it downloads the webdriver binary if it s not present on your system it exports the required webdriver java environment variables needed by selenium so far webdrivermanager supports google-chrome opera internet explorer microsoft edge phantomjs and firefox
you can handle the firefox driver automatically using webdrivermanager

40612530
profiling	instrumentation
to ensure that instrumentation has access to information about your code initiate profiling from xcode see profiling from xcode or configure a symbol mappings file see map data to source code
the problem is instrumentation needs a gateway to your app and simply pointing to it doesn t do it

40621779
division	modulo	division	subtract
this makes sense since and you would expect that subtract the modulo from the original value wouldn t change the division result 99 2 99- 99 2 2 so 99 2 98 2
as others mentioned integer division will truncate

40623555
move	drag
you can also click turtle and drag it to move all elements
turtle doesn t have special function to move all elements

40625115
lxml	libxml2
the problem is caused by the versions.the python version is 2.7 and the lxml is 3.6 which i originally downloaded.when i download lxml 2.2.8.exe i was pleasantly surprised to find that the problem was solved
did you check this could not find function xmlcheckversion in library libxml2

40625816
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 54 and safari 10 work fine on desktop but on mobile safari i kept getting the unknown error when trying to store a blob into indexeddb
i can confirm that this really is just an issue with blobs on mobile safari and not some misuse of the api

viewdidload	viewwillappear
when i write timer in override func viewdidload timer doesn t work
i move timer to override func viewwillappear it works

40640251
stateless	stateful
i eventually came upon this article which kind of covers the whole topic and thus answers the question joepie91 blog 2016 06 13 stop-using-jwt-for-sessions stateless jwt tokens cannot be invalidated or updated and will introduce either size issues or security issues depending on where you store them
stateful jwt tokens are functionally the same as session cookies but without the battle-tested and well-reviewed implementations or client support

40643830
dictionary	map
if tests are sufficiently numerous it will surely pay off to switch to set operations turning the dictionary values into sets would not gain anything as the conversion would be o n with n being the added size of all values -lists while the above disjoint operation will only iterate each values until it encounters a testx with o 1 lookup
map is possibly more performant compared to a comprehension if you do not have to use lambda if key can be used as the first positional argument in resp s __init__ but certainly not with the lambda

40648257
jar	war
as josh long once said in one of his spring io talks make jar not war on the other hand if you have an existing infrastructure out there with servlet containers and already there are multiple application.wars running in those servlet containers and all you have to do is just package your application as a war file and hand it over to a release team or rather you are forced to just reuse the existing infrastructure then it s a different story...but tech-world is already moving away from this practice
again in the spirit of microservices in the spirit of what spring boot intended for i would encourage you to use embedded server and make runnable jar file rather than going with traditional deployment

40654496
google-chrome	firefox
mdn extension documentation mirrors google-chrome docs even for bits not supported in firefox as they see themselves as a central documentation for all browsers
best place to find bugs that track implementation browser support for javascript apis good place to find minimum supported version google-chrome incompatibilities then if there is an api that s not yet supported you should check that it exists in the namespace before using it there s no better runtime way to check support

40658438
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
actually this is a misinterpretation of safari webinspector. you may find the answer here safari encoded decoded transfered compression rate is not reliable or at least does not have the same meaning as it has in google-chrome firefox edge
this safari feature has been pinpointed in 2014 here without content length safari get lost in his indicators

40660846
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
on the other hand some like to try and use a more complex layout for those same guis using layouts like gridbaglayout - older but quite versatile
grouplayout - newer more powerful and provides better ability to align elements that are not next to each other but considered so difficult to hand write that most use a gui designer that will produce code that will not be portable to the next gui designer or ide

40661509
punctuation	words
use the punctuation dash unicode category to match and split both kinds
the in the entries with spaces are not hyphens u+002d but dashes u+2013 you ll usually see this if the data has been copied from a text processor with automagical formatting like words for example

40662004
factors	mean
the euclidean loss should be smaller by a factors of 256 if you divide all of the labels by 256 and re-train
it doesn t mean that dividing the labels by 256 makes the network become any better at predicting the labels

40665847
scheme	racket
since scheme is strongly typed #lang typed racket is definitely too
while scheme #lang racket is dynamicly typed i m not entirely sure if #lang typed racket is completely static

40666058
opcache	apc
php.ini set those two parameters on much higher values than default dump composer autoload composer dump-autoload --optimize - this creates dump file with loaded classes i don t know how you use opcache but i encourage you to install apcu module
after that use metadata cache in symfony config_prod.yml doctrine orm metadata_cache_driver apc result_cache_driver apc your web app.php should look have some additional lines comparing to regular one other but also very important use php 7 which has significant efficiency boost use php with fpm fastcgi proces manager use no sql solution to cache queries redis elasticsearch disable xdebug - make sure that profiler doesn t show you use it

40668602
sudo	passwd
the line in etc sudoers might look like and you would call sudo -u user2 home user1 setup.sh note in this last example i think that user2 would need to have an actual shell configured in etc passwd not bin false
it s not a good idea to store passwd in scripts or attempt to stream them into su

40668635
super	extends
also don t forget to call the super s paintcomponent method as well explained in the first tutorial
your class has a paint method but it s meaningless since the class extends no gui component and the method is not a true painting method override

40670586
hex	binary
as the number is hex base 16 not decimal base 10 you ll do 16 1 15 + 16 0 15 which will evnetually come out to be 255
decimal 255 in different bases is represented as binary base 2 11111111 2 7 1 + 2 6 1 + 2 5 1 + .

40673483
client-side	server-side
not from client-side javascript the browser has no way to know the size of a remote resource if the server doesn t say
you need a server-side fix generate a valid content-length header

40678290
equals	compareto
second your comparable has a weird behaviour if moviename are equals but not the source and destination because it always returns 1
this breaks the compareto contract x.compareto y 0 y.compareto z 0 implies x.compareto z 0 this leads to your treeset not working properly and thus your edge been added twice

40679733
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
however i did try implementing viewdidappear again and viewwillappear together
i believe viewwillappear couldn t work alone because you can t reload a tableview when the tableview itself has not appeared or loaded

40685236
sudo	passwd
-v when given the -v validate option sudo will update the user s cached credentials authenticating the user s passwd if necessary
for the sudoers plugin this extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes or whatever the timeout is set to by the security policy but does not run a command

40686580
rspec	capybara
if all it does is populate some options in a dropdown then you can do something like if using rspec if not using rspec
to have capybara wait you need to tell it what to wait for - so if you want to wait until the async call is completed you need to determine what change the async call response makes to the page

40690288
innodb	myisam
the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s
myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries

myisam is not being developed

40690288
innodb	myisam
see current tests of myisam performance with the patch but what trumps that is the fact that innodb supports acid behavior and myisam doesn t support any of the four qualities of acid
see my answer to myisam versus innodb failing to support acid isn t just an academic point

google-chrome	firefox
this example currently only fully works on firefox since google-chrome simply stops the canvas stream when the tab is blurred.
probably related to this bug but well my timer seems to be working but not the recording... edit it actually now works only in google-chrome since they have fixed this bug but not anymore in firefox because of this one caused by e10s

subtract	addition
for example if we have two choice bits the following explains the difference between simply running through all combinations in an arithmetic progression and going through them in a 1-bit-change order 1-bit-toggle-order decreasing order ---------------------- ---------------------- 1 1 start 1 1 start 1 0 toggle bit 0 1 0 subtract 1 0 0 toggle bit 1 0 1 subtract 1 0 1 toggle bit 0 0 0 subtract 1 we want to exploit the speed of bitwise operations hence we will use the 1-bit-toggle order
now we will build each solution this is not actual c code just an explanation if this code is run on the above example the following toggle statements will be executed which will result in the following additions which in addition to the already-present initial solution completes the set

40698623
bash	subshell
however when you use this alias in command ota --help its definition becomes a literal unquoted part of the command line and bash tries to execute the following broken command cygdrive d program files x86 arduino hardware esp8266com esp8266 tools espota.py --help based on the usual shell expansions this command is processed as follows cygdrive d program is interpreted as the command to execute everything before the first whitespace because word splitting splits the unquoted tokens on the command line into words by whitespace
therefore files x86 arduino hardware esp8266com esp8266 tools espota.py and --help become the arguments to that command but and when used unquoted as they are here are control operators to the shell they are used to create subshell but doing so as part of an argument is syntactically invalid which is why you re seeing syntax error near unexpected token before a runtime error of not finding command cygdrive d program has a chance to kick in

cpython	pypy
it also clearly demonstrates that cpython 3.5 is slower at this than 2.7 which is sad but expected
pypy is not only a solid 5x faster than either of them but all three algorithms perform equally well

division	multiplication
the sub-expression can overflow before your division
by casting c to a larger data-type then the whole expression becomes that type so the multiplication will not overflow

40717560
bash	subshell
this is documented in the manual bash performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command with any trailing newlines deleted
this behavior is not specific to bash it was done by bourne-descended shells before it

google-chrome	safari
so far i can guess this is a problem that only happens with google-chrome and as a workaround i would change the configuration to append the header only if google-chrome haven t checked for safari is not the client until there is a better fix
i had the same issue with google-chrome and after some hours of trial and error i figuered out that google-chrome seems to have a problem with the vary header i ve got this snippet in my apache .htaccess config and as soon as i comment the line header append vary accept-encoding google-chrome starts caching .js and .css files it still does not work while running the request via our nignx server because it is adding the vary accept-encoding header too when delivering gzip compressed

quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
if space isn t an issue then the merge sorts here may be better native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort
no need to mark this as an answer since it s not javascript and doesn t have introsort s depth check to switch to heapsort

40727840
realloc	malloc
this is not necessarily a good reallocation policy malloc realloc etc
calls are relatively slow and if you happen to call bitset_set in increasing order by increasing bit number you end up calling realloc for every ulong_bits

swt	swing
assuming you have the styledtext control for the editor use getcaretoffset to get the caret offset then call getlocationatoffset to get the x y coordinates of the offset relative to the control if necessary you can convert this to be relative to the display note that eclipse plugins normally use swt not swing
it will be a lot more difficult to open a jframe than a swt control

40736885
swift	objective-c
this build setting which specifies whether a target s product has embedded content with swift code tells xcode to embed swift standard libraries in your app when set to yes
according to embedding content with swift in objective-c swift standard libraries are copied into a bundle if and only if you are building an application and this application contains swift source files by itself if you are building an app that does not use swift but embeds content such as a framework that does xcode will not include these libraries in your app

selecteditem	selectedindex
however the only known working solution that is not an ugly hack is to bind also the selected item via the itemssource object binding combobox selecteditem using mvvm
when mvvm is used then a direct modification of the selectedindex property breaks part of the functionality of the binding

40740588
g++	gcc
try g++ -o abc.oxy -x c++ abc.cxy g++ can t deduce the correct language from your custom suffix and anything that it can t deduce as source it passes directly to the linker as an object file
not if you want gcc to auto deduce the source language

40740601
realloc	memmove	realloc	malloc
as you can see above i use a temporary variable for the result and only assign back to buffer if it is non-null. we can write our own analog of realloc using malloc and memmove though
we just need to know both the old and new sizes the real realloc is superior because it does not need to know the old size the c library remembers it internally

40741436
git-svn	svn2git
the svn2git you used is based on git-svn and git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

40741436
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the wrong svn2git in your case is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

40743608
super	implements
it s easy to see why this is valid foo is already implements by super and that implementation is inherited by sub
the exact rule goes like this unless the class being declared is abstract all the abstract member methods of each direct superinterface must be implements 8.4.8.1 either by a declaration in this class or by an existing method declaration inherited from the direct superclass or a direct superinterface because a class that is not abstract is not permitted to have abstract methods 8.1.1.1

lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
if you have lxml installed it would pick it if not it would pick html5lib - if it is not installed it would pick the built-in html.parser if you don t specify anything you ll get the best html parser that s installed
beautifulsoup ranks lxml s parser as being the best then html5lib s then python s built-in parser

getdate	datepart
if we take create view mutli_type as select case datepart day getdate when 1 then 100 when 2 then hello else getdate end as multitype depending on the day we get a different data type returned - double ouch
if you really needed to know what the view returned you could get the select elements in the view and use the tsqlscript dom to parse them into parts and try and infer each one i have mocked up a sample that finds the getdate function in this view to give you an idea of what you need to do but it isn t straightforward and i don t even want to consider stored procedures where you can pass in dynamic sql full sample create table dbo . the_table id int not null primary key stringcol varchar 234 not null a int b decimal a_and_b as a + b go create view the_view as select object_name 4 some_name 123 as an_int from the_table go create view mutli_type as select case datepart day getdate when 1 then 100 when 2 then hello else getdate end as multitype go using system

40747819
super	implements
super doesn t support data descriptors only plain descriptors as only super .__get__ is implements
put differently the assignment fails because the super proxy object does not implements the descriptor.__set__ method and thus that assignment tries to set __bases__ as an attribute on that proxy object

40747819
super	implements
put differently the assignment fails because the super proxy object does not implements the descriptor.__set__ method and thus that assignment tries to set __bases__ as an attribute on that proxy object
you d have to manually access the descriptor on the type object for symmetry s sake i ve used the same manual descriptor access in the getter although super .__bases__ would work too

implements	extends
what you can actually do is to create new class implements parcelable and use value returned from base class to construct your own class
you cannot actually extends spinner.savedstate because it created inside spinner class

40760466
required	placeholder
if you required a default state you can handle this outside of the select box
could you not make the first option a disabled placeholder as follows that way the the user would have to trigger a fetch

40761231
sudo	passwd
however in the case of a command that requires sudo the behavior might change in some cases it will require you to enter the passwd first
in other cases if you have just used sudo and it was not timed out yet it will not require the passwd again

40761807
spaces	delimiter
string.empty.split doesn t return one item with a spaces character but it returns an item with empty string
this is because the method split when it has no arguments considers white spaces as the delimiter

40762356
dictionary	map
instead append it in the form of dictionary
replace with and within your template access it like alternatively if you want to access list in the template suggested approach over here is by using map but explaining for the illustration purpose if you do not want to make any change in your current view then access the items in your list based on the index

40764624
shadowing	named
fundamentally though avoid shadowing variables if you need to access them since that feature of globals is a specific to globals b not really a good idea and c not available with the new let and const declarations
here s a snippet annotated with what exactly is happening and showing using window.variable although again ideally just use a different named ¹ implicit global - a global created without any declaration by assigning to it

40766990
inline	inlining
also remember that the inline styles are harder to override in css code from external files
inlining the style is not necessarily bad yes there are purists that would disagree

40768011
serializable	deserialization
read_only - access setting that means that the property may only be read for serializable but not written set during deserialization
read_write - access setting that means that the property will be accessed for both serializable writing out values as external representation and deserialization reading values from external representation regardless of visibility rules

40768011
serializable	deserialization
read_write - access setting that means that the property will be accessed for both serializable writing out values as external representation and deserialization reading values from external representation regardless of visibility rules
write_only - access setting that means that the property may only be written set for deserialization but will not be read get on serializable that is the value of the property is not included in serializable

40768075
ssl	https
you can switch to flexible ssl instead of full but this is not recommended for a lot of applications as it means the connection from cloudflare s edge to your origin is unencrypted
there are two options you need to alter your app such that it is able to accept https connections instead of http

40772452
pickle	dill
pickle and thus dill use recursive object serialization which means when an object refers to another object it may or may not serialize it based on the serialization settings
pickle typically serializes functions and classes by reference which means they are only serialized on import and by name

40777606
express	node.js
if not you can manually create one you can refer to for a sample for an express based application
meanwhile you can refer to for more info about troubleshooting on node.js applications on azure web apps

40780612
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
ensuring that viewdidappear had already been called or deferring the addition of the child vc until it was solved it for me
per apple the correct order of api calls to add a child view controller is but i still had the problem where viewwillappear in the child vc was not sporadically getting called

40780616
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so you can set the mapview bounds from func viewdidappear animated bool .i had faced the same issue that google map is centering on the self.view properly and not centering on custom view bounds.we found the reason that on func viewdidload we cant get the rectangle bounds of the view properly
i think your mapview bounds are not setting properly to the view outlet in viewdidload function

40781908
inline	inlining
inlining inlining produces fatter code which is faster the inline functions will not appear in the call stack
all the optimisation flags are frowned upon these days profile guided optimisation is by far the preferable way to use optimisations in release and if you want to debug release-ish code you should use the -zo flag which will produce better pdb s which can get you more information about inline functions and variables in registers

40782343
super	implements
however all the super class constructors have some arguments that s why the compilation fails
in your case i wouldn t implements parcelable in your class at all

40782489
floating-point	fixed-point
an advantage of floating-point over fixed-point is the range of numbers you can represent
i am not familiar with the cholesky algorithm but if it has to deal with very large and very small numbers internally floating-point will provide more accurate results

40782489
floating-point	fixed-point
i am not familiar with the cholesky algorithm but if it has to deal with very large and very small numbers internally floating-point will provide more accurate results
if you use fixed-point arithmetic you need to make sure that the input cannot cause saturation or overflow inside the algorithm and restrict it to a specific range

40783134
bash	zsh
it works in sh and bash
as i don t have a zsh installed i couldn t try it out in zsh but i think it should work there too

40783149
implements	extends
what you re actually looking for is a class that extends knockoutobservablearray instead of a class that implements it
extends however requires an implementation instead of an interface and this implementation is not available in typescript

40784948
mp4	webm
to verify a test as at february 2019 with a clean install of ubuntu 18.04 firefox could not play a test mp4 stream
it can play video using other container standards those with the following file extensions webm and ogg in the terminal ran sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras and accepted all licenses etc with no other changes no flag setting etc firefox can now play the test mp4 stream original answer - for older versions of firefox as noted in the comments ubuntu firefox does not support mp4 natively - this is due to licensing issues

40786145
client-side	server-side
the client-side library stripe.js isn t available from npm so you need to add it to your client-side code the old-fashioned way by using
you used the server-side stripe package of which the documentation states these are serverside bindings only if you re looking to install stripe.js our clientside tokenization library - this is not it

40790590
dictionary	map
better way will be to use list comprehension as or if there is a possibility of any key missing in the nested dictionary you may add filter as
you may use lambda expression with map as even though you do not see loop over here but internally map also iterates over the list

40791249
bash	zsh
specifically the contents of the targeted scripts entry from your package.json file is passed to sh -c as an argument so the command line equivalent of your command would be which will fail in the same way because when bash is invoked as sh by design it doesn t recognize process substitutions because it runs in posix compatibility mode
process substitutions are not part of posix they are a bash-specific extension also supported in zsh and ksh

40792536
factors	matrix
there s some constant factors overhead though for both run-time and space hash table isn t as fast as linked list or array lookup and takes a decent amount extra space to reduce collisions
if you use a hash table instead of either adjacency matrix or list you ll get better or same big-o run-time and space for all operations checking for an edge is o 1 getting all adjacent edges is o degree etc.

40792737
swift	objective-c
so in this case the statement that swift is strict typically refers to how things like variables are typed
but unless you have used another language like objective-c or ruby that is not strict about typing you probably won t appreciate the difference

40794133
prepare	execute
convert dataframe to rdd map vectors to 0 1 indicators aggregate partial results and prepare final output
just because you parallelize access to a local collection it doesn t mean that anything is execute in parallel

40797435
realloc	malloc
realloc is used to resize c-style arrays that were allocated with malloc
realloc cannot be used in c++ code to resize c++ objects that were instantiated in dynamic scope with new

40803065
realloc	malloc
other people have explained why you cannot do this operation in place. you have basically two options either you modify the string in place with realloc to allow you to add your suffix r n
but you have to be careful and use a malloc allocated data

40804443
multiplication	exponent
the main advantages of fixed point over floating point are it is much simpler to implement in hardware certain operations are exact incur no rounding error namely addition subtraction and multiplication by integers assuming the result doesn t overflow
if all your numbers are of the same magnitude you can get a few extra bits of precision in the same width by not needing to store an exponent in 32-bits vs 24-bits in binary32 single precision

40804486
oncreate	onstart
but not the some but all code of your oncreate will be called
following will be the flow of your both activity when ever you navigate from activitya to activityb then onpause of activitya method is called followed by the onstop of activitya and then the method oncreate of activityb is called followed by onstart of activityb and then onresume of activityb

40807947
equals	compareto
the javadoc for java.lang.comparable#compareto says that it returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object to reverse order of collection you can recommended use comparator.reverseorder javadoc which returns a comparator that imposes the reverse ordering of the specified comparator
... invert order of compared parameters not recommended change the sign of compareto method

40808754
google-chrome	firefox
there does not appear to be an option to automatically open the developer tools in new windows tabs opened later as in google-chrome
for firefox you can use the commandline flag --devtools introduced in firefox 45 to start firefox with the developer toolbar open

40810719
union	distinct
according to the c standard 5 tw o declarations of structure union or enumerated types which are in different scopes or use different tags declare distinct types
each declaration of a structure union or enumerated type which does not include a tag declares a distinct type

40811207
erlang	elixir
in erlang actually you can use always use -compile export_all which will export all of your functions but it s not a good practice
it s just a matter of point of view- in ruby python or elixir you have to explicitly tell what methods functions you want to keep private

40817660
ssl	https
secondly i received another redirect loop from cloudflare when re-enabling dns protection to correct this issue go to the overview tab settings summary click on ssl and change ssl from flexible to full strict
this is super embarrassing but i found out when comparing configs that my production server that ghost does not need to have https specified in config.js

40819403
super	self
adding original to the bases of modified will make it work edit per the comments the above suggestion can be simplified since all the methods contained within original will be included in modified without needing to pass the dict in the type call and going one step further if you don t want modified to be a subclass of original you could simply make modified a copy of original and then add attributes the same as you do in your example looking at this answer it appears that you cannot use deepcopy to copy classes and given that you have that super call in your original.__init__ method modified be a subclass of original unless you also modify the __init__ method in your modified class after it s been copied
note i corrected the spelling of original in this answer it appears that the problem is that when your modified object is being instantiated and super is called its being called like super original self since those are the default arguments for super

40819403
super	self
note i corrected the spelling of original in this answer it appears that the problem is that when your modified object is being instantiated and super is called its being called like super original self since those are the default arguments for super
since original is not a superclass of modified check isinstance m original python is not allowing you to call super in that way

40819406
super	self
so the super in the code is equivalent to super orginal self .__init__ and it s determined in compile time
according to the documentation also note that aside from the zero argument form super is not limited to use inside methods

40819948
octal	decimal
see integral literal octal-literal is the digit zero 0 followed by zero or more octal digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
because 01062016 starts with 0 but not 0x hence it is an octal number it s equivalence with 287758 in decimal

40820337
ciimage	uiimage
the heart of the matter is that passing through ciimage is not the way to crop a uiimage
for one thing coming back from ciimage to uiimage is a complicated business

40820420
erlang	elixir
genserver in elixir is wrapper for gen_server in erlang and it provides defaults for undefined functions so in erlang you have to always defined 6 functions and in elixir not
you don t have to use explicitly gen_server which is erlang s module but use genserver

40826134
mvp	presenter
here is a mvp sample using dagger rxjava and retrofit which might help you to learn more about mvp in android
context is a part of android view layer in mvp so presenter must not have any idea about it and you should not pass it to presenter

40828326
jspm	npm
for example to install the above plugin with jspm it will use the following highlighted section
the same is currently not possible with aurelia-cli because the installation is done by npm instead of through jspm that redirects it to npm

40828326
jspm	npm
the same is currently not possible with aurelia-cli because the installation is done by npm instead of through jspm that redirects it to npm
if the author of the plugin didn t specify the jspm section in the package.json you would most likely and up with the same sort of issues

40830363
inline-functions	inlining
this is not too bad but you can avoid that by defining an inline-functions that creates movingsum and captures the + operator
as mentioned by fyodor in the comments types cannot have statically resolved constraints in the same way as functions mainly because static constraints are handled using inlining - and you cannot really inline a whole type

40830592
queue	fifo
a recently added capability in sqs might help somewhat in this regard fifo queue
important at the risk of being misunderstood i am not suggesting that a fifo queue is a magic bullet or that it is either necessary or sufficient

40830592
queue	fifo
important at the risk of being misunderstood i am not suggesting that a fifo queue is a magic bullet or that it is either necessary or sufficient
rather i am suggesting that it has some features that will probably help achieve or simplify the task even though some of these features are not even directly related to the strict-ordered fifo behavior of a fifo queue

40830592
queue	fifo
rather i am suggesting that it has some features that will probably help achieve or simplify the task even though some of these features are not even directly related to the strict-ordered fifo behavior of a fifo queue
each message in a fifo queue has a messagegroupid property which is an opaque alphanumeric string that you specify when sending each message to the queue

40831938
inline	inlining
well min and max are macros which expand to inline code while your checkvalue againstminimum andmaximum is a method which will require a method dispatch so the former is undoubtedly faster but the benefit is probably insignificant over the whole application
if you want clarity and you should but not pay too much for it you could start with a function and to get the benefit of inlining add ns_inline ns_inline cgfloat checkvalue cgfloat min cgfloat v cgfloat max ... both of those have the advantage they are functions typically better compiler error messages no strange effects from double-evaluation of arguments etc

40832280
floating-point	fractions
both use identical ieee-standard floating-point numbers except where matlab violates the standard s rounding rules
python however supports true decimal numbers and fractions which matlab doesn t so it is at least possible to avoid these issues in python but not in matlab

40833446
division	modulo
you can always write the division algorithm yourself completly not using the div or idiv instructions
there s of course a range of modulo s where you basically just need an and instruction and eax 255

40834807
hive	hdfs
if you have a path in hdfs such as user hive warehouse that exists only in hdfs not on the servers file system
so you can t cd user hive warehouse

40836126
haskell	ocaml
it seems quelea.shim is a module of haskell
ocaml is a different language from haskell and therefore cannot understand haskell module paths

40836126
haskell	ocaml
ocaml is a different language from haskell and therefore cannot understand haskell module paths
i have never tried something like this but possible scenario is understand how to load haskell modules and call functions from ordinary c programs

40839534
express	koa
for more info on express see other options other frameworks that you can use to serve static files include koa restify hapi sails loopback and more
without a framework if you still think that you don t want to use a high-level framework that does the job correctly and you want to roll your own solution maybe for educational purposes then see this answer how to serve an image using nodejs it explains how to serve static images with express.static express built-in middleware like in this answer express express but without express.static connect one level below than express http using node s http module net not even using http module all of the examples posted are tested and work on node versions 4 5 6 and 7

40843559
bellman-ford	dijkstra
for dag we ve better algorithm for finding shortest distance and that should be chosen over dijkstra s or bellman-ford s
summary longest path problem has no optimal substructure and thus modifying min-weight function in dijkstra s algorithm to max-weight function alone won t work for a graph be it dag or not

40846711
serializable	deserialization
instead it serializable it and sends it to the worker who de-serialize it in turn
for this serialization deserialization process to work the versions of both sides need to be compatible and that is often not the case especially between major versions

40849433
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has many issues with screen readers that were not primarily written for it such as voiceover safari and nvda firefox
i tested this example myself and the labels were read aloud using voiceover and safari but not with google-chrome - because of these issues

40849661
super	implements
what is happening here is that the super class for derived is int
in python 2 int does not implements rich comparison operators like __lt__ __gt__ or __eq__ as it uses __cmp__ instead

40851098
mri	rubinius
array insertions are not safe on ruby but if you run your code in mri it s going to work every time because gil
gil global interpreter lock was made to prevent this kind of issues but jruby and rubinius does not have gil and works as you expect some times produce 5000 some times less

40851303
implements	extends
explains more precisely how value classes are implements and is useful to see in what cases they survive though some details may have changed since
value classes are designed so that adding or removing extends anyval if legal shouldn t change the results of calculations except even non-case value classes have equals and hashcode defined automatically like case classes

40852799
single-quotes	double-quotes
variables are not expanded within single-quotes
rewrite using double-quotes just remember that double-quotes within double-quotes have to be escaped

40852835
tabcontrol	tabitem
would be to handle the tabcontrol.selectionchanged event and filter for events that actually originate from the tabcontrol and not from some inner content elements
another thing i just realized the same condition could be used in tabitem.previewmouseleftbuttondown in order to filter clicks to the tabitem header vs click events originating from the content area

40852858
calloc	malloc
the only remotely tricky bit is the type to hold the pointer to the dynamically allocated array this code carefully uses calloc to zero all the elements of the array and then calls set_matrix to set them to non-zero values
as written malloc would be better than calloc but the question used calloc and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as

40853702
namedtuple	dictionary
if it s only the cell that changes you can easily do this with a dictionary more parameters per workbook when you have more parameters per workbook as for example the worksheetname you can do that in a few ways namedtuple if it is a fixed number of parameters which will not change a namedtuple is a very convenient structure dictionary of dictionary this works approximately the same only this is more generic
it uses the dict.get method which takes a default argument when the key is missing in the dictionary class you could make a myworkbookclass to keep the information of each workbook but this might be overkill

40858030
realloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
also at a later point this causes memory leak as the memory allocated by malloc is not getting free -d actually

40858325
qtwebengine	qtwebkit
you should switch to qtwebengine it s successor instead which has a qwebenginepage audiomuted property
this is not possible with qtwebkit s qwebview as far as i know

40861324
elasticsearch	kibana
enabling kibana authentication with nginx securing elasticsearch kibana with nginx git- kibana with nginx reverse proxy
are you sure you re not running kibana from the wrong es instance and both kibana and nginx are running on the same server

40864941
spaces	linefeed
in this case user agents should treat a cr linefeed pair u+000d u+000a as a single white spaces character
by providing exactly 6 hexadecimal digits 000026b b for example the spaces helps distinguish the string 2022 ff from the string 2022ff which would mean something entirely different i m not even sure it represents an actual character

40869328
multiplication	modulo
before this let s examine the myth of sqrt being expensive but a large bunch of multiplication is not
first of all let us note that sqrt is not that expensive anymore on older cpu-es x86 32b it used to be twice as expensive as a division and a modulo is division on newer architectures the cpu costs are equal

40871431
boost	allocator
especially with fixed columns size being some power of two the flat memory structure will be not just simpler to code for but also it may receive considerable performance boost from having the rows in continuous memory
your solution depends on malloc allocator strategy and with fragmented heap you may end with each row of colors in different cache-page having several additional cache-misses than flat structure

40872910
inline	inlining
the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

40877066
calloc	malloc
the price members are left uninitialized in case of conversion failure which leads to undefined behavior unless you use calloc but the result is still meaningless
there are multiple problems in your code you allocate too much memory in read and you do not need to cast the return value of malloc in c but you should check for allocation failure

40878123
google-chrome	firefox
it seems like firefox will cut the string after max_chars which is different for every representation base while google-chrome doesn t
i didn t find any valid reference in the mdn but if you check for example the same for radix 35 firefox 0.4b5r4d4d4d4 google-chrome 0.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 you can check this in all browsers in google-chrome the max lenght i got was 1101 while in firefox it was 19

40878861
google-chrome	safari
to clear all local stored data including service worker registrations for google-chrome at least you can open the web inspector go to the application tab and click the clear site data button
safari does not yet support service worker so you shouldn t see the same behavior there

40879169
direct3d	directx
i recommend skimming through a direct3d directx opengl game development book just to get an idea of what goes into everything.
they aren t hard to find walk into a bookstore and look for the thickest heaviest book--that will be the directx game development book

40880987
uicontrol	uibutton
if you want to still use any then convert sender to actual uicontrol that it is belong to
you are getting this error because when you are converting sender to anyobject you are getting immutable type object so you cannot update its properties the best option to solved your problem is to change your sender declaration from any to actual uicontrol means if it is button then uibutton

40883557
subtraction	addition
see the subtraction operator and the abstract tonumber operation it uses
5 + 4 54 when either operand is a string the + is string concatenation not addition and the other operand is coerced to string if necessary

40886458
virtualenv	conda
build a virtualenv with that s it
if you want to install more packages try conda first then pip if not included conda install scipy pandas or

40886837
ionic	angular
take a look at the ionic documentation about progressive web apps also check which browser versions you need to support as ionic doesn t support older browsers
ionic applications are build with the same techniques and frameworks you could use for building a web app like angular 2 html and css

40888050
postgresql	mysql
you might consider switching to postgresql if a full complement of set operations are needed for your project
mysql doesn t offer the intersect operation

40889713
mp4	h.264
mp4 h.264 is not the best format for scrubbing - it s designed primarily for streamed forward linear playback
the apple page do use some mp4 videos but only for triggered linear playback when in view not for scrubbing

40890805
realloc	strcpy
use realloc instead
you allocate incorrect amounts of memory so the arrays aren t large enough to hold the strings you strcpy into them

40894601
nodevalue	innerhtml
you cannot do this as the nodevalue for an htmlelement your em element is null
you will need to set the textcontent innertext or innerhtml instead

40894821
swift	objective-c
you can fix this easily like so edit since your question seems to be more along the lines of how do i replicate objective-c s notion of which you can t do in swift i ll mention that you might find it worthwhile to review your design
when i moved from objective-c to swift i thought not being able to use something like would be hard to get around and even filed a bug report with apple about it but in practice it hasn t been an issue

40903015
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you have access to the httpd.conf then placing rules there can be easier to manage in one place faster allowoverrides none means that the server does not look in the current directory and any parent directories for an override file to parse and follow and since .htaccess files are not present in the website directory they cannot be edited and if created will be ignored
there are three issues here in terms of which is better performance management security .htaccess is slower harder to manage and potentially less secure

40904948
equals	compareto
equals is not used by treemap and compareto indeed takes its place
your compareto method compares the lengths of the name string s instead of their content so student s having names with same length are considered identical by the treemap

40905352
swift	objective-c
referring to apple documentation about using swift from objective-c a swift class must be a descendant of an objective-c class to be accessible and usable in objective-c means that your class should be objective-c class someswift nsobject you re right
but you cannot access the whole thing in swift file when you create a swift class that descends from an objective-c class the class and its members properties methods subscripts and initializers that are compatible with objective-c are automatically available from objective-c

40905352
swift	objective-c
but you cannot access the whole thing in swift file when you create a swift class that descends from an objective-c class the class and its members properties methods subscripts and initializers that are compatible with objective-c are automatically available from objective-c
this excludes swift-only features such as those listed here generics tuples enumerations defined in swift without int raw value type structures defined in swift top-level functions defined in swift global variables defined in swift typealiases defined in swift swift-style variadics nested types curried functions reference

40906032
uiview	uiwindow
this is a subclass of uiview so it doesn t have a uiviewcontroller yet
therefore it is then set as the view of the earlier mentioned plain uiviewcontroller which is then set as the rootviewcontroller of the uiwindow which is made key and visible after which we re ready

40906959
daemons	systemd
your answer is the following run two emacs daemons s in a single systemd my suggestion would be to run another emacs instance since you did c-5 2 to create a new frame both those frames are using the same emacs process and thus virtualenv will not work
by running two daemons instances you will not have this problem

40910102
seaborn	matplotlib
so this is the code that hopefully does what you want the op asked in a comment whether this can be found in the seaborn documentation
of course part of this is just pure matplotlib not specific to seaborn

40910787
super	extends
another problem with extensions is the you can only use self but not super
this may create problems in future when you have to extends the properties

40910993
implements	extends
also use it if you do not want to implements your own custom optimizations
extends react.component consider the above example

40913118
octal	decimal	octal	binary
it doesn t work because numbers beginning with a 0 are interpreted as octal numbers
from the integers page of the php documentation emphasis mine integers can be specified in decimal base 10 hexadecimal base 16 octal base 8 or binary base 2 notation optionally preceded by a sign - or +

40916620
margin	text-align
sometimes when these won t suffice you will have to use padding margin which again is very much safe acceptable i don t know what that means here though - however you take it
just need to understand that when you have defined a container as flex you cannot use few block properties like text-align etc

40919125
inline	inlining
the basic idea is that the jit uses a couple size thresholds when making inlining decisions - one small threshold 30 bytes under which it almost always inline and another larger threshold 300 bytes over which it never inline
between the thresholds whether it inline or not depends on whether the method is hot or not and other heuristics such as whether it has already been inlined elsewhere

40919459
gridview	sqldatasource
when using the page designer you can wire up the datasource to the gridview using the gridview context menu
or it can be set programmatically say in page_load gridview supports a number of data source controls you are not limited to sqldatasource

40920124
postgresql	mysql
it s less flexible with backends but supports the same sql aurora is planned to mimic postgresql which supports modern sql so that will be an option in the future
no aurora currently mimics mysql 5.6 which does not support it

40922783
bash	zsh
if you have node.js installed you can easily install it with npm install -g shall if not follow the above link to the github repo for manual installation instructions and then use it as follows shall scriptfile or with an ad-hoc command by default it invokes sh and if installed dash bash zsh and ksh but you can target any set of shells that you have installed by using the shells environment variable
using the example of the echo -n command on macos to only target shells sh and bash on macos bash effectively acts as sh and while echo -n didn t fail when used with sh you can also see that -n wasn t recognized as an option when bash ran as sh

40923132
google-chrome	firefox
also the downloaded file size in google-chrome didnt showed the uncompressed file size while firefox showed the correct compressed files size
it seems a problem google-chrome browser i had same problem i though that deflate is not working at the server but then i tried firefox and used firebug which correctly showed content-encoding in the headers

40932943
jmeter	blazemeter
there is no much difference cause blazemeter uses jmeter
blazemeter provides some extra services on top of jmeter for instance if your machine is not powerful enough to conduct the load you will have to go for distributed testing

40932943
jmeter	blazemeter
blazemeter provides some extra services on top of jmeter for instance if your machine is not powerful enough to conduct the load you will have to go for distributed testing
in case of blazemeter you don t have to worry about getting extra machines installing jmeter on them configuring clustering etc

40935785
noexcept	throw
if it must not use noexcept c++11 or throw c++11 in addition you can help yourself a lot by deriving any user exception from either std runtime_error or std logic_error or any of the other standard errors
now throw with either throw emptyheap

40937024
inline	inlining
kindall s the deque solution tweaked for performance correctness by using islice instead of a home-rolled generator expression and testing the resulting length so it doesn t yield results when the iterable is shorter than the window as well as passing the maxlen of the deque positionally instead of by keyword makes a surprising difference for smaller inputs same as previous adapted kindall solution but with each yield win changed to yield tuple win so storing results from the generator works without all stored results really being a view of the most recent result all other reasonable solutions are safe in this scenario and adding to the function definition to move use of tuple from the b in legb to the l consume -based solution shown above same as consume but inlining else case of consume to avoid function call and n is none test to reduce runtime particularly for small inputs where the setup overhead is a meaningful part of the work side-note a variant on pairwise that uses tee with the default argument of 2 repeatedly to make nested tee objects so any given iterator is only advanced once not independently consumed an increasing number of times similar to mrdrfenner s answer is similar to non-inlined consume and slower than the inline consume on all tests so i ve omitted it those results for brevity
as you can see if you don t care about the possibility of the caller needing to store results my optimized version of kindall s solution wins most of the time except in the large iterable small window size case where inline consume wins

40937708
webchromeclient	webviewclient
instead of that you can use webchromeclient and set progressbar as below
webviewclient doesn t have onprogresschanged method

40938671
quicksort	mergesort
in quicksort they are found by partitioning the input array into two parts containing values that are smaller and not smaller than a chosen pivot
the recombination step for mergesort is merging

40939780
move	drag
if the scenario doesn t require a lot of drag-drops you could use the double-click on add-in taskpane to update current active cell with the data and move cell selection to next logical cell right down etc. to allow next update
drag and drop is not supported

40949989
setinterval	settimeout
so do this nb cleartimeout would also work in most browsers but it just makes more sense to call clearinterval when you used setinterval and cleartimeout when you used settimeout
the argument you need to pass to clearinterval not cleartimeout is not the name of the function you passed to setinterval but the value that setinterval returns

40950457
ubuntu	linux
for ubuntu see this wiki article for more details ubuntu wiki clipboard persistence nb i have not actually tested any of the suggested solutions myself so i don t know whether any of them will work with pyqt
the basic problem is that on linux the clipboard only stores a reference to the underlying data

40950483
queue	fifo
a fifo fifo buffer in a uart is a hardware implemented queue of received or transmitted data
you do not access the fifo directly instead you read or write the data register and this data is automatically read or written from the head of the queue

40950483
queue	fifo
you do not access the fifo directly instead you read or write the data register and this data is automatically read or written from the head of the queue
a fifo can improve link efficiency because it allows software data read write timing to vary while maintaining streaming data on the physical link

40952872
matplotlib	colormap
unfortunaly matplotlib does not provide the functionality of matlab s demcmap . there might actually be some build-in features in the python basemap package of which i m not aware
so sticking to matplotlib on-board options we can subclass normalize to build a color normalization centered around a point in the middle of the colormap

40954250
jar	manifest.mf
before run the jar check main-class classname is available or not in manifest.mf file
manifest.mf is present in jar

40954598
passenger	puma
i know the op mentioned puma but i want to highlight the following for passenger so other reader are aware of differences
the thing is passenger bridges cleverly nginx + your rails app and it wouldn t work to have them on different containers

40954598
passenger	puma
the thing is passenger bridges cleverly nginx + your rails app and it wouldn t work to have them on different containers
passenger puma s job is to be able to scale a pool of rails server processes threads depending on the incoming traffic the idea is to have several of them running so you re not dead when a user uploads a big file and your server has to wait for it and cannot serve other users

40954598
passenger	puma
passenger puma s job is to be able to scale a pool of rails server processes threads depending on the incoming traffic the idea is to have several of them running so you re not dead when a user uploads a big file and your server has to wait for it and cannot serve other users
but passenger s magic is to be able to start a rails server automatically based on the configuration of the nginx vhosts

40957282
hex	binary
you cannot store 0183 in a single byte because this value requires word or two bytes it seems you confuse byte value with its representation for human eyes - in decimal hex binary or another form
for example your ea1 byte is low byte of needed value and it is to look at value in hex use format with x specifier edit you have a byte containing value 65 as example

40957869
google-chrome	firefox
doesn t work on local non-served after checking carefully it s a cross-origin problem on google-chrome and either a non well-formed or syntax error on firefox
xmlhttprequest this works when used with a server works on local non-served with firefox strangely two alert happen one with empty content one with the loaded content doesn t work on local non-served with google-chrome cross origin problem

40957869
google-chrome	firefox
xmlhttprequest this works when used with a server works on local non-served with firefox strangely two alert happen one with empty content one with the loaded content doesn t work on local non-served with google-chrome cross origin problem
interesting note found here the only caveat is google-chrome which restricts access to local files via ajax

40960281
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
it also says note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

40961220
spaces	delimiter
the outer for-loop reads now also the entire line from text file but splits it up into individual strings tokens using spaces tab as delimiter
the first 5 spaces tab separated strings are 2 dec 2016 14 37 gmt those 5 strings are not of interest

40961387
dictionary	map
not callable basically means it is not a function and series.apply accepts a function - not a dictionary
try map instead note to use map you don t have to convert your mapping to a dictionary

40962941
junit	mockito
no rules no runners junit 4 rules and runners don t work in junit 5 so the mockitorule and the mockito runner can not be used
there are different ways to use mockito - i ll go through them one by one

40962941
junit	mockito
manually creating mocks manually with mockito mock works regardless of the junit version or test framework for that matter
annotation based using the mock -annotation and the corresponding call to mockitoannotations initmocks to create mocks works regardless of the junit version or test framework for that matter but java 9 could interfere here depending on whether the test code ends up in a module or not

40962941
junit	mockito
annotation based using the mock -annotation and the corresponding call to mockitoannotations initmocks to create mocks works regardless of the junit version or test framework for that matter but java 9 could interfere here depending on whether the test code ends up in a module or not
mockito extension junit 5 has a powerful extension model and mockito recently published one under the group artifact id org.mockito mockito-junit-jupiter

40963340
gson	moshi
hence this is still not quite as convenient as gson s approach
plus you have to have a do-nothing tojson method as otherwise moshi rejects your type adapter

40965523
implements	extends
the source code for php is similar to when you extends implements the sessionhandlerinterface you get a blank slate with no developed code or parent functions to refer back to
you do not get to extends the functional concrete class that runs in the default deployment

40970109
tvos	ios
as the documentation says it is an optional view just set it to nil output before setting mask view to nil should be like after setting mask view to nil should be like aside bar note comparing with ios it seems that the mask view is nil -by default- but not with tvos
i tried both of them and the log outputs were for ios nil for tvos optional _uiscrollviewgradientmaskview 0x7ff078c037f0

40975007
swift	objective-c
the most significantly bad thing in your code is that usual closures in swift convention swift -- usually omitted cannot be passed to any which represents id of objective-c
use convention block which is stated as id -compatible in the swift book this part you may have tried this but in this case just putting convention block does not solve the issue

40984845
client-side	server-side
if the client-side html editor has a preview that must also be sanitized to prevent dom xss and preview is often not sent to the server the edited content is just displayed right away on the client without a server roundtrip
while this is a lower risk xss it definitely is one that you need to prevent and server-side sanitization does little good here

40990051
postgresql	mysql
if you re using php i d go with postgresql
otherwise mysql because sql server doesn t always play as nice with php need to load specific sql server drivers if on linux

40993519
multiplying	multiplication
multiplication was traditionally a relatively slow operation but it is darn fast on modern processors and this will be especially fast because it s only multiplying two byte-sized values
you could just as easily have replaced the multiplication with the bitwise and operator which does not do short-circuit evaluation

40996908
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
you shouldn t rely on this though per pep 8 code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other implementations of python pypy jython ironpython cpython psyco and such
for example do not rely on cpython s efficient implementation of in-place string concatenation for statements in the form a + b or a a + b

41004731
ssl	https
i don t recommend disabling the ssl certificate validation completely as you might open yourself to unexpected consequences
java is not able to verify the validity of the ssl certificate on the https server

41004964
dictionary	map
thanks to those two features a hashable object can be used as a key in a generic hash map in python mmutable built-in objects are hashable while mutable containers such as lists or dictionary are not
user-defined objects are by default hashable hashtable in general hash table hash map is a data structure used to implement an associative array a structure that can map keys to values

41008150
tensorflow	cudnn
if that actual library version does not match at least from a compatibility version perspective the version of the cudnn library that tensorflow was compiled against then that s a good indication that things may not work and so tensorflow points this out when it is running loaded runtime cudnn library 5005 but source was compiled with 5103
this is tensorflow telling you hey i was designed compiled to work with cudnn v5.1 but you are only giving me cudnn 5.0 to work with

41008312
dictionary	map
each time it hits a new row it is checking to see if that row has is in the map yet again think dictionary
if the value is there it takes the previous value with getorelse and adds 1 to it then updates the acc map with that new pair or it initializes it at one if it doesn t exist yet since it was the first time the row was seen

41010102
decoder	encoder
in your case video decoder supports it and audio decoder doesn t so it is 3 threads - 1 main thread + 2 threads for video decoding
similarly setting threads n on output enables multithreaded filtering and encoding which can spawn n additional threads for each filtergraph i think in older ffmpeg versions this was up to n threads per each filter and each encoder which supports it

41010872
swift	objective-c
compile it and if it will generate linker error like compiled with newer version of swift language 3.0 than previous files 2.0 for architecture x86_64 or armv 7 make one more change in your xcode - project - target - build settings - use legacy swift language version - yes build and run
if you want to use swift file into objective-c class so from xcode 8 onwards you can follow below steps if you have created the project in objective-c create new swift file xcode will automatically prompt for bridge-header file generate it import projectname-swift.h in your objective-c controller import in implementation not in interface if your project has space in between name so use underscore project_name-swift.h you will be able to access your objective-c class in swift

41010879
erlang	elixir
yes elixir doesn t follow the same concept as erlang in this regard
elixir tries to be more accessible for developers less familiar with functional programming especially ruby developers

41013709
fgets	strcpy
the fgets man page says fgets reads characters from the current stream position to and including the first newline character to the end of the stream or until the number of characters read is equal to n 1 whichever comes first
that is why you get a match when you set up c with strcpy but not with fgets

41016276
wildfly	jboss
you said you re using jboss but that error message is specific to jboss wildfly
i ll assume that you re indeed targeting jboss wildfly and thus not apache tomcat nor jboss

41016276
wildfly	jboss
i ll assume that you re indeed targeting jboss wildfly and thus not apache tomcat nor jboss
the correct approach to enable utf-8 in jboss wildfly is to edit its standalone configuration standalone.xml to change the following line to add the default-encoding attribute in case you re actually using jboss 7.x and that error was merely uncarefully copypasted from a test environment the correct approach to enable utf-8 in jboss 7.x and thus not 6.x or lower

41021753
prepare	execute
for most cases all you would see would be one initial prepare 64237612638712636123 ... as .
and later a lot of execute 64237612638712636123 ... which isn t that helpful

41027390
ng-app	ng-controller
what you can do is you can move ng-app directive on body level have ng-controller on two different divs
two ng-app on single page doesn t work it will compile only the 1st instance of ng-app and the other will get ignored

41028093
google-chrome	firefox
the latest version of google-chrome 55.0.2883.75 m behaves exactly the same as 54
google-chrome 53 did not have this issue at all and neither does firefox or ie as reported

41033764
factors	matrix
suppose we are interested in a model with two factors f + g numerical covariates do not matter so i include none of them
the response does not appear in model matrix so drop it too

41034062
sudo	passwd
if you open mysql with sudo command then it will open but not open from your current user
for example lenovo lenovo-thinkpad-e460 etc mysql -u root -p enter passwd error 1698 28000 access denied for user root localhost here current ubuntu user is lenovo

41035489
ienumerable	ilist
if the collection that implements ienumerable happens to implement ilist as well you could cast and add for improved performance and memory usage but different semantics.
the answers given are good but please be aware that you re not tacking new items onto the end of your ienumerable

41035985
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and should not suffer from oom error

41035985
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and should not suffer from oom error
there are pleny tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

41035985
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the wrong svn2git in your case is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

41036133
swift	objective-c
if an objective-c method is overridden by a swift method that cannot be represented in objective-c such as by specifying a parameter to be a variable that method must be marked nonobjc
to summarize use objective-c when you want to expose a swift attribute to objective-c without a namespace

41037954
implements	extends
it is however not yet decided upon nor planned nor implements
you can create a normal extension method you just can t redefine override or extends what the operators do

41040850
vim	emacs
rtags will generate an rtags file in emacs tags format then etags2ctags will transform that into an rtags file which vim can read
unlink deletes the rtags file since it s not needed for vim

41041738
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome request to example.com contains gzip google-chrome response from example.com does not contain gzip curl request clone of google-chrome request contains gzip curl response contains gzip conclusion google-chrome does currently not show the content-encoding
neither does firefox

41047302
swift	objective-c
but if you do it right on both counts swift will do the bridging for you and the objective-c will not be needed
one obvious problem is that in swift 3 this is not the correct signature the correct signature is notice the difference the underscore

41047302
swift	objective-c
swift 3 is very choosy about this
you did not show enough context for me to know if you re getting that part right. the objective-c declaration works around both problems by explicitly bridging this function to objective-c

41047520
ssl	https
while there are a some proxies and some clients which support to be accessed by https too this would essentially mean to build an ssl connection between client and proxy and inside this ssl connection another ssl connection between client and final target double encryption
lwp does not support the use of http proxies which are accessed using https

41047520
ssl	https
thus the code should instead use a http url to access the proxy and not a https url note that this only works in the usual setup with io socket ssl installed on the system and used by lwp
especially with setting perl_net_https_ssl_socket_class to net ssl or explicitly importing net ssl into the program the obsolete crypt ssleay will be used where proxy handling is completely different

41047520
ssl	https
especially with setting perl_net_https_ssl_socket_class to net ssl or explicitly importing net ssl into the program the obsolete crypt ssleay will be used where proxy handling is completely different
even though the proxy will be accessed by http and not https the connection is still encrypted

41048011
vbo	vao
gl_element_array_buffer -binding changed somehow thus the parameters given to gldrawelements may cause access beyond the memory of that object gl_element_array_buffer s content has changed possibly referencing uninitialized non-existent vertex data vbo access out of bounds any of the associated gl_array_buffer objects data was altered thus not containing referenced vertex data anymore vbo access out of bounds or even more of such changes
access violations inside mostly mean that any of the objects bound within the vao state was accessed out of bounds

41048360
scheme	racket
this is actually intentional and is part of the scheme standard r5rs r7rs
it is not restricted to racket but should be the output of any scheme interpreter repl

41065910
apache	nginx
here s how you can fix it depending on your web server and if you have access to it apache set the limitrequestbody directive in either your httpd.conf file or a local .htaccess
nginx set the client_max_body_size directive in nginx.conf iis set the uploadreadaheadsize config setting if your not the owner of the server you could either try uploading a smaller compressed file or sending the request with an multipart form-data content-type

41068740
swift	objective-c
objective-c class which use swift enum objcclass.h objcclass.m detect swift code in objective-c code in my sample i use swiftcode.h to detect swift code in objective-c
this file generate automatically i did not create a physical copy of this header file in a project and you can only set name of this file if the compiler can not find your header file swift code try to compile the project

41069378
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout evaluates your function once setinterval is more suited to call your chrono at specified interval
and you must pass setinterval a callback chrono not the chrono function

41069696
jacoco	eclemma
eclemma is based on jacoco code coverage library and simply provides its integration into eclipse the actual work instrumentation and analysis is performed by jacoco
jacoco performs analysis of bytecode not the source code

41071643
memcpy	memmove
memcpy is more efficient than memmove. in your case you most probably are not doing the exact same thing while you run the two functions
in general use memmove only if you have to

41072337
ssl	https
that might install the ssl certificate for you
if it does not consider changing your app s launch settings from https to http

41073009
swift	objective-c
swift doesn t have selectors
objective-c sends messages to objects while swift calls functions

41073631
comparator	comparable
since your t implements comparable use comparator note that that also calls next only once per iteration since next advanced the iterator
comparable doesn t override the and operators nothing can

41075156
super	implements	super	extends
yeah that s a correct way to do it except that you forgot to pass the options object when calling super as for using type alias it won t work well in your case because as stated in interfaces vs
type aliases a second more important difference is that type aliases cannot be extended or implements from nor can they extends implements other types

41076139
factors	matrix
there are two ways out of this problem at least for as far as gstat is concerned install an optimized version of blas eg openblas or mkl - this does not solve the o n 3 problem but may speed up maximally a factors n with n the number of cores available avoid decomposing the full covariance matrix by choosing local neighbourhoods arguments maxdist and or nmax
the complexity of the choleski decomposition or similar is o n 3 meaning that if you multiply the number of points by 10 the time it will take increases with a factors 1000

41076879
queue	fifo
the ecmascript specs do not enforce a priority for servicing different job queue this specification does not define the order in which multiple job queue are serviced
an ecmascript implementation may interweave the fifo evaluation of the pendingjob records of a job queue with the evaluation of the pendingjob records of one or more other job queue

41077796
multiplication	modulo
by then applying a multiplication operator false turns to 0 and true turns into 1
thus if the number is divisible by 3 we get 0 as the result of the modulo true when applying not 1 when multiplying and the string fizz replicated 1 time as the result of the multiplication

41077796
multiplying	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
thus if the number is divisible by 3 we get 0 as the result of the modulo true when applying not 1 when multiplying and the string fizz replicated 1 time as the result of the multiplication
if it is not divisible we get 0 as operand for the multiplication effectively getting the string fizz replicated 0 times thus an empty string

41079813
scala	typesafe
this looks like a good library for adding more scala friendly interfaces to the java objects to parse your values all the code required would be if you do not want to add another library this will work as a one off parser in java
personally i really don t like the interfaces on java typesafe config objects

41080869
theano	tensorflow
you can test with this theano and let us know your results
theano can handle variable length sequences but tensorflow cannot

41085541
apache	nginx
in there you need to change your proxy check if you re not using apache to nginx like so #
bin bash set -xe opt elasticbeanstalk bin healthd-track-pidfile --proxy nginx if you are using apache it means that there s something wrong with your apache runtime instance or process

41085704
erlang	elixir

i couldn t find a similar description for elixir but i presume it s similar

41091290
profiling	debugging
let s run it through the profiling by pressing cmd + i and choose the time profiling template
somehow the profiling wasn t able to separate these functions probably because they were inlined so i had to run only 1 function per attempt not only they are an order of magnitude faster than debugging but the results are reversed to bool is now faster than int

41091290
profiling	debugging
somehow the profiling wasn t able to separate these functions probably because they were inlined so i had to run only 1 function per attempt not only they are an order of magnitude faster than debugging but the results are reversed to bool is now faster than int
the profiling doesn t tell us why how so we must go on a witch hunt

profiling	instrumentation
the profiling doesn t tell us why how so we must go on a witch hunt
let s check the memory allocation by adding an allocation instrumentation ha

41093423
erlang	elixir
else it s muted the part of this process that s relevant to the question is edlin which is an erlang implementation of readline-like functionality
edlin is unfortunately not documented particularly well as far as i can tell but the gist of using it in elixir based on what i m able to glean out of lib kernel src group.erl is the following call edlin.init in the process that s using edlin this sets up a kill buffer in the emacs sense of a kill ring when you re ready to read a line call where prompt is a charlist representing - you guessed it - your shell s command-line prompt handle requests which should be in the form of

implements	extends
first let s define the trait that will be used to inject json decoder dependency next we define object that creates instance implements this trait as you can notice apply requires implicit to be in scope when it called
then we copy io.circe.generic.auto object content and create a trait i made pr to have this trait available as io.circe.generic.auto next in the package com.example.app.json that uses json decoding a lot we create package object if does not exist and make it extends auto trait and provide implicit returning for given type t now all source files in com.example.app.json has auto implicits in scope you can get for any type t that has or for which it can be generated with auto implicits you do not need to import io.circe.generic.auto._ in every file you can switch between json libraries by only changing com.example.app.json package object content

elasticsearch	kibana
use kibana to visualise data from elasticsearch index
you can use logstash but as you have mentioned that you have multiple containers it will not be advised to install logstash agent on all the containers and then send data to a central server hosting elasticsearch kibana

41103938
elasticsearch	kibana
you can use logstash but as you have mentioned that you have multiple containers it will not be advised to install logstash agent on all the containers and then send data to a central server hosting elasticsearch kibana
you can use the following tools - use filebeat install it on all the containers - it is a lightweight data shipper send filebeat data to logstash central server which will host elasticsearch kibana create logstash configuration file to parse data send output to elasticsearch

retrofit	okhttp
if you are doing this with the latest version of retrofit okhttp the current set of solutions aren t sufficient
retrofit no longer offers a requestinterceptor so you need to use okhttp s interceptors to accomplish a similar task create your interceptor you d need to add the interceptor to your okhttp client i didn t test the above code so some slight modifications may need to be made

direct3d	directx
directx 11 is supported on windows 7 windows 8.1 and windows 10 and requires wddm 1.x drivers which are widely available for video hardware ranging from direct3d hardware feature level 9.1 to 11.1
directx 12 is supported on windows 10 including xbox one and requires wddm 2.0 drivers which are not available for all video hardware

41106279
direct3d	directx
wddm 2.0 drivers are widely available for most direct3d feature level 11.0 or later hardware which is most of the gpus in the market for core pc gamers but not for the bulk of video cards used in business settings or older pc gaming systems
right now the sweet spot for using directx 12 is if you are writing a game and have a good-sized experienced team of graphics developers

41106635
stateless	stateful
in the code below i didn t change your login to be stateless but it still works because i ve muted the value within a react component
from what i can see of your code login should not be a stateful component since it does nothing to mutate the state.

41107382
swift	objective-c
to fix it basically your factory method implementation doesn t match its return type the result are type problems in swift because swift trusts type declarations
your factory method implementation in objective-c is wrong

41117846
ssl	https
get yourself a wildcard ssl certificate so that any site eg www.abc.example1.com www.def.example1.com will all be supported
what you are trying to do will be difficult because cors is one thing and mixing http https is not recommended

41119979
inline	inlining
inline or not it will do the same
if performance does matter and it makes a noticable and significant difference then don t rely on current or past inlining conditions inline it yourself do not put it in a separate function

41124530
aggregate-functions	sum
you are not grouping by it nor using an aggregate-functions on it
+ all_subs_day.charge_amt - sum select distinct min trunc all_subs_day.charge_amt sup.share_usage 4 + all_subs_day.charge_amt - sum trunc all_subs_day.charge_amt sup.share_usage 4 as charge_amt from table names

41125798
inline	constexpr
one more thing in c++17 constexpr static data member variables will be inline too
that means you can omit the out of line definition of static constexpr variables but not static const

41126661
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome this is considered experimental even after being available for a couple few years
it is not available in firefox

41128369
jar	war
so i imagine that this jar is not for the server side but when you want to call a webservice as a client
it looks like that your cxf lib is already provided by jboss and you add another version in your war

41131930
vsto	add-in
microsoft office applications can disable vsto add-in that behave unexpectedly
if an application does not load your vsto add-in the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in

41131930
vsto	add-in
if an application does not load your vsto add-in the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in
hard disabling can occur when an vsto add-in causes the application to close unexpectedly

41131930
vsto	add-in
it might also occur on your development computer if you stop the debugger while the startup event handler in your vsto add-in is executing
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close

41131930
vsto	add-in
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close
for example an application might soft disable a vsto add-in if it throws an unhandled exception while the startup event handler is executing

41133841
swift	objective-c
delegates and datasources in ios are objective-c protocols not sure what they are called in swift
objective-c protocols are kind of like c# interfaces but objective-c protocols can have required and optional methods while all of the methods in an interface must be implemented by the inheriting class

41134269
ubuntu	centos
that link also contains required steps to install ms sql server on your dev machine working on ubuntu doesn t work on aws but you can just spin up an rds instance there . it also contains basic instructions on how to create test tables and data in the database and php connectivity code
php 5.6 ubuntu sudo apt-get install php5.6-sybase freetds-common libsybdb5 aws centos redhat sudo yum install php56-mssql after that you can connect to the mssql database through php with something like this you can troubleshoot mssql with something like this on the command line tsql -h your.server.name -p 1433 -u yourusername -p yourpassword -d yourdatabasename php 7+ microsoft has native drivers we can use

41139051
persistent	transient
variables may be marked transient to indicate that they are not part of the persistent state of an object
you can use transient key word for it

41141956
swift	objective-c
try this in swift 3 the first argument label is a part of method signature and when generating objective-c selector it is concatenated with with so the default objective-c selector for func helloworld a string becomes helloworldwitha
if you do not like this behaviour you can write your helloworld as func helloworld _ a string and its objective-c selector becomes helloworld

41142559
aggregate-functions	sum
edit by comment if duplicates need some aggregate-functions like max first sum mean with groupby and then concat data together another solution with pd.lreshape
i think you need add another column to parameter id_vars in melt another simplier solution with stack drop_duplicates by default keep only first value and last unstack if works with real data you can easy get valueerror index contains duplicate entries cannot reshape then solution is bellow or another answer nedd groupby by columns which creates new index before reset_index here skunumber and category and aggregate some function like mean sum max min first .

41144643
profiling	instrumentation
by far the best way of doing this is by not doing it yourself but by running your code under a profiling an off-the-shelf application which does the timing and optionally instrumentation automatically all without polluting your source code.
what you are trying to do is known as known as profiling getting the duration of each function call and instrumentation injecting code into the functions to get more detailed but probably less accurate timing information

41145820
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and also makes proper git tags from the svn tags

41145820
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and also makes proper git tags from the svn tags
there are pleny tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

41145820
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the wrong svn2git in your case is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

41166985
lisp	scheme
other dialects of lisp such as common lisp and emacs lisp have multiple form evaluation in their cond clauses so not allowing it in scheme would only reduce compatibility adding to someone s workload when they convert code from another dialect to scheme
scheme isn t a functional language let alone a non-strictly evaluated one

41167213
filewriter	printwriter
the filewriter is just used to open a file in append mode as printwriter does not have a suitable constructor to do that directly
you could also write characters with it but a printwriter allows for formatted output

41167473
realloc	malloc
for realloc specifically quoting the c11 standard chapter 7.22.3.5 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

41167730
realloc	malloc
the function called realloc will reallocate the area of memory provided that it was previously allocated with malloc calloc or realloc and not yet free with making a call to free
if free is called on a piece of memory prior to realloc will result in undefined behavior

41168247
implements	extends
treemap and various other map implementations implements serializable but the map interface itself does not extends serializable
i see some options make sure the type of myhappytreemap is not simply map but treemap or some other map subtype that extends implements serializable

41168247
implements	extends
i see some options make sure the type of myhappytreemap is not simply map but treemap or some other map subtype that extends implements serializable
cast your map instance as serializable only recommended if you know the map instance type implements serializable otherwise you will get a classcastexception

41168854
inline	constexpr
in case of c++11 it won t be as easy to allow lambda to be declared inline but let s give it a try
we could create some helper struct to wrap our lambda but as unary + operator isn t constexpr lambda has not linkage we need to do some workarounds... functionwrapper should now provide unique static function for each pair std size_t x lambda

41171967
client-side	server-side
a common source of confusion among beginners is that a quick page refresh will reset their client-side state and cause them to suspect that it isn t working
often when all you want to do is perform client-side actions you may want to skip the server-side controls altogether and just use normal html elements

41172099
serializable	deserialization
allow_null normally an error will be raised if none is passed to a serializable field
required normally an error will be raised if a field is not supplied during deserialization

41174428
noexcept	throw
marking the destructor as noexcept false fixes this
the recommendation that we should not throw exception in destructor is not an absolute

41175512
client-side	server-side
but it will work fine for client-side scripts
the syntax is awkward you should add the following to the top of your script jshint esnext true note that as the other answer says this will not work for server-side scripts because apps script doesn t support es6

41176784
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
in your code given your data structure you ll end up having something like this in the line generator and the same for your circles apparently this is supported by google-chrome and firefox but not by safari
curiously the pattern yyyy-mm-dd is included in the ecma standard so this is probably a safari specific issue

41182502
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in swift it doesn t work in viewdidload but works in viewwillappear
here s the one-liner in objective c that line of code works in viewdidload

41182986
r-tree	quadtree
there are other multidimensional trees that are usually better than kd-trees quadtree r trees like r-tree but much faster for updates or ph-tree
the ph-tree is like a quadtree but much more space efficient scales better with dimensions and depth is limited by maximum bitwidth of values maximum 10000 requires 14 bit so the depth will not be more than 14

41187163
imperative	declarative
- this cop is aimed at large block in the imperative programming sense
as a general guide it does not apply to dsls which are often declarative

41187344
spaces	linefeed
if that s the case do the following mark this spot as the label l which denotes the start of a loop add a line from the input to the pattern spaces test if you now have a closing bracket in your pattern spaces if so jump to the label e if not jump to the label l mark this spot as the label e which denotes the end of the code remove the linefeed from the pattern spaces implicitly print the pattern spaces whether it has been modified or not this can probably be refined but it does the trick edit if you can disable history expansion set +h this sed command is nicer
here s how i would do it with gnu sed which for those who don t speak gibberish means remove the leading spaces from lines that start with spaces and an opening bracket test if the line now start with an opening bracket

41187858
rsa	aes
rsa is not suited for bulk encryption as it s quite slow more than a factor 1000 when compared to aes
instead use a symmetric encryption algorithm like aes if you can

41192405
division	multiplication
in general multiplication is much faster than division
so if we can get away with multiplying by the reciprocal instead we can significantly speed up division by a constant a wrinkle is that we cannot represent the reciprocal exactly unless the division was by a power of two but in that case we can usually just convert the division to a bit shift

41193295
swift	objective-c
that is the objective-c attribute is not being used to expose a swift protocol to objective-c code
edit looking at the ios 10 api diffs for swift and doing some testing in xcode 7.2 uilabel and uicontrol s ishighlighted property was previously named highlighted

41194821
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
keep in mind that this is for safari and i did not add the firefox and google-chrome in this code
so please view in safari

41195051
virtualenv	conda
changing things from bin to scripts for virtualenv etc
i don t have use conda so these ll just be stock python on windows 10 windows 10 python 2.7.9 stock msi installer windows 10 python3.5.1 stock msi installer conclusion at the very least my tests with stock python show that the extension module does not exhibit different performance characteristics

41195554
serializable	deserialization
even for serializable deserialization the answer isn t reflection
you can generate helper functions at compile-time or even generate serializable proxies during runtime

41195594
uiview	subviews
you ll notice if you scroll the orange uiview so it goes towards the top that it disappears even though there is still some orange showing on the screen
because the subviews you added does not fit within the uitableviewcell when that cell scrolls out of view based on its frame it disappears

41199866
daemons	systemd
if you need to start a daemons at startup sequence before user login you have to deal with init systemd init.d systemd openrc etc...
dragons be here be sure that init doesn t restart your daemons after manual stop via cli

41203213
udp	tcp
reimplementing that in udp wouldn t provide much benefits i suppose
this sentence pretty much uncovers the problem and the solution although we improved the memory efficiency with tcp we moved to udp for get operations to reduce network traffic and implement application-level flow control for multi-gets gets of hundreds of keys in parallel

41206948
onclick	onchange
because they are different events and the one that bubbles to div element is onclick
you cannot prevent the click event to propagate to div element by preventing onchange event from bubbling

41210713
bower	npm
do from the console in the project s root folder npm install -g bower bower init this will create the config file bower.json - install the angular-ui-bootstrap from console bower install angular-bootstrap --save this will create bower_components angular-ui-bootstrap entry in the project s root folder - in app_client main.js add the ui.bootstrap in the angular.module array - in app_client index.html insert after all other angular js lib files hth
it is not rocket science but possibly useful for newbees that may land here - install the angular js package manager like npm for node js

41215656
build.gradle	gradlew
it should look like cmake_minimum_required version 3.4.1 add_library apicore shared #here add your cpp sources mysource1.cpp mysource2.cpp #do not include main.cpp misc apitest.cpp misc apitest.h #include libraries needed for apicore lib target_link_libraries apicore android log now rewrite your app s build.gradle and point it to cmakelists.txt apply plugin com.android.application with this you will build your android application with your native libapicore.so inside
you will need to create cmakelists.txt or android.mk to build your libapicore.so if you want to move to stable gradlew plugin

41216621
implements	extends
so if you extends genericservlet then all the request gonna invoke service method. as solution to this httpservlet implements them so you can perform difference action according to the request received
genericservlet doesn t implements all 10 http protocol request get post put delete head trace connect options etc.

41219828
icomparable	compareto
you might define this delegate if you want to implement a special behaviour or if you want to use the comparison mechanism on a non-editable class which doesn t implement icomparable
because compareto must return -1 if element x y 0 if element x y 1 if element x y so if you want to use array.sort with any classes you have to either implement icomparable interface if it s an user defined class or define the delegate

41220138
build.gradle	gradlew
old answer having the android studio plugin enabled isn t enough you also need to adjust your gradlew files a little bit add and apply the kotlin-gradle-plugin here are excerpts of my gradlew files with working java and kotlin databinding in your project build.gradle and in your app build.gradle i m using a newer version of the databinding compiler here you probably should do this as well
edit with kotlin 1.1 and kapt3 it works slightly different in your project build.gradle and in your app build.gradle it s really important that the databinding compiler version and the plugin version are identical

41221328
bfg-repo-cleaner	git-filter-branch
for you it s easier and faster to use bfg-repo-cleaner tool
it s not distributed with git but really stellar and super fast compared to git-filter-branch it will automatically remove file from all branches

41223287
apache	nginx
but if you don t know how to use nginx and why you change webserver just stay on apache
nginx doesn t have support for htaccess files

41225478
implements	extends
you can map the elements to a new collection of the desired type you can also filter the collection if you know there may be some elements in the collection that do not implements genericelement and you want to silently ignore them if you are certain that all of the elements implements genericelement then you can suppress the warning you can also change the type of elements to and then cast each isomeelement instance to genericelement as you add them to the collection elements.add isomeelement as genericelement
if isomeelement extends genericelement then you will not get such a warning

41226107
vb6	vba
in unhosted visual basic vb6 it returns the total number of open windows
my completely unsubstantiated guess as to why it returns zero is that in vba the top level window of the process that the code is running isn t owned by the code you re executing

41227086
comparator	comparable
that is the meaning of the error the method sort comparator in the type arraylist is not applicable for the argument -- there is a method sort comparator but you have not supplied parameters that match it
assuming person implements comparable and therefore has a compareto method you can use collections.sort which sorts arbitrary collections.sort people

41231430
git-svn	svn2git
the svn2git tool you used is based on git-svn and git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

41231430
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the wrong svn2git in your case is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also

required	placeholder
solution we write a custom class that extends native python str.format extend native python string.formatter with custom class configure string.format to support arbitrary delimiter placeholder syntax permit other enhancements such as custom formatters and filters example001 demo use of a custom reformat class we wrote a custom reformat class that extends python str.format pitfalls required extension class to str.format not intended as a substitute for full-blown sandbox-compatible templating solution
using custom placeholder tokens with python string.format context python 2.7 string.format alternative approach that allows custom placeholder syntax problem we want to use custom placeholder delimiters with python str.format string.format is powerful but no native support for placeholder delimiter modification

41231889
icmp	udp
it s reported async since icmp has timeouts for replies and you may have send another udp packet by then
the packet doesn t actually ever leave the kernel hence it can reply to the icmp error before the next udp packet is sent

41232324
gruntjs	package.json
firstly fwiw your examples listed using the files object format method also did not work for me including your last one the only way i could get this to work was to match everything and then negate the top level directories using gruntjs globbing patterns
whilst the following gists demonstrates what worked for me it does require knowing configuring the names of the top-level directories you wish to exclude directory structure given a directory set up as follows repo dir unwanted.js foo.js gruntfile.js node_modules ... package.json server.js gruntfile.js ...and a gruntfile.js configured as follows sloc results running gruntjs via the cli correctly resulted in grunt-sloc reporting statistics for two files only namely foo.js and server.js

41236330
sudo	passwd
if so you should be able to do this usr bin sudo rm usr local bin sudo after which normal 64-bit sudo which would now be usr bin sudo will just work
if you are unlucky but your system allows root login and you know root passwd then simply login as root and # should make 32-bit usr local bin sudo work root host# yum install glibc-2.17-105.el7.i686 if you have no root passwd and no working sudo not all is lost with physical access to the system you could boot off the recovery disk mount your root filesystem and fix root passwd

41240118
namedtuple	dictionary	dictionary	map
so here is how i finally understood this using properties we can define a known set of properties similar to python s namedtuple however if we wish to have something more like python s dictionary or any other hash map where we can t specify how many keys there are nor what they are in advance we should use additionalproperties
additionalproperties will match any property name that will act as the dictionary s key and the or type will be the schema of the dictionary s value and since there should not be more than one properties with the same name for every given object we will get the enforcement of unique keys

41240837
mvp	presenter
presenter - the middle man provides the logic to inputs button clicks retrieval of data validation of inputs then passes the result back to the view activity or fragment here s a great article on mvp here s a simplified diagram of mvp answer modified from this question also answered by me
there is no exact correct definition of implementing mvp in android to answer your question in my view the presenter should not have any android logic

41240837
mvp	presenter
there is no exact correct definition of implementing mvp in android to answer your question in my view the presenter should not have any android logic
as such the adapter would be a view then presenter provides it the data via the activity or fragment and it just deals with how to present this

41240840
aggregate-functions	sum
update to handle your region variable a query might look like this note that i did not attempt to combine this with the first query because it would mix aggregate-functions with non aggregate terms and it might not make sense
assuming you want to count the number of records for which column1 is in between the start and end date then the following should work select sum case when column1 between startdate and enddate then 1 else 0 end as tally from bankholidays this approach is called conditional aggregation and often you will also use a group by clause

41241105
udp	tcp
udp is a connectionless protocol in contrast to tcp
therefor you cannot disconnect a udp client so the error is correct though somewhat misleading

41242623
serializable	deserialization
c use alternative third-party solutions such as jms serializable it allows to declare an attribute type for deserialization
unfortunately that callbacks invoked only on serialization process not on deserialization

41243345
build.gradle	gradlew
this error will happen if you update your android sdk but still using a support-v4 file which belongs to an older version. you can check your build.gradle if you are using android studio to see if app-compact library or support-v4 library are set according to your latest sdk update or not
also it is possible that one of your gradlew dependencies files are using an older version of support-v4

41243810
ssl	https
there s a whole section about this requests verifies ssl certificates for https requests just like a web browser
by default ssl verification is enabled and requests will throw a sslerror if it s unable to verify the certificate note that you shouldn t disable tls ssl verification for production code rather investigate why the certificate isn t valid and follow the guide lines from the official documentation

41246509
fgets	getline
fgets has the same problem as scanf in this regard strlen msg does not alway report the number of characters read
non-standard getline does return the number of characters read and is a way out of this

41247001
explode	substr
if needed you can still return the explode part
to me this reads like you want to extract the full substr 4 6 8 . if so why not simply use a capturing group to extract the part after like in this regex101 demo

41247308
google-chrome	firefox
will work in firefox ie and google-chrome
in firefox and ie it seems the onclick event is captured by the button and not the image tag

41250141
build.gradle	gradlew
welll actually you don t have to have a build.gradle file or the gradlew wrapper to have a valid gradlew project
i guess eclipse is just recording in its metadata that this is a gradlew project but does not add any build files for you

41256009
keystore	jks
java programs then use the keystore entry to do things like implement a tls including https server
however you cannot easily get the private key out of a jks keystore and use it for anything other than java programs

41256009
keystore	jks
however you cannot easily get the private key out of a jks keystore and use it for anything other than java programs
you can convert to a pkcs12 keystore which can be more flexibly used. openssl openssl genrsa generates only the keypair no cert and writes it to a file that contains only the private key in pem format by default but you can specify -outform der instead

41256625
ubuntu	linux
the issue with the template above is that cfn-init is not installed in the ubuntu ami so the call to cfn-init in your user-data script will return command not found and do nothing
the cfn-helper utilities are automatically installed only in the latest amazon linux ami as noted in the documentation

41259264
imagemagick	magick++
if you don t have the homebrew package called pkg-config installed install that first with brew install pkg-config it can then tell you how to compile and link all packages it knows about so let s see what packages it knows about pkg-config --list-all | grep -i magick sample output ... ... libswscale libswscale - ffmpeg image rescaling library imagemagick imagemagick - imagemagick - convert edit and compose images abi q16hdri vips-cpp vips-cpp - c++ api for vips8 image processing library lept leptonica - an open source c library for efficient image processing and image analysis operations magickcore-7.q16hdri magickcore - magickcore - c api for imagemagick abi q16hdri magickwand magickwand - magickwand - c api for imagemagick abi q16hdri gdk-pixbuf-2.0 gdkpixbuf - image loading and scaling openexr openexr - openexr image library vips vips - image processing library magick++ magick++ - magick++ - c++ api for imagemagick abi q16hdri ... ... ok magick++ looks good for you
let s find the header file path for #includes pkg-config --cflags-only-i magick++ sample output -i usr local cellar imagemagick head-a781824 include imagemagick-7 and the linker flags - which is actually your issue pkg-config --libs magick++ sample output -l usr local cellar imagemagick head-a781824 lib -lmagick++-7.q16hdri -lmagickwand-7.q16hdri -lmagickcore-7.q16hdri obviously your values will be different depending on what build-time options you built imagemagick with - so use your own values not mine

41260480
postgresql	mysql
so your connection string is not recognised and the postgresql driver doesn t help
if you re not using appengine switch to a mysql driver and remove google in your connection string as you would do with a standard mysql connection with host port etc

41262277
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
reason being that during viewdidload some of the properties of your viewcontroller has not been defined and it is not ready to present another viewcontroller
you should put the code in which you display the second view controller in either viewwillappear or viewdidappear

41262748
ng-switch	ng-show
angular re-render your directives because ng-switch remove div when ng-switch-when condition is not satisfied which makes directive is destroy and next time must be re-render
the ng-show directive in contrast to ng-switch directive not remove element but only hides

41263547
calloc	malloc
allocating via calloc guarantees that while allocating using malloc cannot guarantee that as we know from chapter 7.22.3.4 the malloc function allocates space for an object whose size is specified by size and whose value is indeterminate
edit one possible scenario where malloc is advised over calloc is writing test stubs used for unit integration testing

41264535
icmp	tcp
either as it s not open its not allowed somewhere along the path local firewall route or rds security group if you specify the -port parameter then it s a tcp test not an icmp echo ping
that is a result of the tcp port not being accessible

41272509
ssl	https
the mitm proxy could act as the client to the server and use a self-signed ssl certificate to present the real client an https connection
in your specific case you should use https and in the client not only check that you are using an https connection but that the certificate presented by the server and its certificate chain are the ones you expect. if you fail to do so you could still perform a mitm attack

41281766
bash	subshell
you can do the following this works with sh and derivates ksh and bash
it doesn t create any subshell

41281922
spaces	delimiter
and delimiter t won t work in your problem coz there are multiple spaces not tab
so we need to remove multiple spaces with re

41282880
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
the ienumerable interface exists because not every class that allows iteration over its parts is a collection or a list such as a string and ienumerable provides a minimal interface to achieve this without having to implement a full blown icollection or ilist
the main and most important consumer of an ienumerable is the foreach statement which is there since the beginning of time .net

41286867
daemons	systemd
unless-stopped always restart the container regardless of the exit status but do not start it on daemons startup if the container has been put to a stopped state before
now as far as your systemd service goes you need to enable that service so it automatically get started after reboots

41287966
daemons	systemd
your systemd is being switched by your audit daemons which is happening in the first line of your log not the exiting on sig 15 i d check the space on your disk and also look at the audit daemons config as the single option for space left will cause the audit daemons to change you to single user mode
if you don t need the audit daemons i d turn it off

41288368
g++	gcc
instead of this gcc source.cpp do this g++ source.cpp
you should compile it with c++ compiler not c g++ for example

41290486
swift	objective-c
swift objects by default do not do this so they aren t visible to objective-c
adding objective-c isn t what you need

41291369
prng	random
it s well known that rand is often not a high quality prng pseudo-random number generator but i m a little surprised by this apparently systematic behaviour with seeds that differ by 1 each time
on my mac when i changed srand to srandom and rand to random i got better as in more unpredictable results 29 1 7 11 25 52 63 15 26 55 75 64 40 4 64 18 8 57 73 27 38 15 60 28 43 3 27 17 1 58 26 72 73 18 20 7 76 16 27 43 64 20 63 30 35 17 33 57 79 47 32 33 6 30 35 7 38 55 25 61 69 57 79 75 15 54 5 35 21 46 65 61 30 79 66 14 56 39 19 8 50 47 76 33 62 65 81 44 52 39 25 30 54 12 24 68 27 49 60 72 53 35 14 41 63 46 45 65 67 39 9 11 60 19 64 73 43 17 21 26 and the mac man page for random still suggests using arc4random instead but this is a lot better than plain rand

41291551
ienumerable	ilist
thus satisfies all contracts that ienumerable satisfies and hence implements ienumerable
it won t work because your class does not implement ilist

41291551
ienumerable	ilist
it indirectly via implements and ienumerable
one might expect to implement ilist but this is not the case

41293483
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
3 an inline-functions with external linkage not declared static has the following additional properties 1 it must be declared inline in every translation unit. 2 it has the same address in every translation unit
notice that not once has optimisation performance or actual inlining of machine code been mentioned or even hinted at

41295219
factors	matrix
so if x y are integer coordinated then x y will not be integers due to the sqrt 2 factors
if you want to rotate elements in a matrix so the points lie in a matrix you effectively want to rotate integer coordinates to integer coordinates taking the central point h as the origin

41298338
division	modulo
for example means if you divide 3 by 3 you get one and the remainder is 0. if the division leaves no remainder the first number is a multiple of the second. that means it is not a prime if the number you divide with is not 1 or the same number a full example 15 is no prime
it is the modulo operation. it is the remainder if you do a division in integer space

41299487
ssl	https
catch the specific exception and connect using ssl
that looks like you re getting redirected to https and your code isn t handling it

41302433
d3.js	canvasjs
which gives advantage to canvasjs over d3.js as canvasjs have quick response time thus rendering is fast in canvasjs
if you want quick response time and not much calculation filters on data then you can go with canvasjs

41304085
udp	tcp
that means your client is trying to connect to your server on tcp port 80 -- not udp port 80 the two namespaces are totally separate
for a udp session both sides need an ip address and a port number

41309095
mockito	jmockit
try mockito i do not know why jmockit does not allow you to mock the file class
in mockito it can be done

41310413
jar	war
on these server implementations the rules are each war module can see it s own classes the classes in each ejb jar and the classes in every jar in the the ear lib directory it cannot see the classes in other war modules
each ejb module can see it s own classes the classes in other ejb modules and the classes in every jar in the the ear lib directory

41310413
jar	war
each ejb module can see it s own classes the classes in other ejb modules and the classes in every jar in the the ear lib directory
it cannot see the classes in any war modules

41312943
equals	gethashcode
so basically you should compute it based on all the used fields in equals even though they re mutable
however the documentation also notes if you do choose to override gethashcode for a mutable reference type your documentation should make it clear that users of your type should not modify object values while the object is stored in a hash table

41315021
jtextfield	jlabel
don t forget to also call the jlabel s setlabelfor ... method to associate it tightly with the jtextfield as per the jlabel tutorial for example which displays as note that the jlabel have underlines on mnemonic chars chars that when pressed in alt-key combination will bring the focus to the jtextfield that the jlabel was linked to via setlabelfor ... and is caused by this code
jlabel s have no default layout manager and so while your jtextfield is being added tot he jlabel it s not showing because the label has no idea how to show it

41315021
jtextfield	jlabel
jlabel s have no default layout manager and so while your jtextfield is being added tot he jlabel it s not showing because the label has no idea how to show it
there can be several ways to solve this depending on what you re trying to achieve give the jlabel a layout manager and then add the jtextfield to it but then the jtextfield covers the jlabel its text if it has any and its icon if it has one not good

41315447
division	modulo
so you cannot determine if a number is perfectly divisible remainder 0 or not perfectly divisible with non-zero remainder using a division operator
modulo - gives the remainder of the division

41317804
zlib	libpng
if zlib and libtiff turn out not to be the ones missing you can try adding system s versions of the other libraries in that list one by one to see which one will solve the missing link issue
the link which you posted in your own answer to this question has the following at the top source distribution includes source for freeimage c++ c# delphi and vb6 wrappers examples and the internally used libraries libtiff libjpeg libpng zlib openexr openjpeg libraw libjxr and libwebp

41317888
i2c	spi
in fact you ll find i2c-dev will not let you use an i2c address bound to another driver unless you use the i2c_slave_force ioctl
this is the opposite to the spidev driver which binds to a specific spi slave device and not the bus as a whole

41318206
express	node.js
ok all you search keywords and attentions here is wrong try to search production ready enterprise ready case study those keywords then or maybe go to indeed.com and search node.js further dig out what node.js framework most companies using the answer maybe just simply say express
if so from node.js stack the frameworks will pretty much be narrowed down a few of them hapi strongloop or even not popular one mojito from yahoo for those frameworks at least you can tell - they are really production or enterprise ready - cos they have been using form walmart from yahoo from other big giants from some time some even for couple of years

41318847
dictionary	map
maybe one thing you should know is that map method of dictionary returns array not dictionary
so if you want the filtered result as dictionary you may need to use reduce generally swift dictionary is a hash-table based implementation of associative array but you should better avoid naming arry for dictionary variables

41318865
implements	extends
well as per your edit you didn t follow my complete suggestion so the error is more obvious now notificationcompat.builder is not implements in support v13.app
you need to use a modern support v4 release or you can use support v7 which extends from v4 this depends on your present or future needs and other libraries dependencies

41319112
udp	tcp
tcp is used only as a necessary evil when firewalls block udp once webrtc is able to connect its ice candidates via udp it will simply stop trying and in most cases you won t see tcp candidates connecting at all - they get lower priority because of 1
as far as i am aware twilio by default doesn t add turn tcp to their configuration of twilio client although they might do so in the future

41322183
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this includes safari firefox ie10 edge and google-chrome
firefox when the private browsing mode of firefox is enabled the indexeddb throws an invalidstateerror because it is not available in private browsing mode

41322183
firefox	safari
firefox when the private browsing mode of firefox is enabled the indexeddb throws an invalidstateerror because it is not available in private browsing mode
to very if that safari for safari the key is the local storage service

41324616
translation	localization
1 the free alternative then as it s not really content that you are trying to translation but some peaces of code located in the function.php file of your active child theme or active theme you should use a specialized free plugin as loco translation that will provides in-browser editing of wordpress translation files
loco translation also provides localization tools for developers such as extracting strings and generating templates

41324944
bower	npm
install jquery with a front-end package manager bower the symfony documentation states bower is a dependency management tool for front-end dependencies like bootstrap or jquery
if bower isn t already installed you can install it globally with npm require node npm install -g bower according to the symfony documentation a bundle should not embed third-party libraries written in javascript css or any other language

41325862
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t have support for compiling asm.js
it can still run asm.js like any other javascript engine and according to the wikipedia page for asm.js as of google-chrome 28 the v8 javascript engine contains some optimizations to improve asm.js performance but google-chrome doesn t take full advantage of asm.js the same way firefox does

41330122
nunit	mstest
nunit has testcase attribute for this scenario
it could be used in the following way to achieve it with mstest you should put more efforts because mstest still does not support test cases in such simple form

41333681
ssl	https
you need to point the domain to the elb and install the ssl certificate for the domain on the elb
you enabled https for your domain name not the elb domain which amazon owns

41335588
jlist	jtable
a jlist does not display real components only rendered images of the component and therefore is does not respond to events if you try to click on the x
the other option is to use a jtable

41337194
trie	tree
that said sticking with the same algorithm a possibly better approach would be to first build the uncompressed suffix trie not tree and then compress the resulting trie
the advantage would be that a suffix trie can be represented using data.map which makes manipulations both more efficient and easier than list of pairs

41337943
sudo	passwd
you can login using ssh key authentication change the passwd using sudo passwd ubuntu by default ubuntu user has sudo-permissions with nopasswd set actually not only you can but you should change the passwd
as of writing this answer no one ever publicly shared the passwd for user ubuntu on ubuntu xenial64 vagrant box see #1569237

41338286
memcpy	malloc
- but see footnote the memcpy function preserves effective type of objects copied so the effective type of the first sizeof int bytes of the space pointed to by buf is int
firstly the cast does not have an alignment problem because malloc space is correctly aligned for any type

41338911
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all this lead to the leverage of the former restrictions so in next versions of google-chrome we should be able to paint on canvas without tainting it even with bloburis
but note that safari still does have the same restriction without the implementation bug i.e the datauri hack doesn t work there and that ie edge do not support element and taints the canvas when any svg has been painted to it and that firefox does remove all useragent and os styles which leads to different results than the one you could expect

41339300
shadowing	named
this is because you have declared named as a local variable to the function shadowing the global named variable
anywhere you declare a variable with var in a closure it creates and hoists a local variable by the named with an initial value of undefined a falsey value so the if block does not run

41340026
accelerometer	gyroscope
short answer - no with accelerometer you can get only accelerations around 3 axes but you want to make a compass which shows north
if you combine accelerometer readings with gyroscope readings you can find orientation changes of the phone but you still can not simulate a compass because you don t have a reference point

41340446
onresume	onpause
not setting countdowntimer to null. either set it to null and try or remove the null check in onresume
in your onpause you are doing countdowntimer.cancel

41342512
bash	subshell
man bash will describe all the circumstances in which a subshell is used which are mainly command | command and command the so called environment only includes environment variables export variable and is passed on to every sub-process
even when invoking bash -c command which is not a subshell but a completely new bash instance

41347047
union	distinct
look at the following link full join in mysql basically you need a union close to what you were doing actually
or even better just do a full outer join and since you re not actually using any aggregation functions a distinct would work as well my apologies i m not a mysql guy and did not realize that mysql does not have full join syntax

41347470
textview	imageview
sometimes it is possible to replace imageview or multiple and textview with one textview with compound drawable s
there are not many parameters which can be applied to compound drawable using native api and this textviewrichdrawable library but if you can manage one textview instead of using linearlayout you should definitely use it

41350001
junit	mockito
motivation mockito is a mocking framework for java and comes packaged with cglib which creates bytecode mocks this is how mockito junit outside of instrumentation tests works
but if you re trying to run mockito in android instrumentation tests then bytecode mocks are not sufficient and you need mocks that mockito can load into the dex classloader that art dalvik can understand and that s where dexmaker comes in

41350540
profiling	debugging
go to xcode project - targets - general and in the section named singing debugging or release you will can see in elegible the new provisional profiling
it see that you need to update both of them certificate and provisional profiling but if you delete one the another one keep the previous references and xcode not update automatically

41352964
required	placeholder
tensorflow s tf.placeholder tensors do not required you to specify a shape in order to allow you to feed tensors of different shapes in a later tf.session.run call
by default a placeholder has a completely unconstrained shape but you can constrain it by passing the optional shape argument

41353692
imperative	declarative
the summary of the question is if querying turns the declarative paradigm into an imperative paradigm
answer i don t believe querying turns it into an imperative paradigm but you currently cannot perform a query keep the results of the operation and use it to declare the next state

41353692
imperative	declarative
answer i don t believe querying turns it into an imperative paradigm but you currently cannot perform a query keep the results of the operation and use it to declare the next state
this currently forces us into something a little further away from declarative for the problem that i would like

41353860
addition	multiplication
but the key point here is that we are not doing a vector addition after all but a matrix vector multiplication
and homogenous coordinates just allow us among other more powerful things to represent a translation via matrix multiplication

41354832
avr	microcontroller
how a processor core boots is very much specific to that architecture and possibly version or variation the avr family has a number of variations
you can then wrap a chip around it something thin like a processor where much of the peripherals and resources are in other chips or like a microcontroller or system on a chip where many if not all of the resources are on chip

41357331
serializable	deserialization
first step test your serializable second step test your deserialization read your object back to check deserialization treemap is serializable
everything runs perfectly fine as long as yourvalueclass does not have complex structure that hinders serializable

41360302
automake	autotools
your second option adding a bootstrap script that calls autoconf and automake to generate the configure scripts is also a bad idea
this defeats the entire purpose of autotools which is to make your source portable across systems including those for which autotools is not available

41363549
treemap	linkedhashmap
but there are map implementations which store keys in natural order such as treemap intmap also does iirc
note that it is not the same as preserving insertion order as listmap and linkedhashmap do

41364528
lxml	beautifulsoup
by default the lxml parser will strip cdata sections from the tree and replace them by their plain text content learn more here
one thing you need to be careful of beautifulsoup grabbing cdata is not to use a lxml parser

41365012
swift	objective-c
to address the issues in your solution attempt nsset is to swift as hashset without the generic type parameter not is to java
it s a datatype from the foundation library that was invented for objective-c

41366223
implements	extends
this would change behaviour for reading values but does not support setting new properties in that way here is example to make this behaviour more consistent you would have to extends this class and implements magic methods __get __set __isset and __unset
another tricky part is serialization default method serialize would return you a copy serialized variable instead of object itself as workaround to return serialized copy of instance you can implements default serialization in __tostring method this way it s behave correctly

41366450
sudo	passwd
so your goal is probably not to run your specific git command without sudo but rather to run it as a different user than the rest
if you want you git command to be run by a hard-coded user the_user just put in your script this will not prompt you for your passwd when the script is run as root

41367870
profiling	benchmarking
if scanl3 is used in a context where the entire list needs to be held in memory at once the intermediate list still shouldn t cause any increased memory use though the only way to be sure would be to profiling both it and an alternative implementation in a specific usage case
with respect to time overhead of using zip3 as an intermediate step again you really need to benchmarking against an alternative implementation to be sure

41368224
queue	fifo
azure service bus consists of two parts queue
in most cases sqs simple queue service will provide an adequate replacement but keep in mind that azure service bus queue are first in-first out fifo while sqs queue do not guarantee the order of messages

41368224
queue	fifo
in most cases sqs simple queue service will provide an adequate replacement but keep in mind that azure service bus queue are first in-first out fifo while sqs queue do not guarantee the order of messages
update 2018-01-09 sqs now allows to create fifo queue

41371666
queue	fifo
just because you re not using a partitioned queue or topic does not mean you will get fifo
if you have more than one reader or do async then no you won t get fifo unless you use sessions as was pointed out above

41371961
swift	objective-c
i just ran into this one using swift 3
in my case the problem only occurred when i used netservice.dictionary fromtxtrecord but did not occur when i switched to objective-c and called nsnetservice dictionaryfromtxtrecord

41375086
persistent	transient
it means that it is not persistent in the database.therefore you are getting no such column name error
remove transient from the base class which is above the part_no

41376294
decoder	encoder
base64 encoding is not meant to work piece by piece it s meant to encode a complete block of data as one single unit so when the decoder sees the symbol which appears at the end of each line it thinks it s reached the end and there is nothing left
the proper way to solve this is to go back to your original code and pass the entire string to a base64 encoder not just one line at a time

41382185
email	dkim
you need to configure spf and dkim for your domain in order to ensure email delivery
spf helps the receiver to verify the authenticity of email where or not it s forged

41388693
lisp	scheme
here is an example now in lisp languages the reader usually converts this at read time so that the code that gets interpreted never actually see the or
scheme standard doesn t say what it should be named so it s implementation defined however most languages use these only the outermost quote is evaluated so in this case the other quotes you see in the result is data and not part of code

41392049
equals	compareto
returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object
note that null is not an instance of any class and null.compareto 1 should throw a null object refference even though null.equals 1 if you get a null for auto it will crash int java.lang.string.compareto java.lang.string on a null object reference so 0 compareto 1 will return you -1 meaning obj is less than to 1 but make sure you don t get a null value to auto to make sure what you get check inside your conditions like the example if its android use logs warning also for the exception you are returning -1

41392486
decoder	encoder
use the mediacodec api to manually send each of your aac frame s bytes to the decoder
if you can handle bytes and familiar with aac frame structre then check these as starting points decoding aac using mediacodec api on android pcm - aac encoder - pcm decoder in real-time with correct optimization but it cannot be played on my android device using a mediaplayer.

41393182
mongodb	bson
or assuming a reactivemongo version 0.11.9 you can use mongodb json extended representation the json formats supported by the reactivemongo serialisation are documented
you are using play json to represent mongodb document not bson and the date is a joda one converted as json number according the play json module

41393182
mongodb	bson
you are using play json to represent mongodb document not bson and the date is a joda one converted as json number according the play json module
you can directly use bson with the driver and pass the date as bsondatetime

41394535
google-chrome	firefox
not all browser support all cdms - in general google-chrome supports widevine cdm ms edge supports playready cdm and safari supports fairplay cdm
firefox supports adobe primetime and widevine cdm although the momentum seems to be with the latter

41395496
scheme	racket
racket as in #lang racket share this with the standard scheme so that the first tail recursive code will never ever result in excess memory use or a stack overflow
the second is a #lang racket specific special form that still is syntactic sugar for a recursive procedure just like do is and it will not stack overflow either however theoretically the number has the possibility to become larger than your systems available memory and get a out of memory error

41395702
serializable	deserialization
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

41396188
mathml	mathjax
mathml is only supported in safari and firefox so using html.node for producing mathml is not a good cross-browser solution
you have to use a polyfill for other browsers such as katex or mathjax

41397523
required	placeholder
if by the same time you want your select to be mandatory required attribute you then ask something forbidden by html spec
if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1 then the select element must have a placeholder label option

41397523
required	placeholder
if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1 then the select element must have a placeholder label option
and the spec defines it as if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1

41399960
google-chrome	safari
you see javascript is not a language that just exists somewhere in the ether - each internet browser comes with it s own implementation of the language - this means that javascript usually only works in internet browsers such as mozilla safari opera or google-chrome for example
internet explorer also comes with an implementation of ecmascript but they call it jscript for licensing reasons i believe the implementation of javascript that comes with google-chrome runs on the powerful v8 engine which is written in a language called c++

41400941
dictionary	map
you don t need lambda either my_dict.get a .get b as noted in the comments you shouldn t use dictionary as the name of your variable.
i m not sure why you re using map here

41408485
division	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction
for example comparison and division come in signed and unsigned varieties btw at the bit level multiplication is the same for unsigned and 2 s complement signed types just like addition and subtraction and both may compile into the same multiplication instruction of the cpu
further unsigned operations do not cause undefined behavior in case of overflow except for division by zero while signed operations do

41408742
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview
comment delete function schimbare in oncreate and edit songadapter like following
in your case findviewbyid r.id.imagine returns null because it doesn t exist in the layout activity_main which you provided in setcontentview

41408742
setcontentview	findviewbyid
in your case findviewbyid r.id.imagine returns null because it doesn t exist in the layout activity_main which you provided in setcontentview
findviewbyid returns null if the view doesn t exist in current layout

41410942
spaces	linefeed
match 0 or more tabs or spaces at beginning of the line
it is not good to use here s as this character class matches any whitespace character which includes the newline characters carriage return and linefeed and the search expression should never match a string spanning over multiple lines

41411055
inline	inlining
if functionb gets longer bigger more bytecode instructions it will not be inline into functiona
so j3d1 was able to use vmoptions to manually switch off inlining for functionb this appears to eliminate the delay with the shorter function

41411677
build.gradle	gradlew
i also tried putting an equivalent of this at the end of root build file the order of declaration in a build.gradle does not matter
gradlew build lifecycle has two phases configuration and execution

41412845
addition	multiplication
here is python code that stores intermediate factorial values to reduce the number of multiplication to just 6 or in general 2 n - 4 and the addition count to the same but half of them are just adding 1 the only way to find which algorithm is the fastest is to code all of them in one language and run each using a timer
here is a way that does not cheat by replacing multiplication with repeated addition or by using division

41412845
division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
here is a way that does not cheat by replacing multiplication with repeated addition or by using division
the idea is to replace your expression with 1 2 3 4 + 5 1 2 3 + 4 1 2 + 3 1 + 2 this used 9 multiplication for the numbers 1 through 5

41414332
serializable	deserialization
java serializable handles cyclic object graphs via a handle system
a previously serialized object is not re-serialized instead a handle to that object is serialized which is reconstructed on deserialization to refer to the same object

41416014
super	implements
in this situation it would be better not to inherit from that super class but create an interface extract with support of your ide of the super class lets call is superinterface that is implements by both the super class and classfive
the you replace all the parameters that are passed to the super class by one single parameter of type superinterface

41416014
super	implements
the you replace all the parameters that are passed to the super class by one single parameter of type superinterface
then you simply delegate all methods of superinterface that are not implements by classfive directly to the superinterface instance

41416014
implements	extends
then you simply delegate all methods of superinterface that are not implements by classfive directly to the superinterface instance
this is what it would look like this pattern also works vice versa if you don t like the duplicated method delegations all over your classes extends superinterface

41416014
super	implements
in that case the interface you create may not be implements by the super class
the methods declared in the interface don t even need to be part of the super classes public methods

41418816
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari opera and android browser nougat don t implement this feature yet unfortunately although it could greatly help to further enhance the performance on multi-core systems
according to a 7 year old issue for google-chrome it doesn t seem likely that they re going to implement this part of the specification

41418834
move	drag
if the user tries to drag the view left when it is already at its left limit and then without lifting their finger changes direction and move to the right your code will move the view right even though their finger is no longer over the view
with the change below the view will not move to the right until the user s finger gets back to the original touch point gesturerecognizer.settranslation cgpoint x newx - gesturerecognizer.view

41419188
google-chrome	firefox
so not good news here - let s hope the feature to debug direct js responses will be incorporated into firefox google-chrome developer tools soon
firebug as firefox firefox extension is currently as per 01 2017 the only way to debug direct javascript responses from ajax calls

41422266
queue	fifo
currently i can produce your issue and detect that it should be the performance issue in some kind of a complicated scenario which relates to the peek-lock mode to receive messages from queue
as in your code snippet you use peek-lock mode to receive messages which will lock the first message of the queue as queue delivers message fifo as the deletemessage in your handlemessage function is an asyn function so node.js will not pending on for this result will call startreceiver in finally section immediately

41422783
google-chrome	firefox
we ll remove it again in google-chrome 57 but we ll also add a hack to allow it just for responses that look to be from shoutcast servers ones that start with icy
so behavior should be just like it was in google-chrome 54 and earlier going forward for shoutcast servers worth noting this does not quite match firefox s current behavior

41425162
client-side	server-side
daterenderer was not found because it was server-side and not client-side
scriptlets can get the server-side variables for some complicated reasons in this project i could not use els

41425379
aggregate-functions	sum
unfortunately mysql doesn t have a product aggregate-functions
but you can use logarithms to turn products into sums sum log 100-weight 100+weight as score unfortunately mysql doesn t deal with infinities the way ieee floating point arithmetic does log 0 - but turns a weight of 100 into a score of null

41425522
union	distinct
in those cases it may help to have a constant column that clearly discriminates each subquery create view v1 as select section1 as discriminator -- rest of section1 union all select section2 as discriminator -- rest of section2 union all select section3 as discriminator -- rest of section3 and now use a constant in your query as well not a bind variable to select the discriminator of course at this point one may wonder whether you perhaps shouldn t create 3 distinct views and select from them directly but i don t know your requirements.
in order to hint the optimiser that it does not need to generate any rows and those not do any computation in a specific union subquery you have to tell it that you don t actually need the info

41427246
swift	objective-c
the problem is caused by a limitation of swift which can t directly express variables parameters that satisfy both class inheritance and protocol conformance unless using generics which breaks the objective-c compatibility
thus a valid construct in objective-c doesn t have a direct equivalent in swift

41427246
swift	objective-c
thus a valid construct in objective-c doesn t have a direct equivalent in swift
a workaround to this limitation is to declare a 3rd method that exposes the class inheritance and protocol conformance arguments as two distinct parameters and call that method from both the objective-c compatible and the swift -only versions

41428596
csv	tsv
generally you export tables in either csv comma separated values or tsv tab separated values
which you should choose depends mainly on your data if your data has commas in it but not tabs you should go for tsv

41430146
google-chrome	firefox
webkit-based browsers such as google-chrome will sometimes display them
gecko-based such as firefox will not

41432339
ssl	https
so just copy same http configuration and add ssl specific parts
config for https does not differ from http

41434705
swift	objective-c
keep in mind that uiview is an objective-c class and objective-c is not swift
none of the rules about designated and convenience initializers and the rules of their inheritance exist in objective-c a fact that can sometimes cause significant trouble when using those classes in swift

41435287
punctuation	words
to easily replace characters and not treat them as regexps cl-ppcr treats them as regexps you have cl-slug to remove non-ascii characters and also punctuation
there s cl-ppcre split for common cases there is the new modern and consistent cl-str string manipulation library str words a sentence with spaces

41437621
clang	llvm
the suspicious moves project target setting seems to control the -wmove compiler warning optionin llvm clang which is a group of 3 other warning options -wpessimizing-move -wredundant-move and -wself-move
those options generate these warnings warning moving a temporary object prevents copy elision warning moving a local object in a return statement prevents copy elision warning redundant move in return statement warning explicitly moving variable of type a to itself from the clang documentation at so it s probably not a big deal whether you accept the recommendation and enable the warning or go without it

41439644
aggregate-functions	sum
you may not use an aggregate-functions returning a non nullable type on an empty collection
in your case sum fails when the where clause on db.product_order returns no elements

41444718
postgresql	mysql
well the fact that postgresql jsonb has several functions that can return rows while mysql at best can only return arrays is reason enough to stick to postgresql rather than mysql
if you think mysql can return rows from json please answer this question from october that s still unanswered convert json array in mysql to rows mysql isn t so good at subqueries as postgresql but the json functionality limit your ability to perform joins against other tables

41445520
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
do not use uinavigationbar.appearance .bartintcolor uicolor.blackcolor if you have a storyboard with a uinavigationcontroller set the tint color there to your uinavigationbar
there is only one navigationbar for each uinavigationcontroller you can t handle your color with that ugly appearance tool for all cases

41449080
variance	kurtosis
from the help-page of dpearson moments optional vector list of mean variance skewness kurtosis not excess kurtosis
so adding 3 to beta.2 will provide you with the real kurtosis to get a result like the one in the paper we should investigate the cumulative distribution function and add 0.5 to correct for the bias caused by approximating a discrete distribution by a continuous one a little background information the function threw an error because the relationship between kurtosis and skewness wasn t invalid kurtosis is lower-bounded by the skewness in the following way

41450237
lapack	openblas	armadillo	openblas
armadillo isn t parallelized with openmp with slight caveats the underlying lapack or blas implementation may be paralellized
if you are using openblas it is

41451946
tabcontrol	tabitem
then you could call and select the correct tabitem by using a tag index of some sort to identify the parent tabitem s position in the tabcontrol
if the grid is not the direct child of the tabitem then it s children will have to be called and so on

41453474
pandas	dask
the justification for this is also mentioned in the dask documentation we do this so that users of the lightweight core dask scheduler aren t required to download the more exotic dependencies of the collections numpy pandas etc.
at dask 0.13.0 and below there was a requirement on toolz identity function within dask async.py

41454237
des	aes
des is deprecated in almost all legitimate uses of symmetric encryption it is obsolete and easily brute-forceable
aes rijndael with block size of 128 bits is the standard symmetric encryption solution while blowfish twofish rc4 also not suggested and 3des tdes are other options

41454237
3des	aes
aes rijndael with block size of 128 bits is the standard symmetric encryption solution while blowfish twofish rc4 also not suggested and 3des tdes are other options
aes is universally supported and will be your best solution in this case

41456991
jspm	npm
jspm tries to help as much as possible when loading from the jspm registry
if not yet available in the registry you can load from npm or github directly

41459095
implements	extends
it implements map which is an interface and says nothing about synchronization policy
hashmap does not implement or extends to be more precise hashtable

41459324
required	placeholder
my transition drawable r.drawable.anim_image_placeholder not required if using a static image
i do it like mentioned below the idea is to set the scale type to as required by the placeholder initially attach listener to change the scale type again to as required by the downloaded image after the image is downloaded

41459433
required	placeholder
last step can be skipped if you don t required it my transition drawable r.drawable.anim_image_placeholder not required if using a static image
i do it like mentioned below the idea is to create the gif using transition drawables set the scale type to as required by the placeholder initially attach listener to change the scale type again to as required by the downloaded image after the image is downloaded

41459535
required	placeholder
my transition drawable r.drawable.anim_image_placeholder not required if using a static image
i do it like mentioned below the idea is to set the scale type to as required by the placeholder initially attach listener to change the scale type again to as required by the downloaded image after the image is downloaded

41461554
prepare	execute
it depends on how you execute your queries formatting via prepare statements is execute by the server which in turn sanitizes your query from any sql injection
but it has other restrictions like you cannot execute more than one query at a time and you cannot provide sanitizied entity names when needed

41463991
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you re against google-chrome there s good news
you can use a polyfill a piece of code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support the feature to make it work i ve tested it in firefox and safari and it works but not perfectly fine

41465976
shadowing	named
the modified example from shadow should be instructive you have to actually unintern and from temp-pack because as long as it is interned there it will be shadowing cl and
moreover the trick of saving the symbol does not work this is because intern creates a new symbol if a symbol whose named is the same as string is already accessible in package it is returned

41466983
vsto	add-in
if you want an xlam add-in as you say you need to go through this reference which doesn t involve creating a visual studio vsto project
a vsto office add-in is a com add-in by definition

41467076
bash	subshell
so bash doesn t think you re trying to refer to your command history.
you can build up the return codes in a subshell as you go then check them at the end using arithmetic evaluation

41467124
division	modulo
you should take care when you divide the sum by 6 though because the modulo equivalence isn t necessarily true for division
you can circumvent this by calculating everything modulo first and then take everything modulo m

41467541
getdate	datepart
select dateadd m -5 convert datetime 2017-01-04 - datepart d getdate + 1 -- datetime instead of date
it is because getdate returns datetime datatype you can do -1 or +1 with datetime values but not with date values

41467587
factories	presenter
but nette security user is service registered in dic so you can get it like this just make sure that you are using component factories - means do not create your component in the presenter using new operator
you cannot get user like this because ui control is not descendant of ui presenter

41469515
swift	objective-c
i propose to start listening in and stop in or deinit in swift objective-c swift the second reason is that view might not be loaded yet therefore is not called and the corresponding view controller is not subscribed
to solve this you may force load vc s view when you are creating you view controllers for tabs objective-c swift update assuming that you can use initializers as explained by danh in the comments below it is better to subscribe in the init method instead of viewdidload

41471512
ssl	https
it then issues a redirect which is not valid because the browser already thinks it s ssl
also keep in mind that cloudflare has your https certificate so it doesn t really matter that you set one up on the origin unless you use full strict https

41474711
ciimage	uiimage
since it uses a ciimage - which isn t a true image but a recipe for an image - it doesn t suffer from degradation
basically turn your uiimage cgimage into a ciimage pick any 4 points in it and crop

41485409
entity-relationship	diagram
the entity-relationship model doesn t use crow s foot
chen s notation and extensions to that notation can be called er diagram

41485409
entity-relationship	diagram
relationships in the entity-relationship model when physically implemented are represented by two or more entity columns in the same table not by any kind of link between tables
in actual table diagram many-to-many relationships are represented by their own table with two one-to-many association lines

41487408
hex	binary
use the method from hex binary string conversion in swift to convert the hex encoded string to data and then pass that as an array to the initializer
you want to use the hex encoded data as an aes key but the data is not a valid utf-8 sequence

41489028
viewdidload	viewwillappear
then it is not working because viewdidload is called when the view controller is loaded into memory which is occurring when instantiateviewcontrollerwithidentifier is called
to get the functionality you want move loaddata from viewdidload to viewwillappear which will get called when the view controller is pushed to the stack

41489937
daemons	systemd
daemons threads are generally known as service provider thread
these threads should not be used to execute program code but systemd code

41491416
inline	inlining
let s put the issue of whether inline is forced or not aside for now there are lot s of discussions on the topic
inlining a function is equivalent of pasting the contents of the function at the location of the function call invocation

41493847
aggregate-functions	sum
imo group by is generally for use with aggregate-functions sum count max min avg distinct is to eliminate duplicates when selecting non key values i think you need to sum your stock as oi could have multiple onhand values for each item
or you need to add your convert to a group by but then you have multiple itemcode codebars and itemname s possible which i think you were trying to avoid and since your order by doesn t take into account the onhand values i think a sum is what you re after or a min max avg ..

41494470
swift	objective-c
i find that the following works in a playground xcode 8.2 swift 3 the oddball class name string is because the objective-c runtime doesn t understand nested classes or other kinds of types that swift can define but objective-c can t -- within swift itself such mangled names are how types functions and such get uniquely defined
for example name mangling is also how function overloading works func foo and have different mangled names internally. the bridging machinery can still be made to dynamically resolve a class given its properly mangled swift name but swift name mangling is an implementation detail and subject to change

41494470
swift	objective-c
at least until swift 4 locks down the abi. so it s safe to pass the result of nsstringfromclass to nsclassfromstring within the same program but not safe to record a mangled name once in testing ship that mangled name as a string literal or resource in your app and expect it to work with nsclassfromstring later
instead if you want your nested class or any other swift-defined class to have a reliably known name for use in the objective-c runtime give it an objective-c name as described in the docs note this snippet won t run by itself -- the class a.b has to be referenced at least once somewhere in your process in order to be registered with the objective-c runtime

41500605
hive	hdfs
since i am new to hive my guess is hivecontext.sql doesn t know or is not able to split the data present in the table
for example when you read a text file from hdfs spark context considers the number of blocks used by that file to determine the partitions

41502862
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload only means that your viewcontroller has been loaded to the memory and ready for initial setup however it is not visible for the user
in order to make the presentation visible to the user i would recommend to start displaying it in viewdidappear and only set the first image in viewdidload

41505922
unicode	ucs
also note that the regex s used in xsd are unicode regular expression which differ from the more standard posix regex s and to make matters worse some of the parsers use whatever regex parser happens to by knocking around xsd validation in .net uses its internal regex parser - which is not unicode regular expression
note the regular expression language defined here does not attempt to provide a general solution to regular expressions over ucs character sequences

41508487
xml-rpc	json-rpc
soap and xml-rpc are both types of rpc implementation styles and are similar but not the same
json-rpc is another rpc mechanism it just uses json to encode the rpc call rather than the more verbose xml

41510498
hive	hdfs
dont forget that hive is not good enough to manage permissions so i highly recommand to set up permissions in the hdfs layer not in hive layer
hive does not support privileges on databases it may depend to version see doc the privileges apply to table and views

41514146
udp	tcp
dns s tcp protocol is the same as its udp protocol with one difference - the messages sent over tcp are prefixed by a 16-bit integer in network byte order to specify the message byte length
that is not required over udp as the message lengths are determined by the size of the datagrams

41515564
inline	inlining
and it won t be inline in debug mode
if you don t have a very good and special reason to tinker with the inlining yourself you should not touch it

41516472
swift	objective-c
that s called covariance and it s not supported for user types in swift except arrays as i know
btw objective-c generics support covariance in some way

41517213
bash	zsh
you can t run a command inside except in the fallback clause for when a value is not set in posix sh or bash
might be feasible in zsh which allows all manner of oddball syntax

41523936
uiview	calayer
the corner radius is a property of calayer and not uiview
unfortunately the uiview animation methods are only going to capture key-value changes for uiview related properties

41524308
ssl	https
this solution would only work for http requests though and not https since s3 won t terminate ssl for an https request
see #3 for a solution that would work for both http and https

41525167
direct3d	directx
for information on other aspects of the moving beyond the legacy directx sdk see living without d3dx directx sdk tools catalog directx sdk samples catalog living without d3dx direct3d sdk debug layer tricks and not so direct setup if you are looking to use directx with c# instead of c++ be sure to read this post
the zombie directx sdk directx sdks of a certain age and a brief history of windows sdks

41525297
prepare	execute
then you need to use prepare statements with parameterized queries so you aren t susceptible to sql injections
here s an example also when using query you don t need execute that execute as well

41525368
erlang	elixir
the real answer is probably because erlang doesn t
because there are other ways to do that same thing that is more like elixir

41525396
ssl	https
since i couldn t get an ssl certificate using aws certificate manager for something.elasticbeanstalk.com i created one for website.com
i then needed to have my client app connect to the https website.com which would forward it over to something.elasticbeanstalk.com

41526511
inline	inlining
but many other other functions are often inline as well at least if they happen to be in the same source file or module
but even inlining from other source files compiled object files is not out of the question

41528492
ienumerable	ilist
you also want less additional members in collection interface as you can see icollection and ienumerable does not fit your needs
i don t see big difference between picking ilist or array

41529550
ubuntu	centos
observations following their advice i noticed that centos ubuntu and debian all use very outdated versions of nodejs and npm when retrieving the current version using apt or yum depending on operating systems primary package manager
get rid of the outdated nodejs and npm to resolve this with as minimal headache as possible i ran the following command on ubuntu apt-get purge --auto-remove nodejs npm this purged the system of the archaic nodejs and npm as well as all dependencies which were no longer required install current nodejs and compatible npm the next objective was to get a current version of both nodejs and npm which i can snag nodejs directly from here and either compile or use the binary however this would not make it easy to swap versions as i need to depending on age of project

41530428
cdr	cons
better use a loop directly defun circularp list loop for cursor on cdr list while consp cursor thereis eq cursor list last but not least your approach is a very common one but fails when the list is not one big circular chain of cells but merely contains a loop somewhere
consider for example see that answer where i explain what and #1# mean the lists with numbers in front exhibit circularity but you can t just use the first cons cell as a marker because you will be looping forever inside the sublist that is circular

41530710
g++	gcc
btw you should use g++ not gcc when compiling c++ code
there are significant differences even if gcc is sometimes able to compile c++ or fortran code you ll mostly use gcc to compile c code

41532593
ecto	elixir
it looks like ecto does not support casting from the deprecated ecto.datetime to the new elixir naivedatetime struct which you re using when you use naive_datetime in ecto 2.1+ the recommended way in ecto 2.1 is to stop using deprecated ecto.datetime struct and use elixir s new naivedatetime or datetime everywhere
if you still want to explicitly convert between them you can do and use that value in your query if you re getting the old structs from ecto queries you probably have the old types defined for them in your schemas which you should change from field foo ecto.datetime to field foo naivedatetime or field foo datetime

41533529
octal	decimal	octal	binary
so exactly 3 binary digits are needed for one octal digit
but with converting decimal from to binary such is not possible

41538043
postgresql	mysql
alternatives mariadb - offshoot of mysql postgresql
the mysql community is working towards an asynchronous c++ connector however it s not there yet

41540614
fgetc	fread
for each object size calls are made to the fgetc function and the results stored in the order read hellip
this doesn t quite state that the read stops early if an error or end-of-file is returned by fgetc but paragraph 3 states that the fread function returns the number of elements successfully read which may be less than nmemb if a read error or end-of-file is encountered

41540917
uiview	subviews
the actual problem was that i added those to a custom uiview and assigned the view s class to my uitableviewcell subclass rather than use a table view cell object within ib
thus i did not add my subviews to the contentview that the ib object gives you causing me the problem

41542916
ssl	https
if you want your es cluster to serve requests over https ssl you need to setup ssl tls either using the shield plugin or preferably with xpack if you re running es 5
elasticsearch doesn t support ssl out-of-the-box

41543222
sum	coalesce
you should be using the case expression inside the sum function not the other way around
from yourtable this will compute the sum of coalesce amount_1 amount for those records where the type is either a or b otherwise it will use amount in the sum

41543552
intersect	contains
for more realistic physics you d have to keep track of time and compute when it would intersect with each edge of the rectangle
computing whether two rectangles intersect is just a matter of a few comparisons i know you re already using intersectswith to determine the direction of the collision you ll have to take into account the possibility that one rectangle completely contains the other collides in no direction it might create a plus figure collides in all directions one corner of the rectangle could intersect with a corner of other corner collides in two directions anyway to determine whether it has collided on the left side last but not least if you re computing this frame by frame there s the possibility that an object might jump over the other

41546428
spaces	delimiter
these are 2 ways to read strings containing spaces that don t use gets or fgets you can use getline posix 2008 may not exist in your system that conveniently manages allocation of the buffer with adequate size to capture the whole line
if you absolutely want scanf in this example it reads to the end of line unless the line has more than the specified number of chars minus 1 for the delimiter

41548627
noexcept	throw
to resolve c4297 do not attempt to throw exceptions in functions that are declared __declspec nothrow noexcept true or throw
alternatively remove the noexcept throw or __declspec nothrow specification

41550393
serializable	deserialization
such mapping classes are only meant to exist between json content and your business object class in order to de serializable the data simply speaking dtos only exist for this purpose and gson-related annotations must not spread onto your business classes -- just convert dtos to business objects
mappings deserialization then since your operators are meant to be effective enums this is the only place where you really need a custom json deserializer just because gson default rules are not aware of these rules

41551491
google-chrome	firefox
there are a number of options available right now edit 09 2018 use puppeteer the js headless google-chrome driver
firefox now also has headless mode but i m not sure which library corresponds to puppeteer

41557037
build.gradle	gradlew
you should not add dependencies by using the project structure but instead declare them in your build.gradle file
so you will have something like if you do not have auto import enabled for your gradlew project you have to refresh the project in the gradlew toolbar

41557581
memcpy	malloc
in c89 for example memcpy could be used to copy the bit pattern associated with an object of any type to an object of any other type with the same size in any cases where that bit pattern would represent a valid value in the destination type
c99 added language which allows compilers to behave in arbitrary fashion if memcpy is used to copy an object of some type t to storage with no declared type storage returned from malloc and that storage is then read as object of a type that isn t alias-compatible with t--even if the bit pattern of the original object would have a valid meaning in the new type

41557581
memcpy	malloc
c99 added language which allows compilers to behave in arbitrary fashion if memcpy is used to copy an object of some type t to storage with no declared type storage returned from malloc and that storage is then read as object of a type that isn t alias-compatible with t--even if the bit pattern of the original object would have a valid meaning in the new type
further the rules that apply to memcpy also apply in cases where an object is copied as an array of character type--without clarifying exactly what that means--so it s not clear exactly what code would need to do to achieve behavior matching the c89 memcpy

41557736
pdfsharp	itext
for those that believe i switched to itext is not an answer i ve found a fix for pdfsharp
without diving into the source code pdfsharp appears to do a redundant rotation on landscape pages

41571207
factors	matrix
either way the u factors ends up with a row of zeros in the bottom so that t a or a is not full-rank
if you want to see a more consistent behavior between two software you d better try a full-rank matrix

41573378
postgresql	greenplum
greenplum isn t postgresql and autovacuum does not work in the database
i highly recommend not tagging greenplum posts with postgresql because you will likely get incorrect information

41575920
swift	objective-c
using objective-c in a swift app doesn t increase it s app size any more than it needs to
as a matter of fact objective-c libraries can significantly reduce your app size if they re static libraries

41575920
swift	objective-c
swift cannot be compiled into a static library as far as i know
objective-c is compiled and all dependencies it needs it has on the ios device all the dynamic libraries it s runtime

41575920
swift	objective-c
it s the opposite adding swift to your objective-c project can increase the app s size because it ships with swift runtime library because swift s abi is not stable yet
adding swift to project increase size substantiously

41576054
implements	extends
this is the one who will be called with the arguments x and this is possible because the someclass can and should in this example be callable just with implements the __call__ method as you would do with __init__ as example + more info about objects being callables note the reference as it not bound with any variable will be lost after the last statement
extends others response will try to give you a more general answer on how python will solve that statement first python s interpreter will try solve the statement after the and then assign it to x so this leave us with_ someclass some_input x in this statement there are two main elements the someclass instation and the call for the result instance that should be a callable someclass some_input x #---instantiation---- --call-- it will solve first the left-side to determine what should be called in the left-side we have a class instantiation it means that python interpreter will call the someclass.__init__ ... method with the arguments some_input

41578161
sctp	tcp
it would probably fit better on security.sx which covers ssl tls extensively and dtls some although not sctp that i can recall
tls assumes and requires the service provided by tcp namely a single in-sequence octet stream where data is delivered in order without loss or duplication or reordering unless the connection fails in which case data delivery stops entirely and detectably

41579065
dictionary	map
not sure why you are using a dictionary but i would probably have gone for a map instead
or at least done some conversion to map somewhere

41579960
swift	objective-c
#available and friends in swift are a simplification of and improvement on the more complex ways of dealing with new features and backward compatibility in objective-c
if you re using objective-c there isn t a direct equivalent to #available so you have to fall back to those old ways

41581406
udp	tcp
or as the standard states in the jcre spec of the 3.0.1 connected edition a java card platform implementation is not required to support the tcp ip or udp ip on card
connections over http https and tls protocols and datagrams over the udp protocol may be supported over ip as well as non-ip protocols by using a gateway on the terminal or hosting device

41586074
ubuntu	linux
once i had published from linux ubuntu in this case i could install it on both linux and windows computers
i m not sure what the reason for this is be it some npm bug or an issue with doze line breaks but now it s working i did try to publish previously from linux and failed but with an old version of node 4.something and that didn t work but now i ve upgraded to the latest version and it works well so that might ve had something to do with it

41586256
bower	npm
at least i didn t find any option to get bower to work with globally installed packages
so in the root of your project you need to do npm install ethereumjs-tx --save-dev --save indicates the package will not only be downloaded to a local node_modules folder but also will modify your package.json and write down the dependency so any further npm install command over that package.json will install ethereumjs-tx with the same version

41587652
mongodb	bson
seems mongodb drive doesn t support it any more
me personally see two possible solutions 1 you query bson not your objects that should work i have tried with my sample data out waht is bad on this approach your should query your collection as bsondocument collection

41587739
client-side	server-side
if you were talking about utility libraries like apache commons i could advise you to make an rpc call instead client-side calls server-side where you can use anything you like and return the results asynchronously but that s not the case
i just took one of my gwt-project client-side classes and added the following lines this obviously compiles just fine but when i launch the gwt app i get this error errors in file c gwtproject src main java package clientsideclass.java error line 119 no source code is available for type org.apache.commons.lang.stringescapeutils

41590980
sudo	passwd
1 fabric maintains an in-memory passwd 2 sudo accepts additional user and group arguments first fabric would get passwd from cache when using sudo then you do not need to enter passwd
but if you use run sudo cmd you need to enter passwd for each sudo cmd

41590980
sudo	passwd
but if you use run sudo cmd you need to enter passwd for each sudo cmd
second if you want to execute a command not under root but other user group like www you just need to set env.sudo_user www or sudo cmd user www

41595236
prepare	execute
within mysql you can only achieve this using prepare statements because you cannot tie a variable to a table or column name
this means that you have to assemble the sql statement in a string and execute it

41601311
sudo	passwd
for example ubuntu user you can create accounts for other users too if you prefer edit etc ssh sshd_config and set pubkeyauthentication no passwordauthentication yes restart the ssh service sudo service ssh restart try ssh into the instance with passwd create an ami from that instance launch new instances from that ami and not specify a keypair
one possible solution is launch an instance ssh into the instance and create a passwd for the user

41601644
cdr	cons
the next problem is the third clause is non-recursive you have to drop first elements in the cdr
however there is a bigger problem with your code. when the function sees a cons it has to know whether the first element is to be dropped or not

41602964
backgrounding	multitasking
apple only allows a very small subset of apps to run in the backgrounding and then only under specific circumstances like a backgrounding sound playing app when the user is actively listening to music or a navigation app that is actively tracking the user s location and notifying them when it s time to make a turn to follow directions.
that application does not run in backgrounding flag is a very old flag that means your app does not support multitasking and should be terminated when the user presses the home button

41603144
bash	subshell
there is no problem with exit and curly braces however there is a problem with exit and pipes and that s what you re running into exit | exit echo still alive in bash by default each stage in a pipeline runs in a subshell and exit can only exit that subshell
in your case you can use redirection and process substitution instead note that this is bash specific code and will not work in sh such as when using #

41609842
implements	extends
project reactor that do not make such distinction and implements only objects with backpressure
observables are faster using observable has lower overhead in general than flowable backpressure might be undesirable the main issue with backpressure is that many hot sources such as ui events can t be reasonably backpressured backpressure complicates things when you try to extends rxjava with custom objects or operators

41610896
swift	objective-c
secondly swift does not have nil messaging like objective-c so the string instance that the function is called on has to be not nil
even in objective-c this would still not matter as the function would not run if called on a nil string

41610989
margin	text-align
set margin-left and margin-right to auto or margin to 0 auto to achieve an effect that is similar to the align attribute
semantically and technically speaking text-align should only be used to align inline level elements of which a table is not

41611925
pascal	delphi
the best way to start assembler is to first optimize pascal a lot and try to comprehend the generated code
i ve been doing image analysis in delphi for years now and going to assembler is only to manually correct the compiler not getting it not hoisting or picking a suboptimal invariant or when register allocation goes awol

41613209
ubuntu	linux
if your ubuntu server is not running a firewall you should be able to connect to the web api with a browser from another machine on the same network you can get the ip address of your ubuntu server by typing ip addr show in a terminal window
notes managing your firewall is dependent on your linux distro

41616025
istream	getline
if you re not allowed by your teacher or something and must use arrays then you can t use std getline but instead have to use std istream getline instead
it s actually kind of simple once you remember that the input operator stops on white-space and also know about the std getline function

41616622
hive	hdfs
there are a few options hbase hive impala solr
hdfs is not a posix-compatible filesystem so you can t just use it as a general purpose storage and then deploy any db on top of it

41616623
google-chrome	firefox
instead of that i use rel preload and everything is working fine but just for google-chrome additionally you can to add the type of asset with as parameter my typescript method to create a link to download is the next
unfortunately the load and error events are not fired with the rel prerender the same in google-chrome firefox i don t know why

41623397
strcpy	malloc
the program output is twinpeaks of course you could use standard string functions strcpy and strcat instead of the loops that can be both written even in the return statement
you can not change the size of the array in the function using malloc

41623606
profiling	debugging
so when i ve run it initially the run debugging profiling was created as junit and then got reused with subsequent attempts to run the class
i guess it could be improved in android studio to determine the run debugging type based on the current state of the class not complaining though

41629477
comparator	comparable
the exact behavior that you experience is hinted in the docs of comparable although you use comparator for example if one adds two keys a and b such that
a.equals b a.compareto b 0 to a sorted set that does not use an explicit comparator the second add operation returns false and the size of the sorted set does not increase because a and b are equivalent from the sorted set s perspective

41630254
ecto	elixir
the problem is that ecto does not know if the datetime is or isn t utc
fortunately ecto 2.1 has a better alternative since it s supports the built-in calendrical types from elixir 1.3

41631277
jar	war
assuming you are only using jstl version 1.2.4 to compile your code and you are not adding the jar in your war web-inf lib
if you compile and package with maven against 1.2.4 and deploy the packaged war on jetty jetty will use 1.2 which is the one on the server classpath and not 1.2.4 because it is not available for jetty

41634216
multiplying	subtract
you can use this observation to compute a number at any spot in the matrix add absolute differences in both coordinates together multiplying by the rate of decrease subtract from the highest number and limit with zero to ensure that the number does not become negative
if the number in the center is the highest number h the number at the position r c is computed by multiplying manhattan distance from the center to r c and multiplying it by the decrease rate

41638373
bash	subshell
the only way to find out if this behavior is expected or not is to ask chet ramey gnu bash maintainer
please send an email with your report to bug-bash gnu.org you can see that the current behavior seems to be correct given that it handles the subshell case explicitly in as you can see the explicit subshell case is handled as a special case and so is the case with the command grouping

41639542
spaces	delimiter
unfortunately it doesn t get rid of the first leading spaces hence the -f3
add tr -s to the pipe chain to squeeze multiple spaces into one spaces delimiter uniq -c | tr -s | cut -d -f3 tr is very useful in some obscure places

41645567
direct3d	directx
with all that said you probably shouldn t be using legacy direct3d 9 anyhow
using directx 11 with one of the modern replacements for d3dx is a better cleaner option and doesn t require the legacy directx sdk

41649547
google-chrome	firefox
api behaves like google-chrome
here are some examples note that the error message that you received showed that the return value is undefined this.sendmsgtotabs ... is undefined if the method was undefined as you thought firefox would print the following error this.sendmsgtotabs is not a function the fix for your case is to use promises as follows if there is any tab without a content script the promise will be rejected though

41650903
hex	binary
if you want a string representation of the encrypted data then you can use for example the base64 encoding print encrypted_data.base64encodedstring or using from how to convert data to hex string in swift as a hex-encoded string print encrypted_data.hexencodedstring
the encrypted data is a binary blob and in most cases not a valid utf-8 sequence

41653976
portrait	landscape
so a phone with zero pitch roll and yaw would have its screen facing away from gravity it s back camera pointed at the ground and its right side of portrait mode facing north
notice that this orientation is relative to gravity not to the phone s portrait landscape mode which is also relative to gravity

41653976
portrait	landscape
notice that this orientation is relative to gravity not to the phone s portrait landscape mode which is also relative to gravity
so portrait landscape is irrelevant

41655573
gmail	hotmail
once you are on your mail provider via web mail or from an email client on your device and send a mail for example from your gmail account to a hotmail account you ve got to consider whether that connection is encrypted
in 2026 gmail started warning if the sender address is for a service that doesn t allow gmail to use https to send it the message

41657855
spaces	delimiter
a 3 row array with mixed number sizes fixed width csv formatting delimiter reading the default mode for python string split uses generalized white spaces here s an example of a csv with constant spacing and variable width reads it just fine
the default display for arrays is a uniform field width per element not a uniform spacing in effect numpy uses a format like np.savetxt does just that using the fmt and delimiter that you provide

41661614
spaces	linefeed
there are of course several ways how to achieve it including writing whole lines prepared in memory buffer instead of single chars but if i will stick with your single char output this wanted output translates into this need to call with dl set to 49 digit 1 13 carriage return 10 linefeed 49 32 spaces 50 digit 2 13 10
that doesn t look obviously loopable but if you would add more lines the pattern digit + spaces for inner loop would emerge

41663342
client-side	server-side
the code does little good for us in client-side javascript but if we pass it to an azure function we can exchange it for an access token
this must be done in some server-side code a web server or azure functions as a super-lightweight form of a web server so that we can pass in a client secret for the exchange -- which quite naturally wouldn t be secret in sniffable-out client-side javascript

41663366
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
first i optimized your svg code using this online tool - it s better if you always optimize your svg code - and with help from this example i modified your javascript code jsfiddle 1 - doesn t work in ie10 ie11 and safari code edit to get it working in ie11 before i only tested with google-chrome and firefox the base64 encoded image needs to be injected into the src attribute of the created appended image
also since we re following this approach we need to get rid of the transform scale 1 -1 otherwise the blueish rectangle would look flipped vertically in ie now it is like below jsfiddle 2 - tested in google-chrome fireforx ie10+ but i have no idea about safari 1 code notes 1 - op did this to get it working in safari as well as other browsers

41670378
move	drag
but as david said in that way you can only select rather than drag move using mouse that doesn t work for me
i can select it but can t move it

41671440
super	extends
super is not emulatable in es5
the pattern of superclass.call this only works when extends other es5-style classes and does not propagate new.target

41671944
shadowing	named
your for comprehension looks at the inner i which is a val not a var thus shadowing the external declaration
bind to a different named note you can do this without declaring an outer variable at all using count edit from your comments i understand you want to print all numbers other than 2

41672794
git-svn	svn2git
that migration script uses git-svn under the hood but git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

41672794
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are pleny tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

41672794
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

41672834
boost	allocator
that s how allocator work you swap out the standard heap-allocator that calls new for boost s one that allocates from the shared memory segment
same behaviour as running out of memory with the standard allocator an exception will be thrown not std bad_alloc though it s apparently boost interprocess bad_alloc instead

41672834
boost	allocator
same behaviour as running out of memory with the standard allocator an exception will be thrown not std bad_alloc though it s apparently boost interprocess bad_alloc instead
you ll want to benchmark the boost s allocator s allocator speed and compare it with that of std allocator which is the default

41672933
qthread	qobject
i suggest you take a look at qt documentation threads and qobject qobject thread affinity a quick guide each instance of qobject is associated with a qthread qobject thread
you can change its associated thread by using qobject movetothread but the qobject must not have a parent and the call must be made from the thread the qobject is currently associated with

41676076
express	node.js
npm install express will install the framework called express for example
first of all it does not ask you to install node.js runtime or npm package manager it offers you to install them both if you want now node.js runtime is basically what will understand your javascript code and execute it to produce a result

41679818
bower	npm
of course you need bower installed first otherwise on dotnet publish you will get the error bower is not recognized as an internal or external command npm install -g bower running that in ubuntu i encountered this other problem bower install usr bin env node no such file or directory the solution can be found here which is adding a logical link in linux ln -s usr bin nodejs usr bin node finally repeat bower install
as user baklap4 mentioned in the comments it needs to run bower install so it retrieves the dependencies via npm it s not done automatically as in visual studio

41684990
rsa	dsa
if you can and do give the server an ecdsa cert a cert with an ecc key and ku sign and not an rsa cert then only ecdhe-ecdsa ciphers can be negotiated with that cert
if you also or instead give it a dsa cert then only dhe-dss ciphers can be negotiated with that cert

41685214
inline	inlining
3 in practice you aren t really going to disable inlining like this but the failure to inline would happen just because the methods are in different compilation units
because of the way godbolt works i can t exactly do that so disabling inlining has the same effect

41686832
subtraction	addition
on such platforms this will effectively define a natural result of all pointer arithmetic operations except subtraction of pointers whose difference is not a multiple of the size of the pointer s target type
other platforms may represent pointers in other ways and addition or subtraction of certain combinations of pointers may cause unpredictable results

41694117
inline	inlining
when you inline everything then there s which is rather trivial to optimize
this inlining is not something you can depend on as there s an inlining limit which gets reached rather quickly

41697232
snappy	lz4
i just tried it with snappy and this works out of the box
lz4 appears not to be implemented by kafka-node at this point

41705692
ssl	https
what we usually do to serve https is place an apache nginx proxy in front that does ssl termination and then forwards the non-ssl request to jetty
at the moment the jetty container wasabi-main only serves http traffic and is not set up to serve https

41708100
boost	allocator
std vector is a specification not an implementation. there is only one implementation boost container vector across all platforms so more assumptions can be made for example originally std vector was not required to use contiguous memory source the boost c++ libraries by boris schäling
there are several differences that i could compile no specialization of source roeland uses boost allocator infrastructure which especially in c++1x is more flexible that the standard allocator doesn t ignore certain traits that are provided by the allocator

41708100
boost	stl	allocator	stl
there are several differences that i could compile no specialization of source roeland uses boost allocator infrastructure which especially in c++1x is more flexible that the standard allocator doesn t ignore certain traits that are provided by the allocator
source in particular one can still specify the reference and pointer types to be different from and see is it still possible to customize stl vector #39

41708100
boost	stl
support for recursive containers source the boost c++ libraries by boris schäling
implementations of stl didn t support incomplete value types they were not required in the first place in particular recursive containers

41708365
rdf	owl
with rdf rdfs alone you can t
you can do it with owl for instance this is not in owl dl however

41710297
apache	nginx
is not is a apache problem .
is not the problem a miss configuration in php .ini file due to a copy paste from nginx setup to be used with apache previously i was using nginx and then i moved to apache leaving the php setup as it was

41711256
hmac	md5
if you follow this path you need to keep some key details in mind use a strong hash-based message authentication code hmac such as hmac sha-256 -384 or -512
do not use sha-1 or md5 as these are easily brute forced

41712956
factors	matrix
- you ll pass this function the x1 x2- y1 y2 range you want to search of the original matrix - calculate that range using the shrink factors this new function did_i_find_a_one x x2 y y2 just returns whether or not there is a 1 in that block or not
in addition to the following code i wrote functions to display the matrix so i could visualize the result

41714485
prepare	execute
just use multiple prepare statements or simply construct them on the fly all the time
when you are using parameters the parameter values are literal values they are not execute or interpreted in any way

41724969
google-chrome	firefox
basically google-chrome allows the data to have a set a timeout period while in firefox it is not possible to specify an expiration period for any of your data
if you re using google-chrome frequently and clear your cache for other reasons you re likely also clearing your auth token

41725683
queue	fifo
erasing a from the front of a vector an element at the time can be quite slow especially if the buffer is large unless you can reorder elements which you cannot with a fifo queue
a circular buffer is an excellent perhaps ideal data structure for a fifo queue of fixed size

41728435
theano	keras
though i knew that theano was providing lazy-evaluated tensor functions that were running the matrix operations on the gpu what i did not realize was that keras s loss functions are actually written in a way where the compiled theano execution graph is smart enough to cache certain values in order to properly back-propagate the loss values back throughout the network
because of the type of network i m creating i dived into writing my own custom loss function without a completely understanding of how theano actually treats the loss after it s been calculated by the function

41729764
implements	extends
the trick is to ignore the external static shell around spark implements in spark.spark and directly work with the internal spark.webserver.sparkserver
there are some obstackles in the code that require workaround spark.webserver.jettyhandler is not public so you can t instantiate it from your code but you can extends that with your own class placed into that package and turn it public

41733910
bmp	png
my recommendation would be first saving the manipulated bmp image to png format and then use imagemagick separately to save it back to bmp
gd doesn t support saving to a bmp image

41734003
erlang	elixir
i found here the definition of the record tbscertificate it is erlang notation but i guess it will be equivalent with elixir
in erlang you can retrieve the information validity using the record syntax i am not familiar with elixir s syntax i think it is something like but i cant t test it

41734666
ienumerable	ilist
suppose you have to implement addsort t item then if you use you might be reinventing the wheel that add and contains should be implemented by yourself i would recommend to use composition over inheritance update i have updated the players as ienumerable so will have much flexibility
this doesn t provide direct answer might have overview ilist provides you the flexibility of implement this functionality

41736159
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
the public key is embedded into your binary create a datastructure holding your relevant licensing information compress it sign it upon license checking verify license signature uncompress structure make whatever checks are needed based on license data common well known asymetric ciphers are not prone against known plaintext attacks to my knowledge elliptic curves are not used in the context of compression elliptic curves are used in the context of cryptography read encryption and digital signatures train your google-fu with rsa dsa ecc elliptic curve cryptography ecdsa
create an dsa or ecdsa or keypair .

41736871
inline	inlining
the inline keyword was originally a hint to the compiler that you the programmer think this function is a candidate for inlining - the compiler is not required to honor this
in modern usage it has little to nothing to do with inlining at all - modern compilers freely inline or not functions behind you back these form part of the optimization techniques

41736871
inline	inlining
in modern usage it has little to nothing to do with inlining at all - modern compilers freely inline or not functions behind you back these form part of the optimization techniques
code transformations including inlining are done under the as-if rule in c++ which basically means that the compiler can transform the code as it wants to so long as the execution is as-if the original code was executed as written

41736871
inline	inlining
this may mean that it is no longer inline but could still be the optimizer will apply the appropriate analysis
no it is only a hint and largely relates to linkage and not actual inlining

41737096
inline	inlining
inline expansion or inlining is an optimization where a function call is avoided by copying the called function into the frame of the caller
a function call can be expanded inline whether the function has been declared inline or not

41738499
google-chrome	firefox
so you can use the source code of that plugin for google-chrome firefox from link above and build your own
you can do this with quickblox js sdk but it needs some additional logic. webrtc api does not provide a way to natively share your screen so google-chrome firefox browsers plugins are needed here

41738499
google-chrome	firefox
you can do this with quickblox js sdk but it needs some additional logic. webrtc api does not provide a way to natively share your screen so google-chrome firefox browsers plugins are needed here
for example i tried some time ago this logic so you just pass another object to quickblox session.getusermedia and that s all but it needs to install google-chrome firefox screen sharing plugin

41739711
ssl	https
then i figured out at least i believe so that they differ only for https requests cause server needs some time to decrypt ssl layer which is not exactly the time spent by the target app but the time spent by server hosting the app service
the time to decrypt ssl and to connect also the one given in time_connect is time_appconnect and only when it s 0 like for non-https requests - time_connect and time_pretransfer are equal otherwise for https requests they differ and for https time_pretransfer would be equal to time_appconnect and not to time_connect

41739711
ssl	https
the time to decrypt ssl and to connect also the one given in time_connect is time_appconnect and only when it s 0 like for non-https requests - time_connect and time_pretransfer are equal otherwise for https requests they differ and for https time_pretransfer would be equal to time_appconnect and not to time_connect
check the following two examples curl -kso dev null -w time_connect time_connect time_appconnect time_appconnect time_pretransfer time_pretransfer n time_connect 0.128 time_appconnect 0.000 time_pretransfer 0.128 curl -kso dev null -w time_connect time_connect time_appconnect time_appconnect time_pretransfer time_pretransfer n time_connect 0.133 time_appconnect 0.577 time_pretransfer 0.577 so i d say that time_pretransfer is more precise to be used compared to time_connect since it ll respect ssl connections too and maybe some other things i m not aware of

41747013
google-chrome	firefox
but not why google-chrome seems to ignore what s causing the issue in firefox
firefox is using the 24px width and height set on the element so remove those and the symbol will expand to fill the space of it s container

41748771
rvm	bundler
if ruby version is not specified in gemfile then it is generally considering default rvm version
but if it is specified in gemfile then that version of ruby should be installed in your system along with its bundler

41757978
prng	random
this ensures that whenever the image is loaded the seed of the prng pseudo random number generator is not modified
thus the script loading the image does not need to do anything special to use a different sequence of pseudo random numbers on each execution

41758937
mergesort	timsort
prior java 8 that was not a big issue the sorting implementation mergesort would not throw exception
java8 changed default sorting implementation to timsort that is much more sensitive to comparators with invalid contract hence it might throw an exception

41759363
xslt	xquery
the kind of query where the output has only minor changes from the input is actually much easier to do using xslt
furthermore xslt is capable of producing multiple output files during a single execution which is not directly possible in xquery

41759363
xslt	xquery
furthermore xslt is capable of producing multiple output files during a single execution which is not directly possible in xquery
in xslt 3.0 this might be to do this in xquery it s probably best to execute the query once per input file which means you need logic in some external language to iterate of the input files and set the corresponding output file for each input

google-chrome	firefox
the following issues have been raised at github ropensci plotly - but no solutions as of 2017-01-20 plotly + flexdashboard + firefox huge memory consumption #721 very bad performance of rmarkdown in firefox #483 r library big slowdown in firefox but not in google-chrome #17 github plotly plotly.js issues 17
apologies - i do not have enough points to respond in comments i get same problem with r + rmd + plotly + firefox but no issue with ie or opera

strcpy	strdup
you are reserving space for an array of pointers but not for the content to which the pointers shall point the probably easiest way to overcome this is to write instead of strcpy
note that strdup automatically reserves enough memory for holding the copy whereas strcpy expects that this space has already been reserved before

41765320
queue	fifo
if you are not looking at scaling out right now then you could mitigate a lot of your concern by making sure that you push events into a fifo queue
then your synchronizer service could then poll the queue instead of subscribing to events

41765894
spaces	delimiter
note in your text example the delimiter is shown as + spaces
without spaces the solution does not work

41766016
google-chrome	firefox
opening the xml via the workspace folder in the node allocate node start will fail and google-chrome will output the error as stated by the question
this is not limited to google-chrome though as firefox will report an error as well looking something like error loading stylesheet a network error occurred loading an xslt stylesheet solving this is a matter of configuring the content security policy csp jenkins uses

41766772
serializable	deserialization
serializable in one solution deserialization in the other solution
if you don t want to share classes or if you need another options then you can use serializatoin deserialization mechanisms that doesn t care about the original type but rather for it compatibility with the data

41767009
textview	imageview
now in the framelayout first add the imageview and then the textview
do not change anything for the textview

41767009
textview	imageview
do not change anything for the textview
framelayout.addview imageview

41769770
subtraction	addition
however since we invert the order of the evaluation this has a problem with arithmetic operations that are not commutative like the subtraction
that s why i do subtraction using addition instead 1-9 equates to 1 + -9

41771069
mvp	presenter
the issue with most mvp implementation out there is that they designate activities and fragments as views and propose to use android framework independent presenter
this sounds good until one encounters issues like yours - bluetooth framework is part of android framework so it is not clear how to use it in the presenter that shouldn t depend on android specific classes

41771614
multiplying	subtract
multiplying a pointer value is not defined nor does it makes sense
you can however add to or subtract from a pointer

41773081
google-chrome	firefox
answer update according to the comment it worked on firefox but doesn t work on google-chrome this issue is related to the dom ready event
this doesn t work in firefox

41773260
ssl	https
the src attribute should point to a valid audio file accessible via an ssl based uri
thus using an https not an http based request

41777313
hive	hdfs
when you import data to hdfs as hive table sqoop first creates a staging area in you home directory your case user gauravfrankly with same folder name and it then moves data to the hive directory
so there should not be any directory in home location with the same table name which you are importing as hive table

41778941
imperative	declarative
x-1 else not a month you probably are used to the imperative world c++ java ... where there are variables that you can set and set to other values
in a functional and by extent declarative language a variable is only set once

41780425
jruby	mri
the jruby java extension api is just the entire internals of jruby and you aren t programming against an api instead you re programming against all the implementations details and design decisions of jruby
we plan to eventually tackle both problems in the same way - which is to add another level of abstraction over the c or java code using an interpreter which we can intercept and redirect when required so that it believes it is running against mri or jruby internals but really we redirect these to our internals

41781539
debian	linux	centos	linux
centos example yum list installed ntp if not installed yum install ntp debian example dpkg -s ntp if not installed apt-get install ntp this is all handled by the package provider on your linux of choice
it depends on your flavour of linux

41783646
onresume	onpause
generally the rule is just to pair things properly- onstop with onstart and onpause with onresume
there are situations where onpause will be called but not onstop but that s generally because a short term transparent background activity pops up over your app rather than because onstop will never be called

41783745
multiplication	modulo
2432902008176640000 does not fit in a long on your system 32 bits probably windows so one of the multiplication causes an arithmetic overflow which the c standard explicitly describes as undefined behavior
on your system the computation might be performed modulo 2 32 and the result could be a negative number but this is not guaranteed by the standard

41784733
lxml	elementtree
its not a full-featured xpath like is available with lxml but works for what you need
elementtree s findall takes a quasi-xpath string

41786880
jar	war
for jar packaging the jsp files should be in src main resources meta-inf resources . for war packaging src main webapp is good
also i guess with war packaging you are probably not implementing springbootservletinitializer with it s method configure ... in your config main class

41787239
bash	subshell
this makes it easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves differently when its stdout is not a tty. just do script -c bash yourscript.sh -a output.txt
the problem is script starts a separate subshell than the one that is running the actual script to club them together

41790421
rpm	yum
yum is a child provider of rpm it uses the rpm command to check if the package is installed on the system
this is a lot faster than running yum info as it doesn t make any internet calls and won t fail if a yumrepo is failing the install command however will be yum install so previously we talked about how puppet uses the ral to both read and modify the state of resources on a system

41791185
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
that s why you are not getting error. on nix if you use javac with case-sensitive then you will get error
windows filesystem is case-insensitive

41791484
swift	objective-c
you could simply do the following to show the navigation bar objective-c swift 3 this will show the modal view controller with the navigation bar
knowledge on objective-c is limited so i did not write the part of presenting

41797191
ssl	https
from the comments it appears you are talking about https compression as returned by openssl s_client command this is nothing to do with gzip compression on each resource as used to reduce the size of large items usually text based items like html css and javascript but is an extra set of compression at the ssl tls level
it is recommended to not use compression at an ssl tls level due the crime attack published in 2012

41800732
gruntjs	package.json
you aren t really running the gruntjs package as a whole from the command
the setup for this starts in gruntjs s package.json

41800974
pickle	dill
i m not sure why use used the dill tag in your question because you only used pickle .
but if you really need your code to be exactly how you wrote it with the one caveat that you can replace pickle with dill .

41812163
queue	fifo
the following features of aws services aren t currently compatible with fifo queue amazon cloudwatch events amazon s3 event notifications amazon sns topic subscriptions
s3 sqs integration does not currently support the use of fifo queue and your queue is a fifo queue

41816635
junit	mockito
our dependencies are almost identical to yours as well - we use junit 4.12 instead of 4.11 but the same versions of powermockito 1.6.2 and mockito 1.10.19
since we use jenkins to launch ant scripts not maven i added this parameter to the junit ant task - you will have to modify as appropriate for maven of course we did not want -noverify to apply to all our tests so i extracted the one that was hitting the verifyerror exception from the main suite and ran it separately

41818203
sudo	passwd
effectively you attempt to run the task locally with sudo command in front and have a requirement for providing the passwd set in etc sudoers
there s nothing silly in what ansible does here and it does not think you are root actually if it thought you were root it wouldn t ask for the passwd

41819148
vb6	vba
now if you want to see if it s numeric you can try to parse it dim digitvalue as integer if int32.tryparse thefifthcharacter digitvalue then numeric digitvalue contains the numeric value else non-numeric digitvalue contains an integer s default value 0 end if lastly if you want a message box use winforms messagebox instead of vb6 s msgbox
you originally tagged your question as vba but vba doesn t throw system.invalidcastexception or any other exception for that matter

41820692
implements	extends
mozilla has explicitly stated that they intend to implements functionality for webextensions which is not currently available in other browsers by extends the apis
one way that this is being done is that there is a mechanism called webextensions experiments which is intended for non-mozilla developers to implements additional functionality for webextensions

41821336
swift	objective-c
it s the same as the objective-c api but uses swift s syntax
nsnotificationcenter.defaultcenter .addobserver self selector #selector batterylevelchanged name uidevicebatteryleveldidchangenotification object nil or in swift 3 notificationcenter.default.addobserver self selector #selector self.batterylevelchanged name .uidevicebatteryleveldidchange object nil if your observer does not inherit from an objective-c object you must prefix your method with objective-c in order to use it as a selector

41825145
udp	tcp
for udp sockets the data is usually sent pretty soon if not immediately but for tcp sockets there can be a relatively long delay between adding data to the send buffer and having the tcp implementation really send that data
as a result when you close a tcp socket there may still be pending data in the send buffer which has not been sent yet but your code considers it as sent since the send call succeeded

41832787
namedtuple	dictionary
you re right namedtuple cannot be passed from the spawned process to the callback
maybe it s not a more accpetable way but you can send dictionary as result instead of namedtuple

41832787
namedtuple	dictionary
maybe it s not a more accpetable way but you can send dictionary as result instead of namedtuple
as dag høidahl corrected namedtuple can be passed

41832996
onchange	onblur
make sure to use the bind method in your constructor so that you do not lose the this context within your onchange event handler method
you will then want to pass the value back to your update input method onblur

41833317
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie are okay with this because they will provide event if it s not defined though other browsers like firefox will not
do this instead i ve fixed the firefox issue by simply using the variable that you were already using

41839555
des	aes
single key tdes is never used in software and may not be supported it just makes sense in hardware where you don t want to supply a separate implementation of des in addition to des-ede
des-ede is much slower than a good implementation of aes and aes has a security of around 126 8 for a key size of 128 bits using a very complicated attack

41839828
ffmpeg	handbrake	mp4	webm
if the chosen destination container cannot hold the data of the source file you cannot copy aac audio into a mp3 file or vp9 video into a mp4 file that just won t work ffmpeg will let you know
webm is just a subset of matroska .mkv so just use handbrake to create a mkv file choose mkv container not mp4

41839828
mp4	webm
webm is just a subset of matroska .mkv so just use handbrake to create a mkv file choose mkv container not mp4
imho is handbrake the best tool for creating mp4 and mkv files on mac also exists for windows and linux but i never used it there

41839881
floating-point	fractions
the attribute values must be signed floating-point numbers no exponential format allowed
the floating-point numbers are rounded to have not more than eight fractions digits

41839881
floating-point	fractions
the floating-point numbers are rounded to have not more than eight fractions digits
the floating-point numbers must be less than 10 8 with respect to their absolute values

41839881
floating-point	fractions
the integer factor to multiply the floating-point numbers with must not exceed a value of 21
the resulting multiplied floating-point numbers are returned with exactly eight fractions digits

41840746
pandas	seaborn
i realize this doesn t directly answer your question in part because your code is not quite a minimum working example but if you re going to be using seaborn then it is probably in your best interest to start handling your data with pandas
a lot of seaborn is written with pandas in mind and so the two jive really well

41844073
firefox	safari
firefox 22 supports this feature
opera 32 supports this feature so arrow functions in your case did work on chrome as they were implemented in the version of the browser you were using but not safari and ie because they were too old and were at a version that didn t support the feature or just don t support the feature in the first place

41850446
vsts	tfs
however vsts is probably not intended for time tracking
you can try and use time sheet extensions to vsts. for example tfs timesheet allows inputting hours directly from a work item tab and generate detailed reports that show how many hours were spent to complete a task with a day-by-day breakdown

41856800
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uiviewcontroller of course cannot provide the animation
.pushviewcontroller instead of self.present you set up animation in uinavigationcontroller

41857767
matplotlib	colormap
note that i use the jet matplotlib colormap and that i set and so that the color values are absolute and not relative to eachother
output of the code above update i wasn t aware that you could simply use color names in matplotlib

41863790
jar	war
do not copy the websphere mq jar files to application ear or war files
do not copy the websphere mq jar or mq c c++ library files from other machines fix packs cannot be applied to an installation where jar or c c++ library files have been copied from another machine and this makes it much more difficult to ensure that all of these jar library files are kept in step with each other and are at compatible levels

41866889
spaces	delimiter
note that tokens may be separated by spaces or tabs
the delimiter themselves are not part of the token so including r and n ensures that these characters will not be part of the final token in a line

41868035
profiling	debugging
the easiest fix is to create a new app from xcode and deploy it on the device xcode will automatically downloads the required profiling and certificates
first of all you do not need to sign publish your app to use it with test recorder. you can start recording tests from .app located on bin iphonesimulator debugging folder

41869674
strtol	atoi
instead you can use strtol
using atoi on a value that cannot be represented as an integer invokes undefined behaviour

41871002
oncreate	onstart
so override onstart method in activity and move your code inside onstart improvements declare your view in class and initialize them in oncreate instead of internalizing them everytime in your timer anonymous class
oncreate will be executed only first time when your activity is created but when you come back to this activity then oncreate will not be executed again

41873216
spaces	delimiter
just for the sake of completeness to remove leading white-spaces use this this works because the default delimiter of for f are spaces and tab
i would not try to remove the leading spaces i would change the method of removing the number

41873216
spaces	delimiter
i would not try to remove the leading spaces i would change the method of removing the number
apply this to remove everything up to and including spaces - spaces or the better syntax the latter variant is better in order to avoid trouble when the last character of the string to echo is a single numeral separated from the rest by a token delimiter because together with the symbol it constitutes a redirection operator like for example

41874253
sudo	passwd
obviously then if you re going to use sudo su which i ve advised against elsewhere you need your etc sudoers configuration to support that
because your etc sudoers isn t allowing direct the switch to root you re requesting it s trying to prompt for a passwd which requires a tty which is thus causing a failure

41875707
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

41875707
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are pleny tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

41875707
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

41877857
ssd	sata
if this is marked as an answer i would caution anyone to first understand trim and how it may or may not be applied for your application with regards to the hardware and software within your operating system and understand the capabilities of a given ssd make model firmware with regards to trim
no action required only if trim is enabled and working as expected on a single ssd connected directly via sata ahci as a single drive

41880987
puma	webrick
to switch it to using puma which will support testing with actioncable you can specify as part of your capybara configuration
the default server used by capybara is webrick which doesn t support testing actioncable it will be changing whenever capybara 3.0 releases

41884324
floating-point	fractions
where x has data type single or double returns the positive distance from abs x to the next larger floating-point number of the same precision as x
as not all fractions are equally closely spaced on the number line different fractions will show different distances to the next floating-point within the same precision

41884324
floating-point	fractions
as not all fractions are equally closely spaced on the number line different fractions will show different distances to the next floating-point within the same precision
their bit representations are the sign for both is positive 0 the exponent is not equal and of course their fractions is vastly different

41884898
swift	objective-c
when you use swift you should really try to use swift code
your code isn t swift it s objective-c trying to pretend it is swift

41886005
bash	zsh
ksh is an improvement over sh as is zsh but zsh claims it is a shell designed for interactive use csh is considered evil these days bash and sh are the ones to learn
the difference is not between linux and solaris the difference is between which shell you are using on each sh csh ksh zsh bash etc

41886990
spaces	linefeed
i m guessing that the blank spaces that you re referring to is at the end of the file not somewhere interspersed within the other lines
if that is the case i suspect it s because the trim command that you use when printing the contents of the snewtext variable to the file does not remove the last carriage return linefeed pair at the end of the string

41889631
swift	objective-c
swift 2.x uiapplication.sharedapplication .openurl nsurl string uiapplicationopensettingsurlstring
objective-c update just realised you want to limit functionality of your app should user not have required services enabled

41891320
google-chrome	firefox
this one button is added though an entry in your manifest.json google-chrome which can be a browser_action google-chrome a page_action google-chrome or a sidebar_action see below under firefox only
not available on google-chrome add context menu entries google-chrome

41891320
google-chrome	firefox
not available on google-chrome add context menu entries google-chrome
these are added though javascript api calls. on firefox you can add context menu entries for tabs in the tabbar and to your browser_action

41891320
opera	firefox
firefox only some also available in opera add a sidebar that is not part of the web page s content
this is done through the manifest.json sidebar_action entry and the sidbaraction api available in firefox 54+ and opera

41891320
google-chrome	firefox
you can also create a ui that exists within pages using content scripts google-chrome within its own window google-chrome or a tab tabs.create google-chrome but such things are not actually a part of the browser ui
if you are coming from a firefox add-on background this will often require you to re-think how you present your add-on s user interface in order to fit within this much more limited paradigm

41892081
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has not showing the good information.
firefox and ie indicate the service that causes the issue slimloadingbarservice

41894343
satellite	altitude
so long as you are not worried about price power and to a certain extend size then your sensors can communicate from anywhere using satellite links
there are also hap - high altitude platforms

41894711
stateless	stateful
what complicates it now is that you will always have to include a partitionkey when you talk to your stateless services
it might not make sense in the same way it does for a stateful service as there is no expected state but your selection of partition key should be evenly distributed to even the load

41898095
mathml	mathjax
the math rendering is beautiful because it uses mathjax and mathjax .org is an open-source javascript display engine for latex mathml and asciimath notation that works in all modern browsers. most of the standard ams latex code seems to work fine align etc
it is called simple mathjax probably because it doesn t have the ambition of the mw mathjax extension to process all latex and tex facilities like numbering equations and process tex macros but it uses the original javascript cdn of mathjax.org and therefore is very simple to install and to use for short mathematical texts

41900486
apache	nginx
note that this directive is meant to be used when the request is meant to be passed in http over tcp form to a subsequent http server running on the specified port apache tomcat jetty etc
php and hence laravel can be run by nginx itself and doesn t require a separate server so your proxy_pass setup is likely a mistake and should have been an appropriate fastcgi_pass set of directives instead the normal way php is executed from within nginx

41901773
viewdidload	viewdidappear
therefore i put the time critical work item repeat loop into the global queue not the main queue as an asynchronous work item within that work item i ll dispatch the progress bar updates into the main queue to be executed in the main thread at the end when everything is done i dismiss the uialertcontroller you only need the first dispatch when your alert view is shown from a method like viewdidload or viewwillappear from a point in time when the view isn t displayed yet
if you call it from a button callback or viewdidappear view is visible you could just skip that outer dispatch

41906553
swift	objective-c
also see cannot import firebase in swift app
if you look at the bridging header grocr-bridging-header.h they import the framework there objective-c #imports that happen in the bridging header are global across swift files in the project

41907475
build.gradle	gradlew
you do not need any additional commands in build.gradle when including prebuilt libraries
the layout of jnilibs you can find more information about the structure in the android gradlew plugin user guide

41907896
octal	binary
number | decimal value | binary --------- ----------------------- decimal 111 | 111 | 1101111 octal 011 | 9 | 0001001 so and to check it out use integer.tobinarystring code on ideone
you re specifying the numbers as decimal and octal not as binary as you assume

41910342
punctuation	words
many such systems use spaces or punctuation to explicitly separate words and soft wrap opportunities can be identified by these characters
scripts such as thai lao and khmer however do not use spaces or punctuation to separate words

41910342
spaces	delimiter	punctuation	words
scripts such as thai lao and khmer however do not use spaces or punctuation to separate words
although the zero width space u+200b can be used as an explicit words delimiter in these scripts this practice is not common

41912046
google-chrome	firefox
i have struggled with this same problem ubuntu 16.04 bluefish editor firefox google-chrome
solution clear browsing data in google-chrome settings advanced settings clear browsing data in firefox open menu image top right tool bar preferences advanced look for this image in the menu cached web content click the button clear now . browser s cache the .css file and if it has not changed they usually won t reload it

41914187
division	addition
if the random number is n and your ranges have size r then the number of the range is in python code n r + 1 note that is an integer division which is done in different ways in various programming languages
most languages do not need those parentheses since order-of-operations will do the division before the addition

41915228
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
opera and google-chrome doesn t save cookies if there is no domain and http communication
knowing the above your options are use ie yuck or firefox you can try running opera with --enable-file-cookies flag this works on google-chrome for me but not sure about opera serve your file over http server

41916519
matlabpool	parfor
the reason that you don t get any speed increase by calling matlabpool before calling arrayfun is that just the act of creating multiple workers doesn t make all code utilize these workers to perform calculations
if you want to exploit the pool of workers you need to explicitly parallelize your code with parfor related info here

41921058
hex	binary
you can t directly search for bytearrays in bytearrays with in so convert them to a string containing fixed length hex representations as substrings as shown
in python 3 you ll get bytes from a binary read rather than a string. no need to convert it to a string by str. print will try to convert bytes to something human readable. if you don t want that convert your bytes to hex representations of the integer values of the bytes by output as redirected from the console b x00g x00 x13 x00 x00 xb0 0x00x470x400x00x130x00x00xb0 you can t search in abytes directly with the in operator since abytes isn t a string but an array of bytes

41924253
boost	allocator
boost s flat_map is a binary-tree-based map implementation except that that binary tree is stored as a sorted vector of key-value pairs
you can basically figure out the answers regarding performance relative to an std map by yourself based on that fact iterating the map or a large part of it should be super-fast relatively lookup should typically be relatively fast adding or removing values is theoretically much slower but in practice - assuming your key and value types are small and the number of map elements not very high - probably comparable in speed or even better on small maps - often no allocator is necessary on insert etc

41925535
onclick	onchange
you cannot call onclick method on
instead you should use onchange method on see react docs like this then on onchange event you can set your state to the selected option

41928094
rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtcp	rtsp	rtcp
uses rtp packetizer to create rtp packets from encoded audio frames uses a transport layer such as udp to send these packets protocols such as rtsp provides the necessary signaling information to provide better stream information
usually rtp itself isn t enough as things such as congestion control feedback dynamic bit rate are handled with the help of rtcp

41928094
rtp	rtcp
usually rtp itself isn t enough as things such as congestion control feedback dynamic bit rate are handled with the help of rtcp
anyway in order to store the incoming stream you need to do the following use a rtp depacketizer to get the encoded audio frames out of it

41930993
google-chrome	firefox
if the line-height is not a whole number of pixels google-chrome rounds the value and uses that
firefox apparently remembers the fraction and uses that when calculating the next one

41938460
ubuntu	debian
pinning is a process that allows you to remain on a stable release of ubuntu or any other debian system while grabbing packages from a more recent version
note however that the processes described below will only work if things like libc6 versions match so you should probably not do this on an ubuntu system

41941056
required	placeholder
here is a more modern solution so it s not specific to the first option but rather an invalid option and required no js to show only the title placeholder option as grey whereas the rest appear normal
the invalid selector on the select only works on an option if the select box is required and the selected option s value is empty so you can style it as you would a text box s placeholder text

41941135
bash	tcsh
if the -s option is not given the bash conventions are used
valid arguments are currently sh bash csh and tcsh . the second problem is that you re just assigning to a variable which means that gets the value -o test.txt -s -- from your example which gets processed in a single loop

41941575
ssms	sqlcmd
in ssms this is what the red square does during query execution
sqlcmd doesn t expose any way to cancel a running request though

41942717
alloca	malloc
not to say that you should never use it but some times alloca leads to more overhead than it releaves frome
actually alloca is not guaranteed to use the stack. indeed the gcc-2.95 implementation of alloca allocates memory from the heap using malloc itself

41943274
persistent	transient
it has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned
transient instances will be destroyed by the garbage collector if the application does not hold a reference anymore

udp	tcp
things might become more complicated on high level considering the following era of https means you can t easily observe http content in traces so tcp.len might be the highest option some data audio video is transferred over different protocol stack ip - udp - rtp
what happens when you connects to server and requests some simple page server application generates requested data string and passes it to http layer http layer generates necessary header according to rfc specifies http version status code content type etc prepends it to generated data and pass everything to tcp layer tcp layer may break data into more than one pieces not our case message is already too small and prepend necessary info for transport layer to each piece src dst port number sequence number some flags checksum etc then passes it to ip level ip layer prepends necessary info for routing source dest addresses ttl and other stuff then passes it to lower layer ethernet ethernet adds its part mac addresses maybe vlan tags and pushes all to physical device resulted data is sent byte-by-byte from server s nic to network so your question is actually up to you

factors	mean
add as a valid input update alphabet2 to provide reverse lookup and change the mod factors from 26 to 27 to account for new character or validate your input beforehand
trim spaces replace spaces convert uppercase to lowercase strip characters not in valid range to trim your input to only include valid letters in the alphabet you could try note that doing this mean losing information from the original message another bug the line should be

41948119
knitr	latex
this doesn t really have anything to do with knitr or r it s all about inserting an underscore in latex
the simplest way to do that is to put it in a verb command after knitr runs this gets turned into and that displays what you probably want you could change the sanitize function to add the verb wrapper if you want

comparator	comparable
shipdetail should be defined as follows and not comparator s are objects-algorithms which provide service of comparison of other objects while comparable s are objects which themselves allow comparing them to other kind of objects
shipdetail is not comparable to itself

41953049
spaces	delimiter
having extra spaces between the delimiter and enclosure characters apparently doesn t sit well with the step
the trim function looks inside the enclosure to trim spaces not outside

imagemagick	libjpeg
if you do not need this functionality or if you are happy to let cimg use your already-installed imagemagick to read write jpeg images do nothing
if you want to use cimg s built-in ability to read write jpeg images you need to #define cimg_use_jpeg 1 before you include cimg.h and you need to set the header include path for libjpeg and link with libjpeg

git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

41960765
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
from your screenshot i can see that you most probably used a tool that is based on git-svn like e

git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

build.gradle	gradlew
if not update the version in build.gradle accordingly
please check your gradlew verson in build.gradle

41963723
memcpy	memmove
you showed that you the laptop systems do the memcpy benchmark in about 120 ms while the server parts take around 300 ms
you also showed that this slowness mostly is not fundamental since you were able to use memmove and your hand-rolled-memcpy hereafter hrm to achieve a time of about 160 ms much closer but still slower than the laptop performance

41963723
memcpy	memmove
the libc version of memcpy you are using uses them but memmove does not
you confirmed as much with your naive memcpy which also doesn t use them as well as my configuring asmlib both to use the streaming stores slow and not fast

41965283
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this could be contributing to your problem since viewdidload is for one-time-init stuff
you should not be calling super viewdidload from the viewwillappear handler

swift	objective-c
dr if your swift project uses an objective-c framework make sure that the framework headers are not included in your swift project s bridging header
i had a similar issue with a swift project which included an objective-c framework

41965896
swift	objective-c
i had a similar issue with a swift project which included an objective-c framework
i had imported the framework in my swift project using import obj-c-framework additionally i had also created a bridging-header file in the swift project and included the obj-c-framework header using this was causing the xcode debugger to always show could not resolve type when printing objects in breakpoints

scheme	racket	lisp	racket
clojure that don t have dotted pairs use a element while common lisp does dotted in structures but not as a parameter specification since it supports more features than scheme and clojure and thus use special keywords to express it instead
the second is #lang racket specific and is indeed used to support infix

41968830
queue	fifo
many queue either open-source rabbitmq activemq or commercial aws sqs support fifo ordering
however the fifo guarantee inside the queue is not enough since the messages sent by a single client could be delivered to the queue in different order due to asynchronicity issues in the network unless you are using a single not-distributed queue and tcp which guarantees ordered delivery

queue	fifo
however the fifo guarantee inside the queue is not enough since the messages sent by a single client could be delivered to the queue in different order due to asynchronicity issues in the network unless you are using a single not-distributed queue and tcp which guarantees ordered delivery
however you could implement fifo ordering on the client side

41970402
firefox	safari
this is safari you can reduce that row gap by lowering height to let s say 200px but firefox will not let you impact height only and will reduce width as well so you could try to workaround that gap by removing on the svg and re-styling it or leave it in all browsers with a moderate gap
the issue lies on the svg percentage since they are floating dimensions are not being considered change it to desired px but note not all browsers render svgs the same here s a code pen that maintains the layout in all browsers although firefox has a bit more margin-bottom due to svg height

super	extends
when you call super like super args in the extends class it calls the constructor of the extended class
you can also call the other member functions of the extended class with super.methods args not super args

ubuntu	linux
you assume that the only way for me to run unix commands is to download ubuntu bash for windows 10 but it s not correct
a rough search with the keyword run linux command in windows leads us to various solutions above all two as stated here run bash shell from windows 10 install cygwin

super	self
if you follow the code you will understand that the get_form method of modeladmin super class does not return any thing
hence you have to access all form instances from self

hive	hdfs
hadoop distcp hdfs namenode1 port1 hive data hdfs namenode2 port2 hive data hive s export and import do not have options for databases
migration of schema assuming hive metastore is stored in mysql take the dump of the metastore database replace the cluster1 fs uri with cluster2 s fs uri sed -i s_hdfs namenode1 port1_hdfs namenode2 port2_g metastore.sql move the dump to the target cluster and restore it

ubuntu	debian
if you want installable .deb package instead of putting everything to usr local do this this will download curl sources with debian ubuntu build files and patches
edit file debian control add line libc-ares-dev to build-depends edit file debian rules remove --enable-threaded-resolver and add --enable-ares to configure_args optional increase version number in the first line of debian changelog for example 7.38.0-4+deb8u5 to 7.38.0-4+deb8u6 this way your package will not get overwritten when you install updates to your system

41987136
dictionary	map
any keys that are not present will return nan via this method so beware you can also supply just the dictionary itself but this appears to introduce a bit of overhead timings some timing comparisons using your example data timeit series.map dictionary.get 10000 loops best of 3 124 µs per loop timeit series.map lambda x dictionary.get x x 10000 loops best of 3 150 µs per loop timeit series.map dictionary 100 loops best of 3 5.45 ms per loop timeit series.replace dictionary 1 loop best of 3 1.23 s per loop
it looks like replace has a bit of overhead and explicitly telling the series what to do via map yields the best performance if you re sure that all keys are in your dictionary you can get a very slight performance boost by not creating a lambda and directly supplying the dictionary.get function

41987583
bufferedreader	ioexception
it shouldn t you should use the same bufferedreader for the life of the socket otherwise you can lose data
socket.isclosed and socket.isconnected don t do what you think they do the correct loop termination condition is readline returning null or throwing an ioexception capping the number of concurrent connections can t possibly achieve anything if the clients never disconnect

41988845
ssl	https
third off you are not actually handing your ssl keys here to socket.io at all
you re passing them to the https module so it can create your server

google-chrome	firefox
the mdn examples of collections of primitive types worked on firefox but not on google-chrome
to have an output on google-chrome for your example what you could do is put the transportation variable inside its own array so that google-chrome will print the table

rvm	bundler
the solution was to remove all traces of the issue rvm implode from there i did a fresh install of rvm using closed and reopened the terminal
installed ruby updated the gem manager changed to the global gemset using then updated all gems using from here i installed bundler and nokogiri not sure if it is a dependent for openssl but wasn t taking chances using and gem install nokogiri from here i made a new gemset to install rails in using then i installed the latest version of rails using not wanting to take chances at this point i removed openssl using gem uninstall openssl then reinstalled it with gem install openssl lastly i closed my terminal reopened it and voila it worked

hive	hdfs
flink does not support direct connections to hive as it is supported in spark with sql context
but there is a simple way of analyzing data in hive table in flink using flink table api what you need to do is first get the exact hdfs location of the hive table you wish to analyze with flink hdfs app hive warehouse mydb mytable then you read data then you need to create a table from the dataset and then register it with the tableenvironment and now you are all set to query this table using table api syntax
