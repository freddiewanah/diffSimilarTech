inline	inlining
next if you want to mark a function as inline there s no reason not to do it in debug builds as well
the inline keyword has almost nothing to do with the compiler actually inlining functions

912729
inline	inlining
and that makes it easire for the compiler to inline calls to the function
finally inlining is not always a performance improvement

915822
fileoutputstream	filewriter
i suspect it is an oversight - note that filewriter is a subclassing of outputstreamwriter that does nothing except pass a fileoutputstream to the superclass constructor
note also that you should almost never use filewriter since it does not allow you to specify the encoding

916640
equals	gethashcode
just a quick list at a glance you should be overriding gethashcode as well as equals
your equals override shouldn t perform a cast unconditionally as that will throw an exception if the object is of the wrong type

916923
icomparable	compareto
therefore we must have an icomparable constraint now the class will compile and work correctly as an array of t is valid for array.sort and there is a valid .compareto method defined in the interface
however if you are sure that you will not want to use your class with a type that does not also implement the icomparable interface you can extend your constraint to this means that when areequal is called it will use the faster generic compareto method and you will see a performance benefit at the expense of not being able to use it with old .net 1.0 types

917574
division	modulo
if monthcount is a calculated value which counts the number of months since a specific dec 31 and mod is modulo division output the remainder after dividing in sql server for example you could use the datediff function in sql server the percent sign is the modulo this will group all the record into buckets which each contain six months of data
correction had it backwards need to use modulo not integer division - sorry.

919047
calloc	malloc
or alternately use calloc which will zero out the memory
the value returned by malloc is not guaranteed to be set to any specific value

920371
prepare	execute
if you re using prepare statements do the following if you re not using prepare statements do the following when you call executeupdate stmt.executeupdate sql statement.return_generated_keys
after you execute your statement you can call this will give you a result set that contains any of the keys that were generated

920673
ienumerable	ilist
on the other hand if you are exposing a property for external consumption then do so with the most complex type ilist or icollection instead of ienumerable since this gives the client the most flexibility in the way they use the object
i m finding the conversation between myself and drjokepu in the comments fascinating but i also appreciate that this isn t supposed to be a discussion forum so i ll edit my answer to further outline the reasons behind my choice to buck the trend and suggest that you expose it as an ilist well a list actually as you ll see

924105
setinterval	settimeout
edit you can also call the function with setinterval if you need to stop the loop later just do this
this should work how it works this line makes an ajax call to yourpage.php and fills the div with the results of that page note that the result of calling yourpage should not be a whole page but just a snippet settimeout arguments.callee 10000 settimeout schedules a function call in the future in this case 10 seconds

924349
octree	quadtree
i would probably build an octree in euler geocentric xyz space because that allows me to get true distance not warped lat lon distance
however in practice a quadtree in lat lon space will probably work well enough

927797
redmine	trac
i know redmine has an additional feature that checks for these bug numbers in the commit logs and attaches the revision to the bug so you can see from the bug all the revisions that were involved in fixing it
i d be suprised if trac doesn t have something similar

930728
vbscript	jscript
edit following further clarification in question javascript isn t or rather wasn t the only language supported by browsers back in the internet explorer dark ages you could choose between javascript or vbscript to run in ie
technically ie didn t even run javascript - it ran jscript mainly to avoid having to pay sun for the word java oracle still own the name javascript

931176
lisp	scheme
then after reading and asking a lot i ended up choosing common lisp
not because it s better than scheme in an absolute way but because it had features i knew i d probably use in the next 2-3 years in my projects a very efficient compiler for numerical computation sbcl the condition system and.

931197
lisp	scheme
cs teachers at colleges and universities today particularly the young ones were educated using java c and c++ and they probably learnt either scheme or common lisp in a course called comparative studies of programming language or programming paradigms which was probably taught by someone who doesn t like any lisp language and taught them about functions lists symbols and higher-order functions
period. then they end up teaching what they learned lisp is one programming language lisp is interpreted lisp is slow lisp is an ai language the last time i checked robert sebesta s book it still claimed that -- but there is a new edition so he may have fixed this lisp has no oo support

931286
postgresql	mysql
all this is irrelevant to postgresql
not only is the straight_join syntax keyword specific to mysql but its function of influencing the internals of the optimizer is too

932360
postgresql	mysql
edit so it seems the only possible need for full-text search might be on description and that looks like it s probably limited enough that either mysql 5.1 or postgresql 8.3 will serve it well
me i have a sweet spot for postgresql even though i m reasonably expert at mysql too but that s a general preference not specifically connected to full-text search issues

932360
postgresql	mysql
me i have a sweet spot for postgresql even though i m reasonably expert at mysql too but that s a general preference not specifically connected to full-text search issues
this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysql full-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene

934267
innodb	myisam
i ve never heard of mysql with innodb disabled even by cheapest of the hosters
make sure your tables use innodb engine myisam does not support transactions

934267
innodb	myisam
make sure your tables use innodb engine myisam does not support transactions
comment update innodb is one of two major storage engines used by mysql the other one being myisam

934570
inline	inlining
sometimes the compiler can do a better job than you can possibly do at choosing what to inline especially in complex architectures like ia64 a compiler might use its own heuristics to decide that despite the hint inlining will not improve performance
compilers usually disable inlining in debug builds because they make debugging harder

934570
inline	inlining
the compiler is not required to inline the function
there are a number of reasons why any compiler might decide to ignore an inline hint a compiler might be simple and not support inlining a compiler might use an internal algorithm to decide on what to inline and ignore the hints

935945
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i know that when you assign a delegate to a uinavigationcontroller the component uiviewcontroller delegate methods are not called
it seems likely that the same is true of uitabbarcontroller

937376
queue	fifo
you should probably wrap it to protect the integrity of the queue fifo only
it would not be hard to wrap a list and do a removeat 0 when you want to pop an item out of the queue

937376
queue	fifo
it would not be hard to wrap a list and do a removeat 0 when you want to pop an item out of the queue
that would give you fifo and let you index in anywhere you want

937696
floating-point	fractions
short answer python uses binary arithmetic for floating-point numbers not decimal arithmetic
decimal fractions are not exactly representable in binary

937728
base	fractions
if you re familiar with the idea that the number thirteen point two is written in base ten as 13.2 because it s 10 1 1 + 10 0 3 + 10 -1 2 then try to do the same thing with a base of 2 instead of 10 for the number 173.2
here s the whole part 1 2 7 + 0 2 6 + 1 2 5 + 0 2 4 + 1 2 3 + 1 2 2 + 0 2 1 + 0 2 0 now here s the start fractions part 0 2 -1 + 0 2 -2 + 1 2 -3 that s .125 which isn t yet 2 10ths so we need more additions that are of the form 1 2 -n we can carry this out a bit further with 1 2 -4 + 1 2 -7 which gets us a bit closer .

939155
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
p invoke can be used in a cross platform way once you have your pcm data using a ogg c lib or managed code something like this of course there are licencing issues with mp3 you will need a way to play it unfortunatly .net does not provide any direct assess to your sound card or methods to play streaming audio
you could convert the ogg files to pcm at startup and then use system.media.soundplayer to play the wav files generated

939427
implements	extends
namevaluecollection does not directly implements the icollection interface
instead namevaluecollection extends nameobjectcollectionbase

939808
calloc	malloc
calloc does set the entire buffer to 0 but i can t imagine it being noticeably faster than malloc+memset
allocating memory via new or malloc does not clear it

945009
mp3	ogg
you need a mp3 decoder and a ogg encoder and a little bit of glue code around that opening files setting up the codecs piping raw audio data around ect. for the mp3 decoder i suggest that you take a look at the liblame library or use this decoding lib as a starting point
for ogg there aren t many choices

945533
postgresql	mysql
you have to use an other database like postgresql to get real blob support sorry
i do not know which client api you use but when trying to use blobs from own java and objective-c clients it seems mysql does not really support streaming of blobs

945832
perforce	svn
as i see it the main reasons for using perforce are mature merge tracking
svn isn t quite there yet

947775
ubuntu	opensuse
ubuntu doesn t have mono 2.4 packages yet
if you require 100 up-to-date packages your best bet is to use opensuse

948313
implements	extends
if for some reason that i can t think of you re creating a custom collection class that does not relate to java.util.collection or java.util.map in any way you should still implements iterable so people can use your class in for loops
if you re writing your own collection class and you re extends any of the existing classes or implementing any of the collections framework interfaces you basically have no choice but to use iterator

950815
super	implements
not super convenient but rather quick
the quickest way for me is usually to type a using block using snippets for an instance of the type in which case you will get an error notification if the type does not implements idisposable

951152
strcpy	strncpy
if the call-site for strcpy or strcpy_mine doesn t know the size of the output buffer you need to search backwards in the code for the location that allocates the buffer and pass the size all the way down to the strcpy site
basically you can t write a drop in replacement for strcpy that takes the same arguments and hope to avoid the problems that produced strncpy in the first place and better replacements beyond that

951156
strcpy	strncpy
one challenge however is that some of your existing code that calls strcpy may not know the size of the buffer either
you could use the same parameter list as strncpy for your strcpy_mine but write it so that it always null terminates the result

951368
postgresql	mysql
postgresql s most useful features which mysql lacks in my opinion are generate_series and set returning functions in general ability to use correlated values in limit and offset clauses custom aggregates distinct on clause more advanced join methods merge join and hash join you can do wonders with them
postgresql code also often looks more elegant note that looks doesn t mean performs since you can use nice casting syntax nice record types and these kinds of stuff

951991
rsa	aes
you can compromise a cipher rsa aes..etc but this does not necessarily translate into ssl itself being broken in my view the most practical crypto attacks on ssl are side-channel attacks against specific ciphers
aes in particular is known to be vulnerable against timing attacks

952708
serializable	deserialization
your result is and that is not directly serializable
you ll have to wrap it a minimal approach and then the deserialization goes like but note that you will not be comparing the xml in any way not practical

953850
fgets	fread
if the file is unicode you cannot read it with fgets you need to use fgetws or fread
unicode characters may have zero bytes bytes with a value of zero which will confuse fgets

954330
lisp	scheme
scheme macros hygienic macros are completely different from traditional lisp macros
some implementations of scheme offer lisp macros in addition to scheme macros but this is not required by the scheme standard

954330
lisp	scheme
some implementations of scheme offer lisp macros in addition to scheme macros but this is not required by the scheme standard
i would recommend you look for instructional materials specific to scheme macros if you would like to learn about that style of macro

956489
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
if you set he background colour of the uiscrollview to be celarcolor the background image will show through - so you have a view heirarchy like uiwindow uiview ----- your background here uiscrollview scrolling subviews ----- high score table here if you draw your highscore table in the scrolling subviews using coregraphics the answer in the question you linked to will also work
it s not quite clear to me what you re asking but if you want the scrollview contents to scroll over a static image you simply need to add a uiview or more likely a uiimageview to your superview and then add your uiscrollview to that

958363
daemons	systemd
a daemons or daemons is a process that is started by the systemd when it starts up it runs till shutdown no user asked for it explicitly
so by definition it is not part of a user interaction but belongs to the systemd

959347
nunit	mstest
adding testdriven.net or resharper to your toolset allows you to run nunit easily within vs - but they aren t free if that s a problem you can try nunitit
mstest isn t of course portable and it s tied to visual studio

959368
nunit	mstest
nunit really is supported everywhere
our 200+ developer shop just moved away from mstest to nunit and so far we ve not encountered issues with lack of tool support in fact rather the opposite it seems that the support infrastructure around nunit is very extensive

959491
postgresql	mysql
as far as i know there is not direct support of such feature in sqlite or postgresql so i use just for them but remember this is not real autoincrement and may create not unique keys if you remove something from the table
mysql supports this create table history id integer not null version integer auto_increment not null content text not null primary key id version

959738
geany	scite	geany	notepad++
if not i ve found geany to be a nice light easy-to-use editor with good python support though i use emacs myself because i know it
other people like scite notepad++ or any of a slew of others

960774
sum	coalesce
i m pretty sure the linker will coalesce equivalent strings so the total will be less than the sum of the parts for these sections but i guess typically not by much
i would also expect your relocation and symbols sections to be less than the sum of the parts

961271
trie	dawg
somewhat of a tangent but if you are super worried about the number of nodes in your trie you may look at joining your word suffixes too
i d take a look at the dawg directed acyclic word graph idea the downside of these is that they aren t very dynamic and creating them can be difficult

962164
vsto	add-in
as far as i know you cannot directly create udfs in vsto
see paul stubbs article how to create excel udfs in vsto managed code where he uses a vba add-in to expose vba udfs which in turn call his managed udfs written in vsto

962164
vsto	add-in
see paul stubbs article how to create excel udfs in vsto managed code where he uses a vba add-in to expose vba udfs which in turn call his managed udfs written in vsto
you can use managed code to create udfs however when not using vsto

962823
client-side	server-side
create a client-side implementation of the stock class there are a couple of things to keep in mind about gwt server-side classes can import client-side classes but not vice-versa usually
the client-side can t import any google app engine libraries com.google.appengine.api.users.user due to both items above the client can never implement the stock class that we created in com.google.gwt.sample.stockwatcher.server

962890
quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
it s easy to see that mergesort does as it s symmetric but reasoning about something like bubblesort or more importantly quicksort or heapsort is not
the bottom line as long as sort uses mergesort you should be reasonably safe except in corner cases at least i m hoping that 2 c n

963310
innodb	myisam
here s a checklist of things that must be true before foreign keys can work innodb storage engine must be enabled
both tables must use the innodb storage engine myisam doesn t support referential integrity constraints

963326
uptime	reboot
caveats it doesn t work with all oss and you ve got to track servers over time to get accurate uptime data
netcraft does this see here for a vague description the uptime as presented in these reports is the time since last reboot of the front end computer or computers that are hosting a site

964014
perforce	svn
it s been some years since i last time used perforce but i remember it certainly didn t like anyone else messing with its workspaces
svn doesn t like it either

964555
mp3	wav
it s free runs on the mac and will convert your waves files to mp3 or a host of other formats
i wouldn t use wav

965351
uiview	subviews
i m not sure what you mean by in the background but if you simply want the uiwebview to not be visible this property is available on all uiview objects straght from the class reference a hidden view disappears from its window and does not receive input events
it remains in its superview s list of subviews however and participates in autoresizing as usual

966142
octal	hex
without the x the values are in octal which isn t nearly as popular or understandable nowadays. alternatively should work notice that the null termination has to be included when initializing like this
probably the easiest in c is to use the hex escape notation x01 x02 x03 x04

966198
super	extends
the takeaway from this example is super class initialization cannot depend on the child class being completely initialized
if ftw did not extends wtf then it would be ok to assume that any initialization specified at the field definition will be done before the constructor is called

966954
fseek	fread
from the documentation for fopen if you open a file in update mode with a permission value that includes + you must call fseek or frewind between read and write operations
for example you cannot call fread followed by fwrite or fwrite followed by fread unless you call fseek or frewind between them

966954
fseek	fread
for example you cannot call fread followed by fwrite or fwrite followed by fread unless you call fseek or frewind between them
in short you need to call fseek before you call fwrite

967713
prepare	execute
however it doesn t accommodate for the need of prepare statements
when repeat executions of a statement with different parameter sets is not directly sequential executemany will perform just as well as execute

969325
cvs	svn
during the conversion the cvs repository should be frozen and after which everybody should use the svn repository
the tool isn t suited for gradually moving parts of the cvs to the svn

969325
cvs	svn
the tool isn t suited for gradually moving parts of the cvs to the svn
it doesn t create a persistent record of which cvs version relates to which svn revision number

969325
cvs	svn
it doesn t create a persistent record of which cvs version relates to which svn revision number
thus if you would convert only parts of the cvs at the time you will lose branching information

971581
inline	inlining
this function is not thread-safe regardless whether the compiler inline it or not
inlining and thread safety are orthogonal unrelated concepts

974012
cvs	svn
exactly subversion is designed to support concurrent access via multiple protocols something which causes major problems with cvs
not only can you use http and svn but also file if you happen to be working locally on the machine for example with a continuous integration tool or other post-commit hook svn+ssh etc

975155
actionscript	mxml
you can also specify more calls in mxml like you can even pass the event parameter to your method whatever you write in the value of the mxml event not sure it s the right term to use will become the body of the generated handler for the actionscript event
the reason is that in mxml what you write isn t actually the handler is what gets executed in the handler

975194
vb6	vba
this knowledgebase article explains how to do it from vba it s exactly the same in vb6
the references command is on the project menu in vb6 not the tools menu i think that s the only difference

976307
jboss	glassfish
a couple general containers for dummies guidelines though use either tomcat or jboss move on and focus on writing a good application
i see a strong up-vote for glassfish but i d caution that it might not have the critical mass you d be comfortable with

976475
multiplying	addition
if the integer i1 is part of the sum add it with its corresponding zero immediately to the left and if i1 is not part of the sum multiplying it
between each zero and the term to the right insert an addition sign

977839
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby ironpython are dynamically typed interpreted languages
i believe ironpython does additionally support compilation but i m not 100 sure and less about ruby

977953
directx	gdi
i m quite sure you can use that method via managed directx from c#
edit after some more research and googling i come to the conclusion that drawing via gdi doesn t happen in realtime and even if you re drawing in the exact right moment it might actually happen too late and you will have tearing

980259
pascal	delphi
turbo pascal was one of the if not the main compilers of the dos era and delphi is still the second most sold ide in the world after visual studio so i think the dead language and teaching language bits are a bit exaggerated
note that older 1.0.x versions of the free pascal compiler sources were effectively turbo pascal compatible as in could be debugged with tp which demonstrates basic pascal capabilities

980929
udp	tcp
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag
the main difference between the two is that udp is fire and forget meaning that it doesn t bother to check to see if the message actually arrived at its destination

984386
udp	tcp
for most large scale mmo s for isntance udp and reliablity udp are the means of communication and reliability
all rudp does is add a smaller portion of tcp ip to validate and order certain messages but not all

984618
jar	war
if the jsps are part of a war that is part of an ear that is being deployed as a jar then i m not clear why your jsps are not being recompiled
if not couldn t you touch the jsps as part of building the war ear before deploying

987096
fseek	fread
fseek on data in a variable doesn t make sense
fseek just positions the file handle to the specified offset so the next fread call starts reading from that offset

987648
matlab	simulink
matlab guis and the simulink editor rely on incompatible technology
you will not be able to embed the simulink editor into a matlab gui

987922
rdf	owl
owl in general is about entailments given a set of rdf not about validation especially with regards to structure
there is no way in owl 1.1 to know if a node is anonymous or not

989767
jax-ws	saaj
actually cxf does not use javax.xml.soap saaj underneath unless its required to do so jax-ws handlers are present provider type things etc....
in general using saaj will be slower than cxf since it doesn t allow streaming which cxf would normally do

990826
realloc	calloc
it is also true for pod types declared at global scope with one exception it is not true for local variables or for data allocated with malloc or realloc
it is true for calloc since calloc explicitly zeros out the memory it allocates

990830
innodb	myisam
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out
however if you are doing a mixture of reads and writes depending on the mixture then innodb can offer serious performance improvements because it doesn t have to lock the entire table to do a write

992232
boost	stl
boost enjoys a near stl status due to the number of people on the c++ standards committee who are also boost developers
poco and ace do not enjoy that benefit and from my anecdotal experience boost is more widespread

992335
boost	stl
again you should probably only consider poco if it provides some functionality you need and that is not in boost
as rdbound said boost has a near stl status

992589
quicksort	radix-sort
inline quicksort string sorting you can also use compression and encode each letter of your dna into 2 bits before storing into the sort array
radix-sort is not cache conscious and is not the fastest sort algorithm for large sets. you can look at ti7qsort

993069
queue	fifo
conceptually if we have the following elements in the queue and when we remove 1 we decide to add 42 the queue will be as the following as the queue is a fifo fifo data structure this ordering is typical
as noted in the documentation for the queue interface this is not a necessity of a queue

993319
vb6	vba
it doesn t have access to vb.net features so it s more like a modified version of vb6 with add-ons to be able to work on the document like worksheet in vba for excel
it s vba

997066
implements	extends
there are many quality apis for common rdbms and it is usually a good idea to use those unless you have specific requirements that those apis do not implements
a good rule of thumb is to not reinvent the wheel but rather extends it when necessary

999093
implements	extends
when extends the class you may create a static method of the same name but you are not in fact implements a static abstract method
same goes for extends any class with static methods

999255
postgresql	mysql
also look at the native postgresql types point lseg box path polygon and circle if you want to understand more about how postgis works and why its 2d feature implementers have a shorter row to hoe in general
mysql does not implement a lot of spatial queries -- i don t know for sure about contains but there are ways of approximating it and other functions

999497
jruby	mri
so the only real performance difference is the fact that your mri yarv ruby applications won t be able to utilize all of your processor cores but your jruby applications will happily do so
however if that isn t an issue mri s threads are theoretically i haven t tested this a little faster because they are green threads which use fewer system resources

1001017
onclick	onchange
clicking in the autocomplete box does not however fire the onclick event
2 the onchange event fires as soon as focus is lost if the content has changed

1001323
entity-relationship	diagram
while not primarily a database tool it can reverse-engineer a database into an entity-relationship model then you can create one or more diagram from that model
it has a nice add related elements command that allows you to create a new diagram to focus on one entity

1003003
implements	extends
interfaces are not inherited rather they specify what you have to implements to properly fulfill the interface definition
inheritance implies a possible change in behavior - parent class defines something child class extends that

1004730
g++	gcc
it isn t suitable because it relies on a very heavy environment consisting of ptrace chroot and an outbound firewall however i found there a few g++ safety switches which i thought i d share here gcc 4.1.2 flags -o -fmessage-length 0 -fno-merge-constants -fstrict-aliasing -fstack-protector-all g++ 4.1.2 flags -o -std c++98 -pedantic-errors -wfatal-errors -werror -wall -wextra -wno-missing-field-initializers -wwrite-strings -wno-deprecated -wno-unused -wno-non-virtual-dtor -wno-variadic-macros -fmessage-length 0 -ftemplate-depth-128 -fno-merge-constants -fno-nonansi-builtins -fno-gnu-keywords -fno-elide-constructors -fstrict-aliasing -fstack-protector-all -winvalid-pch the options are explained in the gcc manual what really caught my eye was the stack-protector flag
i believe it is a merge of this ibm research project stack-smashing protector with the official gcc

1005136
coalesce	isnull
all the cool people use coalesce instead of isnull
coalesce is portable and you can have as many parameters as you want not just two

1005238
django	turbogears
having picked raw psycopg2 or sqlalchemy as the technology for my data-access layer that would rule out django which in my experience only works well with its own orm -- but that s not suitable for a project of such db complexity imnsho
i d go with werkzeug personally as the framework most suitable for highly complex projects requiring ridiculous amounts of flexibility and power -- though pylons and turbogears 2 on top of it may be acceptable as a fall-back if the team just doesn t have the web app experience and skill it takes to make truly beautiful music with a flexible framework such as werkzeug

1008628
client-side	server-side
you must create client-side code then have the server side print an invocation of said code
as for server-side redirection applying to the whole window again such can not occur without the same approach

1008666
equals	gethashcode
first off - do not implement equals only in terms of gethashcode - hashcodes will sometimes collide even when objects are not equals
the contract for gethashcode includes the following different hashcodes means that objects are definitely not equals same hashcodes means objects might be equals but possibly might not andrew hare suggested i incorporate his answer i would recommend that you read this solution by our very own jon skeet by the way for a better way to calculate a hashcode

1008807
ssl	https
if it is very important drop the ajax and pick up a ssl certificate and use the https layer
you could make your own ssl certificate for free it wouldn t be trusted by general users but you can trust it

1009015
opera	google-chrome
opera 10 does not support the audio element though it does support an older version of it in the form of an audio object
google-chrome 3 will likely support the audio element

1010631
pascal	delphi
generally the turbo pascal versions were imo.
though some of the additions to the delphi language were not

bazaar	git
if by code management you are referring to file and directories and renaming go with bazaar
if by code management you are looking at content management git is designed to manage just that the staging area for instance allows you to record what current content you want to commit even though you have already begun to make some large modification you end up not wanting to commit in the current branch to be sure re-read linus s original vision for git back in april 2005

bazaar	git
i have used bazaar extensively for personal projects for a couple of years since the 0.8 days but i have switched to git last year and never looked back at least for source code management
i am too lazy to rewrite my own impression but to sum it up bazaar works more consistently across platforms bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes git is immensely more powerful imho

in particular i am convinced that their approach for rename handling and content tracking is the right one for many cases the bazaar revno system is not good imho

onchange	onsubmit
1 a very simple way to handle this is to start with the onchange event the major drawback here is that the textarea will not update until the focus has left the textarea
2 you should be able to adapt the above example to a form validation function that fires on the form s onsubmit event

1017170
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos
if you re using debian or ubuntu something like apt-get install texlive ..will get it installed
redhat or centos need yum install tetex note this needs root permissions so either use su to switch user to root or prefix the commands with sudo if you aren t already logged in as the root user

1017261
komodo	notepad++
padre is getting better but it s currently not quite up there with komodo or epic
that said it is comparable with ultraedit or notepad++ at this point less than a year after the first line of code was written

1018865
alloca	malloc
one of the oss projects i work on uses it extensively and as long as you re not abusing it alloca ing huge values it s fine
once you go past the few hundred bytes mark it s time to use malloc and friends instead

1018867
alloca	malloc
by using alloca you dramatically increase your chances of getting a stack overflow error if you re lucky or an inexplicable crash if you re not
processes only have a limited amount of stack space available - far less than the amount of memory available to malloc

1019433
vim	emacs
gnu emacs microemacs xemacs jed or a vi clone such as elvis ftp www vile vim for vi lovers in general windows or elsewhere vi nvi available from cpan in src misc is yet another vi clone unfortunately not available for windows but in unix platforms you might be interested in trying it out firstly because strictly speaking it is not a vi clone it is the real vi or the new incarnation of it and secondly because you can embed perl inside it to use perl as the scripting language
nvi is not alone in this though at least also vim and vile offer an embedded perl

1019649
inline	inlining
most of the time properties are inline by the jit engine because they are very simple which means most of the time properties act like fields more than they act like functions so they are closer to how fields behave than functions
in the case of properties it doesn t mater if there is ambiguity between a function call and field access because for the greatest part you don t pay the function call cost property getters and setters because of their simplicity are high candidates for inlining which means that cost wise the are closer to fields than function calls

1020038
vim	emacs
after a while you start to compartmentalize the two mentally and you probably won t have much difficulty though i still occasionally wq emacs and c- vim it doesn t happen often enough to be a problem
read the emacs documentation thoroughly

1020038
vim	emacs
you aren t going to forget vim and replace it in your brain with emacs
if you know vim and you learn emacs then you will know both

1021276
mp3	ogg
xiph the people behind ogg vorbis have published a comparison between the leading codecs rm mp3 wma aac and ogg - you can listen and compare each of the codecs
if your data is already in mp3 a lossy format it would not be advisible to convert it particularly to another lossy format

1021749
floating-point	fractions
seconds may be a floating-point value
on operating systems that do not support waiting for fractions of a second floating-point values are rounded down to the nearest integer. if optional arg nodisp is t don t redisplay just wait for input. redisplay does not happen if input is available before it starts

1022646
persistent	transient
i shouldn t need to double the number of model classes just to have transient versions of my objects not when i want them to behave exactly the same sans persistent
yes the other option is to have an in-memory persistent store which houses all of the entities you want to be transient

1028119
actionscript	mxml
for what it s worth as far as i know file size is not increased by using mxml as the mxml is converted to actionscript before the swf is created
so the best answer to your question may be to just go ahead and use mxml

1028276
spaces	delimiter
i can t trim the string because it only removes white spaces and technically this isn t white spaces
it sounds like you have non-tab whitespace characters in your string as well as being tab delimiter

1030112
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it isn t magic it is a uinavigationcontroller that instantiates a uiviewcontroller internally a uitableview that is populated with your address book contacts and sets the uiviewcontroller as its root view
you can indeed create your own similar uinavigationcontroller subclass

1030707
hex	binary	octal	binary
here is a short-list of binary representation topics for study numbering systems binary hex octal decimal ... binary data organization bits nibbles bytes words ... binary arithmetic other binary operations and or xor not shl shr rol ror ... type representation boolean int float struct ... bit fields and packed data finally...here is a nice set of bit twiddling hacks you might find useful
if you are developing lower-level code it is critical that you understand the binary representation of various types

1031386
comparator	comparable
enum doesn t implement but it does implement comparator
so an enum can be the t in a where clause like where t comparator but this gives an error and then i suppose you d like someclass to be comparable

1032488
automake	autotools
edit 2013-08-26 note that an automake project using a subdirectory named using obj is not portable to bsd make
the gnu build system does not use obj directories so the autotools are not designed to support that

1033785
super	implements
the platform is super young though and it ll be worth it to implements in the long run
i wouldn t recommend replacing a traditional user pass system completely right now but it s great for linking accounts and posting wall posts to user feeds which is pretty easy to implements

1035069
move	drag
the jquery ui sortable should allow you to move items up and down within a column it s a little confusing because the jquery site also has a sortable page with a demo that currently doesn t appear to work
you might also need the jquery ui droppable the droppable will allow you to drag and drop from one column to the other

1035308
ssl	https
in addition the use of ssl is necessary to ensure that communication across existing proxies is not broken
one of the big issues with using https is that its considered secure and so most web browsers don t do any caching or at least do very limited caching

1037510
firefox	safari
indeed firebug in firefox shows the computed style for this element as having 0px for marginleft and marginright but this is non-zero in safari
as expected changing from margin-left to marginleft makes no difference nor does accessing the attribute directly like .container_16 not first 0 .style.marginleft because firefox is computing it wrong in the first place

1037909
daemons	systemd
it also should be emphaised that on unix systemd daemons mode of mod_wsgi must be used and you must implement the code monitor described in the documentation
the whole process reloading option will not work for embedded mode of mod_wsgi on unix systemd

1038145
factors	mean
generate standard normal independent deviates and then transform by multiplying by the cholesky factors of the covariance matrix
add in the mean at the end if the mean was not zero

1039669
nexus	artifactory
that said i have never used nexus and cannot really help you with a proper feature comparison
here are some things off the top of my head that i really like about artifactory keep in mind nexus may have these features too nice web 2.0 interface

1039942
lisp	smalltalk
it can be done in smalltalk and in lisp
there are possibly other systems in which this is possible but i m not aware of them. - alan kay creator of smalltalk

1040259
opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
as far as i know opera 9 and webkit safari google-chrome do it on pcs and rumour has it that ff3.5 will also be able
actually since apple added svg support to iphone s safari just half a year ago i m not sure if it works but it s worth a try

1040886
factors	mean
best probably depends on a lot of factors
if by best you mean most performant here are some points to consider xml is not the best way at all binary serialization is far more efficient

1041524
prng	random
in fact performing any additional actions from a number returned by a prng doesn t really increase its randomness and in fact the number can become less random
so my best advice is don t mess around with values returned from a prng

1041539
apache	nginx
thus using keep alive on the apache side is pointless when using nginx in front of it
because though nginx doesn t implement keep alive it should drop the connections promptly as it will have no intention of reusing them so you shouldn t suffer if you do forget to turn of keep alive in apache when using nginx as front end

1041677
cdr	cons
a list is a series of cons cells where each car holds some value and each cdr points to the respective next cell the last cdr pointing to nil
when you write cons a-list x this creates a new cons cell with a reference to a-list in the car and x in the cdr which is most likely not what you want

1044548
lisp	scheme
if you d show me an example of using eval in common lisp i could try to come up with other methods of doing the same thing
i m not a scheme programmer

1045893
daemons	systemd
your code essentially hands off the sending of the message to a queue daemons that runs on the server and sends whatever mails are in the queue in a separate process thereby not holding up your asp script from finishing its execution
persits produces the well-known aspemail com component that comes with a mail queuing systemd that will do what you need

1048024
daemons	systemd
not surprisingly there s a perl daemons library available
if your hosting provider offers perl script support then you probably have permission to use systemd or backticks command

1048389
webclient	httpwebrequest
the point of webclient is to provide a very simple api to use in very simple situations
webclient doesn t have this kind of functionality - even the slightly-lower-level httpwebrequest doesn t as far as i m aware

1050260
icomparable	compareto
this gives you what you need to know you haven t declared your class to implement the icomparable interface
it is not enough to just implement the compareto method since the sorting algorithms will look for the icomparable interface before attempting to call compareto through that interface

1053422
mvp	presenter
i think apple uses the term mvc almost universally because many of the views in cocoa appkit use data bindings to draw data directly from the model and this breaks with the mvp pattern
in the diagram below from this article the mvp model shows all the data moving through the presenter - and this generally isn t the case for well-built cocoa apps

1054464
bash	zsh
maybe the problem with job control had to do with some bug in zsh that doesn t even exist in bash and maybe it is no longer relevant in zsh either
so try just an with bash and if job control is interfering try to disable it set +m and hopefully this would work

1054610
vim	textmate
it s completely replaced vim for me and while it s not a full ide it s got alot of neat integrations in bundles specially targeted towards perl development
you didn t specify which platform you re on but on the macintosh textmate is a very popular choice for perl development

1054708
opera	firefox
of course this can t be used to retrieve cross-domain-content for that you either have to proxy the calls through a script of yours or think about integration something like flxhr cross-domain ajax with flash call.html jquery.js is jquery 1.3.2 uncompressed test.html a valid xhtml-document xmldoc.js output.js ready.js in opera the whole thing works without the createxmldocument and the beforesend function
the extra trickery is needed for firefox 3.0.11 and ie6 can t test ie7 ie8 other browsers as they have a problem when the content-type returned by the server doesn t indicate that it s xml

1055219
firefox	safari
i believe it works the same way in firefox and other browsers but you may need to get the reference to your swf element differently than ie
ie will use an object tag generally with an id and firefox safari etc will use the embed tag and since you aren t supposed to be the same id on two elements people generally use the name attribute instead of an id attribute on the embed tag

1057308
kerberos	ntlm
existing components that are designed to use kerberos for authentication are not affected by this change
this is expected behaviour microsoft windows server 2003 service pack 1 sp1 modifies ntlm network authentication behavior

1059225
sudo	passwd
this means that you need to modify your sudoers file on each remote machine and add entries like this assuming your username deploy the first two lines allow the deploy user to run sudo without having a tty or re-typing the passwd -- which means it can be run straight over ssh without any further input
here is an example python command to take advantage of sudo on a remote anyway this is not a straight answer to your question but rather an illustration of how easy you can use python and a couple of other techniques to create a systems management tool that is 100 tailored to your specific needs

1059716
cpython	pypy
pypy written in python has a very flexible back-end and can use lots of different strategies id v gives on cpython only the numeric value of the pointer just as a handy way to uniquely identify the object
a list can be heterogeneous some items may be integers others objects of different types so it s just not a sensible option to store some items as pointers to pyobject and others differently each object also needs a type indication and in cpython a reference count at least -- array.array is homogeneous and limited so it can and does indeed store a copy of the items values rather than references this is often cheaper but not for collections where the same item appears a lot such as a sparse array where the vast majority of items are 0

1059716
cpython	pypy
a list can be heterogeneous some items may be integers others objects of different types so it s just not a sensible option to store some items as pointers to pyobject and others differently each object also needs a type indication and in cpython a reference count at least -- array.array is homogeneous and limited so it can and does indeed store a copy of the items values rather than references this is often cheaper but not for collections where the same item appears a lot such as a sparse array where the vast majority of items are 0
a python implementation would be fully allowed by the language specs to try subtler tricks for optimization as long as it preserves semantics untouched but as far as i know none currently does for this specific issue you could try hacking a pypy backend but don t be surprised if the overhead of checking for int vs non-int overwhelms the hoped-for gains

1065323
jsf	seam
jsf 1.1 1.2 raw doesn t provide an easy way to do this
seam spring both have ways around this and there are a couple of things you can do

1065378
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist
it follows that if are not required to do the job then it s sensible to use ienumerable or instead thereby eliminating the additional plumbing
the definition for is so is derived from ilist icollection and in addition to ienumerable and the ienumerable interface exposes the getenumerator method which returns an ienumerator a movenext method and a current property

1066486
junit	testng
junit allows you to easily create methods that run as part of a test easymock allows you to create mock or fake objects to pass in that will respond in very specific ways which you can use to test a method that relies on a framework or running environment that isn t there during testing
junit testng and easymock for testing there are many others those are the ones we use

1067204
implements	extends
for # nokogiriwrapper 0x581f74 nokogiri_wrapper.rb 12 in method_missing nokogiri_wrapper.rb 29 this is one way to implements the delegator pattern in ruby another way is to use one of the delegator classes
nokogiri doesn t have any instance methods to inherit but normally you would use extends ri extends ---------------------------------------------------------- object#extend obj.extend module ... obj ------------------------------------------------------------------------ adds to obj the instance methods from each module given as a parameter. module mod def hello hello from mod. n end end class klass def hello hello from klass. n end end k klass.new k.hello # hello from klass. n k.extend mod # # klass 0x401b3bc8 k.hello # hello from mod. n what you want to do is use all the class methods of the nokogiri module as instance methods of your class

1067393
implements	extends
object.clone has an implementation this link explains the cloneable interface an object must implements the cloneable interface in order to call the clone method otherwise it throws a clonenotsupportedexception
by definition all classes in java extends the base object class and object class has a default clone method even though object itself does not implements cloneable

1067520
profiling	debugging
he says do less stuff. and always profiling the release build - profiling the debugging build is generally a wasted effort
profiling by stopping in the debugger is not a reliable way to get timings as you ve discovered

1067927
client-side	server-side
add some client-side validation to check for the textbox being empty and refuse to submit the form if it is
accompany this with a validation check server-side that confirms the passed-in value is non-null and also a valid date and then fails the save and returns an error message to the user when a valid date is not present

1071040
django	turbogears	django	web2py	turbogears	web2py
there are a couple of web frameworks available in python that will relieve you from most of the work django pylons and the new turbogears based on it
web2py cherrypy and the old turbogears based on it i do not feel django as big as you say

1072654
ienumerable	ilist
if you return an ienumerable then he will not know a priori that he can make an ilist out of it
but if you return an ilist he will know that he can iterate over it

1072778
ienumerable	ilist
basically list is ienumerable but you have count functionality add element remove element ienumerable is not efficient for counting elements if the collection is intended to be readonly or the modification of the collection is controlled by the parent then returning an ilist just for count is not a good idea
in linq there is a count extension method on which inside the clr will shortcut to .count if the underlying type is of ilist so performance difference is negligible

1072919
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
specifically in the touchesbegan withevent method save the starting position
in touchesmoved withevent if the user s intent isn t known yet determine whether the touched has moved far enough away from the starting position

1072919
touchesmoved	touchesended
in touchesmoved withevent if the user s intent isn t known yet determine whether the touched has moved far enough away from the starting position
if it has determine whether the user intends to scroll or change the date and save that intent. if the user s intent is already known and it s to change the date send the date picker the touchedmoved withevent message otherwise send the uiscrollview the touchesmoved withevent message. you ll have to do some simliar work within touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent to make sure the other views get the appropriate messages

1073100
google-chrome	firefox
i sometimes have the same happen to me when i m inspecting http traffic with fiddler and my computer crashes although in that case its the other way around ie google-chrome etc give me the error message and firefox works splendidly
firefox doesn t use wininet which most windows applications use

1074663
pthreads	fork
threads on linux nowadays tries to stay pthreads complient
only the calling thread is replicated not other threads note that on solaris you can chose what fork does depending on what library you link to from a process shall be created with a single thread

1075232
persistent	transient
so for a fresh item that isn t persistent it starts at false and stays false because nhibernate has never saved or loaded it
when nhibernate checks whether the child is transient the trigger responds that it is transient and a save happens which marks the child as persistent

1076398
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable is not indexable
neither is iqueryable

1076866
opera	safari	firefox	safari
please feel free to move it if needed or to tell me so as i can rectify my problem was the following did not work on safari 3 firefox and opera ie is not enable to draw svg
in fact this code produce the insertion in a of the following element and safari 4 is able to draw a svg file as an image but this is not the way to do for the other browser

1077333
move	drag
set child to draggable set parent to droppable set a flag which if true on drag stop removes the element unset this flag in the parents on drop function child dragged out of parent child not dropped into parent so when you move the child around in the parent nothing happens removeme flag is unset and it move back to original position
if you drag the child outside of the parent the removeme flag isn t unset and the drag stop method removes the child

1077337
firefox	safari
ps these were all tested on firefox using firebug
i cannot make any claims about the efficiency of safari s webkit konqueror s kjs ie s proprietary engine or google chrome s v8

1079264
mockito	jmock
jmock doesn t do anything special for final classes other than rely on the jdave library to unfinalize everything in the jvm so you could experiment with using jdave s unfinalizer and see if mockito will then mock it
mockito can t mock final classes

1080018
apache	nginx
if the model isn t very complex and or your traffic is fairly low you can probably get away with apache mongrel and sqlite on some nix
if you start seeing performance issues you can add some memcached into the mix upgrade relatively painlessly to mysql and use a different server passenger nginx

1081281
daemons	systemd
how to detect whether an os x application is already launchd for an introduction to the run-time context and particularly around mac os x daemons and agents and for those cases when you do need to have multiple copies of an executable running as a pool or such and akin to apache see
mapping process management among disparate operating systemd doesn t work

1082107
inline	inlining
explicit inline fixes that
of course the compiler may still inline the function if it thinks that will be efficient but it s not the same as an explicit inlining

1082107
inline	inlining
of course the compiler may still inline the function if it thinks that will be efficient but it s not the same as an explicit inlining
template functions are implicitly inlined in the sense that they don t require an inline to prevent multiple definition errors

1082217
innodb	myisam
where these conditions do not apply and besides websites they do not apply often in the database world the innodb table is likely to be the table type of choice
this article is aimed at users who are familiar with mysql but have only used the default myisam table type

1082394
udp	tcp
this is one major reason why mmo games connected to hundred of thousands of clients use udp
speed the fact that each message is routed individually means that you cannot hit a stream congestion like tcp can

1082394
udp	tcp
broadcast udp can broadcast to all listeners on a network segment
you shouldn t even consider udp if you re considering tcp too

1082394
udp	tcp
you shouldn t even consider udp if you re considering tcp too
if you re considering tcp means you are thinking in terms of a stream exactly once in order messages and using udp will put the burden of fragmentation retry and acknowledgment duplicate detection and ordering in your app

1084554
postgresql	mysql
if you cannot change dbs to one that has spatial operators implemented correctly like postgresql s postgis extension you can solve this problem using a two-part approach
first let mysql give you an bounding box pre-filtering result based on the bounding box that is what it does by default using their intersects operator

1086282
ubuntu	linux
worth noting that gnome-terminal doesn t respond to it just produces a plain foo and neither xterm nor gnome-terminal nor tty1 respond to 6 blink rapid at least on my system ubuntu 9.04
from looking at wikipedia the string produces a blinking foo in xterm or in the linux console as in ctrl-alt-f1

1088439
vim	emacs
vim s my poison
i m sure emacs offers similar gains the biggest gain not needing to touch the mouse

1088743
coalesce	isnull
the coalesce is ansi standard and isnull is not
but more important is the fact that coalesce is more flexible. isnull will only work with two parameters

1088743
coalesce	isnull
but more important is the fact that coalesce is more flexible. isnull will only work with two parameters
if the first parameter is null then the value of the second parameter is returned else the value of the first is returned. coalesce will take 2 to n i don t know the limit of n parameters and return the value of the first parameter that is not null

1088933
hmac	md5
if they send you a long string or file and a hmac you can compute the hmac yourself compare your hmac and theirs and if they match the data was not corrupted in transit nor was the data tampered with
md5 is not encryption - it s a hash

1090158
awt	swing
there are better 3rd party native looking skins than swing s implementations btw lots of people preferred using awt s filedialog over swing s filechooser because it gave the platform file dialog most people were used to rather than the weird custom swing one
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing - you may be targeting an older jvm or platform that doesn t support swing

1091513
opera	firefox	opera	safari
the java code getlocaleinfo.java an example of html page using the above applet getlocaleinfo.html tested on firefox 3.0 ie 6 safari 3.1 and opera 9.50 on windows xp pro sp3. it works without problem with the first two on safari i have a strange error after init call but it still works
i can t get it work with opera the applet loads correctly as i can see the trace of init call in the java console i have no errors when javascript calls the java functions except if i add and call a method getting a jsobject parameter curiously but the java functions are not called i added trace of the calls

1092009
innodb	myisam
if your table is innodb and id is a primary key then you can omit id from the indexes above
if your table is myisam or id is not a primary key you need to create a composite ondex on topic_id id

1092119
shadowing	named
shadowing is not really a java only term
in any instance where a variable declared in a scope has the same named as one in a bigger scope that variable is shadowed

1097291
factors	mean
also take in account that people have different estimation factors not sure this word makes complete sense in english .
by that i mean that you dba might always estimate 1.5 times as long as it takes him and your css monkey maybe just half as long .

1098191
bit-shift	xor
useful as the bit-shift method suggested
you can store two values in one field using xor as you might have noticed you need one of the original values to retrieve the other so this technique is not as .

1098616
dictionary	map
- the dictionary you pass to the translate method has unicode ordinals not strings as keys which is why we need that rebuilding step from the original char-to-char spec_dict
values in the dictionary you pass to translate as opposed to keys which must be ordinals can be unicode ordinals arbitrary unicode strings or none to remove the corresponding character as part of the translation so it s easy to specify ignore a certain character for sorting purposes map ä to ae for sorting purposes and the like

1099712
udp	tcp
udp is a connection-less protocol and used in applications like snmp simple network management protocol dns domain name system where data packets arriving out of order unreliability and not of concern and immediate send through of the data packet matters
since udp does not involve connection establishment there fore applications like dns where connection establishment delays needs to be avoided udp is preferred over tcp

1099807
udp	tcp
udp has lower overhead as stated already is good for streaming things like video and audio where it is better to just lose a packet then try to resend and catch up
there are no guarantees on tcp delivery you are simply supposed to be told if the socket disconnected or basically if the data is not going to arrive

1099807
udp	tcp
tcp has its own re-try and ordering mechanism that is hidden from your application you can re-invent that with udp to tailor it to your needs
udp is far easier to write code for on both ends basically because you do not have to make and maintain the point to point connections

1099870
udp	tcp
in some cases which others have highlighted guaranteed arrival of packets isn t important and hence using udp is fine
there are other cases where udp is preferable to tcp

1099906
udp	tcp
udp is often harder in that you must write your program in such a way that it is not dependent on the accuracy of the packets
udp when speed is necessary and the accuracy if the packets is not and tcp when you need accuracy

1100412
union	distinct
i m sorry that i m not able to understand exactly what your issue is but i wonder if your issue stems from the fact that the union operator will eliminate duplicate rows kind of like a select distinct over the combined query
if you don t want this behavior use union all instead

1101716
cvs	svn
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it
there are tools to convert cvs history to svn and other tools to migrate vss history - so you can use them in your case of moving to a better system

1102146
spaces	delimiter
as an argument to the delimiter command so not having the spaces there may be confusing it
try delimiter

1102306
hex	binary
you can use encoding.getbytes to get the encoded version of a string once you ve chosen an appropriate encoding - but the fact that there is that choice to make is the reason that there aren t many apis which go straight from string to base64 hex or which perform encryption hashing directly on strings
any such apis which do exist will almost certainly be doing the encode to a byte array perform appropriate binary operation decode opaque binary data to hex base64

robocopy	xcopy
an alternate solution that copies one file at a time and does not require robocopy the outer for statement generates any possible path combination of subdirectory in source_dir and name in filenames_to_copy
for each existing file xcopy is invoked

1104534
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this is not always required but i ran into 2 separate cases where i needed to make this change basing a new site in a directory outside of the default xampp http root basically any path that will be accessible via http must have explicit permissions set adding mod_rewrite rules for a site set up as a virtual host under the default http path i was getting the error .htaccess rewriteengine not allowed here
reading the comments in httpd.conf about the allowoverride option makes the cause of the error obvious but i had overlooked that before

1105566
firefox	safari
if you can make something look right in three of the above browsers you ll probably be fine when any of those browsers upgrades in the future ie9 firefox 4 etc.
doesn t look right in chrome safari firefox either so this really isn t an ie8 problem

1105762
opera	google-chrome
the specs say it does not work for netscape mozilla safari opera and internet explorer for the macintosh. .
google-chrome

1107666
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the reason for this behavior is that the only unchecked-exception in the java language is runtimeexception and it s subclasses
all other exceptions and errors including yours since it only subclasses exception and not runtimeexception are checked exceptions

1109651
jar	manifest.mf
there is not a way with the jar command
the closest you can get is to use -tf to show the presence or absence of a meta-inf manifest.mf file or -xf to extract it

1110632
postgresql	mysql
if you want to scale more save time have less weird bugs to hunt have more simple application code spend more time optimizing your business not fighting with your database then the open source solution of choice is postgresql
some say mysql is simple and fast

1115476
opera	google-chrome
example with this you will achieve text-shadow with proper font-weight in these browsers firefox 3.5+ opera 9.5+ safari 1.1+ since 2003
google-chrome 2.0+ konqueror 3.4+ and if you want drop shadow in ie you can use filter expressions with dropshadow but i personally do not recommend using proprietary css extensions

1115476
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 2.0+ konqueror 3.4+ and if you want drop shadow in ie you can use filter expressions with dropshadow but i personally do not recommend using proprietary css extensions
your only real loss then would be having an improper font-weight for older non-ie browsers like firefox 3.0 and lower and opera 9.2x and lower

1115889
implements	extends
an interface on the other hand only allows you to declare that you want properties and or methods with a given name to exist in all classes that implements it - but doesn t specify how you should implements it
also a class can implements many interfaces but can only extends one abstract class

1118936
persistent	transient
in that context persistent makes no sense and so it fails
the javadoc for hibernate session.persist i know you re not using the hibernate api but the semantics are the same and the hibernate docs are better says make a transient instance persistent

1118936
persistent	transient
the javadoc for hibernate session.persist i know you re not using the hibernate api but the semantics are the same and the hibernate docs are better says make a transient instances persistent
if your object already has an id it s not transient

1125307
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	freebsd
and if you wish to move ahead and are suffering from the dogma of a simplified to more complex or geeky linux distro then read this question it made me stick to ubuntu
well freebsd contrary to everyone s expectation does not perform extra-ordinary well efficient or fast from ubuntu

1125307
freebsd	linux	ubuntu	linux
well freebsd contrary to everyone s expectation does not perform extra-ordinary well efficient or fast from ubuntu
various benchmarking are now available for linux and those benchmarks show clearly that there is very little difference between the two in terms of over-all performance

1125307
ubuntu	linux
it is important when you have to try any application or a new product or a new release it is far easier to install n try on ubuntu than on other linux variants
ofcourse this is not what you are looking for in the answer but i am giving my suggestion that ubuntu provide more peace of mind ease on work

1125353
google-chrome	firefox
while google-chrome will execute javascript marked as javascript1.7 it does not support js1.7 features like the let scoped variable operator
this code will run on firefox 3.5 but not on google-chrome using v8 if you change language to javascript1.7 and omit the type it won t run with js 1.7 features in firefox 3.5

1126426
udp	tcp
as far as i know it isn t possible to use udp with the major browser plugins flash silverlight etc
tcp is the lowest you get

1128033
gridview	objectdatasource
i couldn t use the emptydatatemplate property because i was creating my gridview dynamically with custom fields which provide filters in the headers
i couldn t use the example almny posted because i m using objectdatasource s instead of dataset or datatable

1130250
tabcontrol	tabitem
this smells like some tabcontrol funny behaviour since replacing tabcontrol with listbox works fine. as to the specific cause of the problem it isn t apparent to me
edit i ve checked your code and it seems that at runtime the contentpresenter of the tabitem does not inherit the datacontext from the tabcontrol as soon the item to display is of type visual or derived from it

1133611
cvs	svn
subversion for cvs users may also be worth reading
i m not sure if i understand the question correctly but you can tag a specific revision in svn svn cp -r url trunk url tags my_tag see the chapter on svn copy in version control with subversion for more information

1133735
cvs	svn
if you checkout a tag version from a cvs repository it cannot be modified or to say it better it can be modified on your local copy but you cannot commit back the changes
in some way cvs automatically protect its tags from accidental changes the copy in svn is just well a copy of the trunk in another path

1137216
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
after a touchesbegan event is fired the uikit looks for a positional movement of the finger touch which translates into touchedmoved events as the x y of the finger is changed until the finger is lifted and the touchesended event is fired
if the finger is held down in one place it will not fire the touchesmoved event until there is movement

1137627
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
inline-functions are not always guaranteed to be inline - some compilers only do this in release builds or when they are specifically configured to do so
also in some cases inlining may not be possible

1137849
qtableview	qtablewidget
to get the selection you must call selecteditems which is again a method of qabstractitemview and not qtableview which is why you missed it in the docs
the method is public at the level of qabstractitemview but qtablewidget has a built-in model which you can t change

1139394
apache	nginx
serving static content from apache has overhead so it ll be a better idea if you server it using some lightweight webserver such as lighttpd or nginx and connect to apache using reverse proxy to serve the django based content
here s a tutorial on using nginx since you are using mod_wsgi you can run each site as different user as well so that two of them may not access each other s data

1140056
equals	gethashcode
the most important property a hash code implementation must have is this if two objects compare as equals then they must have identical hash codes
if you have a class where instances of the class compare by reference equality then you do not need to override gethashcode

1140658
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome just doesn t ask for them at all
all right this was actually google-chrome caching more aggressively than firefox and ie

1143527
glut	sdl	glut	glfw	glfw	sdl
you do not have to use glut though there s nothing wrong with it - i kind of like glfw
you could also try the tao framework a set of mono .net bindings to glut opengl sdl glfw and much more

1143973
sudo	passwd
maybe you don t need to sudo gem list passwd local gems # ...loads of gems listed ... sqlite3-ruby 1.2.4 # .
loads of gems listed ... if it s not there sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby will sort you out in no time

1144289
g++	gcc
in general you should be using g++ to compile c++ programs
either use g++ readclientfile.cpp or gcc readclientfile.cpp -lstdc++ i m guessing gcc isn t linking vs

1144979
postgresql	mysql
if you are going to attack this with concurrent requests i d go with postgresql
otoh if the data is going to be loaded once then scanned by a single thread maybe mysql in its acid not required mode would be the best match

1146434
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
other places on the web suggest that you not use uinavigationcontroller if you need precise control over your views size and locations
they suggest that instead you create your own navigationcontroller class based on uinavigationbar

1147232
multiplying	modulo
usually a simple hash function works by taking the component parts of the input chars in the case of a string and multiplying them by the powers of some constant and adding them together in some int type
so for example a typical although not especially good hash of a string might be then if a bunch of strings all having the same first chars are fed in then the results will all be the same modulo k at least until the int type overflows

1148804
haskell	ocaml
object-oriented not to be found in haskell or sml
ocaml has a bog-standard oo system grafted onto the core language not well integrated with other languages

1149762
cpython	ironpython
so my suggestion is use cpython for gui use a framework like wxpython pyqt and you would be happy
use cpython with ironpython you are bound to .net platform which do not have much cross platform support mono is there on linux but still for a cross platform app i wouldn t recommend .net

1153158
nsstring	nsobject
also the specifier is not limited to nsstring objects but is for any objective-c objects
the base nsobject class provides a generic description of the object consisting of its class and its address but many objects will supply information specific to their type such as the collection classes nsarray nsdictionary which will supply nicely formated dump of their contents

1156487
equals	gethashcode
an object hash code may be useful for determining when two objects are not equals but to determine whether they are equals you will have to call equals
an implementation that always returns 0 for gethashcode is legal but may not be very efficient when objects of that type are inserted int various types of containers

1156524
equals	gethashcode
you shouldn t implement equals in term of gethashcode ever
it s perfectly valid for gethashcode to have collisions but equals must not return false positives

1159613
lisp	scheme
using sicp with common lisp is possible and fun you can use common lisp for learning with sicp without much problems
the scheme subset that is used in the book is not very sophisticated

1159613
lisp	scheme
generally make sure the code is compiled since common lisp interpreters will usually not support tco
sometimes it might also helpful to write one or two macros and provide some scheme function names to make code look a bit more like scheme

1163208
postgresql	mysql
postgresql vs
mysql and not on the framework - except that some data mapping library may make inefficient use of sql

1163446
gridview	sqldatasource	gridview	objectdatasource
examples datasourceid asp objectdatasource id ods1 runat server selectmethod test typename testbl asp gridview id gv1 runat server datasourceid ods1 in this case databinding occurs automatically datasource asp gridview id gv2 runat server and in code behind you would have something like this please note that i have used instead of angular brackets
the two properties are mutually exclusive when you use one of them you are not allowed to use the other one the datasourceid property is to be used with a datasource control objectdatasource xmldatasource sqldatasource etc the datasource property is to be used with custom objects custom data binding

1163561
postgresql	mysql
another issue i ve seen is that early postgresql on windows will by default make sure that it s writes are going through the write cache - even if it s battery backed
afaik mysql does not do this and it will greatly affect write performance

1166235
equals	gethashcode
it is really important to make sure you keep the override of .gethashcode in step with equals
basically you must make sure they consider the same fields so as not to violate the first of the three rules of gethashcode from msdn object.gethashcode if two objects compare as equal the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1166235
equals	gethashcode
basically you must make sure they consider the same fields so as not to violate the first of the three rules of gethashcode from msdn object.gethashcode if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

1166235
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
in other words you must make sure that every time .equals considers two instances equals they will also have the same .gethashcode

1166315
translation	localization
if you need the ability to translation your software into other languages then i would place as many strings that are displayed to an end user as you can in resource files
if you do not need localization or if the strings in question are never displayed to an end user i would use constants

1167964
multiplying	multiplication
note that multiplying a matrix in place is going to get the wrong answer since you re going to be overwriting values before using them
that s not any matrix multiplication definition i ve ever seen

1168935
cpython	ironpython
note that with this code you can actually use extensions written for cpython from your ironpython code so that s not a discriminating condition any more
ironpython is .net-native -- so it will be preferable if you want to fully integrate your python code with .net all the way

1169169
lisp	scheme
i m not saying that it s not possible -- it is of course possible to implement the whole book in common lisp for example see bendersky s pages just as you can do so in c or perl or whatever
it s just going to harder with languages that are further apart from scheme

1169169
lisp	scheme
however common lisp s nil is still different it is also a symbol
so in scheme you have a clear separation something is either a list or one of the primitive types of values -- but in common lisp nil is not only false and the empty list it is also a symbol

1169169
lisp	scheme
so in scheme you have a clear separation something is either a list or one of the primitive types of values -- but in common lisp nil is not only false and the empty list it is also a symbol
in addition to this you get a host of slightly different behavior -- for example in common lisp the head and the tail the car and cdr of the empty list is itself the empty list while in scheme you ll get a runtime error if you try that

1169169
lisp	scheme
this is all the essence of rainer s first non solution and the reason he labeled it as bad . his third option -- rewriting functional loops expressed as recursive functions as common lisp loops dotimes dolist and the infamous loop can work for a few simple cases but at a very high cost the fact that scheme is a language that does proper tco is not only fundamental to the language -- it is also one of the major themes in the book so by doing so you will have lost that point completely
in addition there are some cases that you just cannot translate scheme code into a common lisp loop construct -- for example as you work your way through the book you ll get to implement a meta-circular-interpreter which is an implementation of a mini-scheme language

1169169
lisp	scheme
note that i m talking about the simple interpreters -- later in the book you implement this evaluator as something close to a register machine where you kind of explicitly make it do tco. the bottom line to all of this is that this evaluator -- when implemented in common lisp -- will result in a language that is itself not doing tco
people who are familiar with all of this should not be surprised after all the circularity of the evaluator means that you re implementing a language with semantics that are very close to the host language -- so in this case you inherit the common lisp semantics rather than the scheme tco semantics

1169169
lisp	scheme
again this is something that might not bother you but it will damage the overall learning experience. all in all very few languages get close to scheme in being able to implement the semantics of the language inside the language as a non-trivial eg not using eval evaluator that easily. in fact if you do go with a common lisp then in my opinion rainer s second suggestion -- use a common lisp implementation that supports tco -- is the best way to go
however in common lisp this is fundamentally a compiler optimization so you will likely need to a know about the knobs in the implementation that you need to turn to make tco happen b you will need to make sure that the common lisp implementation is actually doing proper tco and not just optimization of self calls which is the much simpler case that is not nearly as important c you would hope that the common lisp implementation that does tco can do so without damaging debugging options again since this is considered an optimization in common lisp then turning this knob on might also be taken by the compiler as saying i don t care much for debuggability

1171087
dictionary	map
finally i d add a method to extract the details into a dictionary or probably an ilookup if you re using framework v3.5 something like
you can t - from ayende s blog discussing map i would like to point out that i have still not covered all the options for map there are even more options although idictionary k ilist v is not something that is possible to map for the problematic sql statements that would be required to do so

1172949
client-side	server-side
as has been pointed out user management and role-based security in a win forms app is not something that will actually work client-side
in a web analogy imagine trying to implement all of your security using only javascript and cookies keeping no information on the server-side

1176517
prepare	execute
that s simply not the way you use prepare statements
it is perfectly okay to insert one row per query because you can execute one prepare statement multiple times with different parameters

1179379
memcached	apc
to answer your first point the power of memcached is that it allows to create a cluster of cache servers it is not meant to be used on a single server event it you can use it that way the theory is you have many servers and each one has some free ram you have no use for to use this ram you install memcached on these servers and configure it to use the amount of ram that wasn t used and if one machine is down it automatically stops using it and put load balance the data on the others the drawback of memcached for some people is that it s network based even when you use it on only one machine
which means a bit slower that local-only apc works on only one machine it is great used as a caching mecanism to store data you only need on one server or if you only have one server

1179908
fseek	fread
in particular make sure fseek is returning 0 - if it s not this may be the entire problem
provided that fseek is succeeding fread should tell you the total number of bytes read

1182972
uiview	calayer
if however you are only interested in performing basic animation and it can be done through uiview the api is usually simpler so it will make sense to use uiview to save yourself time there
you use calayer when you are not getting any benefits from using uiview and when it s not possible to do the thing you want to do with uiview

1182972
uiview	calayer
you use calayer when you are not getting any benefits from using uiview and when it s not possible to do the thing you want to do with uiview
following this line of thought if your need is not making use of any ui controls and or you want to create your own custom animation 2d or 2.5d animation it makes sense to drop down to the coreanimation level and create your own calayer to do your thing there

1183073
uiview	calayer
while an uiview has a memory footprint of at least 4 width height pixels this statement is absolutely not true
the memory overhead of a uiview compared to a calayer is just the size of the instance variables of the uiview class plus a few instances of additional classes that will get allocated

1183622
postgresql	mysql
i ve long loved postgresql but with the current 8.4 release it really seems to have reached a peak
don t ignore postgresql -- every bit as open as mysql not in the middle of a muddle caused in mysql s case by acquisition by sun then by oracle core developers leaving forks into drizzle mariadb ourdelta ... and just about as functionally rich and sql standards compliant as ms sql server if not more i miss recursive ctes a lot when i have to use mysql -- both sql server and postgresql have them though just as the sql standards require

1184207
postgresql	mysql
you might want to subscribe to rsses of one of 2 postgresql planets don t ask why there are 2 of them planet.postgresql.org and planetpostgresql.org also subscribing to postgresql related lists can help - you can find list of them in here
important things if you can as since you re starting and own a server - you can use the latest released version 8.4 at the moment make sure autovacuum is turned on in postgresql.conf if you have problems - usually the fastest way to get help is to join #postgresql on freenode.net irc network and ask there there are some things mysql has and postgresql doesn t replace for example - usually if something is not in postgresql there are good reasons for it and or a workarounds

1184528
postgresql	mysql
the time to make the switch is highly dependent on you application environment however if you need clustering and replication to work properly 100 of the time then postgresql will not let you down as mysql has for me in the past
as to skaffman s point you may want to have a look at postgresql if mysql isn t scaling for you

1184528
postgresql	mysql
as to skaffman s point you may want to have a look at postgresql if mysql isn t scaling for you
it is a more mature and robust than mysql and is opensource

1186408
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram i know this is not uml but a good database design upfront is important and an entity-relationship diagram would help you to organise and plan how different tables relate with each other
it s good to have a set of uml diagram to keep track of what is happening but to remember in the end that documentation decays - your code is your design

1186828
draggable	droppable
all that s needed is to hook into the start event of the draggable and conditionally change the accept options of the droppable you want them to work with
running a quick test myself it does not appear that jquery ui inserts any more css classes into the draggable-helper if it is over a droppable so you cannot use pure css to change the colour of the helper when it is over a droppable

1186875
jar	war
basically extract out the common functionality make it a library as a jar file and either include that jar file in both war files or add it to a common part of the classpath
war files are meant to be whole web applications not libraries

1187573
setinterval	settimeout
for your first problem don t use setinterval ndash
use settimeout in the callback for your request don t forget to call your function once after it has been defined to start it off after that settimeout will be called every time after a request has finished. note that in some cases you might not reach readystate 4

1188158
inline	inlining
yes the clr will inline that in normal cases
there are some situations in which inlining doesn t take place however - including anything derived from marshalbyrefobject because it could be a runtime proxy

1189834
factors	mean
maybe we can point you at the right algorithm if we know what you are trying to do why must numbers over 10 000 use the 1 000 factors
what do you mean that the sqrt function doesn t work as you expect

1190815
ati	nvidia
apparently ati has beta drivers and libraries but they are not publicly available yet
i believe nvidia has released a beta windows opencl sdk but i have no idea what the requirements to use that are

1191598
single-quotes	double-quotes
can they be escaped by with backslashes or by enclosing them in single-quotes
if there s an odd number of them the match must have occurred inside a pair of double-quotes so it s not valid the lookahead fails

1197642
spaces	delimiter
try this instead the problem is that actually only matches spaces if any that are alone on a line --not the newlines themselves
this leaves the delimiter empty when there s nothing on the line which doesn t make sense

1198919
ssl	https
on a side note https is not using ssl exclusivley anymore tls the successor to ssl see rfc2818 is more modern rule of thumb users should have the choice if they want http or https in noncritical environments but forced to use https on the critical parts of your site login cart payment ... to prevent malicious attacks
some webservers are configured to mirror the whole site so you can get every page over http or https depending on what you prefer or how the webbrowser sends them around

1199340
rdf	owl
if it s not you ve either got to convert it from its current form into rdf on the fly or permanently
to do it on the fly you could use a technology like d2r which maps relational databases to rdf there s some other semantic web c# stuff about like rowlex which is more owl based or there s my own dotnetrdf library but that s only just about to be a first alpha release so i wouldn t recommend it for any production systems yet

1200052
firefox	safari
the usage of native control and font rendering mechanisms is where you ll see the most differences in firefox
in safari while not officially acknowledged there does seem to be some deliberate changes in the port

1201337
memcpy	memmove
with memcpy the destination cannot overlap the source at all
with memmove it can

1201337
memcpy	memmove
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions
for example memcpy might always copy addresses from low to high

1202486
profiling	debugging
then use the profiling to introspect the state of the threads
the use of java 1.4 is a minor issue here since 1.4 s debugging interface is not great but some profilers still support it

1203047
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division
the pic16f does not have a hardware multiplying or divide unit so unless you are multiplying or dividing by a power of 2 it is taxing to the processor
here is a routine that does a bcd on a 32 bit number and doesn t require division or multiplication

1203234
decimal	ieee
when you convert that back to decimal it only looks like it gained precision
it s not adding precision it s just rounding it to the nearest ieee floating point representation

1204725
boost	allocator
take a look on boost pool_alloc for a good sample of fast allocator
allocator arrays with variable length on the stack is a good idea because it fast and doesn t fragment the memory

1204984
inline	inlining
and some functions such as recursive ones simply cannot be inline
the major reason for not inlining a function is that it would greatly increase the overall size of the code preventing iot from being held in the processor s cache

1205194
client-side	server-side
session is an asp.net server object that is not accessible from the client through javascript directly session may be stored as a cookie on the client but then even then it is not designed to be accessed from the client-side directly
you could handle what you want to do in a number of ways - store a value in a hidden input when a link is clicked and then read that value server-side and store in session

1206992
mef	prism
mef looks like it s heading for the .net framework so i d say this was a really good way to expose a plugin surface area that requires a very small and relatively unchanging dependency just on mef.
not all of the other stuff that comes along with prism for your plugin authors

1208773
single-quotes	double-quotes
i m not quite sure what the rationale for using single-quotes by default is
double-quotes would make a more sensible default i would have thought

1210590
emacs	gedit
it might be be a good idea to learn emacs by using for plain text files notes todo lists so there is not the distraction of learning language specifics
if they are beginning to learn programming it is better to start with a simplae text editor like gedit or geany

1210937
intersect	contains
intersect indicates that the bounding volumes partially overlap
if boundingsphere1 is smaller than boundingsphere2 then i suppose boundingsphere1.contains boundingsphere2 would return a containmenttype.intersects result instead of a containmenttype.contains result since it doesn t completely contains the other

1211401
coalesce	isnull
it s not ansi sql though with a more flexible command existing there coalesce
it s just like isnull but takes any number of parameters

1212917
actionscript	mxml
that s why you ll see that all of the examples use actionscript instead of mxml
yes that means that you can t use flexbuilder to code the renderer and yes some of these examples could be done in mxml but it is easy in mxml to do things that generate extra code that you may not need

1213479
firefox	safari
finally avoid floats and columns when styling for printers it can make ie and firefox act wacky
safari 1.3 and later don t know about 4 do not support page-break-inside try it or see here

1214224
innodb	myisam
innodb tables do support transactions so i ll recreate the tables and then see whether the transactions work then
apparently mysql doesn t support transactions with myisam tables which is the default type of tables

1214267
jsf	seam
if for some reason you cannot use seam maybe you can borrow some ideas from how seam handles authorization and authentication in jsf
i use jsf seam and have used seam s built-in authentication and authorization and find it extremely easy to use

1214388
vsto	add-in
however office interop in f# is the same as c# - you can use the native com apis or the newer managed visual studio tools for office vsto libraries
unfortunately f# doesn t have the ui-designers for creating vsto add-in like c# so the simplest way to do office interop is to use the com apis

1215164
pascal	delphi
martin waldenburg wrote a pascal version of lex yacc named paslex which has been kicking around for way over a decade now and has been converted to delphi although it might not work with the latest versions without some minor work
if i remember correctly it uses the same .l grammar input files as lex so any documentation you find for lex yacc can also be applied to paslex with the exception that you get pascal code as the output

1217016
testdriven.net	xunit.net
i m not sure how testdriven.net supports xunit.net but with nunit you can run a single test a class its tests or all test with a click of the mouse or keyboard shortcut
testdriven.net is a vs2005 2008 plugin which also allows super fast testing especially when using tdd

realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
edit post your edit you don t appear to be having a realloc problem
the first parameter to realloc must be a pointer that was previously returned by malloc calloc or realloc and not subsequently free d

1217117
listview	gridview
also depending on your needs there is a new lightweight listview component in 3.0
it does not support all of the gridview s features but if you primarily need a display-only grid it might be a great alternative

1221524
implements	extends
any class extends the abstract class will have to implements only its abstract methods and members and will have some default implementation of the other methods of the abstract class which you may override or not
--edit - forgot to mention earwicker reminded me finally you can implements as many interfaces as you want but only extends one class being it abstract or not

1221913
g++	gcc
always build c++ code with g++
when you compile with gcc the c++ libraries are not linked in by default

1222655
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
may be there is a bug feature in microsoft s library system.data.oracleclient that this adapter do not automatically support converting we8iso8859p1 to unicode
here is a link to odp.net i hope that there will be a support for this encoding in odp but to say true i never checked this it is only a suggestion 2 workaround in dataset you should create a binary field mapped to the original table field and a string field not mapped to the database

1223031
lxml	beautifulsoup
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it
it has a compatibility api for beautifulsoup too if you don t want to learn the lxml api

1224507
setinterval	settimeout
everyone has a settimeout setinterval solution already
i think that it is important to note that you can pass functions to setinterval not just strings

1225397
move	drag
the current implementation doesn t use mouse move events and do not calculate the geometry
instead it relies on mouse over out events detected by targets after a drag was started

1226423
serializable	deserialization
the great thing about this is if you add a member value that doesn t need to be searched or indexed only stored you don t need to put it in a database column so you make no changes to the database at all it will be stored in the serializable blob
the only thing to do is add a default value for this member in your deserialization code so the objects from this class which are already in the database and do not have this member will have a decent default value for it

1228619
haskell	ocaml
haskell is a wonderful language it has #1 and #2 and although it doesn t have #3 it s type system is so flexible that you will probably not find the lack of meta to be limiting
i believe you can do metaprogramming in ocaml at compile time with a language extension

1228659
cpython	ironpython
so unless ironpython which is written in .net can correctly load c dlls written for cpython you might be out of luck
a ironpython does not support using pyds built for cpython since they leverage implementation details of cpython

1228733
pascal	delphi
first off this is c++ not pascal
the delphi version is self

1229195
postgresql	mysql
i don t have a doctrine-enabled project right here so can t test for you as a sidenote i don t have a postgresql server to test on
but what you propose doesn t work on mysql it seems you have to use now + interval 2 hour and not now + interval 2 hours -- still i don t know about pg edit after the comment ergh you re right this is not a correct solution

1229994
photoshop	fireworks
however photoshop can be quite daunting if you are just starting out
fireworks is specifically web orientated and has preset styles that you can use but it doesn t have the fan-base or tutorials available that photoshop does

1230890
tostring	string.format
bind items to dropdown ... i prefer this rather than overriding tostring as tostring is generic and used everywhere and can therefore be a pain in the arse whereas this is a local modification that doesn t affect anything else
jamie s suggestion is good but instead of overriding tostring i would just project your ilist order into ienumerable listitem before binding ie var items from o in datalist datalist being ilist returned from repository select new listitem o.name string.format 0 | 1 o.key.id o.key.customerid

1231244
udp	tcp
if you are working with tcp ip sockets you already have that scheme with udp sockets listening on a local port to which multiple sources can send data
you cannot have such a tcp socket however the select api is available on all standard implementations to let you open multiple tcp listening sockets one per source and then do a select on the whole lot

1232409
boost	allocator
and you should do the same -- either by using ready-made raii classes like vector shared_ptr or almost any other class in the standard library or in boost or by writing your own
as a general rule of thumb your code should not contain any new delete calls except in the constructor destructor for the class responsible for managing that allocator

1232617
vb.net	vb6
in vb.net you have to use andalso instead of and if you want it to skip evaluating the second expression
it s not true for vb6

1234058
datamapper	activerecord
another approach could be to use an alternative orm like datamapper which does not have the same limitations
activerecord likes to have integer id columns and throws a fit if this is not the case

1236586
vim	emacs
typically if i want to switch between vim and my shell bash i just hit ctrl + z to pause the vim process play around in my shell then type fg when i want to go back to vim - keeping my editor and my shell nice and separate
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to achieve i ve never used emacs but you can run commands in vim by typing and if you want to type in several commands or play around in a shell for a while you can always use once the command or shell terminates you ll be given the option to press enter to return to your editor window vim is intentionally lightweight and lacking in the ability to do non-editorish type things just as running a full-blown shell inside a vim pane tab but as mentioned above there are third-party addons such as vim-shell that allow you to do that sort of thing

1236880
serializable	deserialization
by requiring you to mark the class with serializable you indicate that you have taken these considerations into account
automatic serialization deserialization might not suffice for the object

1237553
mvp	presenter
in the past years i have been using my own implementation of mvp with a very passive view that enslaves itself to whatever the presenter tells him to do
my solution consisted of the following an interface per widget defining the methods to control the visual appearance an implementing class that can be a composite or use an external widget library a central presenter for a screen that hosts n views that are made up of m widgets a central model per screen that holds the data associated with the current visual appearance generic listener classes like sourcesaddevents customerdto the editor does not like the real symbols for java generics here so i used thoe brackets because otherwise you will have lots of the same interfaces who just differ by the type the views get a reference to the presenter as their constructor parameter so they can initialize their events with the presenter

1238502
spweb	spsite
it seems that you cannot really have a spweb without having a spsite
so if you got the spweb without going through spsite to get it either by doing a new spsite or one being provided to you then you probably do not need to worry about disposing the spsite

1238779
spweb	spsite
so you can safely use it and i would avoid disposing of it lest spweb dependencies go all wonky on you
reflector tells us that this is the code that runs inside the spweb object when you call the site property it s not creating a new spsite object just returning the one it already had which would be up to the spweb.dispose to take care of if necessary

1239202
spweb	spsite
you must have some handle to an spsite before an spweb can be created and that is the same spsite instance you will have when you call spweb.site
let s think through the implications of that - if you do not control the creation of the spsite but one of its child webs is handed to you from external code and you dispose the site when control is returned to the calling code you ve disposed a site they may not be done with

1240713
actionscript	mxml
it is hard to reverse engineer the original mxml from the decompiled actionscript that has been generated from that very mxml source
the generated actionscript is not really a pleasure to work with

1241996
awt	swing
err to answer your question no you don t appear to be able to do that with awt swing has the advantage that it is truly write-once-run-anywhere and it can look exactly the same everywhere
there are look feels that try to make swing look native some are better than others mac isn t terrible windows is okay gtk isn t

1245368
lxml	beautifulsoup
ian bicking agrees and prefers lxml over beautifulsoup
there s no reason to use beautifulsoup anymore unless you re on google app engine or something where anything not purely python isn t allowed

1245446
prng	random
the reason you get different results despite the fact that you are clearing the pool and resetting it is that by default openssl s rand implementation will hash the pid into the output block precisely to ensure that even applications that use the same seed do not get the same prng output since 99.9 of the time that happening is a bad thing
in addition even if this was not the case it is unlikely that your reference application uses the same prng that openssl uses to turn the seed file into a series of random bytes

1246177
realloc	malloc
if you re passing a pointer to a function and you want the pointer value to be overwritten then you need to pass a pointer to that pointer if you want to resize a dynamically allocated buffer use realloc note that is the same as
you should not cast the result of malloc unless you re using an implementation of c that predates the 1989 ansi standard or you intend to compile this code as c++ in which case you should be using new instead of malloc

1246563
lisp	scheme
common lisp deftype doesn t have an exact scheme equivalent
you will have to translate type definitions by hand or write a deftype macro in terms of whatever scheme record library is available in your system

1248913
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	struts	wicket
an example of it is not jsf because in some way jsf is pretty much quite the same with struts since the creator of struts and jsf is the same
a good example of component based framework tapestry and wicket

1249002
inline	inlining
if the property getter is inline should it have been the property s declaring type that was the creator
assuming that inlining of the method that needs to check its caller and permissions aren t a problem you can call the following method in a constructor so for your real question the answer is yes it is possible but not recommended

1249521
postgresql	mysql
not sure if it still applies without changes to postgresql
in mysql it would look something like select title from questions order by was_sent_at_time desc limit 3

1250008
lisp	scheme
while common lisp supports a functional programming style that is not its general focus scheme while not purely functional is much closer
common lisp supports a completely imperative style of programming very well

1250805
uiview	subviews
at this point the view property of the top level uiview will be nulled out it will be released and deallocated
because the uitextfield was set as a property that was retained the uitextfield is not deallocated as it would have been had its only retain been that of the subviews array of the top level view

1252077
jsf	wicket
it s not correct to say the seam is the next step of jsf. seam doesn t have to use jsf as the view layer
it can also use wicket or gwt

1252077
jsf	seam
it s biggest disadvantages are those related to jsf too much reliance on http post which s button link doesn t always solve lots of javascript excessive calls to getter setter nasty looking html
etc there are more than enough pages detailing the shortcomings of jsf elsewhere note that these aren t criticisms of seam - rather of jsf1.x and many are resolved in jsf2.0 i don t believe that seam is the next step for jsf but it and facelets are crucial if you re planning to use jsf1.x right now

1252126
jsf	seam
also icefaces is great with jsf and facelets it works perfectly well with or without an application framework like seam or spring
i like jsf and i evaluated seam not long ago

1252126
jsf	seam
i like jsf and i evaluated seam not long ago
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

1252126
jsf	seam
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3
i was first attracted to seam by the advertised auto-generated scaffolding but i never did get it to work with my enterprise data model

1252641
webkit	gecko
if you re not absolutely committed to webkit i recall something about a project to allow you do something similar with the firefox engine
basically a minimalist window around the gecko renderer plus gears and desktop shortcut for your app

1252756
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp
if you are determined to use udp you will have to implement path mtu discovery in your protocol and prey that the routers firewalls don t block the fragmentation needed icmp packets
which they shouldn t otherwise tcp wouldn t work either

1253795
super	extends
super bit in the latter example is only useful if you plan on connecting a b with an a that isn t for exactly the same type of b
thinking in concrete terms suppose you had an and a circle which extends shape which extends b

1254100
strcpy	strncpy
the programmer must be sure they are fulfilled or he must explicitely test them with additional boilerplate code before calling strcpy already silently assuming the non-overlap and zero-terminated strings
strncpy does include some of these checks but it adds another postcondition the programmer must take care for after calling the function because the result may not be zero-terminated

1254401
ubuntu	centos
i ve just been through this game on ubuntu and the trick was simply to install the right packages including dev packages etc
i m not familiar with centos but somebody will probably chime in with the right packages for that

1254870
jsf	seam	jsf	wicket
if you re going to be using ejb and jsf already seam is killer
if you re going to be using jsf plus any of its related tools like icefaces or richfaces seam pojos can simplify your setup a lot as well as give you access to the life-cycle states that seam provides conversation etc. if you re using ejb with wicket or gwt seam might be able to save you some configuration as well though i ve not personally used it in this configuration

1254870
jsf	seam	wicket	seam
if you re going to be using jsf plus any of its related tools like icefaces or richfaces seam pojos can simplify your setup a lot as well as give you access to the life-cycle states that seam provides conversation etc. if you re using ejb with wicket or gwt seam might be able to save you some configuration as well though i ve not personally used it in this configuration
as has been said seam s disadvantages are inherent in any abstraction framework it s hiding the details from you

1255091
dictionary	map
you have to protect the map dictionary inside a lock so that only one thread at a time can access it
the dictionary is not thread safe so if you let one thread read from it while another thread is changing it you will have problems

1255091
dictionary	map
the dictionary is not thread safe so if you let one thread read from it while another thread is changing it you will have problems
remember that using lock on the map object doesn t protect the map object in itself it s only using the map reference as an identifier to keep more than one thread at a time to run the code inside the lock

1255933
serializable	deserialization
however there is one gotcha only use .net serializable for the very highest level datastructure to get serializable deserialization started and then call the serializable deserialization functions directly for the fields in the highest level datastructure
otherwise there will not be any speed-up... for instance if a particular data structure say generic.list is not supported by the library then .net serializable will used instead and this is a no-no

1257224
uilabel	uitextview
uitextview supports data-detectors in os3.0 whereas uilabel doesn t
if you enable the data-detectors on the uitextview and your text contains urls phone numbers etc

1257709
webclient	httpwebrequest
if that is the issue you ll probably need to refactor to use the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes instead on webclient and configure a more reasonable timeout
webclient does not support user-specified timeouts and iirc has a default timeout of 100 000 msecs 100 seconds

1258558
strcpy	strncpy
otherwise it could happen that the source string is not correctly 0 terminated in which case the strcpy function could write more characters to destination corrupting anything which is in the memory after the destination buffer
this is the buffer-overrun problem used in many exploits also for posix api functions like read which does not put the terminating 0 in the buffer but returns the number of bytes read you will either manually put the 0 or copy it using strncpy

1260726
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
doesn t work in opera 10b but i would expect it to work in the stable version 9.6
this works for me in firefox 3.5 ie8 7c google-chrome 2

1262147
ssl	https
this post is the best resource i have found so far that explains why this setting would be enabled and the pros and cons of enabling it the do not save encrypted pages to disk comes into play when dealing with ssl https connections
just like a web server can send done information about how to cache a file one can basically set internet explorer up to not save files to the cache during an ssl https connection regardless if the web server advises you can

1262272
rpm	yum
i think it would be best if your python dependencies were available as rpms also and declared as dependencies in the rpm
if they aren t available elsewhere create them yourself and put them in your yum repository

1264967
xna	spritebatch
personally i wouldn t use either of these for a 2d game when you already have xna
xna already has some classes for doing 2d graphics the main one being the spritebatch

1264967
xna	spritebatch
xna already has some classes for doing 2d graphics the main one being the spritebatch
if you do use xna not only can you make a game that runs on windows but also one for xbox zune and silverlight as well zune and silverlight require that you don t use the 3d part of xna though but that shouldn t worry you

1267023
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
as a further note if you wanted to truncate the block there s a legal way to do this realloc works both to enlarge and shrink memory blocks but may or may not move the memory to do so
you cannot pass a pointer you did not obtain from malloc or calloc or realloc ... to free

1267023
realloc	malloc
you cannot pass a pointer you did not obtain from malloc or calloc or realloc ... to free
that includes offsets into blocks you did obtain from malloc

1267040
calloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behaviour is undefined
in my experience a double free or the free of the pointer that was not returned via malloc will result in a memory corruption and or crash depending on your malloc implementation

1267954
strdup	malloc
the problem appears to be implement a strdup function without using standard library facilities or subscripting
i m going to make an exception for malloc as there s no reasonable way to do the above without it and i think that using it isn t detrimental to what s being taught

1268799
codeigniter	kohana
even though they aren t as good as codeigniter s they still contain a lot of useful information
however if you want to get the most from the framework i recommend you invest a couple of hours looking through the code of the classes that you use kohana orm and if you re feeling brave database

1269139
explode	substr
so you then have to explode that string using n as a separator and take the first element of the returned array
making sure php substr finishes on a word not a character

1269823
stateless	stateful
silverlight apps are interactive stateful applications not stateless web pages containing information and page requests
web pages can also act as applications through ajax and the like but still are stateless pages

1271456
inline	inlining
to summarize there are few scenarios where you should attempt to take manual control of inlining by placing or omitting inline statements
some common aspects compiler option debug builds usually don t inline and most compilers have options to override the inline declaration to try to inline all or none suitable calling convention varargs functions usually aren t inlined suitable for inlining depends on size of the function call frequency of the function gains through inlining and optimization settings speed vs

1271456
inline	inlining
the great opportunity for inlining is removing code paths that the compiler knows won t be taken - as an extreme example a good compiler would inline foo false but not foo true
with link time code generation foo could reside in a .cpp without a inline declararion and foo false would still be inlined so again inline has only marginal effects here

1274639
firefox	safari
moonlight currently is made up of a few components mono runtime cross platform works on many platforms including powerpc and osx graphics engine cross platform video engine cross platform browser gate currently only supports firefox windowing system integration currently only supports x11 there have been discussions about writing more browser gateways for new browsers but so far it has not been a priority
if moonlight were to be ported to the mac a gate to safari would be necessary

1276345
struts	stripes
if you decide that struts suits you well you could also have a look at stripes a struts-like framework that s based on the same concepts but is less verbose when it comes to configuration with more sensible defaults less xml and support for annotations
large knowledge base. i agree that this perhaps isn t as valid as it used to be but struts has been used in a lot of projects over the years

1279211
.htaccess	httpd.conf
something to keep in mind the way that apache handles .htaccess rules is cascading meaning that it will check every .htaccess along the path of the file you are trying to access so if you have some rule forbidding users from viewing any non-index files at any point it will affect all deeper directories
having said that if you know the issue isn t with the httpd.conf file check to see if the root of the publishing path has a .htaccess

1279402
webclient	httpwebrequest
use the webclient instead which exposes a webresponse.headers property
the httpwebrequest does not permit access to the response headers collection

1280872
junit	jmockit	testng	jmockit
this happens because it keeps track of the current test being executed by the test runner which can be a junit 3.8 a junit 4.5+ or a testng 5.8+ runner. so when not running in the context of a testing framework junit or testng it lacks the necessary test tracking information
jmockit expectations could be changed though

1281258
actionscript	mxml
mxml is simply declarative actionscript so there is no difference between creating your instance in actionscript or using the mxml notation
your function could be changed to or if your actionscript does not have a reference to the display list than you cannot add the custom component to the display list

1281258
actionscript	mxml
your function could be changed to or if your actionscript does not have a reference to the display list than you cannot add the custom component to the display list
adding an mxml based custom component is no different than adding any other displayobject to the display list is the same as both the sprite and the startsplashpage are extensions of displayobject at their core

1281399
nfa	dfa
however the regex implementations in most of today s popular programming languages including .net are what friedl calls traditional nfa engines
one of the most important differences between them and dfa engines is that alternation is not greedy

1281651
tostring	string.format
i took hhafez code and added a memory test i run this separately for each approach the + operator string.format and stringbuilder calling tostring so the memory used will not be affected by other approaches. i added more concatenations making the string as blah + i + blah + i + blah + i + blah
the result are as follow average of 5 runs each approach time ms memory allocated long + operator 747 320 504 string.format 16484 373 312 stringbuilder 769 57 344 we can see that string + and stringbuilder are practically identical time-wise but stringbuilder is much more efficient in memory use. this is very important when we have many log calls or any other statements involving strings in a time interval short enough so the garbage collector won t get to clean the many string instances resulting of the + operator

1281829
bazaar	svn
now i m using bazaar
but the idea is exactly the same except with bazaar i have local history and all that i have an ssh access to the production server like you do i work on linux exclusivly so what i do might not be as easy with windows now how i work everything that has te be on the production server source-code images ... is commited to svn bazarr whatever i work locally with apache php mysql i use a dump of the production db that i import locally once in a while i am the only one working on that project

1281829
bazaar	svn
and forced me to remember the revision number of the time i last pushed to production well it was automatically stored in a file by the script so not that hard what i do now when switching to bazaar i didn t want to rewrite that script which didn t work very well anyway i have dropped the script totally as i have ssh access to the production server i use rsync to synchronise from my development machine to the production server when what i have locally is considered stable production-ready
a couple of notes about that way of doing things i don t have a staging server my local setup is close enough to the production s one not having a staging server is ok for a simple project with one or two developpers if i had a staging server i d probably go with do an svn update on it when you want to stage when it is ok launch the rsync command from the staging server which will ba at the latest stable revision so ok to be pushed to production with a bigger project with more developpers i would probably not go with that kind of setup

1286718
factors	mean
depending on several factors it may or may not work - and for a couple reasons
i take it you mean full-on reversible compatibility

1287679
profiling	debugging
the best way to narrow this down is with a tool such as ants profiling which will show memory leaks and performance issues
you could also turn on asp.net tracing and set debugging true in web.config and get some idea on slow executing code although with all those timeouts this might not be so helpful

1288731
hash-collision	key
note the difference between a key collision and a hash-collision
the hashtable will not allow more than one entry with the same key as in your example you put two entries with the key two the second one 3 replaced the first one 2 and you were left with only the second one in the hashtable

1290070
nunit	mstest
that is not to say that you can t plug any other testing frameworks into cc nunit just happens to be an easy one to use
as for available features mstest has some really nice add-ons when you run it with the fantastically priced visual studio team system with tfs in the back-end

1293324
listview	gridview
i don t think there is any point in using a listview if as you say you cannot use gridview or any other view
i would exchange listview for itemscontrol or listbox if you need a selectable item or any of the other things that listbox offers

1293893
pascal	delphi
but delphi was pascal and he knew nothing about pascal and couldn t be bothered to learn more about it so he chose to develop in powerbuilder for new projects
and i decided to move to a company with a smarter boss who did believe in delphi

1294824
config	ini
the point of this is that the responsibility of config is delegated
each unit doesn t care if the config is stored in a table ini file xml file or even gasp the registry

1294826
queue	fifo
a fifo queue would just be a stack with enqueue being push and dequeue being pop
that doesn t make any sense as an exercise so i d definitely assume a fifo queue was intended

1296201
serializable	deserialization
full cycle serializable deserialization could work reliably only if you are holding both activities in your own hand
if one company implements serializable sends the rdf over to another company that implements the deserialization you cannot expect too much

1296684
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested all combinations of pre-allocating not pre-allocating counting up down and for while loops in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.5 google-chrome and opera
the functions below was consistently the fastest or extremely close in firefox google-chrome and ie8 and not much slower than the fastest in opera and ie 6

1297161
gif	png
for some reason when people are running internet explorer via citrix it changes the mime type for gif and jpg files
jpg image x-citrix-pjpeg gif image x-citrix-gif based on my testing png files are not affected

1297357
cpython	ironpython
you can simply copy the standard library from a cpython install if you prefer although you re better off getting just the modules that the ironpython developers have ensured with with ironpython - this is most of them
modules that are implemented using the cpython c api extension modules will not be available

1298617
swt	swing
we also had this question in company and decided to go with swing because for normal desktop application you just cannot sense the speed difference which is supposedly on swt side and this speed you are buying with ruining wora principle you have to bring with your application needed .dlls or .so files to natively support your application running in desired os-es
for long time swing part of java with printing was weak point of java

1299593
config	ini
readability is one of the main reasons i ve used ini filies for php script config in the past
people who are not coders have run into an ini file at least once before and can understand what it is much easier than even a simple php file

1301010
implements	extends
i don t think there s anything out there that would do all 5 but the other requirements shouldn t be very difficult to implements
perhaps you could get the source to one of these existing plugins and extends it

1301375
division	multiplication
in 64 bits it s okay obviously after the multiplication has overflowed the division isn t going to undo that overflow
because the multiplication overflows 32 bit integers

1302763
directx	gdi
directx is not something you would use to draw simple shapes rather render complicated 3d stuff also using dx api under c# is a bit trickier although not that hard
read about gdi gdi+ system.drawing namespace for example here

realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
this is a limitation of the malloc calloc realloc free api -- and implementations may rely on these limitations for example keeping bookkeeping information about the allocation immediately before the start address which would make moving the start address difficult. now malloc isn t the only allocator out there -- your platform or libraries might provide other ones or you could write your own which gets memory from the system via malloc mmap virtualalloc or some other mechanism and then hands it out to your program in whatever fashion you desire
for c++ if you allocate memory with std malloc the information above applies

1306062
jboss	weblogic
i don t know if the jboss support contract comes with a sales force but would be surprised if it did and that the playing field has leveled in that respect
in my experience other than the pretty console you get with weblogic which isn t worth forking out the license fees for there s not much between the 2

1309174
datamapper	activerecord
the pattern that hibernate adheres most closely is the datamapper pattern
hibernate does not follow activerecord pattern

1309555
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work in google-chrome neither windows nor mac however
as for firefox 3.5 and ie 8.0 no deal

1309557
bazaar	git
i find them much less hassle for smaller projects and if you re using it on more than one machine the whole thing is backed up on both in case of hd issues. any of git mercurial and bazaar are fine choices in general
git on windows still doesn t have a native client although there are ones that work decently through emulators so i d not go with that

1311946
spaces	delimiter
failing that it finds spaces
in perl if you use grouping in the regex when calling split the function returns not only the elements but also the captured groups in this case our delimiter

1314757
postgresql	mysql
as the person that implemented both i can tell you that the reason is that by passing the string through as-is to postgresql and odbc the pdo driver code for those databases does not need to be updated as the underlying library adds new features
since mysql does not have its own connection string parsing code we invented a mechanism for passing data in to the underlying mysql function calls which have a very specific api with fixed parameters

1315361
udp	tcp
it s more a udp datagram connection
in these cases the data isn t a stream which gets packeted by tcp but rather a giant chunk of data

1315636
base	fractions
as for base ten i cannot tell how to handle denominators containing but not being a power of two - for example 12
i can give a hint - repeating decimals in base ten are all fractions with the denominator having at least one prime factors other than two and five

1316950
prepare	execute
this is done as an potential optimization - if you know in advance that you will need to execute the statement many times in a row preparing it upfront can save some work on the database server since it does not have to re- prepare the statement for each call
pg_query_params as well as its simpler version pg_query just execute the statement query directly forcing the database server to re prepare the statement each time the function gets called

1317131
google-chrome	firefox
so the fact that it s firefox that is launched and not google-chrome is normal
if you want to launch google-chrome you will have to use something else than

1317520
perforce	svn
i m not familiar with perforce but i got info from p4 opened
it looks like svn status performs the same function

1318765
perforce	svn
perforce won t affect any part of that - as long as you can make it ignore the .svn dirs
i don t see why not if you can make perforce ignore the .svn directories then a svn wc is just an ordinary directory of files

1318765
perforce	svn
i don t see why not if you can make perforce ignore the .svn directories then a svn wc is just an ordinary directory of files
you can make your changes to those files and commit them as normal using svn - svn simply uses the .svn dirs to detect whether anything has changed and to generate the diffs to send to the repository

1319665
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql this is a fairly common approach to your dilemma
while i ve not tried it in mysql sepecifically it may be worth considering

1323270
jar	war
make the war project have a dependency on the jar project and the jar project have a dependency on aspectjrt
the jar dependencies you want to exclude can be specified as scope provided so they will not be included in the build or excluded by configuring the jar dependency to exclude those transitive dependencies see the transitive dependency exclusion section of the dependency mechanism documentation for details

1323270
jar	war
the jar dependencies you want to exclude can be specified as scope provided so they will not be included in the build or excluded by configuring the jar dependency to exclude those transitive dependencies see the transitive dependency exclusion section of the dependency mechanism documentation for details
when the war is built any compile-scoped dependencies and their transitive dependencies will be bundled into the war s web-inf lib directory aspectjrt will be included as well

1325719
ssl	https
something like that gets you a connect for the ssl connection and then a get for the http portion
connect isn t a http verb it s the start of a https request the ssl connect portion

1327733
listview	gridview
also be sure to look into the new listview and datapager controls
if not then perhaps the gridview is not the appropriate control to build from

1330982
opera	google-chrome
it s very easy in firefox and opera as far as i see
google-chrome and ie not so much

1331518
firefox	safari
i was able to fix this in firefox by doing this i m still getting an issue in safari where the browser refreshes to a blank page with just the content of the document.write and ie6 ie7 doesn t do anything at all
firefox works though

1335107
spaces	delimiter
you should set for spaces not to be considered delimiter more info here
since you work in a version that does not support the above as was clarified after the answer was submitted you have two options find a character you know will not be used in the original text underscore convert all spaces to that character before splitting and convert back after splitting

1335774
postgresql	mysql
in tables with traditional data types integer varchar date numeric etc etc. differences could be for one or the other as appropriate but in stored procedures firebird is much more powerful than postgresql much more simple and elegant
two or three years any linux distribution not including firebird only mysql and postgresl. not for nothing today but tradicionesles distributions ubunutu opensuse fedora centos etc etc and firebird include in their repositories

1336041
postgresql	mysql
i ve been working with postgresql firebird oracle mysql mssql more than 6 years ago and my preferred are firebird and postgresql
i don t like mysql because commercial license is not cheap and mysql lacks of some functions. i you ask me about what is my preferred one between fb and pg..

1337718
translation	localization
i know you re not asking for translation methods but i think the joomfish way of selecting content based in a chosen language would be what you wanted but not based in languages just domains
the only component i know it would be able to suppress articles based in pre defined parameters in its case the language is the joomfish s table localization plugin but you need to be a joomfish silver member paying 60 to joomfish s developers

1337971
vbo	normals
for opengl es on the iphone apple recommends that you place all of the vertices that you can draw at one time in a vertex buffer object vbo and that you interleave the vertex normals color and texture information within that buffer in that order
note that the vbo itself doesn t give you a significant performance boost over a standard array on the original iphones but the 3gs has hardware vbo support

1338116
udp	mtu
for ethernet assuming the 5000 byte payload is not encapsulated in an ip + tcp udp frame you will have 18 bytes of overhead for every packet sent
that means each transmission with an mtu of 1500 will be able to hold 1482 bytes

1340066
valgrind	gprof
caveat i am not familiar with kcachegrind i see now that kcachegrind is using valgrind framework so i would imagine you would be able to run it from your development machine
gprof would be the obvious choice if you are using gcc and i suppose valgrind should work too

1341801
super	implements	super	self
apple documentation implements initializers cocoa-dev self super init debate basically it stems from the idea that a superclass may have over-ridden the designated initializer to return a different object than the one returned from +alloc
if you didn t assign the return value of super s initializer into self then you could potentially be dealing with a partially initialized object because the object that super initialized isn t the same object that you re initializing

1343110
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining
if any of the method s formal arguments are structs the method will not be inline

1343110
inline	inlining
although your method is quite short and not very complex so it might match the heuristics is a struct so i d guess your method is not inline
as a rule of thumb if inlining this method improves performance the jit will inline this method

1344869
django	web.py
pylons is not that much simpler than django and it doesn t seem to have the same community
for lightweight apps i would recommend web.py

1344876
icmp	udp
instead you should just start receiving and the only way to tell that the remote socket may have dropped off is if you get a 0 byte packet or you get an icmp response from it
since you are using udp you cannot connect to the remote target

1346835
fileoutputstream	filewriter
in sun java 6 you can just use fileoutputstream
it will automatically create a new file if the file doesn t exist or overwrite an existing file if it exists note for writing text files what is what you seem to want to do use a writer for example filewriter instead of using an outputstream directly

1350540
innodb	myisam
if innodb doesn t exist mysql will automatically substitute myisam unless you change the default sql_mode to avoid this substitution
innodb has been around since mysql 4.0 and compiled in to most releases except for some special ones - like what is given to oem vendors

1350641
realloc	malloc
if you allocate the initial buffer using malloc you can use realloc to resize the buffer
you shouldn t use realloc to resize a new -ed buffer

1351741
serializable	deserialization
for example if a i serializable an object over the wire perhaps i send it from a client to a server via rmi and then do it again in separate rmi calls then the 2 deserialized objects on the server will not be
however in a single serialization a single client-server message which is a graph containing the same object multiple times then upon deserialization identity is preserved

1351929
division	modulo
modulo is the remainder not division
the sign is often used for the modulo in lieu of the word mod

1352521
xrange	enumerate
if you measure properly you ll see there s essentially no difference enumerate is microscopically faster than xrange in this example but well within noise btw i always recommend using timeit at the shell prompt like this not within code or at the interpreter prompt as you re doing just because the output is so nicely formatted and usable with units of measure of time and everything
in your code you have an extra assignment in the enumerate case you assign the list item to v in the for header clause then again assign v to elem

1352540
postgresql	mysql
if this is sql server oracle or postgresql yes you can use a check constraint
if it s mysql check constraint s are recognized but not enforced

1353225
ironruby	ironpython
have not tried ironruby but i ll assume it can work in a roughly equivalent way and speed
ironpython ironruby ironpython in action will do a better job explaining this and exactly how best to use ironpython that can possibly be accommodated in a so answer

1355105
firefox	safari
parts of html 5 are supported by safari firefox and opera but they are not necessarily incorporating the same parts
it seems that firefox is the most ahead from my experience but it will be years before the majority of browsers users use will support it

1355214
profiling	instrumentation
that s obviously a more complication solution and i m not sure it ll work without compile-time support so hopefully the profiling tool is feasible for your situation
or is it sufficient to instrumentation the application running in a test environment

1355470
serializable	deserialization
well if you cannot change the way the instance is handled change the way it serializable
implement system.runtime.serialization.iserializable and just set the initial state in the deserialization constructor required when implementing the interface

1358144
profiling	instrumentation
the best approach is to unsign the assembly for the profiling run
the reason you can not instrumentation a signed assembly is that the instrumentation process changes the contents of the assembly

1358945
mvp	presenter
in both mvp and mvc the view is supposed to be as dumb as possible and really should not be responsible for processing anything...commands actions input etc
should all be the responsibility of the controller or presenter

1359270
innodb	myisam
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam
that said with innodb you wouldn t need to re-order the table but you would lose the blazing speed of myisam

1360658
serializable	deserialization
you would just serializable the elements in the hashset but not the keys
deserialization restoring an object from a serial representation and ensuring the invariants of the object

1362499
profiling	debugging
don t profiling or otherwise judge performance in the debugging configuration
the debugging configuration isn t intended to be fast and you may make performance conclusions which are wrong like the idea that partial views user controls are slow

1363071
inline	inlining
but there are some counter example to it in java defining getter setter instead of defining public member variables does not result in performance degradation as the jit inline the getter setter
sometimes calling a function repetedly may be better than performing inlining as the code executed may then fit in the cache

1363119
nsmutablestring	nsstring
since nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring you may have been given a mutable string at assignment so other code may modify the string s value without your knowledge unless you are using key-value observing to observe those changes
for this reason it is usually appropriate to use copy semantics for properties that you intend to hold an immutable value nsstring nsdata nsarray nsset are the common--though not exaustive--suspects

1363524
vb.net	vb6
it also makes other changes and additions to the language but contrasting vb.net with vb is not possible because they are the same thing
what you can do is contrast with vb.net with vba or vb6 or vbscript or some other variant of visual basic

1363582
gridview	repeater
see scott mitchell s why i don t use datasets in my asp.net applications for some details about datareader performance - as long as you aren t optimizing prematurely it s quite good advice. instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater
i m not sure whether you meant the gridview control or just a conceptual grid - the basic architecture would be the same for a gridview then add a handler to the repeater.itemdatabound that checks if the child data reader s current record matches

1363831
nunit	mstest
they use nunit for that project i believe
even microsoft s open source code prism composite wpf doesn t use mstest

1363832
nunit	mstest
integrating nunit with vs08 doesn t seem to the biggest problem on the other hand getting vs with built in testing framework might be a bit harder at least for some people
personally i m using vs ts so no test units in mstest wouldn t turn anything off for me

1364161
ssl	https
the server will need to support ssl for that if you re using apache make sure you have mod_ssl
make sure to use https not http if you want a secure connection

1365122
implements	extends
i m not sure whether this is especially pythonic but you could use operator overloading this is of course far more expensive to implements than your example and i would be wary of too much meta-programming but it was a fun exercise
you can extends or use this as you see fit

1367360
postgresql	mysql
but i m using postgresql
i d love to use spatial data types for another project but i m going to have to do a hack or change databases to deal with mysql s insistance that they be not null

1367563
ienumerable	ilist
if ienumerable has everything you need then you could be even more generic and use that instead
if you use the second form you ll be able to call methods on mylist that are part of the list class but not part of the ilist interface without a cast

1369193
jms	jta
similar to servlet-api and jms the individual implementers provide their own copies of the api and providing the sun jar can muck them up
i believe that you should not be specifying the jta jar as a runtime requirement but rather as a provided requirement

1370561
ubuntu	linux
the reason why it can happen is that ubuntu system you re compiling at is newer and forward compatibility is not preserved in linux libraries
you may install on your ubuntu box the compiler that fits the version of the library on your server

1370663
spaces	linefeed
the error that you get header may not contain... is only triggered if the string you pass as an argument to header contains a linefeed character that is not followed by either a spaces or a tab which would continue the header on the next line
now setcookie will actually urlencode its value setrawcookie will not so a linefeed will not cause an error there

1370742
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
debian and ubuntu use .deb redhat and fedora use .rpm etc
there are tools for making application bundles for linux but they re not used often

1371692
implements	extends
i am working with java the hole day and my colleagues and i are using interface idialog abstract abstractdialog class defaultdialog warningdialog abstract classes implements most common interface methods or most used util methods
you do not have to extends from the abstract class

1373852
postgresql	mysql
i have used both and even migrated projects from mysql to postgresql and in my experience postgresql was the better choice
for my applications it was at least on par speed wise with mysql and offered needed features not found in mysql

1374768
calloc	malloc
it s probably because the return value of calloc was null
the amount of physical ram in your box does not directly correlate to how much memory you can allocate with calloc malloc realloc

1376454
awt	swing
but if the component falls out side the bounds it is automatically substituted with a awt heavy weight component that has it s own native drawing surface outside the active window
it s not possible with the custom renderer since swing components are light weight

1376972
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i try to use sortedlist as much as possible because it allows me to iterate over the keys and value collections
this is not possible with sorteddictionary as far as i know

1378366
dictionary	map
but on the same python object you provide a property which will be kind-of proxy for this mapped string field of type dictionary . code example not tested
if you need to map a 1-n relation and map it as dictionary rather then list then read dictionary based collections but if you mean a field then what you can do it to have a db field of type string which is mapped to your python object

1379598
implements	extends
if you want to do it cleanly you d need to implements your own scrollpaneui and set that as the jscrollpane s ui with setui
unfortunately you can t just extends basicscrollpaneui and disable its mouse wheel listener because the relevant member variables are private and there aren t any flags or guards on the scrollpaneui s installation of its mousewheellistener

1382596
factors	mean
this is possible w o any wait if you actually split the execution stack up to the for-loop you execute on the calling thread after the for-loop you finish on the last queue thread whether this will work or not depends on many factors and i can t say w o knowing more about the caller context if is possible to suspend its execution on the calling thread and resume it on a queued thread
btw by exit thread i do not mean an abrupt thread abort but a gracious return and the entire calling stack is prepared to hand over execution context to the queue thread

1383721
dictionary	map
when a few extra microseconds per translation are no big deal one might want to consider the bu approach simply for its convenience only needs a translation dictionary for hopefully few special characters that don t translate correctly with the underlying unicodedata idea
so here are three approaches more or less as given or suggested in other answers run as main this emits or wikipédia le projet d encyclopédie ae wikipedia le projet d encyclopedie ud wikipedia le projet dencyclopedie tr wikipedia le projet d encyclopedie showing clearly that the unicodedata-based approach while it does have the convenience of not needing a translation map xtd can t translate all characters properly in an automated fashion it works for accented letters but not for the reverse-apostrophe so it would also need some auxiliary step to deal explicitly with those no doubt before what s now its body

1384783
client-side	server-side
it s generally not a great idea to store large chunks of data in client-side cookies both for security and compatibility reasons
instead i would recommend using something like cgi session which will give you automatic session cookies and you can store the data in a table or file on the server-side

1385686
boost	allocator
boost just says not to store objects which may throw exceptions
so if you allocate memory you just have to be able to handle the case where allocator fails

1387189
division	addition	addition	multiplication
then it processes operators first exponentiation then multiplication and division together and finally addition and subtraction together
because well-formed input is expected as specified in the challenge it doesn t check for the addition operator explicitly since it s the last legal operator after all the others are processed

1388394
vsto	add-in
vsto does not create com add-in
you will need to install your add-in on non-development machines

1390061
division	subtract
the division in your example is probably a bad idea because it changes the scale of the output variable depending on which side is better
generally when comparing two quantities you either want interval data subtract one from the other or ratio data divide one by the other but not both

1395708
vb6	vba
...and scroll down to the end miscellaneous i18n resources on this site. much of that information is out of date for .net and other programming but it s still going to apply to vb6 access vba
here s an article that suggests a number of directions you might go in using unicode in visual basic 6 access s vba is an superset of vb6 then you ll probably want to muck around with these access vba functions strconv ascb chrb that doesn t resolve all of it but that should give you a starting point

1399006
innodb	myisam
usually this is avoided by not using noddy myisam and going to innodb instead which has row-level locking amongst other desirable database features
the problem of course is that you only get fulltext search with myisam

1399006
innodb	myisam
personally i now tend to store everything in the innodb table including the text and store a second copy of the text in the myisam table purely for fulltext searchbait purposes
this simplifies queries and code and brings the advantages of innodb s consistency to the text content and i also use it to process the searchbait to get stemming and other features mysql s fulltext doesn t normally support

1399211
implements	extends
class b extends a implements runnable is valid java syntax but doesn t really do anything
by extends a b is runnable

1399422
robocopy	xcopy
i couldn t work out how to use the built-in msbuild copy command because everything to do with msbuild is designed to maximally painful so i used robocopy instead
robocopy is the replacement of xcopy

1400676
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not allow you to use key-events at all
firefox is the most benign but still sketchy--like internet explorer

1401747
centos	linux
centos 5 isn t listed in the operating systems and software provided by amazon but according to this thread centos 5 is very close to rhel centos 5 is 99.9 red hat enterprise linux 5
with exception to the yum update process used within centos the only difference between the two is the name

1403134
cpython	ironpython
2 the libraries in ironpython are very different than cpython
the python libraries are a fair bit behind - quite a few of the cpython-accessible libraries will not work currently under ironpython

1403134
cpython	ironpython
however ironpython has clean direct access to the entire .net framework which means that it has one of the most extensive libraries natively accessible to it so in many ways it s far ahead of cpython
some of the numpy scipy libraries do not work in ironpython but due to the .net implementation some of the functionality is not necessary since the perf

1403265
rsa	3des
is freeeware and with sorce code unfortunately does not implement rsa
hi bruce i use this library since delphi 5 delphi encryption compedium part i v.5.2 complete rewrite of the former dec 3 update to the dec 5.1 released back in 2006 many ciphers blowfish twofish 3des rijndael ... many hashs md2 4 5 sha1-512 ripemd128-320... checksum functions crc32 crc16... text conversion functions mime base 64 xx uu coding... secure random number functions with ciphers encryption in modes cts cbc cfb ofb ecb... full and easy object oriented highly optimized fast core supports ansi and unicode in d2009 and below by using widestrings .

1403346
cpython	ironpython
scipy is huge and sprawling and chock full of c-coded and fortran-coded extensions i have no first-hand experience but i suspect less than half will even run much less run flawlessly under any implementation except cpython
ironpython should make it easier via .net approaches but cpython is not that far via com implementation in win32all

1403346
cpython	ironpython
ironpython should make it easier via .net approaches but cpython is not that far via com implementation in win32all
last but not least by all means check out the book ironpython in action -- as i say every time i recommend it i m biased by having been a tech reviewer for it and by friendship with one author but i think it s objectively the best intro to python for .net developers and at the same time the best intro to .net for pythonistas

1403598
delphi	oxygene
given the comments the answer probably is there is not yet structural syntax highlighting for delphi prism - you might also want to contact the people at devexpress or hook the people at devexpress up with the people at remobjects
remobjects is the company that developed the whole delphi prism language and visual studio ide integration that product is called oxygene

1405882
3des	aes
3des md5 sha-1 are already considered not enough
attacks against aes have been recently published

1410736
tabcontrol	tabitem
it will behave this way if you use the mvvm or presentationmodel pattern and load viewmodels as the items for your tabcontrol and use datatemplates for the views
if you just put tabitem into the tabcontrol with controls inside of them it will not behave this way however

1410737
postgresql	mysql
edit there is another option of embedding r inside postgresql using joe conway s pl r
just for completeness you have two more options rodbc which is very mature and feature-complete but doesn t correspond to the dbi framework as the postgresql mysql sqlite oracle .

1412936
boost	stl
i work on the parallel pattern library so i m using critical_section from vs2010 beta boost mutex works great too and the raii pattern of using a lock_guard is almost necessary regardless of how you choose to do this
there isn t one that i know of the closest is in thread building blocks which has concurrent_unordered_map the stl containers allow concurrent read access from multiple threads as long as you don t aren t doing concurrent modification

1413884
richtextbox	textblock
if you need text highlighting formatting then maybe you want to use richtextbox
if you do not expect much more than ten-thousands of search results in your application a textblock control or readonly multiline textbox will suffice by far

1415014
pascal	delphi
to squeeze that last 1 you might even have to maintain several versions optimized per processor and if newer processors and an improved pascal compiler comes along you re not going to benefit from it
this delphi code is faster than your fastest assembler code it s fast because the operations can be done with registers only instead of needing to store and fetch memory

1415678
.htaccess	httpd.conf
assuming this goes in your local .htaccess
if that goes in your httpd.conf i believe it s a minor change to but i m not 100 sure about this because i rarely do it this way

1416090
mef	prism
we currently ship mef for .net 3.5 on codeplex
as far as prism with mef the challenge at this point is you need to write a bunch of code as prism does not yet have implementations of the services necessary to talk to mef one option is to use the mef unity integration layer we have in mef contrib mefcontrib.codeplex.com

1416090
mef	prism
as far as prism with mef the challenge at this point is you need to write a bunch of code as prism does not yet have implementations of the services necessary to talk to mef one option is to use the mef unity integration layer we have in mef contrib mefcontrib.codeplex.com
it enables unity and mef to talk back to one another thus you can using the existing prism source with mef through the unity bridge

1416197
uiview	calayer
calayer will let it s delegate the uiview draw into a cgcontextref
it is one context per uiview so you can not use cgblendmode to blend several views since it will only function within one single uiview context

1416197
uiview	calayer
it is one context per uiview so you can not use cgblendmode to blend several views since it will only function within one single uiview context
blending of calayer should be done using the filter properties

1416610
postgresql	mysql
generically you can do it by using a case statement with a sum select voteable_id sum case when vote then 1 else -1 end as vote_score from votes group by voteable_id note that this is ansi sql so will work across sqlite mysql postgresql oracle sql server db2 etc. etc
to get your top n posts you would simply append to the above query order by vote_score desc limit 10 limit is used by postgresql and sqlite a bit differently in mysql and not in oracle or sql server as an fyi

1416700
hex	binary
you can open the file in a hex editor which is a text editor that is more sensitive to binary data
i am not very familiar with mac software but a free hex editor can be downloaded at

1416726
octal	binary
in hexadecimal octal as characters etcetera
edit to elaborate on binary data can mean absolutely anything a binary bit pattern that that is output by say a compiler cannot be distinguished from the identical binary bit pattern output by say some random user-defined application

1421320
equals	icomparable
since you have defined equality in the methods of that interface you also need to override the equals method and equality operator to ensure the results from the two are consistent
in the above example i have implemented icomparable but not overridden equals

1421320
equals	compareto	icomparable	compareto
in the above example i have implemented icomparable but not overridden equals
if you call compareto with two separate instances of the class that have the same value it will say there are equal

1421320
equals	compareto
if you call compareto with two separate instances of the class that have the same value it will say there are equals
if you call equals with the same two instances it will say they are not equals as it will test to see if they are the same object the default implementation of equals

1421320
equals	gethashcode
if you call equals with the same two instances it will say they are not equals as it will test to see if they are the same object the default implementation of equals
two equals items should return the same hash code which are used for quickly finding items used as keys in hash tables so if you override equals then you should also override gethashcode as an example i just created the following class in my ide and ran resharper s helpful generate equality function saying that i wanted both a and b to affect equality

1421757
apache	nginx
if you ve got enough memory already then it shouldn t be an issue whether its passenger or apache just optimize and cache your app efficiently
i d second for passenger + nginx

1424871
strcpy	strncpy
also note that you ensured enough space for data in send buf so you can use strcpy safely
strncpy does not terminate the output string when the limit is reached - prone to errors

1427865
jar	war
also note that if the 3rd-party jar is a properly-defined maven project it s dependencies will be defined in its pom.xml
those transitive dependencies are also bundled into the war unless you have them defined with a non-default scope in which case they might not be

1428298
awt	swing
edit if panela is an awt component you will be hard pressed to get panelb to overlap
from sun s article entitled mixing heavy and light components do not mix lightweight swing and heavyweight awt components within a container where the lightweight component is expected to overlap the heavyweight one

1429215
updatepanel	scriptmanager
this is one of the key reasons i decided not to use updatepanel the asynchronous post-back causes almost all of the page life-cycle events to happen and makes it very hard to actually see what s happening in complex situations like this - the only time i ve used an updatepanel in anger was on my personal site to wrap around a data grid to save the whole page reload when working with large sets of data
in the postback request the scriptmanager id operates as the parameter

1429273
innodb	myisam
innodb needs resources and it will not work well with defaults a lot
tuning myisam from defaults rarely gives more than 2-3 times gain while it can be as much as 10-50 times for innodb tables in particular for write intensive workloads

1430171
vim	emacs
vim doesn t have this included in it s default distribution and the project there for integrating gdb and vim was nearly impossible to get working with macvim
the biggest difference for me in choosing to use emacs over vim was the built in gdb support in emacs

1430188
vim	emacs
there is a huge difference on a day-to-day level - vim or any vi variant is inherently modal you go into command modes where you cannot edit and emacs along with most other editors are not
sure using menus and such you don t have to actually enter command mode in vim - at first

1430200
vim	emacs
on the downside vimscript is relatively similar to today s dynamic languages while elisp doesn t resemble pretty much anything more extendible excellent support for gnu tools the bunch of them personally i prefer vim - it is small does what it s supposed to do and when i wish a full blown ide i open vs
emacs s approach of being an editor which wants to be an ide or should i say an os but is not quite is imho outdated

1433315
vim	emacs
even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim
the text below is my opinion it should not be taken as fact or an insult with emacs you are expected to have it open 24 7 and live inside the program almost everything you do can be done from there

1433568
fgets	getchar
fgets read input until n or end of file followed by sscanf parse a string for input is safe from buffer overruns and will absorb any extra input and line terminating n flushing stdout after the printf isn t normally needed for terminal io but can be if you re piping it to a disk typically when you re logging a crashing program it will lose the most interesting bit just before the crash if you don t fflush
because fgets reads up to and including the end of the line there are no characters left in the buffer so you only need one getchar and slightly awkward input such as 1234 space enter doesn t cause the program to terminate without pausing

1434630
equals	icomparable
or just override equals and object.gethashcode on your class without implementing any interfaces
icomparable is not normally used to compare for equality it s used for ordering so ignores it

1435433
erlang	ocaml
i think ocaml is a great way to get started in fp and erlang is not very difficult once you have the basic fp concepts down
but the suggestion from aneccodeal is fantastic-- if you are interested in ocaml and have a friend who is already strong in it by all means develop a concurrency perhaps mpi library for it

1435831
erlang	lisp
clojure is concurrent so learning a little bit of erlang will help though you will need to keep in mind that erlang includes a lot about distributed programming while clojure is all about concurrent programming that is not necessarily distributed
clojure is a lisp so learning other lisp will help a lot in getting used to the parts of the lisp culture or general way of doing things

1436515
profiling	instrumentation
i got it to work only with my development provisioning profiling which is not my distribution profiling
i also made sure i have the same provisioning profiling in project and target and turned on get-task-allow in entitlements.plist it sometimes still doesn t work and then i restart xcode unplug plugin my iphone clean the target and run instrumentation from xcode via start with performance tool this is by the way with xcode 3.1 sdk 3.0. hope this gets less painful with sdk 3.1 which i m downloading now

1441389
nfa	dfa
there s a dfa nfa library on scala as well though it is not particularly a good one
it supports conversion from arbitrary regular expressions ie the literals need not be characters into dfa nfa

1442744
implements	extends
you don t have to implements the list from scratch you just inherit from it and override methods such as insertitem and removeitem to implements custom rules add calls insertitem under the hood
is not a partial class so you can t extends it using your own partial classes

1442901
udp	tcp
for heartbeats use udp not tcp
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

1443077
ubuntu	linux
since regular release testing covers ubuntu i would not worry about functionality of created libraries -- if there s .so it should work
the recommended way to use the boost c++ libraries on linux is via shared linking

1444060
inline	inlining
the compiler can inline whatever it wants in case inlining doesn t violate the code semantics and it can reach the function code
it can also inline selectively - do inline when it feels it s a good idea and not inline when it doesn t feel it s a good idea or when it would violate the code semantics

1444060
inline	inlining
it can also inline selectively - do inline when it feels it s a good idea and not inline when it doesn t feel it s a good idea or when it would violate the code semantics
some compilers can do inlining even if the function is in another translation unit - that s called link-time code generation

1445064
actionscript	mxml
compiling without flex builder you can also use flex builder flash builder without using the flex framework -- meaning you can program in the ide and use only actionscript classes that aren t part of the framework the classes you d use if you programmed in flash and not flex builder
you can choose to use or not use mxml

1445064
actionscript	mxml
you can even use mxml to auto-generate actionscript that s not part of the flex framework your own custom classes
using mxml for your own classes good luck

1446070
vim	textmate
not sure if you were referring to vim s own tabs there or pining for textmate s
it s unclear what vim version you re using but it s had tabs since at least 7.0 which seems to be installed everywhere i look lately and they re awesome

1446881
google-chrome	firefox
it works for ie and google-chrome
only firefox doesn t seem to be working for me

1447993
multiplying	subtract
so you have to do or to preserve precision multiplying and dividing by whole numbers works normally
for instance to divide by 6 you can simply write and in the case of dividing by a power of 2 adding and subtract whole numbers though doesn t work naively

1448597
lisp	smalltalk
but smalltalk isn t a modern language in many ways it s a dialect of lisp so its heritage is 1950s even though it only arrived in the 1970s and the improvement is made to the implementation not the language
the same improvement exists in the sun java runtime the google javascript runtime and many common lisp runtimes

1449319
vim	emacs
vrapper doesn t give you full vim emulation but you can bounce around your code using vim shortcuts and you don t loose any of the goodness of eclipse
vim is without a shadow of a doubt the best editor in the world come get me emacs guys

1449812
decimal	ieee
the latest revision of the ieee 754 2008 standard does indeed define hardware decimal floating point numbers using the representations shown in the software referenced in the question
the previous version of the standard ieee 754 1985 did not provide decimal floating point numbers

1450998
rational-numbers	fractions
the reason for the exception is that an int does not hold rational-numbers basically fractions
so trying to parse 0.3 to a int is nonsense. a double or a float datatype can hold rational-numbers

1451684
inline	inlining
about inlining now some true code can be put inside the headers usually by prefixing it with the keyword inline
again this is not really true code the compiler and the linker will figure what to do with it but it can either move the function code into an object file and have all the other object files link with it there inline the code where the inlined function is used the two solution above at the same time but the inlined function could well disappear from the binary if it is not used

1451846
lisp	scheme
common lisp although does not have native continuations allows to create delimited continuations using cps transformers like cl-cont
so generators in common lisp can be written in pretty much the same way as scheme generators

1453063
vim	emacs
i can totally understand why someone not already familiar with emacs wouldn t want to use viper-mode but as someone coming from vim you really have the opportunity to get the best of both worlds
in general get used to the fact that viper-mode isn t perfect learn how to do the things you re missing from it the emacs way and make sure you explore the cool features that emacs has that aren t available in vim

1453512
hex	binary
reflector comes up with some source which would compile to the same binary code - it doesn t know whether you used a hex literal or a decimal one etc
you can change the number format it uses under view options disassembler forcing it to hex or decimal or leaving it to decide

1454034
ssl	https
not sure about any java or spring specifics but in general 1 set up an ssl cert on your server
2 forward or link to an absolute url with https at the beginning when going to login page 3 forward to an absolute url with after successful authentication

1455170
punctuation	words
with x replace all punctuation and math symbols .
+ with a space dashes are not replaced add percent back slash underscore carat asterisk equal sign curly braces question and exclamation marks pipes dollar and cents signs pound sign tabs crlf replace all digits with a space replace all one letter words with a space pattern space single-character-wildcard space remove redundant spaces

1457900
subtraction	addition
i couldn t take off the last term because then it wouldn t be in range and i couldn t remove the subtraction from the mod as that could result in a value over the top end of the interval
instead i had to subtract the lower value from the initial addition to compensate

1459435
freemarker	velocity
freemarker is also a lot more flexible in my experience
velocity isn t really under active development any more

1461800
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
assuming you know the type have an instance of it and that the method is actually public note that i m doing case-sensitive name matching here which wouldn t work with your sample
if you want to be case-insensitive it s slightly harder but still doable - personally i d advise you to make the xml match the method if at all possible

1465055
innodb	myisam
it means what it says your installation of mysql is compiled or configured not to provide any support for the innodb database backend
the alternative and default database backend myisam is largely undesirable as it does not offer the data-integrity features that robust applications require

1465228
move	drag
whatever it is matters because placement of elements in wpf is highly dependent on the parent container. it s easy to move something 20px to the right inside a canvas just add to canvas.left but it s much harder to do so in a grid you have to deal with column columnspan and margin
there s a code project article describing how to drag elements inside a canvas dragging elements in a canvas if you want to move just that circle and not other controls in an existing canvas grid

1465464
implements	extends
namevaluecollection does not directly implements the icollection interface. instead namevaluecollection extends nameobjectcollectionbase
this implements the icollection interface and the overloaded add system.string method is not implemented in the namevaluecollection class

1468158
imperative	declarative
imperative programming sequentially executes statements that may manipulate an underlying state
some imperative programming in java note that if you do the above out of order it would result in a null pointer exception declarative programming doesn t have a state or order just declarations

1468158
imperative	declarative
some imperative programming in java note that if you do the above out of order it would result in a null pointer exception declarative programming doesn t have a state or order just declarations
here is a simple example - this xml snippet could be considered declarative it doesn t talk about how the customer object will get built just declares the parts

1468347
gif	png
i use this css hack for giving ie 7 a gif file and everything else a 24 bit png with transparency
yes ie 6 supports sprites but doesn t support 24 bit png transparency

1468419
lisp	scheme
this is not entirely language-agnostic in lisp you can actually return any number of values from a function including but not limited to none one two .
defun returns-two-values values 1 2 the same thing holds for scheme and dylan

1469796
ethernet	wireless
if this is in fact its own isolated network then you are right there really isn t a need for the ethernet connectivity at all
the overhead you will see on the wireless is huge your no overhead ideal data rate is 250kbit sec running zigbee on 802.15.4 2.4ghz point to point your real data throughout is usually around 20kbit sec

1469938
set	bag	union	distinct
the set operation performed is in this case set union while for removeemployeeobject and removeemployees it is set difference of course
because core data represents a to-many relationship using a nsset a collection of distinct elements not a nscountedset a set that can contain duplicate elements also known as a bag

1469938
set	bag
because core data represents a to-many relationship using a nsset a collection of distinct elements not a nscountedset a set that can contain duplicate elements also known as a bag
and because a set is an unordered collection therefore appending does not make sense as it does instead for an array or list

1472383
profiling	debugging
the pb call blocks until the profiling browser is exited note just closing the window with the wm destroy button doesn t seem to cause it to return - only the exit menu item seems to so your server is hung until you dismiss the window but for debugging purposes that seems like it may be fine
after looking over the guppy website and not finding any information about how to launch the profiling browser there i started looking around the guppy source and eventually found guppy heapy prof.py at the end of which i saw a docstring containing this line then remembering that i had see some documentation giving the return type of guppy.hpy as use i checked to see if guppy.hpy .pb would do anything

1473930
webclient	httpwebrequest
the webclient is a very dumbed down wrapper for httpwebrequest
webclient is great if you just doing very simple consumption of services or posting a bit of xml but the tradeoff is that it s not as flexible as you might want it to be

1476642
multiplying	multiplication
i really doubt that java has multiplying methods for point or vector classes because a canonical definition of a concept like multiplication is not possible for these objects
there are a few operations generally called products dot product cross product complex multiplication by identification of the complex and the euclidean plane but they all have properties that strongly differ from the properties of the usual real multiplication

1477008
pascal	delphi
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there
to add to the answer of phoenix i associate leading underscores with c c++ not with delphi

1478775
multiplication	modulo
if not then it might not be worth slowing down all the multiplication operations with an extra lookup
and if you do use the lookup idea definitely do not use a modulo

1480214
imperative	declarative
that does not mean the imperative approach is useless
there are times when it is not possible to apply handlers declarative

1480380
openssl	m2crypto
m2crypto is a python wrapper around openssl
the api is pretty much a straight translation of openssl s into python so the somewhat sketchy documentation shouldn t be too much of a problem

1480380
openssl	m2crypto
the api is pretty much a straight translation of openssl s into python so the somewhat sketchy documentation shouldn t be too much of a problem
if the public key encryption algorithm you need to use is supported by m2crypto then you could very well use it to do your public key cryptography

1481487
ssl	https
edit if you are using ssl tunneling proxy authentication is a bad idea
proxy using basic auth over https is not secure when the ssl is tunneled

1482273
comparator	comparable
you ll be able to access the comparator method on things typed e
not everything is comparable

1482711
boost	allocator
also this doesn t help you with the non-crt memory allocator functions heapalloc globalalloc localalloc virtualalloc etc though boost almost certainly uses the crt functions
if the allocator number is consistent you could use _crtsetbreakalloc to set a breakpoint when that allocator occurs to see what code is allocator the memory

1482799
actionscript	mxml
mxml is not rendered directly it is first compiled into actionscript 3.0 and then into a typical swf.
so you cannot serve your users with mxml

1483828
cpython	pypy
cpython has its own dedicated virtual machine
for completeness other implementations not yet recommended for production use include pypy a highly flexible implementation that supports many possible back-ends including but not limited to .net

1485051
gridview	sqldatasource	gridview	repeater
here is the code from my example - nothing tricky here just bound a string array to a repeater and bound the gridview to a sqldatasource with the select and delete commands specified
all i can think is that your datasource doesn t have the delete command method specified but you d get a clear error about this or that you don t have the datakeynames specified in the gridview but you d get a clear error about that as well

1486132
vb.net	vb6
first thing to note is that you definitely do not have to use vb.net with the interop forms toolkit you can just use your c# code directly
check out these two codeproject articles vb6 - c# interop form toolkit interop forms toolkit 2.0 tutorial in the second article there is a class called activexcontrolhelpers if you look in there you ll see how to wire-up your usercontrol to have the events flow seemisly across vb 6.0 to .net

1488584
strtol	atoi
the atoi function has been deprecated by strtol and should not be used in new code
i would use the strtol equivalent just for that reason but i doubt you have to worry about atoi being removed

1488675
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining
the methods would most likely all get inline

1489476
profiling	debugging
you need to debugging with a development profiling and use the ad-hoc profiling only for distributing non-debuggable copies
the ad-hoc profiling doesn t support debugging

1494124
factors	mean
on the other hand note that even if log n is not likely to exceed 50 a performance factors of 10 is really huge -- if you re compute-bound a factors like that can easily make or break your application
if that s not enough for you you ll frequently see factors of log n 2 or logn 3 in algorithms so even if you think you can ignore one factors of log n that doesn t mean you can ignore more of them

1499465
innodb	myisam
also a killer on innodb not about locking rather about sync disk io waits
3 fulltext myisam not usable for read-write tables because of locking

1499791
yslow	pagespeed
additionally if you are looking to optimize a page yslow can provide other advice though it doesn t give you the specific data you re asking for
there is a plugin for firefox that supports this need pagespeed - this tool will let you record web activity live and then view each portion of requests

1501641
mp3	wav
with audio files in a compressed format like mp3 transforming the compressed data back into time-domain samples would be so insanely difficult to do in javascript that i would found a religion around you if you managed to do it successfully
update after reading your question again i realized that it might actually be possible to do what you re discussing in javascript even if the files are in mp3 format and not wav

1502428
xna	slimdx
so if you change to xna you support for directx 9 but not directx 10 or 11 soon
so if you really want to replace managed directx you should have a look at slimdx

1505860
datalist	repeater
edit i was actually thinking of the datalist new name for the old listview as canavar mentions but the new listview is so flexible i d bet you can use it as well
the repeater does not have it the listview however does

1510448
daemons	systemd
if the daemons function doesn t exist on the systemd you re using you need to use setsid and fork instead
on linux look at the daemons function int daemons int nochdir int noclose

1510699
equals	compareto
for example add method defined in core set interface specifies that you can t add an element to the set if there already is an element whose equals method would return true with this new element as argument
well sortedset doesn t use equals it uses compareto

1510699
equals	compareto
well sortedset doesn t use equals it uses compareto
so if your compareto returns false your element will be added even if equals were to return true thus breaking the set contract

1511864
equals	compareto
as chssply76 wrote in a comment you can use hashcode to decide the compareto call in the case where two collections have the same size but are not equals
this works fine except in the rare case where you have two collections with the same size are not equals but have the same hashcode

1512183
clang	llvm
you can also change the compiler from gcc 4.x to clang llvm
that displays more errors and clang warnings one example is that nslog a value is value will warn you you are not passing in enough parameters

1512587
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equal

1513398
django	turbogears
and although django is making many of the same mistakes zope2 did they are also fixing them much faster so i completely expect much of this discussion to be moot in five years because i expect every single python web framework to use wsgi+webob+repoze+deliverance+buildout as a base by then
but even then i d go for frameworks where i can use the zope component architecture and zodb but that includes not only the ones made by the zope community but also for example turbogears

1514244
udp	tcp
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control
also tcp with nagle turned on batches packets which again wouldn t be a fair comparison to udp which doesn t do that

1516601
hash-collision	key
developers do not have to work around the issue of hash-collision in hashmap in order to achieve program correctness
there are a couple of key things to understand here collisions are an inherent feature of hashing and they have to be

1518126
django	turbogears
i m new to python i want to learn it not just for web-projects but as a substitute to php for scripting small helpers what i didn t like about django to me looks like a close platform
orm template system sessions etc they all are django s on the other hand turbogears 2 uses already known open platforms and just glued them just like appfuse does it for java with turbogears 2 i learn sqlalchemy that i can use later for small python scripts or from the python shell to solve common tasks

1519660
plone	buildout
but if it s private packages that should not even be listed on pypi or packages only useful as a part of a large system like plone it s another matter
then you want easy___install and buildout etc s to look for eggs on your server

1521566
lisp	scheme
update only a piece of the store thanks for the detailed comment by laurence gonsalves . it is however one of the few or even the only well-known success case of lisp in the real world and for some reason yahoo rewrote it in c++
there are a number of free programs that use lisp but few if any people get paid to work on them and these are not specifically scheme

1521566
lisp	scheme
there are a number of free programs that use lisp but few if any people get paid to work on them and these are not specifically scheme
geda is the gnu electronic design automation package and is one of the again few success cases for guile the gnu lisp extension language

1521583
lisp	scheme
stores was before it was bought by yahoo largely though not exclusively written in lisp
seeing how scheme is a variant of lisp any kind of problems

1522270
persistent	transient
i am also pretty certain that the issues you are seeing are not related to the code you have included above because even in the first case there is nothing in the code you have that will commit the changes to persistent storage
absent a call to nsmanagedobjectcontext save all changes to your object graph will be transient

1523151
profiling	benchmarking
never profiling unless the code does not meet specifications expectations
if you need to profiling this code write it both ways and benchmarking it with your expected load

1523809
xsl-fo	xslt
the xslt processor may need to be replaced explicitely as described here of course you can also just continue to use xsltproc for generating the xsl-fo and then feed fop the fo file
as was noted at this is not directly a fop problem but one with the default xslt processor that is active in your java installation

1524031
memcpy	memmove
if it is a single object why not use assignment operator i suppose the compiler-generated assignment operator could be implemented in terms of memcpy if that is so advantageous and the compiler knows better whether your class is a pod. if you want to copy an array of objects you can use std copy
depending on the implementation this may end up using memmove one more thing that you can mess up - the buffers may overlap

1524391
cassini	iis
i would not recommend using hacks to use cassini as your host server - it s just not 100 the same and you might run into serious deployment problems in the end - just not worth it really
if you want to deploy to iis later use iis in your development and save yourself some grief

1525698
hex	binary
i recommend you take a look at the file in a hex editor and if you cannot work out the issue post the file and the code here
edit1 regarding your c++ code do not use the operator to read from a binary stream

1526793
stateless	stateful
i m in the stateful client-stateless server camp due to scaleability but when facing the hurdles of explaining why this and that became harder to implement using a stateless server you get kind of resigned in the long run this is where stateful server shines
eventhough i prefer stateful client this is not easy to implement efficiently using asp.net viewstate and perhaps this is where stateful web gets practical. i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

1526793
stateless	stateful
eventhough i prefer stateful client this is not easy to implement efficiently using asp.net viewstate and perhaps this is where stateful web gets practical. i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires
that is sometimes hidden until trouble occures using stateful server programming model

1526930
ubuntu	linux
note that all four of the dhcp clients listed here can be installed on ubuntu and can replace the default dhcp client dhclient
with the wide variety of dhcp clients on linux -- pump dhcpcd dhclient udhcpc and quite possibly others that i do not know of -- this isn t possible in a general sense

1527046
codeigniter	yii
however for objectivity i should mention i tried both zend and codeigniter before
in the earlier releases of yii benchmark tests were very impressive and because the leadership doesn t want to have this framework bloated not all feature requests get implemented

1528145
gif	png
gif does not support alpha transparency
png works in all modern browsers whereas alpha transparency is not supported in ie6 natively

1528859
cvs	svn
which doesn t support cvs
svn book chapter on externals the only thing you should point at cvs is a gun

1529816
junit	testng
and if you decide otherwise it is not a big undertaking to convert from junit to testng or visa versa
in testng you can define suites via the configuration file testng.xml which should match your needs

1529816
junit	testng
but i think you could also do that in junit which i am not too familiar with
what is nice in testng is that you can define dependencies

1531002
daemons	systemd
the way to write a mac os x daemons is very much like the way you would approach it on a regular unix systemd
accordingly there are a few things to keep in mind non-interactive you don t get direct input from the user but you also have to use something like syslogd for output as the process is not attached to a terminal environment don t assume it has a particular current directory path default permissions or any other environmental settings - explicitly set these up security ensure the daemons has the barest minimum privileges required to perform its function and no more this is a huge topic in itself signals you will need to trap and respond to certain signals as these are typically used for process control eg

hex	binary
you can also use oct to translate binary octal or hex strings to numbers based on the prefix 0b - binary 0 - octal 0x - hex
if you have you can use and you ll get hex doesn t require the 0x at the beginning of the string

1533094
super	implements
it is not super obvious how to do this
but you can create a shared instance on nsconditionlock in the variable condlock like this and this is then how you would implements the waiting in my_connect and this is how you would signal the nsconditionlock that it is time to continue from you delegate method

1533114
xslt	xquery
i don t think they ll add support for xpath 2.0 or xslt 2.0 any time soon
however you shouldn t feel bad if these are not part of the bcl as long as you have 3rd party implementations available saxon xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 3.0 xmlprime xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 2.0 querymachine xpath 2.0 xquery 1.0 lightweight xpath2 for .net xpath 2.0 exselt xslt 3.0 microsoft is customer oriented

1533905
strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc
but to do what you want copy a string and allocate necessary space it will be more simple and more efficient to use strdup that does exactly that a malloc and a strcopy
you should also not forget to free space you allocated yourself using malloc calloc strdup or any other allocation function

1535237
nunit	mstest
unless you have a particular reason to take the nunit testdriven.net approach like you need a certain feature or you just prefer that way of setting up tests and trying to integrate it back into vs then i don t see any reason not to just use mstest which works right out of the box
if it just a simple application the mstest framework built into vs2008 should tick all the boxes

1535381
nunit	mstest
i d recommend getting a thin book pragmatic unit testing in c# with nunit and going through it atleast once
on the nunit v mstest line i m not fit to comment

1535381
nunit	mstest
on the nunit v mstest line i m not fit to comment
0 flying-time with mstest

1536379
ssl	https
you ll want to make sure you can t hit your controllers when you are not using ssl
this will help you catch any errors and ensure that no one uses http instead of https

1539517
dictionary	map
use a reverse dictionary
the reverse dictionary will map each function reference to the exact name you gave it in fun_dict which may or may not be the name you used when you defined the function

1542553
passenger	webrick
this may not be the answer you re looking for but i ve found it very straightforward to just run passenger locally for development
you can always tail the development.log it s really just as easy as watching the terminal output from webrick

1546159
division	addition
however this is not true in the c# version because of the parentheses the addition will come first then the division
looks to me like you may have a problem in your c# code here math.pow 1d + interestrate 12d ... your vb6 code has 1 + m_dblinterestrate 12 ... vb6 has a higher precedence for the and operators than the + and - so the division will occur before the add

1547501
onchange	onblur
and maybe keep the onchange event in order to know whether the onblur event handler should trigger the ajax request or not
i haven t really tried this except a few tests for answering this question but maybe you could get it working using the onblur event

1547996
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
technically yes but it s risky because while css syntax is mostly case-insensitive in some browsers under certain conditions class names are treated as case-sensitive as the spec does not specify how browsers should handle case when matching css rules to html class names
from the spec section 4.1.3 all css syntax is case-insensitive within the ascii range.

1548710
octal	hex
screen doesn t have any shorthand syntax for alt bindings but you can give it the octal code directly
for instance on my machine alt-x has the hex code f8 or 370 octal so putting escape 370x in my screenrc changed the escape code to alt-x tested and works with screen 4.00.03 on linux

1551254
equals	compareto
it appears that both methods pretty much do the same thing but the compareto method takes in a string not an object and adds some extra functionality on top of the normal equals method
if all you care about is equality then the equals method is the best choice simply because it makes more sense to the next programmer that takes a look at your code

1551256
equals	compareto
i believe his opinion was just a matter of taste and i agree with you -- if all you need to know is the equality of the strings and not which one comes first lexicographically then i would use equals
the 2 main differences are that equals will take any object as a parameter but compareto will only take strings

1551256
equals	compareto
the 2 main differences are that equals will take any object as a parameter but compareto will only take strings
equals only tells you whether they re equal or not but compareto gives information on how the strings compare lexicographically

1551906
codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter is another wonderful php framework but not quite so rails-ish
i would say cakephp is more rails-ish in its approach

1553734
vsto	add-in
but even vsto does not seem very native to excel
your requirement is exactly what lead me to develop exceldna after finding the automation add-in inadequate

1554330
srp	ocp
this is not .net specific but the most important i think is the solid principle. robert martin aka unclebob has a nice reference here . i will quote the most important section srp the single responsibility principles a class should have one and only one reason to change
ocp the open closed principles you should be able to extend a classes behavior without modifying it

1555534
war	manifest.mf
following files are not included in the signature meta-inf manifest.mf meta-inf sig- meta-inf .sf meta-inf .dsa meta-inf .rsa it doesn t know anything about war
if you sign the war it will be treated as jar so all the rules will apply

1557382
decoder	encoder
an amf3 decoder should not use the traits from a partially-constructed object -- such input should be flagged as erroneous
the strings-reference table is implemented at the encoder by tagging in-memory string objects as they are serialized

1561982
equals	gethashcode
if you re implementing a class you should implement a gethashcode routine that returns the same hash code for items that are equals
ideally you want to return a different hash code for items that are not equals whenever possible as this will make your dictionary lookups much faster

1562002
tostring	string.format
if the benefit you find in overloading tostring is for the debugger you should start using system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute
as for needing this implementation for converting objects to strings via string.format and or console.writeline they could have deferred to the system.convert.tostring object and checked for something like istringable failing over to the type s name if not implemented

1563266
yslow	pagespeed
fixing yslow warnings is generally pretty easy but you have to be careful to avoid creating caching and other problems which is why the default server config doesn t do these things
another answer recommended the pagespeed offering

1565309
codeigniter	kohana
it came out of codeigniter and loading models etc is done just the way you proposed
although kohana reuses many common design patterns and concepts there are some things that make kohana stand out community not company driven

1566958
uiview	calayer
each individual layer does not have to be backed by a view but the root layer in the hierarchy must be backed by a uiview
the point is not to avoid having copies of the calayer s which are quite lightweight but to avoid having copies of uiviews or more specifically the graphics contexts that back uiview s

1570490
dictionary	map
notably the complexity does not depend on the length of the dictionary
for your dictionary index build a map map bag char list string

1571977
boost	allocator
there s probably something in boost that provides this the closest i ve personally seen is boost.array which is insufficient
however if you re just looking to model the important subset of std string it s not very difficult to make a fixed-length equivalent for anyone asking about why bothering to do this at all the main benefit is to avoid memory allocator without losing most of the useful std string api

1572125
set	bag
the semantics of a bag do not match that of a set which is that a set can only have unique instances and a bag can have duplicate instances
as a fair comment a list does not match exactly the semantics of a bag either a bag does not have an index but it s close enough for nhibernate

1575282
punctuation	words
the general algorithm is going to go like this - obtain text - strip punctuation special characters etc. - strip simple words - split on spaces - loop over split text - add words to array hashtable etc if it doesn t exist
if it does increment counter for that words the end result is a frequency count of all words in the text

1575675
dictionary	map
here is the entry point now that is simple enough it just builds a dictionary map for the objects during the clone and populates it with any object that should not be cloned
you will note the comparer provided to the dictionary is a referencecomparer let s take a look at what it does that was easy enough just a comparer that forces the use of the system.object s get hash and reference equality.

1577153
ssl	https
we decided to use godaddy as we also use the ssl certificate for regular browsers and those show a warning message to the user if they encounter a self-signed certificate which obviously scares people away
if you use https ssl on the server side it shouldn t matter if you use xml-rpc or json-rpc

1577205
super	self
two small things i noticed which might help solve the problem you are not releasing the pin in the first code sample which would create a leak you are not checking if self super init
in your second code sample was successful if self super init ... return self

1578723
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
following these guidelines you shouldn t catch exception since it doesn t fit either of the above criteria meaning it s not a runtimeexception and it s not a specialized exception sublcass to indicate an expected error
it s a long article but this proposes you use checked exceptions when the client expects this error to occur regularly and must handle it ex user-entered data did not pass validation use unchecked-exception for unexpected conditions ex db server went down in theory #1 expected errors should have their own exception type and the only place that should catch a #2 a runtimeexception is some type of top-level handler that catches the exception logs it and shows the user an error message and even here you should probably catch throwable to make sure any uncaught exceptions are handled

1579321
bazaar	svn
i haven t used bazaar myself but i read it s very nice
if you re considering svn because i don t need the distributed part the modern vcses are not only distributed but much much more elegant in functionality

1579788
udp	tcp
udp information another point i would like to make is to not use raw socket as your first tcp connection use the tcpclient class. tcpclient
i would suggest using udp rather than tcp with manual ack commands this way you don t get the constant connected sockets as per your boss

1580533
implements	extends
it is not however possible to have two different portions of a partial class implements the same partial method
generally partial methods are used in code-generated partial classes as a way of allowing the non-generated part of extends or customize the behavior of the portion that is generated or sometimes vice versa

1582007
google-chrome	firefox
file uploads using the xmlhttprequest object is not possible in all browsers only firefox and safari google-chrome support it so for a cross-browser implementation use the trick
if you want a real xhr file upload i have written an extended article on how to do it in firefox 3

1582611
udp	tcp
source addresses for udp cannot be trusted
source addresses for tcp can to an extent you know the data has to be coming from the ip address in question or someone along the route

1582763
pthreads	fork
linux osx actually pthreads programming any language that have pthreads calls general scheme setup a socket.
fork close 0 close 1 not necessary dup2 will close it too.

1583370
udp	tcp
if it receives it as udp is not as reliable as tcp of course
i you are reading from a tcp socket you can t assume when the end of line will be reached. therfore you ll need something like that assuming you are using n n as a delimiter

1584076
xsl-fo	xslt
there are a number of ways you can edit the template for documents to be created in xsl-fo
typically this template is xslt that you apply to your xml data but this is not a requirement

1584131
lisp	scheme
it s a lisp which is worth learning
you get lisp macros destructuring first class functions and closures the repl and dynamic typing - plus literals for lists vectors maps and sets - all on top of interoperability with java libraries and there s a clr version being developed too. it s not exactly the same as scheme or common lisp but learning it will help you if you ever want to work through the structure and interpretation of computer programs or grok what paul graham s talking about in his essays and you can relate to this comic from xkcd

1585114
strncmp	memcmp
for this example strncmp is ok
in general memcmp is better because it doesn t have to worry about string termination so even if the byte stream tag you are comparing contains ascii nul 0 characters memcmp will work

1585548
uiview	uiwindow
the interesting bit here is that uiwindow is itself a subclass of uiview so you can add all four views to your window directly
this may not be the best approach but it s perhaps the simplest. all you really have to do is initialize each of your four views programmatically with the location and dimensions you want them to have in the uiwindow

1586488
spaces	linefeed
if your fields alow zero-length strings and can have white spaces in them here s one solution i m assuming you re writing your sql to execute in access itself as trim and len are access vba functions both are provided by the access expression service using vba so this wouldn t work via odbc or oledb
now that ignores other kinds of issues in those fields such as tabs or cr linefeed characters

1586922
innodb	myisam
this will not work for innodb tables and may or may not work for other storage engines with which i am less familiar
mysqlhotcopy if you need to dump the contents of a database while the database server is running you can use mysqlhotcopy note that this only works for myisam and archive tables copying the entire data folder if you are copying the entire database installation so all of the databases and the contents of every database you can just shut down mysqld zip up your entire mysql data directory and copy it to the new server s data directory

1587060
client-side	server-side
as for the configuration utility sql server network configuration is all about configuration of network protocols on the server side of things sql native client configuration is the client-side configuration if you have a dev box with both on it you ll see both
a regular pc connecting to a sql server typically doesn t have sql server itself installed on it locally so the server-side settings are meaningless there obviously

1587509
hex	binary
you can use binary literals or hex for example binary literals only work for python 2.6 or later and are of the form 0b11110000
if you are using python 2.6 or later then you might want to look at the bytearray type as this will let you treat the data as binary and so not have to use the call to ord

1587792
imperative	declarative
when you use an api you instantiate objects and call methods in an imperative manner
on the other hand a good dsl should be declarative representing rules and relationships in your problem domain not instructions to be executed

1589207
lisp	prolog
well if you consider lambda calculus a form of logic then lisp has been showing off its benefits pretty well by being since 1958 the language whose expressive power other language aspire but do not manage to reach
then there s prolog the only other serious language i know that tries to be explicitly grounded in formal logic

1590491
gtk	cairo
i ve done something like that before for a different purpose with gtk on x which indirectly uses cairo
if you don t want to do it that way and cairo doesn t provide an api you might be able to add one

1591999
sudo	passwd
mine looks like this your apache configuration 4 i ve run sudo -u mysql mysql_install_db5
i ran mysqladmin -u root passwd mypw and got an error saying the mysql could not connect through the socket

1594570
spweb	spsite
do it within a rwep and make sure you dispose of your spsite spweb objects correctly
not the most efficient solution to this problem but you can iterate through all the site collections webs in the web application and then call web.doesuserhavepermissions userid spbasepermissions.open where web is a spweb object and userid is domain user.name of the user you are checking access permissions for

1596646
ienumerable	ilist
if the collection is unordered or doesn t need random access ienumerable is correct
if it s a list and you want to expose it as one then declare the method or property to return ilist but you may well need to return a readonlycollection wrapper over that collection either directly or using syntax such as list.asreadonly

1598429
strncmp	strcmp
if that s not what you want but you want to use strncmp anyway you would write this will correctly reject commander
you d be looking for strcmp from the header

1599815
jtextfield	jlabel
you cannot mix applet and swing components for instance you cannot place a jtextfield on an applet contentpane. if you are extending to an applet not japplet use textfield instead of jtextfield
button label textfield panel are for applet jbutton jlabel jtextfield jpanel are for japplet please take note of the prefix

1600586
division	multiplication
on most architectures the division instruction puts the quotient in one register and the remainder in another
if your division instruction is not fast enough but the multiplication instruction is you can use the following technique and it sounds as if this is the technique you re after

1603679
mp3	ogg
but it does not support mp3 only ogg
on chrome it might work with mp3

1604257
super	extends
it would have been super correct if adding a final qualifier to class test would have allowed access to field s but it does not
extends test and not test

1604301
allocator	stl
unfortunately stl allocator cannot have state or at least have to be very careful how that state is used - each instance of a particular allocator type must be equivalent for stl containers to work effectively with them
i don t recall the details right now but i know that scott meyers discusses this problem at length in effective stl item 10 be aware of allocator conventions and restrictions

1604301
allocator	stl
for example see this paragraph from an article by anthony aue improving performance with custom pool allocator for stl a potentially more serious caveat is that since the allocator uses nonstatic data it s not technically standard compliant because the standard requires that allocator of the same type be equivalent
see effective stl item 10 for a thorough explanation of the issue

1606923
dictionary	map
if you would solve the problem in the object model using dictionary there is the option of directly map the dictionary as map but then the data is not in columns but in rows
or you map the dictionary as dynamic component which will map to columns

1607031
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
instead you have to do something like of course i understand the rationale behind keeping the original buffer intact on failure but my use case has popped up enough that i generally code my own functions to handle that case something like the relevant section in the c11 standard states my italics 7.20.3.4 the realloc function if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

1611370
cfstring	nsstring
most of nsstring is actually implemented in with corefoundation cfstring so there s obviously a path from a cfstringref - -utf8string
it s just not as neat and simple as nsstring s -utf8string

1611464
actionscript	mxml
you cannot remove an event listener that was defined in the mxml tag define your httpservice objects in actionscript creationcomplete of the app and add event listeners using addeventlistener method so that you can call removeeventlistener on them to reuse
you cannot remove event listeners added in the mxml tag. livedocs says you can remove only event listeners that you added with the addeventlistener method in an actionscript block

1611630
inline	inlining
every compiler uses some heuristics to determine whether the function should be inline or not but normally every compiler uses its own ones
so to say that a loop will have some universal effect on inlining is not correct

1612308
firefox	safari
ie4 5 6 7 8 use the eot files while ttf support is only provided by firefox versions 3.1
about safari and opera i m not sure but safari 4 worked for me and opera 10 too

1612935
jlist	jtable
if you want the table to display the items in the list you need an implementation of the tablemodel interface not a jlist
edit if you want the jlist and the jtable to be displayed next to each other you have to addthem both to a jpanel before adding that to the scrollpane

1614890
ssl	https
this has grown to my general brain dump of best practices for working with passwords in php mysql. the ideas presented here are generally not my own but the best of what i ve found to date. ensure you are using ssl for all operations involving user information
all pages that involve these forms should check they are being called via https and refuse to work otherwise

1618621
udp	tcp
udp does not guarantee that a given packet was actually received so encoding whatever you transmit as a difference from last time is problematic -- you can t know that your counterpart has the same idea as you about what the last time was
essentially you d have to build some overhead on top of udp to check what packets have been received tagging each packet with a unique id -- everybody who s tried to go this route will agree that more often than not you find yourself more or less duplicating the tcp streaming infrastructure on top of udp.

1618621
udp	tcp
essentially you d have to build some overhead on top of udp to check what packets have been received tagging each packet with a unique id -- everybody who s tried to go this route will agree that more often than not you find yourself more or less duplicating the tcp streaming infrastructure on top of udp.
only most likely not as solid and well-developed although admittedly sometimes you can take advantage of very special characteristics of your payloads in order to gain some modest advantage over plain good old tcp

1618932
tftp	tcp
for more information check out the rfc for the tftp protocol which uses this strategy. finally if possible you may want to consider using tcp instead
udp unlike tcp is not a reliable protocol

1620587
serializable	deserialization
there are many ways of doing this but the first step will be to make your class serializable by adding the serializable attribute then you can use for instance the xmlserializer class to handle the serializable deserialization
update i should mention that you can use xmlserializer even if your class is not decorated with the serializable attribute

1620593
onclick	onchange
you could use the onclick event instead
my guess is that ie doesn t fire the onchange event until after the radio element loses focus

1622291
gif	png
it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png but using them just seems so 1987. it probably is your tools
from the png faq there are two main reasons behind this phenomenon comparing apples and oranges that is not comparing the same image types and using bad tools. continued.

1623229
client-side	server-side
since javascript is client-side executing a history.back renders the control to the browser which then decides which page was last in the history keeping in mind that the last page may not be a page within your domain
when you re using server-side php the http header referrer is whatever the browser supplied to you

1623814
google-chrome	firefox
a it seems that google-chrome converts the #0000ff to rgb 0 0 255 but the same does not apply to blue b firefox will display very diferent results depending on the property you are asking for
specificaly for the background-color property it converts the colors to the format rgb 0 0 255 just watch google-chrome #39

1625263
filewriter	bufferedwriter
in this case a buffered writer is better notes the second parameter to the filewriter constructor will tell it to append to the file rather than writing a new file
if the file does not exist it will be created. using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer such as filewriter

1625263
filewriter	printwriter
if the file does not exist it will be created. using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer such as filewriter
using a printwriter gives you access to println syntax that you re probably used to from system.out

1627971
lisp	scheme
in this particular case i believe you are interesting in lisp macros in particular
i think these may be interesting clojure documentation itself video macros in clojure in 20 minutes standard issue wikipedia - clojure note that macros in clojure work very similar to common lisp macros a type-2 lisp and not quite-so-much-like scheme macros

1629409
hmac	md5
since you cannot change the php implementation you will have to write an hmac implementation in objective c that has this same non-standard variation
first your objc2 is using sha1 not md5 this means you are probably getting a buffer overrun since sha1 is 20 bytes while md5 is 16 bytes

1629679
implements	extends
basically there are a couple of parts to implements a custom authenication chain in spring-security authenicationtoken - details of the authenication request and it s result ie contains credentials you require to authenticate authenicationprovider - registered with the authenicationmanager accepts your authenicationtoken and validates the user and returns a token with the granted authorities set authenciationfilter - doesn t actually have to be a filter just using abstractprocessingfilter will make your life a little easier
the trick here is that you need to create a new authenicationtoken maybe extends usernameandpasswordauthenicationtoken and as emills says you need to then implement a new authenciationprocessingfilter to map the request values to the token and submit these to the authenicationmanager

1630095
allocator	stl
the stl allocator design makes it difficult to do this
some stl containers have a constructor that lets you pass an instance of an allocator but not all containers support this

1630095
allocator	stl
some stl containers have a constructor that lets you pass an instance of an allocator but not all containers support this
on containers that support this you can include a reference to some global map inside your allocator class and then pass an instance of your allocator to the constructor of each container

1630859
opera	google-chrome	required	placeholder
the is required to make opera not show the broken image placeholder
the onerror is required for google-chrome and ie

1630987
postgresql	mysql
pl postgresql is actually a nice language + you can use many other languages
mysql doesn t have sequences so if you need them you have to roll your own

1632334
cassini	iis
cassini doesn t as far as i can tell support classic asp
an alternative would be to run a local install of apache since you can t won t use iis which will host asp but is probably asking for trouble

1633112
tiff	png
so doing something along the lines of would write that tiff image to file
i do not think nsimage has any built-in way of getting the data in png or jpeg form

1633851
udp	tcp
typically game engines send udp packets because of latency
the fact is that tcp is just not fast enough and reliability is less of a concern than speed is

1634525
jruby	mri
yes because all the tutorials beginner docs and most of the devs who will normally be able to help you out are assuming mri so for each issue you have you must first eliminate a jruby related cause
from what i have seen certain gems aren t supported on jruby or things might be done a little differently in that ecosystem

1634536
jruby	mri
that said the most popular gems tend to work in jruby
performance in jruby still isn t quite as good as ruby 1.9 but in a lot of cases it s comparable to mri 1.8

1634536
jruby	mri
performance in jruby still isn t quite as good as ruby 1.9 but in a lot of cases it s comparable to mri 1.8
personally i d recommend treating jruby as an advanced ruby concept

1634671
postgresql	mysql
the replication story is more coherent for mysql than postgresql
postgresql is significantly more full-featured has a better optimizer but isn t as widely deployed

1638289
implements	extends
for example if something is implements using com that will usually show up directly in your code that uses it
it s a strength because it s fairly easy to extends mfc to handle areas it doesn t by default as well as to simply bypass it and work directly with the api when you need to do so

1639022
firefox	safari
no idea what magic they changed but it was definitely something in the cert that firefox did not like
we had this problem and it was very much firefox specific -- could only repro in that browser safari ie8 chrome etc were all fine

1640106
uilabel	uitextview
update if you are on newer versions of ios uilabel now has a lines property multiple lines of text in uilabel
it sounds like what you actually want is a giant uilabel inside a uiscrollview and not a uitextview

1641749
google-chrome	firefox
and a goggle google-chrome one with 4 tabs
not sure exactly why i don t currently have any firefox open probably just forgot to restart it after upgrading to 3.5.4 recently but normally there would be 2-3 windows there with another 8-10 tabs

1641794
jar	war
the -0 option tells the jar command to not compress the member files when creating the war file
then when rsync compares the old and new versions of the war file the delta-transfer algorithm should be able to create small diffs

1641916
client-side	server-side
if you d use add service reference then visual studio will inspect the service based on its metadata and create a new set of client-side objects which look the same in terms of their fields and all but they re a separate distinct type and thus you wouldn t be able to use your shared validation on both the server-side and the client-side objects
if you control both sides of the wire the server-side service and the client-side then you could do the following put all your service and data contracts into a shared assembly reference that contracts assembly from both the server and the client manually create the client proxy by deriving from or by creating it from a - do not use add service reference or svcutil.exe

1642528
implements	extends
note that the interface itself doesn t extends idictionary - it s just that the implementation also implements idictionary
this works because implements idictionary - but it will indeed fail at execution time if someone calls idictionary.add object object with a non-string key - you ll get an argumentexception

1642573
udp	tcp
you basically just throw a packet out there with a destination address and it may or may not arrive - that s the u in udp unreliable
you shouldn t be lulled into thinking the connection of tcp results in all packets taking the same physical path

1642592
udp	tcp
as a consequence the lower level protocols in the ip stack do not guarantee that packets are received at the destination packets are received in any particular order packets are received at the destination just once udp in particular does not try to solve these issues
on the other hand tcp protocol has to get rid of these issues

1643721
punctuation	words
if such info has not readily be lost your question implies that maybe the tokenization has readily been done during the tokenization words parsing in this case process look for patterns that may define expression boundaries such as punctuation particularly periods and also multiple lf cr separation use these
also words like the can often be used as boundaries

1647078
innodb	myisam
personally i still believe that the advantages of innodb triumphs myisam and myisam also has problems with data integrity from my experience
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

1647078
innodb	myisam
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads
also myisam tables are stored in separate files and from what i can remember you can actually transport those files to another mysql database and is easier to backup

1647200
innodb	myisam
innodb supports fk s supports transactions uses a large memory buffer for operation supports row level locking but has a much higher maintenance cost -- you really need to tune your memory usage configure your table files etc
myisam has a bunch of special column features that innodb doesn t like full text indexes spatial columns i m pretty sure this doesn t work with innodb very fast for primary read append use cases table locks for updates deletes but not for inserts also typically has faster inserts caches indexes in memory key buffer but relies on the os to buffer the actual data pages for example i d use innodb for things like ecommerce user databases or anything that i want to use transactions in

1648773
vim	textmate
vim offers coloration for diff files
if you d rather go graphical use macvim which is free or textmate not free

1650403
nexus	artifactory
i would recommend setting up one nexus server with at least four repositories
i would not recommend artifactory

1650789
boost	stl
not part of stl but well known library is boost
i would go the way of using boost date

1651347
cpython	ironpython
edit at least this surely holds in cpython
i thought it was part of the python standard definition but apparently ironpython and jython disagree not ensuring thread-safety of count.next in their current implementations so i may well be wrong

1652265
uiview	subviews
the uitableview is handling the hits because the b uiview is not in the responder chain at all
you need to make b-uiview a sibling of a-view instead of an invisible and inactive subviews

1654667
addition	multiplication
one approach is not to try to compute the time by repeated addition of this 0.1 seconds constant but to keep a simple integer clock-tick count
this tick count can be converted to a fixed-point time in seconds as needed usually using a multiplication followed by a division

1654684
vb.net	vb6
unfortunately i can only suggest a workaround not a solution if you do not find a suitable activex control for your vb6 application you might consider migrating the communication part of your application to vb.net
this has the following advantages calling .net code from vb6 is not hard

1655286
factors	mean
i would argue that either you factors out the read-only part and have a read-write method call a read-only method or that you just stop considering it read-only it isn t
just because the transaction is put into read-only mode for one transaction does not mean it will remain in read-only mode for the rest of the scope of the session osiv

1655518
innodb	myisam
in particular switching from myisam to innodb will break your application if it doesn t handle deadlocks appropriately deadlocks do not happen on myisam it expects table-level locking it relies on mostly dubious myisam features it is high performance and you have not understood how to tune innodb correctly but did tune myisam well or ok you have not assessed the disc space impact of switching engines
the myisam engine does support foreign keys

1657438
floating-point	fractions
this sounds like an integer quantity and i wouldn t take the detour through floating-point land
thus my approach would be multiplying by an integer 1000 preserves the fractions number perfectly and may be a little faster too

1659289
haskell	scheme
and and or need to short-circuit -- stop argument evaluation as soon as the final result is known -- so they can t be regular procedures functions in any eager language lazy languages such as haskell -- where each argument is evaluated only if when and as needed -- are a very different breed and don t need this regular function versus special form distinction.
but alas scheme just isn t one of those

1660109
boost	stl
boost shared_ptr for example if you use it inside a dll boost intrusive_ptr works over dll boundaries
edit like remarked in the comments stl strings are not guaranteed to be immutable by nature

1661117
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
for example i use ubuntu linux and perl is a component of the system
but the ubuntu system perl interpreter is not in good shape due to some dubious setup decisions by the debian people so installing things like cpan modules is tricky

1661383
octal	decimal
in this statement 005 is an octal constant
in this case it doesn t matter because a single digit octal constant has the same value as the equivalent decimal constant but in c whether an integer literal is expressed in octal decimal or hexadecimal once it is parsed by the compiler it is just treated as a value

1664422
rsa	aes
to answer your question it s generally a better idea to create a session secret the aes key through a diffie-hellman exchange and each side use its private rsa key to sign its key-exchange data
otherwise if the session secret is not established through a dh exchange an adversary that gains access to the private rsa key which has to be stored somewhere could decrypt all traffic that was ever sent between the client and server

1664765
tostring	string.format
perhaps simplest just overload tostring for role which makes it suitable for use in string.format and friends but of course doesn t make it assignable
by default each entity class or poco should have a tostring overload anyway

1665043
pascal	delphi
searching the keyword pascal filtering the results with programming language pascal you ll find a bunch of applications of pascal if not enterprise level at least serious programmer s level
with so many open-source and cross-platform ides libraries i think pascal is still alive except the popular delphi dialect and could do practical tasks.as the results implies pascal could do operating system compiler cross-platform library desktop-programming.so it seems that pascal at least could do a lot of serious tasks if not too pratical to make moeny back instantly

1667192
google-chrome	firefox
for example google-chrome doesn t highlight the options in the drop down
firefox does but then it doesn t change them back if you move the mouse away and they are still pulled down

1669137
mp3	flac	mp3	ogg	wav	flac	wav	ogg
by the way audiere can also play certain audio files mp3 wav aiff mod s3m xm it by itself
ogg vorbis flac speex with external libraries not just pure generated tones

1671267
intersect	contains
if you take the intersect of two lists as it looks like you re doing the result will be a single list that contains all of the elements that are in both of the lists
thus once you ve done the ienumerable in intersect doesn t need left or right

1673862
awt	swing
iterator pattern in collections framework nested containers in awt swing use the composite pattern layout managers in awt swing are an example of strategy and many more i guess
observer pattern throughout whole swing observable observer mvc also in swing adapter pattern inputstreamreader and outputstreamwriter note containeradapter componentadapter focusadapter keyadapter mouseadapter are not adapters

1675345
firefox	safari
using an arbitrary high value seems more reliable than in firefox and chrome. i ve made it is as a jquery plugin
if you re not using jquery i trust you can still get the gist easily enough. i ve tested in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3.5.5 google chrome 3.0 safari 4.0.4 opera 10.00

1676530
freebsd	linux
in your case if you re sure your .bashrc is going to be used only on gnu linux and on a bsd system you can check for switches that exist in one of the ls but not in the other for example -d doesn t seem to be an accepted switch by ls on my bsd machines freebsd and mac os x whereas it is for gnu ls
conversely -p is accepted on bsd but not on gnu linux

1676749
xsl-fo	xslt
the two technologies i ve used to produce pdfs xml - xsl-fo - apache fop formatting objects processor - pdf
advantages if you understand html and xslt creating output with xsl-fo is not a lot harder than creating html with xslt software is open source

1677386
haskell	scheme
until someone showed me the equivalent haskell definition 2 lines
i am not so confident on the efficiency of my implementation - particularly the flatten step was quick to write but could end up calling append with a very large number of lists which may or may not be very efficient on some scheme implementations

1677864
postgresql	mysql
with postgresql 8.1 this has changed
however if this doesn t help you can use the union solution you tried this is a common solution for mysql users which continues to have a one-index-per-table limitation

1680049
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
example code for your scenario just for the curious in dotnetzip you will get bit 3 set if you use the zipfile class and save it to a nonseekable stream like aspnet s response.outputstream or if you use the zipoutputstream class in dotnetzip which always writes forward only no seeking back . i think sharpziplib s zipoutputstream is also always forward only.
i don t know for sure because i am not very familiar with either sharpziplib or osx but i still might have some useful insight for you

1680049
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i ve spent some time wading through the zip spec and actually i wrote dotnetzip which is a zip library for .net unrelated to sharpziplib
currently on the user forums for dotnetzip there s a discussion going on about zip files generated by dotnetzip that cannot be read on osx

1680755
move	drag
the feature to move the window by pressing alt is also a function of your window manager not qt
there is just one way to make the window manager move the window add a drag bar

1680956
base	fractions
any value represented as base 2 mantissa and exponent 1.00110101001 x 2 -11101001101001 means take the mantissa value 1.00110101001 and multiply it by 2 raised to the power of the exponent when exponent is negative this is equivilent to dividing by 2 to the power of the absolute value of the exponent
this means that where the exponent is negative or where any portion of the mantissa is a fractions binary the number cannot be represented as a decimal mantissa and exponent and vice versa

1681589
udp	mtu
here is some sample c# code from my own udp multicast server client on the server side where datasock is my socket bound to the udp multicast group also be sure and set socketoptionname.sendbuffer on your client side to match the buffer size your server is producing
i would also recommend if you were not already aware to make your packet sizes less than the mtu

1681855
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
therefore your approach is exactly right use uinavigationcontroller s subclass of uiviewcontroller in place of standard view controllers when you want to achieve navigation within a given tab
the uitabbarcontroller represents its sub-tabs as an array of uiviewcontroller s not an array of uinavigationcontroller s

1683991
bazaar	fossil	fossil	git
so if you clone a fossil repository you do not just get the latest version of the source code plus all its history like you would get with git mercurial bazaar monotone darcs or any other version control system you also get the current bug database plus all its history and the current wiki plus all its history
fossil is written by d

1685300
daemons	systemd
if one was on a unix systemd one could send a kill signal to the worker daemons processes and they would restart without restart whole of apache
on unix this does not overly cause problems even when multiple sites in same process as the listener socket for port on which http requests are accepted is maintained open at all times so subsequent requests which arrive during the restart just queue up and will be handled once worker daemons processes are running again

1686486
prng	random
it s unlikely your prng has enough bits of state to express every possible shuffle however so the real question is if your prng is random enough with regards to the set of shuffles it will actually produce and whether your seeding strategy is secure enough
only you can decide this as it depends on the consequences of a shuffle that isn t random enough

1688717
implements	extends
if that s not possible try implements each of the interfaces that arrayobject implements one-by-one based on this manual to see which interface you really need to use for your object
make your class extends arrayobject if possible

1689996
realloc	malloc
malloc realloc free memory management is not actually aware about threads at least by now
so you should treat results of malloc as simple resource

1691658
jar	war
to do so you ll have to package your javaapplication as a jar including the .class files and the files under resources but not the libraries it depends on jars under lib
these dependencies will actually end up in the web-inf lib directory of the war beside the jar of your javaapplication

1693017
lisp	scheme
templates and classes were cool initially but after a while i realized that i was fighting them all the time and finding workarounds for language design problems common lisp which was ok but not widely used fo sci computing
not easy to integrate with c if compared to other languages but works scheme

1693253
innodb	myisam
i would only warn that this is going to be terribly slow in case of a innodb table as it doesn t support fulltext scans
if you want better performance with a like then you should use myisam

1693671
punctuation	words
it doesn t cover interrupting phrases or clause structures or constituency tests or embedded clauses or punctuation or anything like that
also this solution requires a dictionary - a list of nouns and verbs and prepositions so that you can determine the lexical category of each words in the sentence

1694040
imperative	declarative
basically with declarative languages prolog you specifiy what you want to accomplish without specifying how to accomplish it which contrasts with imperative languages
you are confusing the concepts c and c++ are not declarative languages

1697014
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient is useful for those situations where you just want to do an operation eg post get form upload and cant be bothered to create and manage the httpwebrequest requeststream httpwebresponse and response stream
httpwebrequest exposes a lot more stuff that allows you fine grained protocol control for eg whether you want to use keep-alive what connection pool to use whether to buffer writes or not etc

1698731
division	multiplication
another implementation using stl binary search on a lookup table which seems not bad not too long and still faster than division methods
it also seem easy and efficient to adapt for type much bigger than int will be faster than o digits methods and just needs multiplication no division or log function for this hypothetical type

1698851
realloc	malloc
if that returns non-null you can use to do something more sophisticated not bounded by an arbitrary size or spanning multiple lines you ll want to learn about dynamic memory allocation the functions malloc realloc free .
some links to help you manpages for file i o fopen fgets fclose for memory allocation malloc also just to throw it out there if you are interested in writing c++ instead of c that also has its own file i o and string stuff that you may find helpful and you won t have to do all the memory allocations yourself

1699006
equals	gethashcode
in addition i would create an almostequals method possibly even an overloaded equals which is free from the contract of equals
i would not put fuzzy logic into equals because equals as a strict contract with gethashcode

1699411
ssl	https
ssl works on site level not on folder level
once you install ssl certificate your website could be accessed using https protocol like so

1700461
margin	text-align
by default div elements are the full width of the page and since you aren t specifying how wide it should be the auto margin will be 0 on both sides
in this case i would use a text-align center

1700745
lisp	smalltalk
for such an old programming language well maybe not lisp old but ruby is older than java after all and a community that fanatic about code quality style and beauty the ruby book market is surprisingly light on higher level books
there are several reasons for this a lot of rubyists are already seasoned smalltalk or lisp programmers when they pick up ruby so they don t need those books

1701079
floating-point	fractions
decimal fractions don t have exact floating-point representations
when you convert decimal fractions - binary fractions - decimal you do not have exact decimal representations and will have noise bits at the end of the binary representation

1702465
move	drag
if your drawing isn t already in a drawingbrush resource copy or move your drawing s xaml into a drawingbrush resource for example now you can edit your drawing like this go to the resources tab and find the drawingbrush create an empty window or find an empty area area of an existing window usercontrol etc drag the drawingbrush onto the artboard in the empty area select copy drawingbrush to canvas from the popup menu that appears edit the canvas using all the normal blend tools when you done editing select the canvas on the menu select now your drawing xaml will be updated inside the drawingbrush
you can move the drawing back wherever it was or you can choose to leave it there and use it as a drawingbrush

1704059
jar	war
i wrote up my findings in i downloaded metro 1.4 from version 1.5 is very new and i haven t looked at it which eventually unpacks to several jar files
copy webservices-api.jar webservices-rt.jar webservices-extra-api.jar and webservices-extra.jar four files to the folder containing blessed jarfiles common to all of tomcat - i believe it is tomcat lib for tomcat 6. 1 in your eclipse project eventually ending up to be a war file if your workspace jre is java 5 you must add webservices-api.jar to the classpath it should not be deployed in the end

1704644
bazaar	git
i don t know much about bazaar or monotone so i can t offer any feedback there
i can t speak for fogcreek but i know when i was choosing which dvcs to use many people commented that git does not work well on windows unless it s run in cygwin

1704807
persistent	transient
by default toplink jpa assumes that all the fields of an entity are persistent
if you want to specify a field or property of an entity that is not persistent you need to mark it with transient but this is not what you want here

1706274
apache	nginx
add the following before_filter to your applicationcontroller if you did want to do the redirect using apache you could use this
ideally you d do this in your web server apache nginx etc. configuation so that the request doesn t even touch rails at all

1706938
innodb	myisam
in general for any task default to innodb for its acid-compliance and row-level locking
consider resorting to myisam only for a fulltext search and b specific cases where performance under innodb isn t good enough it s fairly rare that this is significant but some types of data can benefit from myisam s profile

1711204
ienumerable	iqueryable
the where extension methods for ienumerable indeed take a system.func which is how you are trying to pass the predicate here
but you re working with iqueryable not ienumerable

1711204
ienumerable	iqueryable
but you re working with iqueryable not ienumerable
the where extension methods for iqueryable take a system.linq.expressions.expression not a system.func

1712020
xapian	whoosh
my advice is mostly related to haystack in general since i don t have experience with xapian as a backend
installing xapian from the haystack docs - note that haystack doesn t support xapian on its own it may be helpful to use whoosh during development or for testing certain things but keep in mind that it doesn t support all the features xapian does

1712020
xapian	whoosh
installing xapian from the haystack docs - note that haystack doesn t support xapian on its own it may be helpful to use whoosh during development or for testing certain things but keep in mind that it doesn t support all the features xapian does
haystack does a good job of failing gracefully a warning in your console if you try to use whoosh with a feature it doesn t support so switching between them is painless a snippet from my own code of switching between whoosh and solr easily as far as i m aware your choice of database doesn t make a difference as long as django supports it since haystack uses the orm

1713384
.htaccess	httpd.conf
edit in response to your edit say you have a request for www.example.com dir1 dir2 dir3 file apache will look for a .htaccess in all 3 of those directories and the root for rules to apply to the request if you have overriding allowed
if you wont have to change your rules very often you should put them in the httpd.conf and turn off overriding in the top directory your rules apply to allowoverride none with no overriding your apache will not scan every directory for .htaccess files making less of an overhead for each request

1713384
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you wont have to change your rules very often you should put them in the httpd.conf and turn off overriding in the top directory your rules apply to allowoverride none with no overriding your apache will not scan every directory for .htaccess files making less of an overhead for each request
whenever you do have to change your rules you will have to restart your apache server if you put it in your httpd.conf as opposed to them being instantly detected in .htaccess files because it reads them all on every request

1713937
daemons	systemd
the other possibility and i think that s the standard way in windows is to have a daemons program running started by the admin so it has the necessary privileges and this daemons waits for commands to process by some means of ipc network etc. checks if the user should be allowed to do that however this is determined and eventually processes those commands
at least in unix-like operating systemd linux you cannot possibly do that in java not even with jni

1716029
strtol	getline
you should probably use getline to read a line no matter what and then parse it with strtol or similar instead
yes getline is gnu-specific not posix

1716751
arp	tcp
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time
this implies that reuse of the arp is not causing it to stay refreshed which is possible behaviour that would be helpful in your situation

1716893
actionscript	mxml
once that load event is completed i instantiate my children in actionscript
i have a shell application that doesn t have any ui children declared in its mxml

1717830
quicksort	heapsort
that allows for example a merge-sort or a linked-list version of a quicksort contrary to popular belief quicksort isn t necessarily unstable even though the most common implementation for arrays is
with that proviso the short answer is that in most current standard libraries std sort is implemented as a intro-sort introspective sort which is basically a quicksort that keeps track of its recursion depth and will switch to a heapsort usually slower but guaranteed o n log n complexity if the quicksort is using too deep of recursion

1718883
hex	binary
second you d need to use a hex editor to pick around inside the guts of the application
windows notepad will not give you the ability to edit a binary file like this

1721850
udp	tcp
this would happen only if you have a very big udp burst
at the risk of just pointing you back the comments to that post explain that udp doesn t block on the tcp ack but you could still block on a kernel buffer overflow

1722180
innodb	myisam
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases
myisam is faster for reads and writes but not at the same time

1723585
queue	fifo
queue does not allow iteration through its elements
from the sgi stl docs a queue is an adaptor that provides a restricted subset of container functionality a queue is a fifo fifo data structure

1723660
swt	swing
check out swt and this
i think swing awt cannot do this without a guest program specific jni

1726749
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient does not allow you to set the timeout and the default for httpwebrequest what webclient uses is 100 seconds
i guess i will have to figure out how to get the progress when using httpwebrequest

1727198
quicksort	mergesort
and yet most people use quicksort instead of mergesort
one psychological reason that has not been given is simply that quicksort is more cleverly named

1727499
prng	random
but it is important that you use a prng not a true rng and that you pick a prng that has the right properties
from what i can tell the random class offers a prng with a cycle length of

1729055
apache	nginx
one apache installation and multiple passenger processes
if you need better performance and scalability you can use nginx as a frontend proxy and forward all rails requests to multiple backend servers each one composed of apache + passenger. i m not going into the technical details here this solution is intended to be used by rails projects with an high level of traffic

1730317
innodb	myisam
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

1730676
scrollable	panels
or you can create a custom panels and implement the scrollable interface
the key in this case is overriding getscrollabletracksviewportwidth to return true so the viewports width and not the width of the panels is used for layout purposes

1730863
postgresql	mysql
my general thoughts on foreign keys is that they re great but not usable in mysql and that postgresql handles them much better
foreign keys in mysql are only available to certain database engines

1733555
hex	binary	octal	binary
hex and octal are close enough to binary
most data on a hdd is binary data not meant to represent printable characters so if you use cat a command meant to output text not binary you get meaningless mush

1734289
persistent	transient
as for mom versioning the core data model versioning and data migration programming guide says core data s perspective on versioning is that it is only interested in features of the model that affect persistent
it doesn t clarify its position on transient properties however

1734444
ubuntu	linux
however unless you know how to fix future apt-get errors i d recommend not manually deleting any files that were installed by packages in ubuntu
j3ll3 in ubuntu or any dpkg-based linux os you can ask the question what package provides xyz by typing dpkg -s path to xyz so for example in ubuntu 9.10 dpkg -s usr lib python2.5 lib-dynload gdbm.so returns python-gdbm usr lib python2.5 lib-dynload gdbm.so you can find out more about the python-gdbm package by typing apt-cache show python-gdbm which says that python-gdbm provides gnu dbm database support for python . perhaps more interestingly if you type dpkg --listfiles python-gdbm you get to see a listing of all the files that python-gdbm installs ... usr lib python2.4 usr lib python2.4 lib-dynload usr lib python2.4 lib-dynload gdbm.so usr lib python2.5 usr lib python2.5 lib-dynload usr lib python2.5 lib-dynload gdbm.so usr lib python2.6 usr lib python2.6 lib-dynload usr lib python2.6 lib-dynload gdbm.so ... so it looks like this single package installs 3 .so libraries one for each version of python

1735623
serializable	deserialization
if the class implementing serializable contains a field which you d like not to be stored on the disk file system for example private string password bad example but it should give you the idea then you can just declare it transient to avoid its value being serializable to disk private transient string password
you only have to live with the fact that it won t be restored with its original value after deserialization

1735989
codeigniter	yii
with codeigniter it is recommended that all controller methods that should not be accessible via browser are declared private
yii brings this to another level requiring that all such methods start name with action it would be actionedit in your example so you really cannot call some arbitrary method from outside

1737338
daemons	systemd
first the client which is part of the cgi and this is the main daemons loop
this seems the easiest path to me as it does not involve creating another communication channel client apache your cgized existing script embedded systemd as opposed to client apache new cgi script existing script embedded systemd i assume the reason is that you expect the cgi script to run multiple times simultaneously and the embedded systemd is not able to handle multiple connections

1737973
mp3	wav
don t forget that an mp3 file is compressed whereas a wav isn t
so the delay might be the time it takes to read the mp3 file into memory and decompress it which doesn t have to happen with the wav file

1740020
vb6	vba
a basic example might look like this it s not great but it s about as good as it s going to get with vba vb6
as jtolle indicated this is simply not possible in vba vb6

1740020
vb6	vba
as jtolle indicated this is simply not possible in vba vb6
there is no perfect way to work around this but what i personally do is create a public friend sub call initialize with the parameters i want in vba vb6 you use optional parameters for overloading and then put a quick check in all exposed members of the class that throws an exception if you try to access them without running the initialize method

1740122
matlab	simulink
an example of what matlab can do that r cannot is interface to real-time hardware for signal processing acquisition and control
a simulink model in matlab can be configured both to run in simulation on your machine before compiling the code to execute on a real system taking measured data as input and calculating appropriate outputs what was before a simulation of a control system is now a fully functioning one

1740789
super	implements
of course remember to call super init first if you do go with just one method
for example and in the view controller you should alloc and init a testaccel object not an acc object also testaccel should implements the uiaccelerometerdelegate protocol and your view controller should not

1741131
persistent	transient
also when creating the nsfetchedresultscontroller the sectionnamekeypath has this limitation if this key path is not the same as that specified by the first sort descriptor in fetchrequest they must generate the same relative orderings. for example the first sort descriptor in fetchrequest might specify the key for a persistent property
sectionnamekeypath might specify a key for a transient property derived from the persistent property

1742184
prepare	execute
in addition to preventing sql injection pdo allows you to prepare a query once and execute it multiple times
if your query is execute multiple times within a loop for instance this method should be more efficient i say should be because it looks like that is not always the case on older versions of mysql

freebsd	linux
i built three servers for my latest project using freebsd and couldn t be happier
here is a very good albeit a bit outdated article about freebsd vs linux vs windows sorry no opensolaris

fgets	getline
if you can bound the maximum length of a line fgets may be a better way to read each line
but since you mention c++ you might consider using instead getline caveat fgets also put the n in the buffer it fills getline doesn t

haskell	ocaml
what you want is just a non-tagged union which is not an algebraic data type and isn t supported by haskell
ocaml has polymorphic variants see other answers

1747886
doc	rtf
i remembered the rtf capabilities of the clipboard and realised that a class could be created that would copy rtf data to the clipboard paste to a word doc and output the resulting plain text
the benefit of this solution is that the word doc object would not have to be opened and closed for each rtf string

memcached	apc
memcached in my experience is better at handling large numbers of concurrent writes to a single cache key
apc doesn t seem to cope very well with its cache filling up

1751784
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
subclass the root view controller as uinavigationcontroller instead of uiviewcontroller
the app is trying to treat your uiviewcontroller like a uinavigationcontroller which it s not

1752167
client-side	server-side
this essentially breaks all client-side validation
it s important to note that server-side validation does not automatically keep your page from processing

1753464
phpunit	simpletest
i could not understand how to download and install phpunit
i could however easily understand how to install simpletest

1757330
profiling	debugging
i would recommend using a profiling as others have mentioned and compare only similar configurations
i don t think anyone has mentioned this yet but the debugging build may not only affect the way your code executes but also the way the timer itself executes

1757781
hex	binary
for parsing hex to an integer and then down to binary use something like this build the protocol packet with something like this
i see two mistakes token should be passed in binary and not in hex ascii

1757781
hex	binary
i see two mistakes token should be passed in binary and not in hex ascii
you can t use the binary syntax to turn lists into binaries

1758403
intersect	contains
1 2 you can use the intersect extension method to do this
however if your second array contains elements not found in the first one these will then be in the resulting list intersect works symmetrically

1759130
calloc	malloc
you weren t checking the return value of malloc now calloc but same rules apply
if there isn t enough memory calloc returns null

1759292
ubuntu	debian
the debian guide can be quite useful when it comes to ubuntu normally programs install themselves in the usr local subdirectories
but debian packages must not use that directory since it is reserved for system administrator s or user s private use usr local bin seems to be acceptable according to the guide

1759575
inline	inlining
in maximally optimized code usually all private methods are inline whether you ask for it or not
as an aside to prevent inlining in gcc use __attribute__ noinline and in visual studio use __declspec noinline

1760471
inline-functions	inlining
implicit template instantiations have special linkage as inline-functions do
there is also static keyword which has been deprecated in favor of anonymous namespaces so yes this specialization in your example has the same linkage as in fact the compiler may mumble about inlining the specialization in your example saying they do not match

1762445
innodb	myisam
they probably had some problem with innodb and restored their database from backups
since innodb wasn t working it fell back to the myisam storage engine which doesn t support integrity constraints like foreign keys

1762445
innodb	myisam
since innodb wasn t working it fell back to the myisam storage engine which doesn t support integrity constraints like foreign keys
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine

1762445
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine
even if your statement says then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1763241
implements	extends
edit in this example objects implements sortedmap which extends map are accepted too so in your case you could create a baseinterface and extends that in the interfaces like acceptedinterface extends baseinterface you want to be accepted by your .register baseinterface arg method
to accept only objects that implement an interface as argument use the interface as type can be called with objects implements the map interface like hashmap but not with string s for instance as they do not implement map

1763304
rsa	aes	rsa	3des
pci dss does not require 1024 bit rsa to encrypt
older versions of the specification mentioned aes and 3des by name but i believe newer versions just specify strong encryption

1765105
cassini	iis
it does not work with the vs development web server cassini
also make sure that you have enabled asp debugging in iis iis home directory properties iis application configuration once you have the configuration in iis as noted above here is how to attach the debugger open the classic asp files in visual studio set a breakpoint anywhere you want to break in the server-side code view the page in a web browser ensures that the host process is running in visual studio debug menu - attach to process locate the iis asp worker process w3wp.exe on iis6 dllhost.exe on iis5.1 attach to the script code for the host process see below for example attach debugger dialog at this point the breakpoint should bind and you should be able to debug the classic asp pages

1765564
octal	hex	octal	decimal
- ie any number starting with 0 and not followed by x is octal 0 0 01 1 02 2 ... 07 7 010 8 011 9 012 10 ... -
by the way everyone 0x0 is hex as you have all mentioned but 0 is octal not decimal

1767044
ilist	icollection
from msdn ilist is a descendant of the icollection interface and is the base interface of all non-generic lists. ilist implementations fall into three categories read-only fixed-size and variable-size
a read-only ilist cannot be modified

1767044
ilist	icollection
a variable-size ilist allows the addition removal and modification of elements
the icollection t interface does not have an indexer so a fixed-size icollection t is automatically readonly - there is no way to modify an existing item

1767552
firefox	safari
safari and ie interpret multiple references to the same image and make a single request while firefox appears to make a unique request for each image linked to via css
i realize its probably not specificly understood as a bug but in an era where browsers are competing for being labeled the fastest -- seems like a potential improvement for firefox

1769144
google-chrome	firefox
i believe safari and google-chrome do too
the regular expression engine in firefox compiles some not all

1770469
appfuse	spring
it doesn t have the power of appfuse but is a good way to learn by example
mesir is simply a project skeleton using many useful frameworks including spring and hibernate

1771523
profiler	perf
someone pointing at microbenchmarks showing that something like i j with j 0 is 10x slower catching div-by-zero than checking j 0 pragmatic answer of how to approach performance for apps in general usually along the lines of make perf goals for your scenarios ideally working with customers build it so it s maintainable readable and robust run it and check perf of goal scenarios if a set of scenarios aren t making goal use a profiler to tell you where your time is being spent and go from there
iow any perf changes especially micro-optimizations like this made without profiling data driving that decision is typically a huge waste of time

1774881
inline	inlining
so all these properties accessor that would have been inline will be real calls now
thx to inlining simple properties will not add real overhead at runtime

1775953
des	aes	tripledes	aes
pem is a very old format so it only supports des tripledes
aes and blowfish were added later on but not supported by all implementations

1776642
innodb	myisam
ok ok unless you absolutely have to often due to fulltext matching not being available in innodb
even then you re often better off putting the canonical data in innodb and the fulltext index on a separate myisam searchbait table which you can then process for stemming. do use binary columns when you want rigorous string matching otherwise you get a case-insensitive comparison by default

1776845
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
you nest your video references so that browsers try these in order falling back if it s not supported ogg theora mp4 h.264 a flash container displaying #2 number 1 gets you firefox 3.5 and google-chrome
number 2 gets you safari and the mobile phone webkit browsers

1777246
webclient	httpwebrequest
imho overriding getwebrequest is the best solution to webclient s limited functionalty
before i knew about this option i wrote lots of really painful code at the httpwebrequest layer because webclient almost but not quite did what i needed

1777448
postgresql	mysql
rails is married to mysql so i m not surprised that it generates sql that doesn t work in postgresql
mysql s totally non standards compliant group by can be emulated by postgresql distinct on

1777759
innodb	myisam
innodb maintains referential integriry
myisam does not

1778620
jboss	weblogic
this is actually a well known problems with jboss 4.2.3.ga and the convention plug-in 2.1.6
quoting chris vogel in this thread that faced the same problem with weblogic in case you haven t figured it out i ll tell you what i have learned. struts xworks scans for action classes and does this by scanning directories it is given by the class loader not just by looking at jar files

1778964
trie	tree
a trie is an uncompressed prefix tree a tree in which the paths from root to leaf nodes correspond to all the prefixes of a given string
tries should be compared to and offset against suffix tree suffix arrays and q-gram indices not so much against other search tree because the data that they search is different instead of discrete words in a corpus the latter index structures allow a factor search

1779064
spaces	delimiter
first off your linked udf s default delimiter is the character not spaces
so using the default delimiter as you are you re getting a single row back with both words in it

1780746
webclient	httpwebrequest
for example you may need to authenticate with a web site before you can request the page you really want and webclient might not be able to do that
httpwebrequest will

1782787
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
quoting note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

1783772
prng	random
if you do not initialize the prng the default is to have it initialized with the value 1
of course initializing it with some other constant value will not give you different pseudo random numbers for different runs of the program

1784687
imperative	declarative
declarative programming is when you say what you want and imperative language is when you say how to get what you want
a simple example in python the first example is declarative because we do not specify any implementation details of building the list

1784702
imperative	declarative
with imperative programming you tell the compiler what you want to happen step by step
for example let s start with this collection and choose the odd numbers with imperative programming we d step through this and decide what we want here we re saying create a result collection step through each number in the collection check the number if it s odd add it to the results with declarative programming on the other hand you write code that describes what you want but not necessarily how to get it declare your desired results but not the step-by-step here we re saying give us everything where it s odd not step through the collection

1784716
imperative	declarative
c# is a much more imperative programming language but certain c# features are more declarative like linq the same thing could be written imperatively example from wikipedia linq
imperative programming is telling the computer explicitly what to do and how to do it like specifying order and such c# declarative is when you tell the computer what to do but not really how to do it

1791254
valgrind	gprof
better use something like oprofile or valgrind
gprof doesn t work with threads at all

1795117
postgresql	mysql
some things i ve personally used or seen used in postgresql that don t really exist in mysql afaict
transactions and full-text search together i know it s popular to use an external fts since mysql doesn t have one

1795117
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql i just do it all in one transaction and there s no chance i ll end up with this transaction partially applied
in mysql it can do the data conversion step in a transaction sure but if it has to rollback the new column has still been added so you need to clean it up by hand or write a more complex transaction to deal with that and even then it s still not atomic in the db

1796989
bash	subshell
the bash manual entry states this clearly each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process in a subshell
the same construct executed with the korn shell ksh runs the while in the same process not in a subshell and hence gives the expected answer

1797236
postgresql	mysql
it appears that mysql doesn t provide this functionality unlike postgresql according to the docs of regexbuddy mysql s support for regular expressions is rather limited but still very useful
mysql only has one operator that allows you to work with regular expressions

1798021
rsa	aes
this way the data will only be readable by people who have the private rsa key as anyone else wouldn t be able to decrypt the symmetric aes key
.net s rsacryptoserviceprovider class can read public keys from xml using the fromxmlstring method in the following format edit as i understand your procedure you re using the rsa public key as an aes symmetric key

1799202
floating-point	fractions
data can be lost when floating-point representations are converted to integral representations as the fractions components of the floating-point values will be truncated rounded down
conversely converting from an integral representation to a floating-point one can also lose precision since the floating-point type may be unable to represent the integer exactly for example float might be an ieee 754 single precision type which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly while a 32-bit integer type can

1799247
aggregate-functions	sum
you shouldn t group by some columns and then select other columns unless you use aggregate-functions
only p.partnumberp and sum remainderint make sense here

1800446
wordpress	joomla
wordpress has been used as a cms for a while now and i think it s often a great place to start
i love wordpress but it s not the only cms out there you should look at drupal joomla movable type or one of many other open source or even commercial cms

1800446
wordpress	joomla
i love wordpress but it s not the only cms out there you should look at drupal joomla movable type or one of many other open source or even commercial cms
you may also want to look at other products in the automattic family such as wordpress mu buddypress and bbpress

1801162
factors	mean
sometimes the log factors are ignored entirely and you might see õ f n o with a tilde above it which means o f n polylog f n o f n log f n k for some k
abuse of notation or not polylog n does mean some polynomial in log n just as poly n can mean some polynomial in n

1801708
client-side	server-side
dhtml is mostly used to describe client-side functionality and you use javascript for that
but if you mean dynamic web pages server-side functionality and you must use c you can use cgi common gateway interface rfc3875 however using c for web pages is not a good choice

1801943
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine
even if your statement says then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1801943
innodb	myisam
even if your statement says then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you
even if you later discover and fix the innodb problem all tables created during the problem remain myisam

1801977
boost	allocator
with all that out of the way i do recommend that every c++ programmer is at least familiar with the fact that boost exists and some of the core libraries like the smart pointer library regular expressions etc
i would not expect anybody working for me to be an expert in all facets of boost but i do expect even fairly inexperienced c++ programmers to know where they can find it and that they will be better off using code from boost rather than trying to say write their own pooled memory allocator

1802548
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend is almost entirely written in c# wpf
there is also at least one text editor component under development not sure if it is already available from a commercial third party actipro which is supposedly going to be available in silverlight and wpf versions

1807250
recvfrom	datagram
peter hosey is correct in stating that the given result of recvfrom means that there is no data to be read
if you are sending several udp datagram at a time from some host to your iphone some of those datagram may be discarded because the receive buffer size on the iphone is not large enough to accommodate that much data at once

1808085
implements	extends
b we have written a class which implements drag gesture listener
public class filedraggesturelistener extends dragsourceadapter implements draggesturelistener public void draggesturerecognized draggestureevent dge class textfiletransferable implements transferable so this is how we can able to download the file up to temp then we can not move that file to a location where is has been dropped

1808085
move	drag
public class filedraggesturelistener extends dragsourceadapter implements draggesturelistener public void draggesturerecognized draggestureevent dge class textfiletransferable implements transferable so this is how we can able to download the file up to temp then we can not move that file to a location where is has been dropped
please suggest where i am wrong or what best approach to implement this drag and drop

1810235
serializable	deserialization
i also try to abstract the versioning handling directly in my serializable framework + a few other things because dry should be adhered to on error-handling to ease error-detection i usually use a pair of markers special bytes to separate one object from another
it allows me to immediately throw during deserialization because i can detect a problem of desynchronization of the stream ie somewhat ate too much bytes or did not ate sufficiently

1810844
erlang	lisp
those that do not understand erlang are doomed to re-implement it badly
okay the original was about lisp but.

1810856
super	self
if self.clean_ship_to_billing return self.clean_billing_street return super orderform self .clean_shipping_street if you weren t as lazy as i was when i wrote the code you might want to avoid so many duplicate validations of the boolean field
this should be faster provided the default field isn t run unless it s needed - not sure on that myself def clean_shipping_street self print validating

1811452
config	ini
it simply declares the config from an ini file within an array
the exit function exists so the config file cannot be read directly from a browser with a leading

1812724
inline	inlining
keep in mind that the compiler is written by people way smarter then most mere mortals including myself and has access to more information when deciding to inline or not so when it doesn t inline it probably has a good reason
if you want to force inlining then use include files

1813757
perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
i don t know but you may want to check with perforce on this as this might be something specific to their plugin rather than something in the team su8pport i never have this problem with svn or cvs though maybe my builds are not big enough
also from what i understand the first generation perforce plugin had major problems but they have a new one that s much better

1814693
octal	hex
this still doesn t explain the why octal question but it does answer the why one
002 means 02 interpreted as an octal base 8 number similar to how x02 would be the same for a hex base 16 number

1814697
jar	manifest.mf
it doesn t contain com.gorkwobble.logmanager.logmanager this is what the error is saying check the content of the jar
a slightly different error when i double-click the jar-with-dependencies.jar failed to load main-class manifest attribute from c eclipseprojects logmanager target logmanager-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar again if you configured the assembly plugin as suggested you have something like this with this setup logmanager-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar contains the classes from the current module and its dependencies but according to the error its meta-inf manifest.mf doesn t contain a main-class entry its likely not the same manifest.mf as in logmanager-0.1.0.jar

1815047
udp	tcp
udp is completely stateless so after firing off a packet the only way an application can expect a response is if it knows the other end is going to send one
depending on the udp application i d expect that the response would come on the same port for simplicity -- this is not the case for protocols like tcp which have an intentionally random and high source port

1815372
vim	emacs
i would advise that checking out both is worth the time because of various reasons already covered by other answers or emacs vs vim vs xy threads
still if you would have to pick one of them i d go with vim because of one thing availability vi m has the advantage that it is installed not only available by default on almost any nix system

1817701
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is because an nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring so it is a nsstring. you can however create a mutable string from an nsstring with
you can set an nsmutablestring to an nsstring but not the other way around is okay but is not

1819084
stateless	stateful
the web application is by nature stateless so even if your users should log-in it does not make the application stateful
couple the things which are stateful in asp.net are session state cache which can be configured appropriately in a webfarm

1820480
google-chrome	firefox
it currently works in ie versions 6 and up as well as safari and google-chrome
it s not supported by firefox so this isn t really a useful answer yet but it s worth keeping in mind that the real best way will eventually be to let css handle this

1821881
memcached	apc
zend cache supports different backend storage devices including memcached file storage apc etc
each one has its own implementation - as you can see in the zend library - and apparently the memcached implementation doesn t support automatic cleaning

1827221
profiling	debugging	ssl	https
bear in mind to do that on a separate meaning not for other browsing activities firefox profiling in order to intercept https zap will install a new ssl certificate
wireshark won t help you if you have to debugging https requests unless you can get the encryption keys for both endpoints - see the wireshark site for details

1827266
innodb	myisam
you must switch to innodb
if you are reverse-engineering a myisam database you won t get foreign keys since they aren t supported by the engine

1828951
listview	gridview
i replaced with my listview with an items control
so i am not using the gridview of the list view anymore

1830399
awt	swing
your code is a bit messy there will be more syntax errors if compiled. you should not mix swing awt components for instance instead of using label use jlabel in swing for panel use jpanel
take note of the j prefix for swing you should be reading books perhaps if you want to know more on swing or even read some basic tutorials

1830722
kerberos	ntlm
the error you re seeing is an sspi error specifically and kerberos ntlm error and you should approach it using the kerberos ntlm tools and methodologies
most if not all kerberos ntlm issues can be troubleshoot using the troubleshooting kerberos errors document

1832437
jruby	mri
netbeans bundles jruby which is based and powered by java virtual machine jvm
sqlite3 ruby bindings are not compatible with jvm these needs the original and native ruby implementation also known as mri matz ruby implementation or c ruby

1832758
firefox	safari
it s for sure a certificate issue - it will work with https firefox and an official certificate
i use swfupload in combination with https on the site invoiceplatform.com and it works with ie safari firefox and chrome did not test other browsers

1833763
udp	tcp
you can use this call to create socket public socket inetaddress address int port inetaddress localaddr int localport throws ioexception this is normally done for udp and this is not advised for tcp connections
if you do this for tcp on both ends you can only have one tcp connection

1834397
boost	stl
also boost iterator_facade may be useful here.
to prevent exposing set iterator to not promise to users more than needed you can create a wrapper thus you will get rid of internal iterator because it s quite restrictive to be able to have only one iterator and will get ability to use algorithms from stl on particle s iterators

1834791
cpython	ironpython
for the cpython implementation of python yes it is guaranteed to be closed when its reference count goes to zero
for python as an abstract language including jython ironpython etc no it is not guaranteed to be closed

1835645
octal	hex
using octal for 8-bit bytes requires 3 octal digits of which the first can only have the values 0 1 2 and 3 the first digit is really tetral not octal . there is no reason to go to base32 unless somebody develops a system in which bytes are ten bits long so a ten-bit byte could be represented as two 5-bit nybbles
the zero prefix for octal and 0x for hex are from the early days of unix

1836274
cpython	ironpython
python s best feature is the batteries included standard library and even though this is not distributed with ironpython much of it will work if you just point ironpython to the installed library folder from cpython
in fact most pure python libraries no compiled c or c++ modules will work fine with ironpython

1838400
gridbaglayout	miglayout
once you get the hang of gridbaglayout it s not that bad to write initially but it s still not pretty to work with or to debug later on
i tried miglayout for something recently and was disappointed to find that the miglayout actually ended up being more complicated to use than the gridbaglayout in that particular case

1840855
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
hex is actually a bit too much already but octal has the problem that it doesn t evenly fit in a byte
this is part of why ada uses the form 16# to introduce hex constants 8# for octal 2# for binary etc

1840999
postgresql	mysql
also starting with version 8.3 of postgresql it is pretty much on-par performance wise with mysql it isn t like the older 7.x versions which were s-l-o-w
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

1841447
serializable	deserialization
if you only need serializable and not deserialization you could probably just do ast.tostringtree the above will give you a lisp like tree structure
an easy way to do serializable would be to use that in combination with a custom ast node class with an overridden tostring

1841636
ubuntu	linux
there are some very good recommendations here already but let me suggest that you develop your applet not so much for ubuntu as for gnome
it doesn t take much extra effort to also make rpm packages for distributions such as fedora and arch linux packages to name two examples

1842383
factors	mean
it s of course easier to make the code work in ie6 if you don t have to think about valid code at the same time but that s just because there are more factors to consider not because the factors are incompatible per se
it s a bit of work to make the code work in ie6 and there is a bit of work to make the code validate but that doesn t mean that it s the same kind of work or that one of them will make the other impossible

1843906
factors	mean
when i can choose i have server environment control and i don t mind factors 2 i choose python
just because you can write good code in php doesn t mean you should

1846875
set	bag
difference is semantic a set should be used when your collection is unordered and can contain each item only once a bag is still unordered however - it can contain some items many times well - at least with many-to-many mappings a list is a collection that is ordered and can contains some items many times - you have a guarantee that items will be retrieved in the same order as they were saved nhibernate will manage specified index column for you however both bag and list can be represented with ilist in code - that s perfectly ok but you have to remember that you cannot rely on order of items in a bag
when choosing how to map your list choose the option that best matches your collection - if you don t need order choose bag if you need order - choose list

1849457
queue	fifo
in that kind of situation a solution if often to not do that kind of heavy work within the apache processes but either run an external php process using something like shell_exec for instance -- this is if you must work in synchronous mode ie if you cannot execute the task a couple of minutes later push the task to a fifo system and immediatly return a message to the user saying your task will be processed soon and have some other process launched via a crontab every minute for instance check that fifo queue and do the processing it there is something in the queue that process itself can run in low priority mode
as often as possible especially if the heavy calculations take some time i would go for the second solution it allows users to get some feedback immediatly the server has received your request and will process it soon it doesn t keep apaches s processes working for long the heavy stuff is done by other processes if one day you need such an amount of processing power that one server is not enough anymore this kind of system will be easier to scale just add a second server that ll pick from the same fifo queue if your server is really too loaded you can stop processing from the queue at least for some time so the load can get better -- for instance this can be usefull if your critical web-services are used a lot in a specific time-frame

1851294
mvp	presenter
mvp places majority of meaningful functionality inside classes called presenter
presenter do not rely upon gwt implementation classes but instead depend on gwt interfaces mostly

1852378
multiplying	multiplication
if you multiplying on the right by the inverse of projection you will get world view
if you multiplying on the left you ll get something entirely different since matrix multiplication isn t commutative

1852392
mp3	wav	wav	ogg
however it only support wav files as far as i can tell - it does not support other common formats such as mp3 or ogg
wxpython has support for playing wav files on windows and unix - i am not sure if this includes macs

1852766
interpolation	splines
here s a minimal example of 1d interpolation with scipy -- not as much fun as reinventing but
the plot looks like sinc which is no coincidence try google splines resample approximate sinc

1853738
floating-point	fractions
if it s absolutely important that the numbers be stored in the form they were in the file don t use floating-point values
not all fractions base-10 values can be represented exactly in binary

1854546
opera	firefox
background-size isn t implemented yet in any browser but there is - -background-size for the newest versions of mozilla webkit konqueror and buggy opera don t use it in opera together with background-attachment fixed
mozilla developer center has more and a workaround for firefox 3.5

1856019
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib
out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup
use a dom library not regular expressions when dealing with manipulating html lxml a parser document and html serializer

1856019
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib
use a dom library not regular expressions when dealing with manipulating html lxml a parser document and html serializer
also can use beautifulsoup and html5lib for parsing

1858532
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf
double check that the war you deploy on tomcat has the following structure my-webapp |-- meta-inf | -- manifest.mf |-- web-inf | |-- classes | | |-- x | | | -- y | | | -- z.class | | -- another | | -- packagename | | -- anotherclass.class | |-- lib | | |-- ajar.jar | | |-- bjar.jar | | -- zjar.jar | -- web.xml |-- a.jsp |-- b.jsp -- index.jsp or that the jar that bundles x.y.z.class is present under web-inf lib
well you are not really providing enough details on your webapp but my guess is that you have a jsp with something like that and x.y.z can t be found on the classpath is not present under web-inf classes nor in a jar of web-inf lib

1861688
skip-lists	tree
the following types describe implementation linked list double linked list skip-lists array dynamic array hash table binary tree managed binary tree heaps leveled tree etc. tree where insertion and deletion is not done directly but through a procedure that guarantees certain constraints for the tree graph although very fancy the following describe purpose stack means filo can be implemented by a linked list but also with an array or vector queue means fifo can be implemented by a double linked list or maybe in other sensible ways dequeue ... priority queue means highest lowest key first out this is an abstract concept that can be implemented in many different ways map associative array dictionary means you map keys to values
often requires an extra function to convert keys into valid keys for the underlying hash table or tree set means it s a collection that is iterable and can tell whether a value is an element of the set or not

1861790
inline	inlining
you should simply mark functions as inline when 1 it is convenient for you and 2 you want to ensure that the compiler has the option of applying the inlining optimization
but you re not forcing the compiler to inline anything

1861856
inline	inlining
as others stated inline in c++ doesn t mean that compiler will inline function. and the other way around lack of inline will not stop strongly optimizing compiler and linker from inlining some function when they think it ll speed-up the program
inline in c++ says only one thing to the compiler this function is defined in header file and so it may be compiled independently in multiple compilation units. it is not an error so don t emit any error or warning message. instead during consolidation multiple versions of this function should be treated as one

1864858
cdr	cons
cdr isn t a car at all.
in lisp a linked list element is called a cons

1866020
xsl-fo	xslt
if you wish to avoid .net then xsl-fo is worth a look
try the foray project. xslt can be a steep learn if you do not have experience already

1866239
doc	rtf
this makes it easy to do something approximating form-filling on word .doc files using just standard file-utils and some trivial rtf- doc tweaking
i suggest generating rtf on the server it s easy enough to automatically generate using cpan s rtf writer has converters generating good pdf can be edited by hand in word oo-writer textedit doesn t have any really bad compatibility issues between the main editing applications and has decent text resource extraction tools with text extraction being rather better than pdf

1867309
super	implements
personally i do not find the uri type to be super useful but there are 2 options that i can think of create a new user type by implements iusertype see - search for the uri implementation it s about half way down create a protected string property that is mapped in nhibernate and wrap a public uri around it
update i haven t played with this but given that you are looking to map the properties of the uri i think you want to look at implements the icompositeusertype instead of iusertype

1872348
cvs	svn
cvs2svn does not have a feature to discard part of the cvs history
but you can convert the whole history then use svnadmin dump and svnadmin load to discard part of the repository after the conversion svnadmin dump -r r head path to full repo | svnadmin load path to abbreviated repo where r is the svn revision number of the first revision you would like to retain

1874334
ubuntu	linux
edit by calmarius this trivial code reproduces the problem when compiled with this command gcc -wl --no-as-needed -g -o stuff main.c -ldl -lpthread even the latest valgrind 3.11 can reproduce this on ubuntu 14.04 upstream bug has been reported
was able to reproduce this issue with some hello world code which doesn t even call any symbols in the loaded object. i assume it s a bug in libc or valgrind. reproducible on ubuntu 9.04 and scientific linux 5.3 20 and 32 bytes respectively

1875320
freebsd	linux
the canonical example of a full system profiling tool for solaris os x freebsd is dtrace
but it is not yet fully available on linux you can try here but the site is down for me at the moment and i haven t tried it myself

1879748
implements	extends
as far as i know there is no built-in c# or .net library function for this so you d have to implements something on your own or find some code online whose license suits your needs
a simple greedy algorithm shouldn t be too difficult to implements however until the required number of characters is reached extends the shortest sequence of spaces by one choose one randomly if there is more than one such sequence . i d distribute the spaces randomly rather than starting at the center to make sure the spaces are evenly distributed among your text rather than concentrated at one position

1880993
g++	gcc
i m doing which prints out foo bar works with msvc2005 but not with gcc g++
edit to make it work with gcc g++ you can abuse variadic macros however it s your discipline not to use the macro with too many parameters

1881052
implements	extends
another solution which would perhaps be easier to implements and still arguably pretty neat would be to overwrite or wrap jquery s function with a function of your own that stringifies the json on the client this is done anyway to create the request in the first place so it shouldn t be a lot of overhead and checks length there
the gain with this approach is that you don t have to mess with extends the service handler but also the part of truncating the object would be easier as your javascript object is readliy at hand

1881169
g++	gcc
well this thread is already a bit old however i was dealing with the same problem and found a way to initialize an array of pointers to arrays like this and i get the output compiling with gnu g++ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and compiling with intel icpc 0 1 1 40896 32767 -961756724 0 32767 4198878 0 so the syntax seems to be in principle correct just that the intel compiler does not correcly support it probably due to a lack of common use of this style
--- edit --- here is also a c version as demanded i tested it with gcc and clang and it prints the correct result. btw

1883519
django	web2py
web2py was very much inspired by django and if you know one it is easy to learn the other
we added some features we did not find in django including database migrations alter tables automatically tickets on errors a web based ide a database abstraction layer that works on google app engine a role based access control mechanism with pluggable login modules

1883519
django	web2py
one of the fundamental design differences is that in django apps are implemented as modules and therefore you need to restart the server when you edit them
in web2py instead models views controllers are not modules they are executed not imported by the frameworks and therefore you do not need to restart the server when they change

1886025
ssl	https
https is http over ssl encrypted connection
ssl certificates are free getting them signed by a known certificate authority isn t free nor cheap

1887094
gtk	clutter
gtk doesn t offer that much although you can use clutter alongside with it
if you re specifically looking into db xml gtk has a parser for a subset of xml and threading gtk has glib features then qt will offer all that in qtsql qtxml and qtconcurrent

1891212
gridview	repeater
if you need to be able to sort your results by column however you may want to look at the gridview control
i prefer using the standard asp.net listview control mostly because it is not much more complex than a repeater but the listview can support data paging

1893180
innodb	myisam
on testing the foreign keys are not created on my machine using this syntax but they are when i use this create statement an easy way to see if foreign keys exist on a table is show create table bugs_products or you can query the information schema also check you re using the innodb storage engine
the myisam engine does not support foreign keys

1893638
freebsd	linux
all servers are nix-like freebsd os x linux but not all run apache
my freebsd mirror runs xshttpd somebody most knowledgable must be dedicated maintainer for a long time

1896729
multiplying	division
in order to get two decimal places multiplying the number by 100 floor it then divide by 100
and note that the number you will return will not really have only two decimal places because division by 100 cannot be represented exactly in ieee-754 floating-point arithmetic most of the time

1898214
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
however given that you don t have a fast multiplying i m not sure it s worth it - you might want to first work on implementing a fast multiplication algorithm
first implement multiplying using repeated addition

1900794
profiling	benchmarking
and then examine exactly what the compiler is doing in your case by profiling timing and on when necessary by examining the individual instructions
and when timing your code be aware of all the caveats and gotchas that can invalidate your benchmarking make sure optimizations are enabled but also that the code you re trying to measure isn t optimized away

1901673
profiling	debugging
i have no idea if and how the nhprof reports batching but using the normal sql profiling you cannot notice it
to verify how it works and if it is indeed enabled as i have set it up i had to debugging the nhibernate s code

1904946
boost	stl
in the case of hashed containers there s a whole progression from the various implementations of hash_map to the boost containers to the tr1 containers to those that will be included in the standard library in c++ 0x
depending on how you define stl there s a pretty good chance that at least one of those isn t stl and another is but there s no one point at which it s likely to make sense to treat one differently from another

1905514
jtextpane	jeditorpane
you can change jtextpane s font only as a whole it doesn t do rich text
there s a document underneath jeditorpane and apparently jtextpane too which you get a hold of with getdocument

1906478
firefox	safari
when you go back in the browser history safari and afaik firefox as well doesn t request the page again
instead safari webkit keeps a copy in memory of the previous visited page so that going back is almost instantaneous

1907927
innodb	myisam
you then have to make sure you update the myisam tables from any new text inserted into the innodb tables after a successful transaction
whilst the lack of transaction support in myisam risks occasionally making the data inconsistent in concurrent or error conditions a danger that obviously also applies to the separate fulltext store solution like sphinx lucene et al that s not a big problem in reality as it s only the searchbait that becomes inconsistent and not your actual data

1908049
arp	tcp
the first syn can t be sent until the arp response arrives
maybe the os or tcp stack uses a timeout instead of an event for threads beyond the first one that try to open a connection when the associated mac address isn t known

1908733
xslt	xquery
if your input is based on more than one xml document you are pretty much stuck with xquery if your output is not xml based you are pretty much stuck with xslt
xslt is designed to take one xml document and transform it into something else csv html or a different xml format xhtml

1908733
xslt	xquery
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml
personally i find the xml based syntax and the declarative nature of xslt slightly difficult to read and maintain

1910175
wadl	wsdl
following on the comment above about wadl you can also try wsdl 2.0
while not widely adopted yet wsdl 2.0 does contain good support for rest style services

1911650
vsto	add-in
i suggest you to download the sample code and apply the following modifications in connect.cs in panelmanager.cs the proof-of-concept is a managed com add-in and not using vsto but a very similar approach should also work for vsto
let me know in case you need any further help as the proof-of-concept already requires some knowledge about subclassing and the office add-in architecture idtextensibility2

1912607
cpython	ironpython
the gil is not actually part of python it s an implementation detail of cpython the reference implementation that the core python devs work on and that you usually get if you just run python on your linux box or something
jython ironpython and any other reimplementations of python generally do not have a gil and multiple pure-python threads can execute simultaneously

1914152
inline-functions	inlining
but if you are curious about the compiler internals it will fold constants but it will not inline-functions or unroll loops
inlining functions is a hard problem in a dynamic language

1914781
primes	modulus
select primes content with specified id
if you really want to store primes as numbers and one of questions stopping you is primes numbers can not be broken down into factors there are another thing store it in list of modulus of any number ordered by sequence

1914781
primes	modulus
if you really want to store primes as numbers and one of questions stopping you is primes can not be broken down into factors there are another thing store it in list of modulus of any number ordered by sequence
small example list is 81 17 83 2 in real application is useful to split by modulus of 2 32 32-bits integers specially if primes in processing application stored as byte arrays

1914781
primes	modulus
small example list is 81 17 83 2 in real application is useful to split by modulus of 2 32 32-bits integers specially if primes in processing application stored as byte arrays
storage in db create table primes prime_id number not null part_order number 20 not null prime_part_value number not null

1916511
jboss	weblogic
for example an application which uses ejbs can run on ibm websphere redhat s jboss bea s weblogic etc and not have to comply with jboss s license
maybe shipping jboss and your app on the same cd would violate the license for jboss but your app is otherwise free of restrictions unless it includes parts of jboss in it

1916901
super	implements
you can find an example of that in classwritercomputeframestest that introduces a classinfo abstraction similarly simpleverifier.getclass method is used by simpleverifier.isassignablefrom and you can overwrite the latter and use the classinfo abstraction to find the common super type
if i am not mistaken aspectwerkz project had implements similar thing in its type pattern matching code

1917866
division	subtract
i m sure that there is a more elegant way of adding the records in the union but i hope that the idea comes across. then run you count id group by division on this recordset may be a temporary query and subtract the dummy record from the count so the select clause would be select division count id -1
i m not exactly sure how to do this properly in access but here is an idea of making sure that there is always at least one row in the result set basically this statement adds a dummy record for each division

1919178
set	bag
bags or multisets are as you can see from the links above a type of set which does allow the objects within it to be duplicates of other objects
these are not generally used as lists ordering can be ignored and hence treated as a bag

1921272
mp3	wav
the iphone can play multiple of these files at the same time mp3 aac cannot because you need the hardware decoder
you can convert wav to caf with the following terminal command on mac os x also if you play these with avaudioplayer avfoundation you will not have to worry about caching as avaudioplayer already does this

1921585
ubuntu	linux
only if you have a friendly linux geek next to you for a week go for ubuntu server on the first day
linux is case sensitive totally new default locations u g o r w x permissions can come as a rude shock to people new to linux symlinks can be helpful but confusing because of windows links not shortcuts being a bit different if mysql stores tables as files with the same name which it does in general case senstitivity can make you feel very lost as nothing works in both php filesystem and mysql my documents to home username documents is a big change in thinking for people new to linux various service configs for server security might confuse you initially any hardware compatibility issues for your linux and your hardware usually very minor problem but can take up hours of figuring out what the problem is. don t expect a cakewalk if the app is real-world and giving you some income

1922486
postgresql	mysql
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing
what i need to know is whether the porposed solution is suitable for such a small project and could not be easily replaced by less complicated languages frameworks dmbses like php with mysql etc. yes

1922688
equals	icomparable
it s not clear which type you re calling indexof on anyway but most collections won t use icomparable anyway - they ll just use equals and do a linear search
unless you ve overridden equals or implemented a class will be compared by reference identity and a struct will have auto-generated equality comparisons

1922764
comparator	comparable
on the other hand you can provide a comparator when constructing the treemap and it will use that object to compare objects and determine the sort order
you can use comparators to compare objects that do not implement comparable or enforce a different sorting strategy

1924747
xsl-fo	xslt
an editor like oxygen xml has in built fop support which makes it easy to quickly test your xsl-fo and should make it easier to learn xsl-fo but you can do the same thng from the command line and several other editors as well
i d recommend michael kays xslt book as it s a great reference book for xslt xslt programmer s reference 2nd edition link also the fop book by dave pawson is the best available xsl-fo reference book i know of although there is admittedly not much available

1926657
serializable	deserialization
because in your first example you re creating an anonymous subclass of arraylist via double-brace initialization and arraylist implements the serializable interface
the serialversionuid is used in deserialization and it s a good practice to provide one though not strictly necessary

1926847
implements	extends
only a few classes implements ifocusmanagercomponent as others mentioned and canvas is not one of them
if you really must call focusmanager.setfocus you will have to extends the canvas class to implements this interface and use that class instead

1929790
onreadystatechange	onload
in these browsers only the onload listener is useful to detect the end of a script loading the onreadystatechange is not needed
in firefox safari and chrome the onreadystatechange handler nevers gets called

1929891
onreadystatechange	onload
en presto 2.2.15 version 10.10 test for script.readystate behavior started added script with onreadystatechange handler test1.js start test1.js start of closure test1.js end of closure readystatechange loaded readystatechange loaded these different behaviors indicate that onreadystatechange is not a reliable way to detect the end of a script loading in opera
since opera also supports the onload listener this other mechanism should be used instead

1930131
imperative	declarative
cmake s build model for c++ is more declarative and less imperative and thus to me easier to use
the cmake language syntax isn t great but a declarative build with odd syntax beats an imperative build in python

1930483
udp	tcp
you can get udp type behaviours over unicast tcp pubsub
re udp i am not sure if udp would be useful here

1931639
spaces	delimiter
the yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss format has a locale language issue on sql server 2005 an example is french but is fixed in sql 2008 so do not use this format yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss spaces separator
only use yyyy-mm-ddthh mm ss t separator or yyyymmdd hh mm ss no dash delimiter important if you re generating scripts that include datetime constants

1931836
queue	fifo
queue a collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. besides basic collection operations a queue provides additional insertion extraction and inspection operations
queues typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner

1931836
queue	fifo
queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner
among the exceptions are priority queue which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements natural ordering

1932236
des	rsa
this was especially true in france which for a time outlawed all non-governmental uses of crypto even very weak 40-bit des
although france has loosened up a bit they still seem to behind most other developed countries in understanding that a their citizens have a valid right to privacy and b there s not much they can do to stop it in a world where 4096 bit rsa is available all over the net

1932349
implements	extends
the most flexible way to program for this is provide the interface provide the abstract class that implements the interface provide the concrete classes that either extends from the abstract class or extends from another class and implements the interface alway unless you cannot declare variables parameters constants as the interface rather than the abstract class or concrete classes there is no point in having the concrete classes implements the interface more later . there is no point in having the abstract class repeat the abstract methods from the interface
by doing #4 you ensure that all classes that implements the interface can be used - if you were to use the abstract class instead then classes that implements the interface but do not extends the abstract class cannot be used

1932349
implements	extends
by doing #4 you ensure that all classes that implements the interface can be used - if you were to use the abstract class instead then classes that implements the interface but do not extends the abstract class cannot be used
later part the one argument for having the abstract class and the concrete classes implements the interface is that if you were to later change the concrete class to no longer extends the abstract class then you could forget to also implements the interface which in some cases could break the code without the compiler complaining

1932371
inline	inlining
about performance the wise approach is as always to profile the application then eventually inline a set of functions representing a bottleneck
references to inline or not to inline 9 inline functions policies binary compatibility issues with c++ gotw #33 inline inline redux effective c++ - item 33 use inlining judiciously edit bjarne stroustrup the c++ programming language a function can be defined to be inline

1932371
inline	inlining
references to inline or not to inline 9 inline-functions policies binary compatibility issues with c++ gotw #33 inline inline redux effective c++ - item 33 use inlining judiciously edit bjarne stroustrup the c++ programming language a function can be defined to be inline
for example the inline specifier is a hint to the compiler that it should attempt to generate code for a call of fac inline rather than laying down the code for the function once and then calling through the usual function call mechanism

1932371
inline	inlining
to make inlining possible in the absence of unusually clever compilation and linking facilities the definition and not just the declaration of an inline-functions must be in scope 9.2
an inline especifier does not affect the semantics of a function

1935090
udp	tcp
you mention udp and even raw sockets but it s not clear to me why
web services are typically http which means they re over tcp

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached does not have any bytecode or php acceleration features which is why i would run it side-by-side with apc or xcache
memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time

1935367
stateless	stateful
you should always use a connection pool and if you re running inside an application server which if you re using ejbs then you are then you can easily use your appserver s datasource configuration to create a connection pool and use that inside your stateless session bean slsb
this is not what stateful session beans sfsb are intended to be used for

1935790
innodb	myisam
t-sql it doesn t have a specific name but yes it supports stored procedures and functions manual chapter 19 transactions yes mysql supports them in some of its storage engines innodb for instance
some storage engines don t support them myisam for instance but you can just not use those

1936371
jboss	weblogic
the coldfusion support matrix lists a limited number of java ee servers that they support weblogic server 9.2 10.3 websphere application server nd 6.1 nd 7 jrun updater 7 jboss 4.2 5.01 your choice from this list is going to be dictated by commercial realities not technical ones - weblogic and websphere are the leading servers but commercial and expensive
jboss is free although you can pay for a support contract

1936372
awt	swing
you should not be using a windowlistener to close the frame again this is an old awt technique
swing applications now use the frame.setdefaultcloseoperation ... method to control this

1938284
verilog	vhdl
verilog is based on c so knowing c will help with learning verilog however fpgas are by nature parallel so even though the syntax might look similar not much else translates
like others have said most fpga s are designed using vhdl or verilog

1939736
uiview	subviews
the view controller s view is still of type uiview therefore you cannot call tran s -dosomething on the view controller s view because that view is not of type tran
your subclass of uiview should be capitalized to tran for readability class names are capitalized you are adding m_view to the view controller s view via -addsubview therefore the view controller view has a subviews array and that array contains an object instance of type however neither using -addsubview nor casting via makes the view controller view of type tran

1939838
jboss	glassfish
i am not connected in any way with redhat jboss or sun glassfish my company erudis.pl is supporting and developing for both servers
a number of things from my own experience glassfish has much better administration console jboss has three consoles each of them far from being ideal

1941719
move	drag
i have seen cases where the dragged object doesn t move exactly with the mouse and for a short while the mouse is actually hovering over another object causing the mouseout event to fire thus changing the cursor
i would look at the mouseout event and determine if its firing when you re moving the mouse during a drag

1943251
coalesce	isnull
also as of 2008 i don t know whether the option exists in 2005 one can persist a computed column and add a constraint create table t c1 int null c2 as isnull c1 1 persisted not null c3 as isnull c1 null persisted not null c4 as coalesce c1 1 persisted not null c5 as coalesce c1 null persisted not null go insert into t c1 values null results in a constraint violation
i d prefer the ansi standard coalesce function but isnull is fine

1943251
coalesce	isnull
to use coalesce define your computed column as coalesce dbo.fn_getprice itemid 0 edit learn something new everyday
i did the following create table t c1 int null c2 as isnull c1 1 c3 as isnull c1 null c4 as coalesce c1 1 c5 as coalesce c1 null exec sp_help t and c2 is indeed not nullable according to sp_help but c4 is reported as being nullable even though there is no way that coalesce expression could result in a null value

1945369
google-chrome	firefox
its not a google-chrome webkit issue
infact its a firefox issue

1945742
haskell	ocaml
i found that learning a less aggressively functional language before moving on to haskell is a step worth taking
you may want to consider ocaml objective caml another functional programming language that is not pure nor lazy

1946757
udp	tcp
it might not be quite as efficient as udp if you were not worrying about packet loss but you should be able to transmit the data just fine
tcp ip would work

1947423
postgresql	mysql
unfortunately mysql does not support function based indexes like postgresql and oracle
source a possible workaround in mysql is to add another column for lower case e-mail addresses and a trigger that populates it with lower case e-mails on all updates and inserts

1948426
ienumerable	iqueryable
thanks to itowlson for pointing out that it has to be not just ienumerable
you ll have to turn it into two queries it s important that query be ienumerable instead of var or iqueryable it s important that you call asenumerable so that you get back an as we want to force the second query to use linq to objects on the results of the first linq to sql query

1949755
jboss	glassfish
if you want to run in container tests then you could indeed use an embedded container and my current preference goes to glassfish v3 even for java ee 5 i may be wrong but i m pretty disappointed by the starting time of the latest jboss releases so it isn t getting much of my attention
see the post glassfish embedded reloaded an appserver in your pocket for sample code that you could use from your tests or using maven plugin for v3 embedded glassfish if you are using maven

1951172
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
in cpython today you need not worry -- reference counting in practice does ensure timely closure
but most other python implementations jython on the jvm ironpython on .net pypy on all sorts of backends pynie on parrot unladen swallow on llvm if and when it matures per its published roadmap ... do not guarantee the use of reference counting -- many garbage collection strategies may be involved with all sort of other advantages

1951706
mdpi	hdpi
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal
note that other dimension types such as in and mm do take into account the screens density. so for densities you have 3 choices ldpi 120 mdpi 160 and hdpi 240

1952389
gif	png
no the gif format does not support alpha-channel transparency like png does
you can only select one out of the 256 possible colors in a gif to be transparent

1952390
gif	png
the gif format doesn t support this so unfortunately no there isn t a way to do it
the edges in a png are smooth because of anti-aliasing and thus variable opacity

1953683
profiling	benchmarking
some top tips from mysql performance tips forge specific query performance use explain to profiling the query execution plan use slow query log always have it on
don t use distinct when you have or could use group by insert performance batch insert and replace use load data instead of insert limit m n may not be as fast as it sounds don t use order by rand if you have 2k records use sql_no_cache when you are selecting frequently updated data or large sets of data avoid wildcards at the start of like queries avoid correlated subqueries and in select and where clause try to avoid in scaling performance tips use benchmarking isolate workloads don t let administrative work interfere with customer performance

1954290
client-side	server-side
any other method mentioned--cookies javascript http referer--depends on client-side data which is insecure and should always be suspected of being fake forged hijacked and maliciously constructed
really the most secure way to do this is to as you suggested use server-side sessions as these cannot be crafted as cookies can

1957820
super	self
two links with examples of super and multiple inheritance things to know about python super 1 of 3 python s super is nifty but you can t use it
super classtype self .__init__ is not redundant in a cooperative multiple inheritance scheme -- classtype is not necessarily the type of self but the class from which you want to do the cooperative call to __init__

1957820
super	self
then in b.__init__ you must pass the class type b to super -- since you want to resolve calling superclasses of b or rather the next in the mro after b of the class c
class a object def __init__ self pass class b a def __init__ self super b self .__init__ class c b def __init__ self super c self .__init__ if you now instantiate you see that the class type is not redundant -- super self .__init__ inside b.__init__ would not really work

1957820
super	self
class a object def __init__ self pass class b a def __init__ self super b self .__init__ class c b def __init__ self super c self .__init__ if you now instantiate you see that the class type is not redundant -- super self .__init__ inside b.__init__ would not really work
what you do is that you manually specify in which class the method calling super is an this is solved in python 3 s super by a hidden variable pointing to the method s class

1959795
innodb	myisam
then you can pretty much forget about myisam and not devote resources to it and get the full benefits of using innodb
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

1960996
memcpy	memmove
also on some architectures memcpy can benefit from using cpu instructions for moving blocks of memory - something that memmove cannot use
memcpy doesn t have any special handling for overlapping buffers so it lacks some checks therefore it is faster than memmove

1962851
httphandler	httpmodule
in iis6 isapi filters extensions were analogous to httpmodule httphandler
in terms of httpmodule they cannot deliver the exact same functionality as isapi filters

1964735
webclient	httpwebrequest
when using the .net compact framework you can use system.net.httpwebrequest instead of webclient which isn t supported on .net cf
since webclient is implemented on top of httpwebrequest you can do everything with httpwebrequest that you can with webclient albeit with more code

1964772
boost	allocator
note about boost pool
when testing performance of boost pool test not only allocator but also deallocation

1964772
boost	allocator
when testing performance of boost pool test not only allocator but also deallocation
i experienced that boost pool and boost fast_pool deallocation time can be extremally large

1965541
division	multiplication
the code compiled with gcc tdiv.c -o1 -o tdiv.s -s the division by 2 and the multiplication by 0.5 however when i changed those int s to double s which is what python would probably do i got this division flds lc0 fstl -8 ebp fldl -8 ebp flds lc1 fmul st st 1 fxch st 1 fstpl -8 ebp fxch st 1 multiplication fstpl -16 ebp fldl -16 ebp fmulp st st 1 fstpl -16 ebp i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using int division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2
using double multiplication is shorter because the compiler uses the processor s floating point opcodes which probably run faster but actually i don t know than not using them for the same operation

1965845
config	ini
with any stable setup there is on the face of it very little point in storing your config file above the web root although given murphy s law it is worth doing if you can that or use .htaccess or the equilivent for your server to deny user access to a directory
i store it in a plain text ini style config file usually above the web root so as not to allow users access to it

1966649
inline	inlining
note that i have to force the function not to be inline
otherwise gcc detects that there aren t any aliasing pointers in my benchmark code and restrict wouldn t make a difference due to inlining

1967152
config	ini
except its not in ini format because it doesn t contain but just key which chokes config ini
alas this is one of the few ini parsers i could find that will deal with a string

1967902
realloc	malloc
new returns a pointer of proper type but the pointer what malloc returns has to be typecasted c++ new delete does not have realloc alternative unlike new delete these things are not going to make much of difference in your program
so as stated above it is perfectly fine to go for new your code will not fail unless new or malloc fails in which case new throws an exception and malloc return a null pointer

1968421
alloca	calloc
edited use alloca instead of calloc
there are two different situations to consider 1 an object is created in the local scope and it is not needed outside this local scope. in this case you could allocate storage with calloc alloca or with a raii approach

1968421
alloca	calloc
there are two different situations to consider 1 an object is created in the local scope and it is not needed outside this local scope. in this case you could allocate storage with calloc alloca or with a raii approach
using calloc alloca has the big advantage that you don t have to care about calling free because the allocated memory is automatically freed when the local scope is left

1972067
nunit	mstest
i ve actually never used mstest myself since i started learning tdd with nunit right away
one of the reasons i did not try out mstest first was that i heard mostly negative opinions whenever i mentioned it to most tdd ers

1977069
serializable	deserialization
datacontractserializer it s fast - around 10 faster than xmlserializer it s interoperable - works flawlessly with java ruby - you name it uses explicit opt-in model - you need to mark what gets serializable doesn t require any constructor can serializable non-public members and internal fields doesn t support attributes on xml nodes you tell the dcs explicitly what to serializable but you don t have much influence over how it s done
xmlserializer serializes only public fields and properties serializes everything except those you exclude opt-out model support attributes and everything it s interoperable - works flawlessly with java ruby - you name it requires a parameterless constructor for deserialization you tell the xmlserializer pretty clearly how and what to serializable but you cannot serializable everything - only publicly visible properties

1978191
vmware	virtualbox
but when the virtual machine bears no resemblance to the machine it is running on then there s no need for special help from the operating system and hardware and no need for anything as complex as vm 370 or vmware
a jvm is not virtual in the same sense as a virtualbox or vmware virtual machine

1978278
emacs	aquamacs
try learning to browse through the documentation within info mode in emacs rather than resorting to the web to get more used to how navigation works in emacs
oh and try using an emacs that doesn t have the aquamacs key bindings

1978278
emacs	aquamacs
oh and try using an emacs that doesn t have the aquamacs key bindings
there is a command line version of emacs included on mac os x though using the meta key is a pain there you have to either set your terminal preferences to use option as meta or always use esc

1979389
jsf	wicket	tapestry	wicket
for high traffic sites i d use a framework that doesn t manage client state on the server - wicket jsf and tapestry are managing client state on the server
i d only use those frameworks wicket is my favourite if the application should be more like a desktop application

1979395
onclick	onsubmit
to form element c use the submit procedure form action ... method get no onclick event the browser will be happy and you can control the submit in the onsubmit event you can cancel it or not
means put a button in the page and do whatever the onclick event says

1980006
webclient	httpwebrequest
of course if you want to download the resource if it exists it would most likely be more efficient to send a get request instead by not setting the method property to head or by using the webclient class
if you re attempting to verify the existence of a web resource i would recommend using the httpwebrequest class

1980138
xdebug	xhprof
i suggest not using xdebug on live site and if needed configuring it to activate on demand through trigger as described in docs
as bender said xhprof 1 2 is much lighter then xdebug and i prefer it for taking profiling info about the live site

1981078
bazaar	git
bazaar get is alias of bazaar branch which is roughly equivalent of git clone
in the case of bazaar checkout you should not use bazaar pull but should use bazaar update instead

1981192
bazaar	svn
if you change your mind later and want it to behave more like svn you can do a bazaar bind and any commits you make will automatically be committed to the parent branch
basically you have the option of not being tied to the branch you got the code from if you want a standalone copy use bazaar get if you want to be automatically bound to the original branch use bazaar checkout

1987465
decimal	ieee
however money and decimal are
ieee 754 and related floating point numbers cannot accurately represent many decimal values

1988044
cassini	iis
there is nothing wrong with cassini
it s simple webserver but it s not the only alternative to iis

1989291
datamapper	activerecord
this is one of the reasons that ruby-on-rails upcoming move to merb has been generally seen as a positive move for ruby-on-rails as merb makes use of the datamapper pattern in addition to activerecord
i m not sure demeter is the primary concern with activerecord

1989455
gif	png
png gif
the gif image format does not support alpha transparency

1989492
gif	png
as other posters have pointed out gif doesn t support alpha transparency--but a single color in the gif can be set as fully-transparent
you could convert the png to a 256-color paletted bitmap and replace any fully-transparent a 255 to colors.transparent and then save the new image as a gif

1989821
postgresql	mysql
also outside the standard postgresql has many peculiar data types including user-defined types and multi-dimensional arrays mysql has unsigned integers
i would say that two of the largest differences are with queries and window functions -- standard sql features from the sql-99 standard that are also available in other major sql implementations such as oracle db2 sql server ... but not in mysql

1989971
super	implements
if you re ok with changing all the run implementations and calling run instead of run_all in d this works note that i don t use super in the root class -- it knows there s no further superclass to go up to object does not define a run method
unfortunately in python 2 this is inevitably verbose and not well suited to implements via a decorator either

1991116
nunit	mstest
you can just create a class library add a reference to nunit and mark your tests with the corresponding attribute
the wizards are only for mstest and even then not required

1992567
hex	binary
some examples of outputting an integer as hex
integers in .net are not stored as decimal they are stored as binary in two s complement representation

1992574
innodb	myisam
the same won t happen on other storage engines in mysql such as innodb
but really you want to be using innodb and not myisam in most cases for a variety of other reasons

1994459
super	self
usually we ll write because super s initialization method might return an object that s not the same as the one that was allocated
so that s why we use self in initxxx method and we don t need to use self in other kinds of methods

1995378
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
in this case you need to work on a case-sensitive file system or you will need to edit the repository to ensure that no collisions of this sort occur
a case-insensitive file system simply cannot store the contents of this repository

1998373
udp	tcp
in case of udp packets will be lost
with tcp this cannot happen

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable does not allow indexed access to the collection whereas ilist does
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
if you need to go from ienumerable to ilist you may try a cast first if you get lucky it will work
if not you ll have to foreach over the ienumerable collection and build a new ilist

2002620
struts	stripes
reason i am asking is i am looking at a web application and they seem to be using both spring and struts
using struts 2 or stripes doesn t exclude using spring for dependency injection and other services

2003499
innodb	myisam
for example innodb stores multiple tables in its tablespace and the data file timestamp does not apply
for myisam the data file timestamp is used

2005181
udp	tcp
the dangerous part of udp is that unlike tcp ip it doesn t do any handshake
effectively this means that an attack app could be built that floods a local network with udp packets

2005181
icmp	udp
the external server doesn t have to send anything at all back only nice boxes will send back icmp errors
i also imagine there could be some pretty creative ways to overwhelm a firewall that supports udp traversal

2005516
implements	extends
of course you you can specialize once you have these types but this has to be done by someone who implements these types
2 do not provide default one and specialize for basic types it s not ideal too depends on how many basic types you expect to use 3 use isderivedfrom trick calling test outputs as i understand that s your goal extends it to work with more types like wrap is possible but messy too but it does the trick - you don t need to do a bunch of specializations

2005786
vb.net	vb6
vb6 created the .exe in the same directory as the project vb.net doesn t
vb6 s app.path really does do the same thing as application.executablepath it is just that the .exe is written to a different directory

2006682
spweb	spsite
found a solution myself the trick i did not know is that if you use a long url in the constructor of the spsite it gives you the spweb object with the deepest possible address that matches your url described here still i have to loop through all the lists to find out which list has the required url
a simple function that does what i need update 2012-08-01 no need to loop through list collection there is a getlist method in spweb object

2008353
punctuation	words
a valid name in javascript must start with a unicode letter dollar sign or underscore then can contain any of those characters as well as numbers combining diacritical accent characters and various joiner punctuation and zero-width spaces
additionally it cannot be a words reserved by the javascript language abstract as boolean break byte case etc

2008613
client-side	server-side
you cannot access it from client-side code javascript
the repeater and the dataitem s are server-side control which is available from the code-behind of your pages controls

2009535
firefox	safari
update you can see your code working here if you visit the page in firefox 3.5
known bug this does not work in safari 4 but it has been fixed in the yet unreleased at the time of this writing 1.8 version of jquery ui

2010807
dictionary	map
however you can iterate over the dictionary noting which keys map to the desired value obviously this is not efficient for large dictionary though
yes the dictionary is basically a one way street

2010813
dictionary	map
dictionary do not work like this nor are they intended to
how would you resolve the following you could do this but if you really need to go back and forth between keys and values you should consider encapsulating the problem into a two-way map

2012554
multiplying	multiplication
execution time is not used to multiplying those values
instead multiplication is done at compile time
