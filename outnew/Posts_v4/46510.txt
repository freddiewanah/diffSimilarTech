build.gradle	gradlew
multiproject subprojects vs allprojects the first issue is that the defaulttasks is defined in the main build.gradle but your java plugin is only included in subprojects
in a multi-project build the master project is not part of the subprojects section only allprojects affects the master project but your defaulttasks is defined at the top level so running gradlew will invoke the defaulttasks in the master project and fail on the classes task because it doesn t load the java plugin

42005025
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
for example we already have some bugs that only appear on centos 6 but not on 7 nor ubuntu so we want to make sure we stabilise things before moving ahead
feel free to submit a feature request to support linux mint

42005163
stateless	stateful
but one of the important things to notice is while container components tend to be stateful and presentational components tend to be stateless this is not a hard rule
presentational components can be stateful and containers can be stateless too. like in your case your logic s example depends only with internal logic of the component so in my opinion it would be better to keep inside the card component

42009026
prepare	execute
however if you are using data got from the user it is not safe to assume thay are not attempting a sql injection attack so you should use prepare and parameterised queries like this i think you shoud start by reading the php manual for the mysqli extension
text values have to be wrapped in quotes in a query you also look like you were trying to execute that same query twice here this is not legal usage

42009416
calloc	malloc
you can do that by allocating them with calloc in the first place or you could just set them to zero in the same loop nest where you set the initial x and y values
when you allocate memory with malloc the space you get is not automatically initialized

42011751
swift	objective-c
in swift 3 you should not use the ns -prefixed types when there is a native swift type available
for example instead of nsurl use url and instead of objective-c s nsstring use string

42012232
profiling	debugging
the later ones are just flags controlling compiler s vector code generation they have nothing to do with advisor profiling capabilities so you may or may not use them
to give you deeper understanding there is an important feature in advisor which is called intel advisor survey compiler integration . this feature leverages the data relatively similar but not identical to opt-report. in order to make this feature working you need using intel coimpiler 14.x beta 15.x 16.x or 17.x -g enable debugging info and -o2 or higher enable some optimization optional for intel compiler 15.x only -qopt-report5 all other features in intel advisor work equally well regardless of compiler version item 1 above or opt-report and versions item 3 above but they all still require -g part of option 2 above

42018821
prng	random
of course a good bit is dependent on the speed of the prng
gnu s rand is fast but not so random

42026883
division	modulo
the module operator returns the remainder of division between two operands
it seems like you want the average angle which would be your function if you do still want to apply modulo of 360 to this you should remove the surrounding and have this but by adding 360 you are returning the average of the angles since they in theory will not be greater than 360

42031995
decimal	ieee
for example .16e will give you output in exponential format with a total of 17 significant digits one preceding the decimal point
that will not require excessive space in memory or on disk and it will accurately convey all numbers regardless of scale supposing again that your double s are represented per ieee 754

42034388
strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc
now the gnu extensions provide a strdup function that both allocates and copies but understand that is not part of the c99 standard so you can run into portability issues
well you allocate with malloc calloc or realloc and then you validate that your call to those functions succeeded before proceeding or you have just entered the realm of undefined behavior by writing to areas of memory that are not in fact allocated for your use

42041879
single-quotes	double-quotes
in contrast with that when you set the value within the double-quotes is stored as-is after variable expansion and the embedded single-quotes are taken literally
and then when you pass to find the value is taken as it was stored it is not reinterpreted so the literal single-quotes in the value remain literal single-quotes

42042251
client-side	server-side
just because you re testing a client-side piece of code not some parts of server-side logic
having it isolated from whatever server-side is - is a great idea that you would love when your project become grow while more and more endpoints will be appearing

42042390
scala	typesafe
as much as scala is a functional language it also a language that promotes type-safety
in an ideal world a truly fully typesafe language will not have runtime exceptions like nullpointerexception and option plays a important role in scala to avoid it

42042923
dictionary	map
i couldn t figure out how to fix that error nor have i succeeded achieving the desired result with an extension or a map but i have an alternative solution to the problem using a function declaring dictionary function usage testing assuming that we have the date 2017-02-04 16 42 46 +0000 the output is 1486226566.2349629 which is correct
as losiowaty pointed in his excellent answer map always returns an array in this case an array of tuples

42044733
build.gradle	gradlew
this creates a wrapper without requiring a dedicated task to be added to build.gradle
with this option ignore do not check in these files folders for version control . gradlew gradlew gradlew.bat the key benefit is that you don t have to check-in a downloaded file to source control

42047448
division	multiplication
in fact gcc has a flag to control this behaviour -fcx-limited-range when enabled this option states that a range reduction step is not needed when performing complex division
also there is no checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is nan + i nan with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case

42048340
firefox	safari
reason invalid token multipart form-data in cors header access-control-allow-headers the above error means firefox does not treat multipart form-data as a valid entry in access-control-allow-headers http response header
however chrome safari seem cool about it

42049739
implements	extends
do note that you re reinventing the wheel a generic binary search is already implements in collections.binarysearch
extends t will be ideal make the type of the element to search for t add a comparator parameter and use it to replace the comparisons on book getid like this when you use this function to find a book in a list by id you can write the comparator parameter as comparator.comparing book getid . needless to say the list parameter must be sorted by book ids already otherwise binary search won t make sense. lastly as nic pointed out in a comment your implementation has a very undesirable behavior when an element is not found it returns 0

42050381
swift	objective-c
writing your own efficient fft is not easy but the accelerate framework s vdsp routines provide a straight-forward way to do it if you are using objective-c - not so straightforward in swift due to the use of unsafepointer and unsafemutablepointer parameters
here s a simple swift example of using the fft

42052106
noexcept	throw
yes of course the allocators would always be equal but the code doesn t know that and would still have to perform the check and thus you cannot offer a noexcept guarantee
with pocma true you can statically know that you will steal resources and thus won t throw

42053628
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
dr my current setup which is very similar to many other apps uses uitabbarcontroller as the top most controller with uinavigationcontroller stack for each tab
uinavigationcontroller takes care of the status bar style as it should and do not call preferredstatusbarstyle on its child view controllers

42055758
apache	nginx
i have read that you need apache to run wordpress but this is false
nginx does not use .htaccess

42055758
apache	nginx
to be clear i did not install apache at all
all pages static and dynamic are served by nginx

42055969
backtracking	greedy
an atomic group forbids backtracking
since is by default greedy it takes c then b then a in other words it takes abc but because of the atomic group will not give a character back the a and the pattern will fail

42056596
direct3d	directx
keep in mind that many of the direct3d 11 learning resources were written prior to the deprecation of the legacy directx sdk so they tend to focus on deprecated support code like d3dx11
i d recommend starting with the directx tool kit for directx 11 tutorials and once you work through those you can go back to resources like the rastertek.com tutorials knowing what s deprecated and what s not

42056995
inline	inlining
as other devs mentioned email clients do not load external css so you have to inline it
inlining css manually is poor decision

42057455
mvp	presenter
mvp is a pattern not an arquitecture itself the model in mvp is the view model meaning it should represent the data you dislay in the view domain model is all the data that represents your application entities in simple cases you will probably use the same domain model in the view but it s a good idea to separate both keep your app logic in domain model mvp will consume the data from domain model and add or transform presentation model for the view
for example if you have a users.geactiveusers in a presenter you can get the list of active users and also have additional information in the model like selecteduser that doesn t belong to the domain model

42059072
virtualenv	conda
conda has it s own virtualenv set up process but if you have the conda distribution of python and still wish to use virtualenv here s how find the other python distribution on your machine take note of the availble python versioning that is not conda and run the code below note for python 3 and above you have to upgrade virtualenv first virtualenv -p python2.7 or your python versioning flaskapp
in case anyone in the future runs into this problem - this is caused by your default python distribution being conda

42061000
getchar	getline
you just do something like alternatively you could try filling up an array with getchar in some loop dynamically reallocating memory as you reach the end of the array using malloc for example
the c standard doesn t have such a function but getline which is posix does what you want

42063482
google-chrome	firefox
the good news is you can rely on for google-chrome and ie
ironically firefox is unreliable for the latter but it shouldn t matter since it is reliable for event.persisted

42065648
super	self
so if you want to support a class hierarchy in which __getattr__ may chain to the __getattr__ method of another class you would need to call super .__getattr__ name if super.__getattribute__ failed
python language refererence about __getattr__ object.__getattr__ self name called when an attribute lookup has not found the attribute in the usual places it is not an instance attribute nor is it found in the class tree for self

42068526
required	placeholder
update related to your comment here you have an addition that removes address text label from address1 field and set it to address2 field making also that field optionally required and changing a little bit the placeholder i have also another solution see below after the code
here is the code instead of toggling that 2 fields you could invert the fields placeholder and add make optionally required the field address2 so you will not need to reorder the fields

42071352
bash	zsh
if you want more control over the order in which they are added for example if you want to prepend you can use the following style note that the expansion of an array parameter includes all the elements not just the first as in bash .
zsh has a few features that make it much easier to update your path

42072036
dictionary	map
there are many ways around this but they might go from the complicated use of type libraries which moreover are not available on all platforms to the relatively simple solution i suggest below which uses a dictionary to track the mappings between the names of the constants and their values
by the way in this method you are not obliged to map the same names as of the variables

42075778
nfa	dfa
if it is a dfa or posix nfa engine then you are always going to match the longest left-most possible pattern
you can determine if your engine works this way by trying to match nfa|nfa not against the string nfa not

42078787
dictionary	map
you can make the whole thing a nested list comprehension too now if you wanted to produce a dictionary you ll have to filter out any entry that is not a key-value pair dictionary p.strip for p in s.split for s in l if in s
you can strip each element after splitting demo i used a list comprehension rather than a map call there

42079414
g++	gcc
so branch coverage works but with a lot of clutter. ironically exceptions in c++ profiled using g++ gcov appear to suffer the same clutter problem
not quite an answer but i can report that ghdl built with the gcc backend reports 100 coverage for this example

42080064
mvp	presenter
to be honest i wouldn t be too obsessed with being one or the other mvc mvvm or mvp they re pretty much the same and the point is to get keep that big split
that said right now imho you seem to be closest to mvp model view presenter the problem is that you have a lot of intermingled logic there ipage should really just be a view but you have it doing things that a controller typically would

42083763
bower	npm
through ember-browserify npm install ember-browserify --save-dev npm install moment --save-dev you can import it by import moment from npm moment try ember-cli-moment-shim ember packages are not served through bower
it does not mean you can t use bower at all

42088836
multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtraction	division	subtraction	division	addition
currently dynamodb doesn t support - multiplying or - division arithmetic operators in updateexpression
it supports only addition + and subtraction - operators

42088981
noexcept	throw
it must use the move operations even though they re not noexcept
if you make the types copyable you should see a difference with moveexceptvector being much slower because now vector has a choice between doing moves that could throw or copying so it chooses copying

42089011
daemons	systemd
original answer i think you could use cgroups to achieve what you want. you could create a new cgroup on your host machine which allows access to dev isgx and start your docker daemons with . you could also set the cgroup-parent option in your etc docker daemon.json
if you have never worked with cgroups before then it might not be trivial to setup though. how to create a new cgroup depends on your host systemd but you must use the devices controller to whitelist specific devices for a cgroup

42089550
postgresql	mysql
however in reality your application will handle this data in at least 5 forms a postgresql bytea column a variable in your server-side application probably a string or byte-array a stream of data in the api that links your server to your client possibly encoded in some ascii-safe form such as base64 a variable in your client-side mobile application an sqlite blob column the data will flow through each of these forms in turn so the conversions you need to worry about are not postgresql to sqlite but postgresql to from server-side language server-side language to from api encoding and so on
you shouldn t need to make any changes to your mobile app if you change your server to use mysql or store the data in separate files or find a way of creating it on the fly

42089585
des	rsa
you are trying to encrypt using the insecure des algorithm with an rsa public key
that s always going to fail descryptoserviceprovider doesn t accept rsa keys

42090432
sudo	passwd
sudo allow you to grant privileges for specific command to specific user which is precisely enough check this post and you can choose to manage the privilege in a separated file other than the main sudoers file if you want just append #includedirs etc sudoers.d in the main etc sudoers file most linux distributions have already done that and make a file like ifconfig-user with another thing remember to edit the config file with visudo in case you lost control of your system when there is syntax error
do not try to write a system passwd plainly in a file especially for a user that have the sudo privilage just as jointeffort answered privilege issued should be solved by system administrators not by app writers

42091700
profiling	benchmarking
this may be related to the fact that the end of a function often appears in the profiling as taking a lot of time
in general the profiling is good for identifying inefficiencies in your code functions that are called too many times etc. but really isn t well-suited to actually benchmarking code since jit acceleration isn t enabled

42091700
profiling	benchmarking
in general the profiling is good for identifying inefficiencies in your code functions that are called too many times etc. but really isn t well-suited to actually benchmarking code since jit acceleration isn t enabled
for benchmarking it s best to use timeit or some other function

42097317
daemons	systemd
as recommneded by mbarthelemy this can be done via the -g option when starting the docker daemons directly
however if docker is being started as a systemd service it is not recommended to modify the etc default docker file

42102219
hash-collision	key
hash-collision will then be handled for you by the normal dict collision handling
in general you should not use hashes as dict key as doing so defeats collision resolution

42102713
innodb	myisam
but there are some major problems with this approach myisam doesn t support transactions so if you rollback changes in your innodb table they won t rollback in myisam
if you are using myisam for your primary table which you shouldn t don t use transactions for that table or your data is static this might be an option

42109353
multiplying	multiplication
the multiplying is clearly reversible it s the xor that s not
by combining the low and high part of the multiplication you lose information

42115719
profiling	debugging
to see what part consumes most of the processing power you should use a function profiling
it doesn t debugging but it creates a report when it s finished

42117387
shadowing	named
java introduces the concept of shadowing to disambiguate
some declarations may be shadowed in part of their scope by another declaration of the same named in which case a simple named cannot be used to refer to the declared entity

42117396
icmp	tcp
according to rfc 3022 icmp error packet modifications section in a napt setup if the ip message embedded within icmp happens to be a tcp udp or icmp query packet you will also need to modify the appropriate tu port number within the tcp udp header or the query identifier field in the icmp query header
second according to rfc 5508 if a nat device receives an icmp error packet from the private realm and the nat does not have an active mapping for the embedded payload the nat should silently drop the icmp error packet

42120326
g++	gcc
either g++ -c serialib.cpp g++ -c uart.cpp g++ serialib.o uart.o -o uart or all in one command g++ serialib.cpp uart.cpp -o uart you should read an introduction to gcc to understand the commands not just enter bogus commands without understanding them
g++ -c -wall -werror -fpic serialib.c to convert to pic which gives the following error the error is not an error it s a warning telling you that your distcc setup is broken but that it compiled locally

42121511
hive	hdfs
as mentioned in the comments data is moved to hive warehouse directory that s why there is no data in --target-dir
sqoop import to hive works in 2 steps fetching data from rdbms to hdfs create hive table if not exists and load data into hive table in your case firstly data is stored at --target-dir tmp yfr then it is loaded into hive table a using load data inpth .

42121734
sudo	passwd
bin bash echo notsecure | sudo -s apt-get update variable lets still type it explaining -s and -p - help read -r do not allow backslashes to escape any characters -s do not echo input coming from a terminal handy if you make a script that logs into multiple servers to view route -n for example
you re looking for sudo -s explaining -s - man sudo -s --stdin write the prompt to the standard error and read the passwd from the standard input instead of using the terminal device

fileinputstream	filewriter	fileoutputstream	filewriter
fileinputstream and fileoutputstream will work with any characters as they are not character but bytes to it
when you try and read a file as character using filereader and filewriter you have to take character encoding in consideration

42130042
freebsd	linux
sys statistics linux uses procfs but freebsd unlike linux doesn t offers procfs on default
so to use the aforementioned script you have to mount procfs manually and - because there is no freebsd port - to install sys statistics linux manually

42131540
ubuntu	linux
update the error cannot execute binary file exec format error could come from a mismatch between the system architecture and the file -- ensure your ubuntu machine is a 64-bit version and compare the output of uname -a and file myapp according to this thread running a file inside the shared folder of the vm with windows host can cause trouble -- try to copy myapp outside the shared folder
on ubuntu and other linux systems just myapp will try to find myapp from the path environment variable

42133684
rpm	yum
you can check if you have the package by rpm -qi centos-release you will probably see package centos-release is not installed first find out the exact centos version that you have by executing as root cat etc redhat-release you will see something like this centos linux release 7.3.1611 core you can fetch the centos-release package from repo by wget now run reinstall centos-release package via rpm sudo rpm -uvh --replacepkgs centos-release-7-3.1611.el7.centos.2.5.x86_64.rpm as next you can try to install something with yum and you might get now you can try to reboot the machine or try to use the following command to rebuild the rpm db rpm --rebuilddb
before trying any of this have a backup of your machine you could damage your os more completely it seems that your yum variable releasever is somehow corrupt it usually is caused by missing centos-release package on the machine for some obscure reasons

vim	atom-editor
the implicit newline after each line does not count according to vim s implementation
with your second command the assertion effectively acts like the simpler atom-editor

42142015
udp	tcp
the fact that the udp messages are not being sent at the normal rate when you are trying to connect to a tcp socket suggests that you are using the same thread for both actions

multiplying	multiplication
interestingly thanks to fma the floats mx and my gives you the rounding error that was made when multiplying r and cos

they are tracking usage statistics and there are still a large number of google-chrome extensions and websites out there in the real world implementing the spec
i m not quite sure if you mean can i use sqlite websql in google-chrome or can i use sqlite websql in firefox so i ll answer both you cannot use websql in firefox

42146688
google-chrome	firefox
i m not quite sure if you mean can i use sqlite websql in google-chrome or can i use sqlite websql in firefox so i ll answer both you cannot use websql in firefox
you can definitely use websql in a google-chrome extension

spaces	linefeed
do not press enter in the end of terminal just once after all the many a s and after that one enter press ctrl - d your file-ending looks like this ...aaaalf then you add a cr to the end or just use unix2dos above and your file ending looks like this ...aaaacrlf now add character x to the end of it and the tail looks added 2 spaces around x for your reading pleasure ...aaaacr x linefeed what happens is that first all the a s get outputed then cr returns the carriage to the beginning of line current line line 2 on your terminal and then the x get outputed
maybe your file has a crfl carriage return - linefeed or r - n line ending where not appropriate for example a windows file in linux system or .

freemarker	velocity
i will follow jespers advice to use freemarker
in order to answer my question if someone cannot switch technologies but wants to move to springboot 1.5.x here as an easy solution properties need to be changed remove spring.velocity.properties add the properties created the bean one important drawback is with that solution you cannot change your property file name without changing it for the velocity engine as well

implements	extends
one limitation to understand in the current v1 version of custom elements being implements across browsers rather than the legacy v0 version which is definitely not going to be implements across browsers going forward a custom-element class can only extends htmlelement
so feeding customelements.define a class that extends htmlinputelement will fail

visibility is a factors not a determiner
the fact that turn isn t volatile doesn t mean that your code will break just that it might break

42182963
google-chrome	firefox
this behaviour is not an issue with google-chrome it s most likely on your side
the most likely scenario is that the text contains certain characters that google-chrome doesn t know how to print but still marks as worth printing and handles them by the default char box while firefox understands it as spacing or similar

42183380
quicksort	mergesort
that way quicksort can reach recursive base case more quicker than mergesort
when i experimented with both sorting algorithms by counting the number of recursive calls quicksort consistently has less recursive calls than mergesort. it is because quicksort has pivots and pivots are not included in the next recursive calls

google-chrome	firefox
no you can t use webrtc in google-chrome in iphone ipad because google-chrome and also firefox are only some cover over apple webview apple doesn t let to use custom web engine on their platform
sad is that it isn t clearly informed by google and mozilla because some people get confused and said yes google-chrome support webrtc so it should work on ios devices

i think this is not possible in swift because of the way it bridges to objective-c protocols
but this is a work around using objective-c associated objects to solve the unrecognized selector sent to instance.

42216734
ssl	https
in order to handle custom domains via https you ll need to set up google cloud load balancing register your ssl certificate with it and then configure it to be backed by a gcs bucket
the c.storage.googleapis.com dns redirect feature does not work for https addresses

42217167
serializable	deserialization
some types do not serializable deserialize correctly and in powershell workflow that is a problem because powershell workflow relies on object serializable deserialization that s how pswf is able to checkpoint suspend and resume -- it converts all objects to a string form when checkpointing suspending and restores back to full objects from those strings when resuming
it would appear get-azurermwebappslot s output object is one of those types that does not serializable deserialize correctly

42218814
stateless	stateful
stateless approach is fine
you do not need to go into stateful services with a single partition unless you want to leverage reliable collections for your services

42219474
punctuation	words
however now white space and punctuation is included with the words before it
this makes sense because you wouldn t want a new line to start with white space or punctuation

42221919
build.gradle	gradlew
if that proves problematic you can add the snippet below to your build.gradle to change this behavior we are aware that the default behavior is problematic when using classes like log or textutils and will evaluate possible solutions in future releases
it can help you unit testing on android studio not mocked error text from your link sorry i can t set this post as a comment note that when running tests from gradlew we will execute tests for every variant of your code see here

42225223
shadowing	named
the only time when a cast to a base-class is required and will result in the execution of a different method is when you have a case of shadowing
shadowing occurs when a derived class implements a method of the same named as a method in a base class 1 and explicitly this is not an override

42225385
ionic	angular
you tagged your project like an ionic2 project but he doesn t seen like a normal ionic2 app you don t have any ionic cordova dependecy in your package.json
i think you need install and add angular platform-browser in your package.json you can do this npm install angular platform-browser --save so at this moment angular2 has a final version youi don t need to use a beta version

42230524
dictionary	map
you could use a counter and use the element-wise minimum and | element-wise maximum on them by using functools.reduce in the repl note that the result is a dictionary and not a list containing a single dictionary but it is rather useless to put the result in a list
this works because we first use map to convert the list of dictionaries to a list of counter s

42230889
inline	inlining
when functions are not defined in a single translation unit the compiler can not optimize the function calls using inline expansion
however if enabled some linkers can perform inlining across translation units

42232061
interpolation	splines
as you can see in the graph below if i do not replicate the x1 and y1 vector i will obtain some discontinuity when i compute the interpolation result
you can reach a similar result by using a splines interpolation

42232921
hex	binary
those 10 bytes can happen for instance when writing year 1802 hex 0x70a as binary
solution use binary mode and note in text mode specifying a block size doesn t work since the size depends on the data

42234531
jacoco	eclemma
jacoco performs analysis of bytecode and unfortunately doesn t have yet filtering for the bytecode that compiler generates for assert
eclemma - is eclipse plugin based on java code coverage library called jacoco

42236399
keras	tensorflow
this is not something that is solved in keras as far as i know so you have to resort to backend-specific functionality
both theano and tensorflow have print nodes that are identity nodes they return the input node and have the side-effect of printing the input or some tensor of the input

42236834
client-side	server-side
another way would be server-side using if you want to access it client-side you can use document.referrer
note that the last two especially the client-side are not as dependable though you should generally be fine

42251412
serializable	deserialization
so the serializable class javadoc states if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

42252599
bower	jspm
found in root instance as you can see here in order to get that to work with the runtime-only build i would need to create a render function on the vue instance like so here s the updated fiddle and that is what vueify and vue-loader do when used with bower and webpack respectively therefore the template compiler is not needed
if you are using jspm you may want to take a look at systemjs-plugin-vue however it s no longer maintained so it may no longer work

42252993
google-chrome	firefox
note on browser support google-chrome 59 does not appear to support visibility collapse as of july 12th 2017
the code samples below with collapse fail in google-chrome they behave just like hidden but work in firefox and edge

42258720
octal	decimal
to particular details of dec - hex - binary - octal conversions and why how it works just refer to wikipedia or some tutorials
just one short advice the 3222 is not number 3222 it s the representation of number 3222 in base-10 decimal formatting which is commonly used by humans

42259174
build.gradle	gradlew
here s how you do it in app build.gradle this works because mresourceconfiguration is the backing field for resconfigs
unfortunately the android gradlew dsl does not currently expose a method to reset resconfigs so we re forced to access the field directly using the groovy syntax

42263601
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions can not be nested
so something like sum

42266976
aggregate-functions	sum
your observation is consistent with the documentation and what i have so far seen in any other rdbms i ve worked with if aggregate expressions are used any column identifiers that are not included as arguments of an aggregate-functions must be included after the addition group by
take for example the time field uzeit you can tell the system to aggregate in your case sum up all amounts for the same point in time by adding it to the group by clause or you can apply an aggregate-functions as well sum would not make any sense here but min might or you could omit the field altogether

42266976
aggregate-functions	sum
take for example the time field uzeit you can tell the system to aggregate in your case sum up all amounts for the same point in time by adding it to the group by clause or you can apply an aggregate-functions as well sum would not make any sense here but min might or you could omit the field altogether
you can not leave it dangling around without further specification - the field either needs to be part of the new key set created by group by or has to have an aggregate-functions applied to it so that the system knows what to do with multiple datasets that might occur in the group

42272785
bower	npm
in the documentation they claim the package should be installed through bower so you might need to give it a try that way
i think qcode-decoder is not an npm package

42274023
mp4	h.264
as xander s says the code above is designed to handle an mp4 file that has been segmented or fragmented in this way and not a non-fragmented mp4 video file
to build on xander s answer it is useful to look at the way the video is packaged and streamed camera camptures raw image - generally a large bitmap of pixels encoders encode each frame into a more efficient format for storage and transporting - example encoders are h.264 h.265 vp9 etc

42274333
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
you have to take into account the size of your struct which must be incremented before calling realloc btw another fatal mistake
since i got tricked by that i don t propose pre-incrementation but 2 lines notes you never have to cast the output of realloc malloc calloc reallocating at eah step is easy but not optimal

42277631
super	self
what you need is to call to super. super calls the next method in the mro so you will call a b. you don t need the base class
class mixina object def get_id self return a super mixina self .get_id class mixinb object def get_id self return b class instance mixina mixinb pass first the instance .get_id will call to a.get_id then the call to super will call the next method in the mro that is b update not like before the mixins are independent

42280408
dictionary	map
ideally you would use map to transform the input dictionary to the output dictionary by filtering each of its values user arrays
unfortunately dicationary.map returns an array of key value tuples not a new dictionary

42282888
punctuation	words
however since you seem to be concerned about poorly formatted strings you have to consider multiple whitespaces whitespaces at the beginning and the end as well as punctuation
if you do not want to use regular expressions as in ezsrac s answer here is an alternative that considers combinations of characters numbers and the underscore as words just like w does

42282964
union	distinct
by ignoring the original values you can remove those with distinct or with union instead of union all
you can also exclude any generated rows with null start or end times and any that overlap with other records - which could happen if two other activities were contiguous you can then union that with all the original table rows except the cash record ... union all select activity start_time end_time from table1 where activity not in shift cash order by start_time

42287853
persistent	transient
from the session class documentation persistent instances may be made transient by calling delete from the guide transient - an object is transient if it has just been instantiated using the new operator and it is not associated with a hibernate session
it has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned

42287853
persistent	transient
it has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned
transient instances will be destroyed by the garbage collector if the application does not hold a reference anymore

42290317
serializable	deserialization
assume it s as follows then you can either create a custom response deserializer or save some memory the json de serializable require some memory because they work with json trees and create a more low level type adapter then any of the options above can be used like this or the outputs are 23519033 asalas77 and 23519033 asalas77 asalas77 id 23519033 name asalas77 profileiconid 22 revisiondate 1487214366000 summonerlevel 30 respectively
you must have a wrapper class in order not to clash deserialization strategies

42290416
csv	tsv
so your csv file has not loaded and thus sales is not defined and has no properties by the time you are using your sales variable in your scales
the easiest solution to this is to place anything requiring the csv data in the callback function itself the entire csv will be loaded even if you are using only two columns for each of with d3.csv tsv json

42292640
build.gradle	gradlew
and then you just need to add a library information to you test projects build.gradle
the library jar which you have created does not contain any dependency information which the ide gradlew can then resolve to be able to compile run the test project

42293609
express	node.js
here s a very quick example of a node.js server using the express framework that would respond with the name in the way you suggest in the question note that twilio doesn t pass a name query parameter when it makes webhook requests
it uses the twilio node.js helper library to generate the xml on the fly you would need to host this somewhere that can run node.js applications

42298696
kerberos	ldap
but in ranger you work not with the actual kerberos principles but with the usernames which are obtained from auth_to_local configuration setting according to the mapping rules specified there
if you are running ldap sync it will pass all matching principles through the collection of rules in this configuration property and will create the end user account with names obtained after execution of these rules

42301321
required	placeholder
mt0 s solution can be simplified - this problem doesn t required the seesaw recursive query i mentioned in my comments to mt0
in the recursive query i start with the given data but i add three columns the sum of values for the current rows count of rows and the number 1 as a placeholder

42303040
realloc	malloc
from the c standard section 7.22.3.5 realloc 3 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

42304458
mvp	presenter
finally i decided to do something like this activities or fragments are out of scope they do not know anything about mvp but i am going to use an event bus like otto to send signals events so my classes which extends some kind of presenter know nothing about android context but they will have an mvpview interface with only onattachpresenter and ondetachpresenter
the class which extends service will have a presenter attribute and implements some mvpview interface with onsucess onerror onstart oncomplete or something like that and same events for otto onsucessevent onerrorevent onstartevent oncompleteevent

42304906
swift	objective-c
if you are managing core data in swift and not seeing changes propagated between your background saves and primary context you like me might be missing the autoreleasepool part pfffbt
objective-c

42305333
innodb	myisam
myisam does not follow acid as opposed to innodb which follows transactions to maintain integrity of the data
myisam supports concurrent inserts if a table has no free blocks in the middle of the data file you can insert new rows into it at the same time that other threads are reading from the table

42305743
persistent	transient
jpa spec 2.3.2 - explicit access type when access property is applied to an entity class mapped superclass or embeddable class mapping annotations may be placed on the properties of that class and the persistent provider runtime accesses persistent state via the properties defined by that class
all properties that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

42308258
implements	extends
if the api you want to enforce is a qore-language class api then you need to implements your abstract class in qore and not in c++
if you have a c++ virtual class hierarchy that should be extended in qore then you should use qpp to implements your qore class in c++ and then allow programmers to extends it naturally by subclassing your classes in qore

42309672
super	self
super calls the base class which is not what you need
what you need is to update the context of the current instance of the class which is self

42310440
implements	extends
the problem is that because couchbasecache implements some interfaces spring creates a jdk dynamic proxy and a limitation of jdk dynamic proxies is that they can only implements interfaces not extends classes
they extends java.lang.reflect.proxy. so the value that your cachemanager method sees returned from the maincouchbasecache method is not an instance of couchbasecache but rather an instance of some subclass of java.lang.reflect.proxy that implements the cache and couchbaseclientmanagement interfaces

42310818
dictionary	map
let s take our input in the format now let s map the info about total items and total price in a dictionary called items_by_count but wait
will throw a keyerror if count isn t already in the dictionary

42311892
build.gradle	gradlew
the issue was with the name of the debug build variant if you name your debug build variant anything but debug make sure to notify android s gradlew plugin by adding testbuildtype yourdebugbuildvariantname to your build.gradle script your app module s build.gradle not the project global in the section or rename your debug build variant to just debug
if you have multiple debug build variants you need to specify one of them on which you d like to run your tests like testbuildtype armdebug even with this explicit config gradlew occasionally seems to have issues with running instrumentation tests

42314149
viewdidload	viewdidappear
in viewdidload autolayout hasn t taken effect yet so your button bounds are not device specific
put in viewdidlayoutsubviews or viewdidappear make sure to add gradients or perform tasks related to uiview frame or bounds after viewdidlayoutsubviews has been called if you are using autolayout

42318364
recvfrom	datagram
they are not passed to a subsequent recvfrom
so the solution is to just pass in a buffer big enough for any udp datagram and then cast it to your data type

42318498
recvfrom	datagram
you can thus accomplish your goal by using msg_peek on the first recvfrom call but note that then you need to receive the entire datagram in the second recvfrom call not just the part that you did not read the first time
you cannot split receipt of one datagram over two recv recvfrom calls

42318498
recvfrom	datagram
you cannot split receipt of one datagram over two recv recvfrom calls
it is the fundamental nature of datagram-oriented sockets that sends and receives operate in units of datagram

42322349
profiling	instrumentation
read more at callgrind is not just a profiling it is binary recompiler used to implement exact profiling with instrumentation approach and it has 10-20 times overhead for any code even when profiling tool is not enabled
in linux perf statistical profiling tool has very low overhead 1-2 so you can profile entire application with perf record . your_application and then analyze generated profile perf.data with perf report command

42324537
exponent	modulo
it rounds down ensuring that your exponent remain entire numbers
this is essential for example when splitting your operands in high digits by floor dividing by 10 m2 and low digits by taking the residual modulo 10 m2 this would not work with a fractional m2

42324592
prepare	execute
your query will become then you will have to prepare it bind variables and execute as you can see it s just three simple commands prepare where you send a query with placeholders bind_param where you send a string with types s is for string and you can use it for any type actually and than actual variables
and execute this way you can always be sure that not a single sql syntax error can be caused by the data you added to the query

42327967
multiplying	multiplication
i guess you wanted to multiplying each vector in coords by the matrix in matrix
for this multiplymm is the completly wrong function since it does a matrix times matrix multiplication not matrix times vector

42333089
mp4	h.264
although browsers are not likely to drop their existing support license issues prevent developers to think browsers support for mp4 h.264 will continue forever
google has announced that it would remove h.264 support from chromium project in 2011 but chrome still supports it

42333205
dplyr	purrr
fist matches helpers from dplyr takes a regex string as argument not a vector
it is a good way for you to find a regex that matches all your columns. in the code under you can use the dplyr select helper that you wish then purrr functions works great with dplyr when you understand the underlying scheme of functionnal programming

42334357
ssl	https
this isn t a solution to your specific problem but i m putting it here because this thread is the top google result for ssl certificate_verify_failed and it lead me on a wild goose chase
if you have installed python 3.6 on osx and are getting the ssl certificate_verify_failed error when trying to connect to an https site it s probably because python 3.6 on osx has no certificates at all and can t validate any ssl connections

42334907
implements	extends
an alternative is to use list s in place of arrays which implements a proper tostring method
array classes are final you cannot extends them and override their methods

42336871
client-side	server-side
the extent of your client-side validation depends on your business goals
since you ve got your server-side validation completed the only technical advantage for client-side validation is saving http requests which may not matter depending on your traffic hosting etc

42336871
client-side	server-side
since you ve got your server-side validation completed the only technical advantage for client-side validation is saving http requests which may not matter depending on your traffic hosting etc
i d opt to start with no client-side validation and make sure the server-side errors show up correctly on submission failures

42339629
namenode	hdfs
hdfs dfsadmin -safemode enter namenode restart is not required to save namespace
yes the command usage to save the namespace is hdfs dfsadmin -savenamespace this command would save the namespace image from memory directly to disk which is faster than rolling and merging of edits with the fsimage stored in disk

42358126
primes	modulus
in particular for reasons i do not yet understand the period of all most non-divisor primes as far as i was able to test the only exception is 1 574 029 is less than the primes itself so it can be found rapidly
and since there are usually a lot of zeros in any sequence which contains a zero a divisor can also be found reasonably rapidly although it sometimes requires examining more than the first k values of the sequence modulo k it never comes close to k² . all of that means that between sieving known multiples of non-divisors and stopping the scan when a modulus is shown to be a divisor it is rare to do a large period scan

42361092
laravel	codeigniter
i am assuming this because if you were already familiar with laravel then this won t be your question
we would have asked why codeigniter doesn t have artisan command

42361796
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
hibernate when attempting to update the schema hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto update looks for a column named createddate as specified in the domain class does not find one because case-sensitive and so believes the column needs to be added and attempts to do that
the add operation fails because a column with an equivalent name according to postgresql case-insensitive exists

42365402
mathml	mathjax
the element is deprecated in mathml cf
the spec and mathjax s content mathml extension does not support it

42375670
build.gradle	gradlew
what went wrong a problem occurred configuring root project android . could not resolve all dependencies for configuration _debugapk . a problem occurred configuring project cordovalib . could not resolve all dependencies for configuration cordovalib classpath . could not find com.android.tools.build gradlew 2.2.3. searched in the following locations required by android cordovalib unspecified i read the above answers which pointed to update a build.gradle file but turns out there were multiple files with that name in the project
what worked for me and hopefully helpful to whoever is working on angular2 ionic2 project and having this issue is updating the build.gradle file at this file was missing the jcenter entry and now the repository part looks like this and works like a charm

42376040
swift	objective-c
in my case i had added swift files to a framework that was until then purely objective-c
the test bundle did not have any swift code in it

42376279
factors	matrix
so your transformation can be built like this translate by -points 0 .x -points 0 .y rotate by rotationangle scale by scaling factors translate by x1 y1 the order of rotation and scaling could be swapped it doesn t matter
see the article of transformation matrix for how to build each one

42380926
octal	binary
based on your output you have a 32-bit two s complement int type where -1 is represented as the binary 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 _ _ _ _ __ _ _ __ _ _ 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 with the bottom line showing the octal representation what you re seeing
and the reason why you re seeing a 3 at the front is because each octal digit represents three bits and 32 is not evenly divisible by three

42381159
inline	inlining
if you look at the call stack of anymatch in your benchmark you ll see something like that not all of these method calls can be inline
furthermore jvm limits inlining to 9 levels but here we see the deeper call stack

42381960
namedtuple	dictionary
edit since your dictionary s all follow the same format you could consider using a namedtuple as well
the main issue is that dictionary s are not hashable

42382214
mathml	mathjax
in particular it doesn t recognize openmath at all because some years ago i yanked all openmath-specific code from the checker at the request of somebody from the mathml working group
however that doesn t mean your code won t work correctly in mathjax

42383536
h.264	webm
from the apple docs ios supports many industry-standard video formats and compression standards including the following h.264 video up to 1.5 mbps 640 by 480 pixels 30 frames per second low-complexity version of the h.264 baseline profile with aac-lc audio up to 160 kbps 48 khz stereo audio in .m4v .mp4 and .mov file formats h.264 video up to 768 kbps 320 by 240 pixels 30 frames per second baseline profile up to level 1.3 with aac-lc audio up to 160 kbps 48 khz stereo audio in .m4v .mp4 and .mov file formats mpeg-4 video up to 2.5 mbps 640 by 480 pixels 30 frames per second simple profile with aac-lc audio up to 160 kbps 48 khz stereo audio in .m4v .mp4 and .mov file formats numerous audio formats including the ones listed in audio technologies
it doesn t support webm

42391288
prepare	execute
this is you example with prepare statements
s ave.php the reason i used prepare statements prepare statements reduces parsing time as the preparation on the query is done only once although the statement is execute multiple times bound parameters minimize bandwidth to the server as you need send only the parameters each time and not the whole query prepare statements are very useful against sql injections because parameter values which are transmitted later using a different protocol need not be correctly escaped

42397986
ionic	angular
since this is not an angular 2 but an ionic 2 question i will lead you how i did it
just install web-animations-js since this is ionic 2 we don t have polyfills.ts somewhere in the code

42398106
unixodbc	iodbc
if turbodbc is built with unixodbc it will use unixodbc s configuration of data sources
it will not use configurations configured for iodbc

42403012
swift	objective-c
the most comprehensive list of swift features not available from objective-c is in the swift type compatibility section of apple s using swift with cocoa and objective-c guide
quoting from there the list of exclusions are as follows generics tuples enumerations defined in swift without int raw value type structures defined in swift top-level functions defined in swift global variables defined in swift typealiases defined in swift swift-style variadics nested types curried functions the whole guide is worth reading but i d pay particular attention to the mix and match section which describes calling swift from objective-c and vise-versa including external frameworks

42406537
selenium	appium
looking through the selenium docs it looks like you have the arguments for find_elements reversed
to me it doesn t make any sense that appium is able to find the elements but when trying to use one it can t find it again

42417060
build.gradle	gradlew
dont forget classpath com.google.gms google-services 3.0.0 inside dependency of build.gradle project not in the main dependencies 4
apply plugin com.google.gms.google-services should be placed in the bottom of gradlew app

42418285
udp	tcp
what you could do is use a udp proxy but i m not familiar with anything like that
no the redis protocol resp is tcp based networking layer a client connects to a redis server creating a tcp connection to the port 6379

42421420
uiview	calayer
note this is all simplified and skips lots of things like calayer actually being the real view object that shows on screen not uiview etc.
each uiview can be thought of as a bitmap an image gpu texture

42421472
super	self
try this from documentation the call to super contactform self .clean in the example code ensures that any validation logic in parent classes is maintained
you are not calling clean method of super class while overriding

42422220
mongodb	bson
note tips for further understanding use lodash to check the same objectid stored in multiple collections npm i lodash --save in your file.js lodash _.isequal performs a deep comparison between two values to determine if they are equivalent use lodash and perform _.isequal for deep comparing suppose the id 58ae39c54473f9cfd4eb29b6 comes from two different mongodb documents collection users suppose this user is referenced to rooms collection collection rooms if you do a normal comparison or includes like this
the mongo _id is 12-byte bson type objectid so normal object.instructors.includes 58a5ac4f84230a2117d1d6cb means you are comparing a raw string to an objectid which is not a valid integer or string which will always return false

42425282
realloc	memmove
since s has been allocated by the system you can perform a realloc on it to shorten the size but you cannot free the start of an allocated zone without freeing the rest that you cannot
use memmove realloc to shift the data and reduce size afterwards

42426495
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this includes safari 10 google-chrome 55 including opera edge 13 on the desktop and ios 10 and google-chrome on mobile
this also includes firefox although not mentioned

42434364
jar	war
then you could create an uber jar from the compileonly configuration then you could copy the uber jar to tomcat_home lib
you could declare the dependencies in the compileonly configuration so that they are not packed inside the war

42436563
lisp	scheme
lisp then chooses to pun making the empty list and false be the same object scheme does not and treats them as distinct
additionally lisp provides a name for the empty list object while scheme does not and scheme also does not treat the empty list object as self-evaluating while lisp does

42436563
lisp	scheme
additionally lisp provides a name for the empty list object while scheme does not and scheme also does not treat the empty list object as self-evaluating while lisp does
both languages provide a canonical true object as well but again lisp provides a name for it while scheme doesn t

42444991
oncreate	setcontentview	setcontentview	findviewbyid
this doesn t mean anything because before oncreate it will be null because activity gets it s context which you are referring as this from application when oncreate get called so move your inside oncreate update you are initializing the songprogressbar reference from xml using findviewbyid so you don t need this part at all so do this update 2 use setcontentview r.layout.player
instead of setcontentview r.layout.activity_main

42451573
firefox	safari
unfortunately the x button to clear the search does not appear in firefox but as above a polyfill could be implemented for browsers that don t support this feature natively firefox
super-simple html 5 solution source html 5 tutorial - input type search that works in at least chrome 8 edge 14 ie 10 and safari 5 and does not require bootstrap or any other library

google-chrome	firefox
super-simple html 5 solution source html 5 tutorial - input type search that works in at least google-chrome 8 edge 14 ie 10 and safari 5 and does not require bootstrap or any other library
unfortunately it seems firefox does not support the search clear button yet. after typing in the search box an x will appear which can be clicked to clear the text

42451573
google-chrome	safari
after the bootstrap css has been loaded you can restore the search cancel button with the css used in the following example source html 5 search input does not work with bootstrap i have tested that this solution works in the latest versions of google-chrome edge and internet explorer
i am not able to test in safari

42452537
monkeyrunner	androidviewclient
as you may have discovered already this is because monkeyrunner is not running the setupclass method
you can use androidviewclient culebra as a drop-in replacement for monkeyrunner with the advantage that it runs with python 2.x so your tests will be correctly initialized

42454449
realloc	strcpy
yes you are overwriting the returned address of malloc memory leak free if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc posix_memalign realloc or strdup function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
change to strcpy s hello world

42456935
ssl	https
you can use the following script caveat some browsers do not support this without ssl
as of chrome 50 the geolocation api will only work on secure contexts such as https

42457460
entity-relationship	diagram
i recommend using chen s notation for entity-relationship diagram
that doesn t mean i m against table diagram - they re just used for different purposes

42460943
implements	extends
ideally you would implements your own caching mechanism to avoid repeatedly downloading the same image but this should get you started
here s an example of how to extends mtktextureloader to load remote urls which are not supported by the default implementation

42463521
keras	cudnn	tensorflow	cudnn
it seems like that keras over tensorflow when running on a gpu tends to produce results that are not reproducible when transfered to a non-gpu machine
this most likely has something to do with the cudnn installed

42468789
serializable	deserialization
however in normal cases where you would provide the value to a static variable at the main class run-time would not be serializable
you can try to access the serialversionuid by making it public and try to access it after deserialization

42470438
ionic	angular
ionic v2 supports android 4.4 and up
the older browser on pre-4.4 devices do not have the features needed for ionic2 and angular 2 to work

42473558
direct3d	direct2d
you need to create direct3d resources with the direct3d apis and not try to create them directly with dxgi but you can use queryinterface in places to get a dxgi surface for doing certain operations like inter-api surface sharing
with direct3d 11.1 or later most of the device sharing behavior has been automated so you don t have to deal with dxgi to use direct2d directwrite with direct3d 11

42475281
oncreate	setcontentview
these must be the first two lines of oncreate
setcontentview creates the view objects so you cannot access any of them until after you call this method

42480620
implements	extends
however so does blockjunit4classrunner therefore we implements it as below and used the code from xtextrunner and put it into the new runner -- it is necessary to extract injectorproviders from xtext as well creating a test
by looking at the xtextrunner class it inherits from blockjunit4classrunner. parameterized does not extends this runner but parentrunner

42480622
jar	war
you are creating a jar file which isn t a war file
however you have put the files in the location as it was a war file

42486489
virtualenv	conda
if you not you could run source activate tensorflow and then install jupyter in your virtualenv by conda install jupyter
you can use pip too. partion 2 1.from within your virtualenv run this will create a kernelspec for your virtualenv and tell you where it is where pythonx will match the version of python in your virtualenv

42486772
mp4	webm
you may convert into mp4 file optimized for streaming so that tables are at the beginning. mpeg ts transport stream also is loaded quickly
probably webm will load faster than standard mp4 but i am not so familiar with webm format

42486772
mp4	h.264
probably webm will load faster than standard mp4 but i am not so familiar with webm format
all pcs and smartphones have hardware based avc h.264 video decoder

42489551
matlab	simulink
see simulink matlab standalone executable unable to get output for more info
the sim function is not supported by matlab compiler

42491787
libstdc++	libc++
by switching the compile to libstdc++ it no longer removes characters from the names
however i m not sure how to fix this problem whilst still using libc++

42493893
clang	llvm
apple clang annoyingly apple s versioning doesn t correspond with that of the llvm projects
that said the current release clang-800.0.42.1 is based on llvm 3.9.0

42494098
daemons	systemd
note that after you change dns settings on the windows host to get name resolution working you ll likely need to restart the docker daemons to get the embedded vm to restart with these changes
docker does the push on the remote docker daemons not the local docker client which means the dns resolution needs to work on that systemd

42495149
ecj	javac
interestingly the eclipse compiler for java ecj does not include this null check and running nullcheck as compiled by ecj will not throw a n npe.
while i agree with the general consensus of preferring to avoid the getclass hack it is worth noting that as of openjdk version 1.8.0_121 javac will use the getclass hack to insert null checks prior to creating lambda expressions

42495449
bash	subshell
assuming your shell is really bash not bin sh you can build an arrays and use a c-style for-loop which unlike the nonstandard external command seq is guaranteed to be available everywhere bash is if you need compatibility with bin sh it gets a little bit more verbose note set -- modifies the current process s or in this case the current function s argument list using that as an arrays we can dynamically modify
tee_between instead of means that the function runs in a subshell -- a completely separate forked-off process

42506478
keras	tensorflow
so what i advise is the following a little bit cumbersome - but working for me approach do not load keras to your main environment
if you want to load keras theano tensorflow do it only in the function environment

42510301
ciimage	uiimage
creating a ciimage from uiimage may require extra time to copy the image data from memory to gpu memory
try loading your image into a gpu texture and then creating a ciimage backed by this texture using ciimage texture size flipped colorspace make sure you re only creating the texture once not at the start of every draw _

42513971
swift	objective-c
extra for experts during the run-up to swift 3 .normal was abolished and or uicontrolstate were the only ways to specify the zero option
this was because of a rule that said that the zero option of an objective-c option set was not imported into swift by name at all

42516789
super	implements
let the super class layout the view for you
either remove onmeasure and onlayout methods from carsgridviewitem or implements them correctly because you do not override them correctly now

42520757
addition	modulo
in this program it automatically converted into -10 it does not convert to -10 it converts to a large positive number that behaves like -10 when you perform an addition
c standard says a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type a consequence of this behavior is that when you add 10 to - 10u the result is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type so it gets truncated to zero

42527908
uialertview	uialertcontroller
once i had a problem since uialertview was deprecated and old application had new bug where uialertview was not respecting application orientation
i had to do a tricky code which detected if uialertcontroller i prefer this approach instead detecting ios version is available than use it and if not than fallback to uialertview was used

42528647
udp	tcp
udp is not reliable
tcp is but udp is faster

42530890
implements	extends
there isn t either an sdk provided by microsoft or a sample available that implements these ucwa important concepts
extends this example for implementing messaging should be possible but you ll also have to make sure the concepts i explained before are implemented correctly that for what i know they aren t in that example for your case being on-premises is probably more appropriate to look at ucma which despite is much heavier in requirements and infrastructure

42530890
ucma	ucwa
this example uses ucma 4.0 and should be part of the sdk samples of ucma creating a lync bot edit trying to add more information or pointers to some topics as per comment s request impersonation bot you need to have a registered and active endpoint to receive and send instant messages
if you choose for ucwa this must be a user endpoint so you need to create a dedicated user chatbot contoso.com in skype for business and use its credentials to instantiate a ucwa app web users you aren t detailing your scenario fully so there can be different solutions

42531313
multiplying	multiplication
even if equal you will get the same error when you multiplying it element-wise with a since a is not a column vector
element-wise multiplication requires the order of both matrices to be same because only that s when each element of a matrix can be multiplied with the corresponding element in the other matrix

42537948
email	dkim	dns	spf
disclaimer i m not a pro at these things more later imho this is probably the simplest explanation of dkim spf in my own words providing a dns txt record that identifies where all your email smtp mta servers can come from
the more complete formal spec is here you can implement both opinionated spf is easier to implement identify all the origins of your email set them in your spf record which is a txt record in dns dkim is more complex - your mail smtp server s must implement it

42539514
debian	linux
you can check what s provided by typing the function does exist on my debian linux box but it is absent on windows and osx as well
i don t know why it s not there on your linux box

42540457
clang	llvm
as of 2017 with the llvm 3.9.1 build for windows you need the following to be able to invoke clang from your shell
vc++ build tools we still do not have a libc++ port for windows so clang uses the vc++ libraries as well as the vc++ linker

42540751
prepare	execute
also as u_mulder points out you only need to prepare your query once as it doesn t change through each iteration of that loop
you can always execute with an array that usually minimizes your code and it also allows you to accumulate data through if clauses as you build up a query without having to complicate your code

42543665
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

42543665
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

42543665
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

42544619
swift	objective-c
swift s cfdictionary isn t itself a data structure
it s a pointer to a data structure and it is equivalent to objective-c s cfdictionaryref

42546509
centos	linux
in the scenario described in your question you are running four machines with four separate network stacks a physical machine windows a centos vm supposedly running under virtualbox orchestrated by vagrant a docker linux machine which is running in the background when you install docker for windows judging from your sentence the docker command from windows cmd an ansible container running under the docker s linux machine each of these machines has its own loopback address 127.0.0.1 which is not accessible from any other machine
you have one port mapping vagrant set a mapping for tnt centos virtual machine under the control of virtualbox so that the vm s port 22 is accessible on the windows machine loopback address 127.0.0.1 port 2222

42547398
setinterval	settimeout
note i ve used setinterval for the browser example in the snippet but setinterval specifically may not be a good choice for a similar experiment using nodejs as nodejs s setinterval is a bit different from the one in browsers and has some surprising timing characteristics
two things that will run sooner than that settimeout process.nexttick callbacks nodejs-specific the process.nexttick method adds the callback to the next tick queue

42547444
fgets	getline
you can just read each line with fgets 3 until it returns null which indicates a line was not read
you could also use getline 3 to do this which is a posix c function designed for reading lines efficiently

42548148
trie	tree
the simplest model of a trie is a tree where each node holds a letter and a flag to tell whether the current letter is the end of a word and additionally pointers to other data about the word
example picture of a trie containing the dictionary aback abate bid bird birth black blast to search for a word start from the root and for each letter of your word follow the node containing the current letter halt if it isn t present as a child of the current node

42548286
punctuation	words
it can only be used to search for whole worlds and so it won t work for subpart of words from mongodb text index documentation text will tokenize the search string using whitespace and most punctuation as delimiters and perform a logical or of all such tokens in the search string
a solution is to use the operator introcuced in mongodb 3.4 this operator return the index of the occurence of a string in an other string and -1 if there is no occurence how it works filter out all documents not containing car with a regex car gi case inensitive create a field named index which stores the index of car in itemname sort documents on the index field the query would looks like this and this returns try it online mongoplayground.net p fqqcuqi3d-e edit for the behavior of the index this is completely normal a text index tokenize text using delimiters default delimiters are white space and punctuation

42550016
backtracking	greedy
+foo xfooxxxxxxfo o similar of greedy case we have reached to the end of the string but possessive case can still match it thus will not pass the torch to the backtracking structure and will cause a matching failure
the main difference between lazy reluctant greedy case is that the behaviour of the backtracking structure and the possessive is just way too aggressive

42550016
backtracking	greedy
greedy case is the opposite will continue its matching until it fails never passes the focus to the next operator only when the matching fails the backtracking goes into effect and the next operators will be matched from reverse
foo xfooxxxxxxfo o when the greedy case is at this point last char the matching will fail since we couldn t match the foo part of the regex

42552827
ubuntu	linux
i think it means that your graphic card driver is still on your windows system so you have to tell your ubuntu image to access the drive on your windows
you can access to your windows system in the following directory mnt c however not all linux apps or tools can access a file using mnt. a solution is to create a symbolic link

42554361
icmp	tcp
technically it is not possible in any case to use icmp as data transfer protocol unless you change structure and all coding of icmp and then it will no longer be icmp
if you study about tcp ip layers you will find that icmp is a internet layer protocol and its purpose is to the internet control message protocol icmp is a supporting protocol in the internet protocol suite

42556440
octal	hex
a3 hex number parsed to octal number equals 243 what means that 243 as three octal digit metacharacter also matches
the problem with is that it s unicode is 20ac what means that it can be used as u20ac four hexadecimal digits metacharacter but it cannot be shortened to two hex digits while it does not begin with 00

42560808
floating-point	fractions
for base-radix types it is the value of digits digits-1 for floating-point types multiplied by log 10 radix and rounded down
and later the standard 32-bit ieee 754 floating-point type has a 24 bit fractions part 23 bits written one implied which may suggest that it can represent 7 digit decimals 24 std log10 2 is 7.22 but relative rounding errors are non-uniform and some floating-point values with 7 decimal digits do not survive conversion to 32-bit float and back the smallest positive example is 8.589973e9 which becomes 8.589974e9 after the roundtrip

42564923
atoi	atof
first off atoi isn t the same as move
you d also need atol and atof to handle all the situations move can

42565047
trie	tree
your looking for a persistent hash map also called hash array mapped trie
one should note that a tree is not the same thing as a trie data structure

42566602
swift	objective-c
it s not swift and it s not a struct
it s an objective-c class

42568088
monkeyrunner	androidviewclient
iirc monkeyrunner does not honor pythonpath
alternatively you can use androidviewclient culebra as a replacement and you will be able to do from python

42569816
ssl	https
see amazon cloudfront custom ssl
you would need a cname record in namecheap for your domain eg images.example.com that points to the cloudfront distribution name eg d3in9v4naaabbb.cloudfront.net an alternate domain names cnames entry in your cloudfront distribution you can do this via the cloudfront console see using alternate domain names cnames please note that this will not work for https by default

42570458
queue	fifo
for the queue this is not safe - you can get a concurrentmodificationexception 0
fifo size 2 1

42571771
coalesce	isnull
select coalesce var1 var2 as result
use coalesce function not sure about why isnull returning output like this but assuming that while checking isnull p1 p2 it will consider size of first parameter only

42574593
prepare	execute
first of all try to change your statement to prepare statement otherwise you are not protected from sql injection
second try to execute the function and look if it is supported by your sql database

42576422
phpstorm	webstorm
debug breakpoints not work in my phpstorm 2016.3.2 with nodejs 7.7.x
my expectation is that webstorm will have same issue

42576949
verilog	vhdl
these were strict in verilog but have been relaxed in system-verilog to such an extent that if you are not designing using tri-state logic you don t need nets in system-verilog
vhdl has exactly the same distinction

42582099
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
generally not something you see buried behind the scenes ...it is not limited to floating point you will see similar library calls for addition subtraction multiplication division as well as float for operations that the c language supports that the target doesnt necessarily directly support
adding two 64 bit integers on a 32 bit processor integer division on a processor with no hardware division signed multiplication on a processor that only supports unsigned multiplication etc

42586895
draggable	droppable
when draggable is used in conjunction with droppable you can then append the dropped item to an element
draggable simply adjusts it s position but does not change it s place in the dom

42588266
spaces	delimiter
however as ole tange rightly pointed out in the comments it still suffers from not properly handling directory names with spaces or other shell metacharacters in them
this is precisely the problem that xargs -0 was intended solve but bash provides no convenient way to display the directory stack using null as a delimiter

42591324
division	exponent
division is normally a very slow affair
however a division by a power of two is just an exponent shift and the mantissa usually doesn t need to change

42591950
aggregate-functions	sum
you are nesting aggregate-functions which is not allowed in mysql
you don t actually need the sum function for count distinct phone_nos for different conditions

42593657
clang	llvm
clang with microsoft codegen is using clang to parse the source into an ast
but then msvc s code generator kicks in so anything related to llvm is not used

42594985
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
nsurlsession is newer than nsurlconnection if you are using swift language then you can use your own custom methods by using nsurlsession or you can use alamofire
the nsurlconnection used in afnetworking frameworks if you are using objective - c then you can use it that means not that you cannot use nsurlsession

42594985
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
the nsurlconnection used in afnetworking frameworks if you are using objective - c then you can use it that means not that you cannot use nsurlsession
nsurlsession launch after ios 7.0 or 8.0

42595128
ethernet	wireless
in the best case winpcap is able to see an ethernet emulation and not the real transiting packets this means that the 802.11 frames are transformed into fake ethernet frames before being captured and that control frames are not received
for real wireless capture cace technologies offers the airpcap adapter specifically designed to sniff 802.11 traffic including control frames management frames and power information

42598100
hex	binary
hex which encodes binary using just 16 characters is a little easier to read
not easily because the actual values are binary which is why they re base64-encoded in the first place

42599538
queue	fifo
with this solution each queue run async respect others queue but two jobs on the same queue are not async they respect fifo precedence
push jobs on different queue queue1 queue2 etc

42600132
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
multiplying anything by millis will always create a scaling effect -- which in this case will always create what you call scrubbing. for example if you change the multiplier 10 seconds suddenly becomes 15
instead in order to change the speed at which the clock changes in the future but not to change how far it has advanced up-to-now keep your own clock variable separate from millis and change the step amount use addition not multiplication each draw frame

42600602
strdup	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
if you write your own strdup don t do this but rather bzero is redundant because it will zero out exactly the bytes that strcpy will overwrite with non-zero values at the next line
the strncpy + strlen combo is plain wrong as it doesn t null-terminate the destination string

42602946
serializable	deserialization
if for whatever reason you cannot change these types you can create a custom contractresolver that automatically ignores all delegate type properties now serializable with the following settings the valuechanged property will no longer be serializable or deserialized
json.net does not serializable events so the public event propertychangedeventhandler propertychanged in the propertychangedbase base type of the houseplan repository should not cause problems during deserialization

42603178
implements	extends
in order to implements our own jdbcclientdetailsservice let s look at the signature of the default method public class jdbcclientdetailsservice extends object implements clientdetailsservice clientregistrationservice as you can see the above class implements interfaces
while implementing our own jdbcclientdetailsservice i do not recommend extends the default jdbcclientdetailsservice because there are quite a few private class variables and methods which will not be inherited hence let s use the default implementation to write our own

42605116
memcmp	strcmp
when you does s single step or si step single instruction what you see for string and memory functions like strcmp memcpy memcmp strlen etc is correct and gdb does recognize your c library ubuntu 16.04.2 amd64 started from iso in vm already has libc6-dbg debugging package preinstalled for your libc - c library
strcmp_sse2_unaligned at .. sysdeps x86_64 multiarch strcmp-sse2-unaligned.s 24 24 .. sysdeps x86_64 multiarch strcmp-sse2-unaligned.s no such file or directory. strlen at .. sysdeps x86_64 strlen.s 66 66 .. sysdeps x86_64 strlen.s no such file or directory. what we see here is that gdb was able to find debugging information for both functions strcmp and strlen to get line numbers but these functions of standard c library are not c functions

42613510
comparator	comparable
i ve taken out only relevant implementation of put method which is related for using comparable comparator method as i am not java expert i would be happy to see any comment on my update to make sure that information is correct
this.getname means getting name of its own object c.getname means getting name of object c comparator method used for comparing itself to other object passed comparable interface provides method declaration to comparing its own object to other object passed in its comparator method

42615873
ionic	angular
first build an angular 2 app then fork it and build a ionic 2 mobile app from it
you will have to do some modifications to make it fit to ionic 2 but it will not be too bad

42616500
rpm	yum
the other is that in both cases you are using a shell command which globs matches via wildcard the actual rpm filename
but yum expects its argument to be a package not a filename

42618200
move	drag
if the position is greater than the ground line then move the point away from the ground
the point may also be fixed not needing the above movement drag and gravity applied or fixed to a moving object like the mouse

42620032
client-side	server-side
client-side javascript is run by the user s browser
it isn t interpreted server-side like php is

42627484
swift	objective-c
just add -swift.h after the name of your class to import it just as i did in the .m example above. last but not least update your swift class with objective-c annotations at class and method declaration lines i hope this helped
after reading this so post i suddenly remembered that a swift project could embed some objective c classes. the solution to my problem was ridiculously easy to set up once i realized that eventhough i ve never had to do it before

42629185
cpython	ironpython
python isn t just for numerical computation but if that is what you re after i recommend either looking for similar libraries written in .net or sticking with cpython or maybe pypy
ironpython can work with third-party libraries

42633798
wildfly	jboss
assuming you are using the default version of hibernate orm and hibernate search as included in wildfly 10 you could download the infinispan modules at version 8.2.6.final the latest stable release as it also contains a module or if you re using jboss eap you might prefer to download the jboss data grid distribution which will contain the same features as the infinispan modules
as you noticed the infinispan extensions used by hibernate search for this purpose are not included within the infinispan module which is part of wildfly jboss eap so you correctly downloaded the infinispan modules from the infinispan project

42633798
wildfly	jboss
as you noticed the infinispan extensions used by hibernate search for this purpose are not included within the infinispan module which is part of wildfly jboss eap so you correctly downloaded the infinispan modules from the infinispan project
what you are missing is that wildfly is able to isolate modules very effectively so the first thing you have to realise is that you really don t have to match the version of infinispan as included in wildfly

42633798
wildfly	jboss
what you are missing is that wildfly is able to isolate modules very effectively so the first thing you have to realise is that you really don t have to match the version of infinispan as included in wildfly
since you will be using the module set from infinispan.org you should not configure these caches in your jboss eap configuration file as the caches defined there are controlled by the clustering subsystem and will affect the cache definitions created by the infinispan modules included in wildfly the infinispan modules at slot main

42636367
udp	tcp
rtp realtime transport protocol however uses udp and is used for media streaming
here is one more thing udp is not going to assure you a 100 transport whereas tcp tries to when packet loss is detected tcp tries a re-transmission

42636367
udp	tcp
here is one more thing udp is not going to assure you a 100 transport whereas tcp tries to when packet loss is detected tcp tries a re-transmission
so we expect drops in udp

42638579
ssl	https
some other suggestions get a let s encrypt ssl certificate and put that on your site so that the communication between cloudflare and your site is all ssl
ensure that hsts is turned on for all of your https requests so that the browser will know not to send any requests to any http urls

42638639
implements	extends
if performance is not absolutely critical and when you re implements your own userlist you ve already given up on performance by and large it s much easier to have one known good implementation and implements other operations in terms of that known good operation
so for example __add__ can be implemented as so now as long as your constructor and extends method are correct __add__ is correct automatically

42641351
client-side	server-side
of course you can access data sources such as pouchdb from ember.js or you need to implement a security policy in client-side
but those are not the case core implementation for a security has to be done in server-side

42647010
base	fractions
this works fine in excel but not in gs because it uses a different base for dates so duration like 69 41 00 would be interpreted as 1 1 1900 21 41 and the days are not correct
so you would have to break it down into days whole numbers and hours+minutes fractions of a day like this you can make it work in google scripts if you want to by adjusting the date - should work ok for durations up to 1 month

implements	extends
i strongly suggest that instead of implements a custom text field you extends the uitextfield class like this then to use it you just do this yourtextfield.applycustomclearbutton
implements a custom text field as suggested in the other answers is not a good idea

42651364
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you can set a case-insensitive collation immediately after creating the database so your data doesn t end up case-sensitive as this is probably not what the end users want
obviously this won t work if your application is actually relying on case-insensitive object names unless you rewrite your queries carefully

42655837
udp	tcp
so ip will get you from one machine to another and tcp ip and udp ip gets you to a specific service or process by adding port numbers
ip and tcp address fields do not overlap

42660060
implements	extends
example code for implements queue output of the code hello hello stackoverflow user null
the queue interface extends java.util.collection with additional insertion extraction and inspection operations like +offer element e boolean inserting an element +poll e retrieves the element and returns null if queue is empty +remove e retrieves and removes the element and throws an exception if queue is empty +peek e retrieves but does not remove the head of this queue returning null if this queue is empty

42663267
ssl	https
verifying the source of the certificate means verifying that the hostname in the provided url is a valid endpoint and then using an https user agent that doesn t have ssl certificate verification disabled
most people know that in https the web server s certificate is used in the process of encrypting the connection

42665977
prepare	execute
i recommend you to use prepare statements. i hope this will help
your query doesn t run because you are using the mysqli function wich need 2 parameters to execute your query

42673136
equals	compareto
if it doesn t change you can sort the array using java.util.collections.sort array comparator and you can create custom comparators that sort based on the fields you need example supposing i have a class with 2 fields i can create a comparator that compares somefield method compare must return -1 if m1 is less than m2 which means if m1 must be before m2 when i sort 1 if m1 is greater than m2 m1 must be after m2 when i sort or 0 if they are considered equals it doesn t matter the order of m1 and m2 when i sort
in this case i used compareto of string class because it does this same logic with strings. if i call collections.sort list somefieldcomparator it will sort according to values of somefield

42673501
imperative	declarative
u-sql does not provide any imperative code-flow constructs because it impedes the optimizer s ability to globally optimize your script
you should think of approaching your problem declarative

42679574
client-side	server-side
if you want to pass a value from client-side to code behind without posting back the entire page you will need to use ajax
calling to a server-side method in asp.net web form is not as clean as asp.net web api or mvc

42680420
serializable	deserialization
this means you need to configure bytearrayserde s for key and value for you input output topic of your streams app and add a map that does the deserialization ie -- or the other way round if you also want to catch serializable exceptions
otherwise you cannot try-catch deserialization exceptions

42680822
division	subtraction
as i wrote in my answer above doing 32b 16b division on 8086 is not trivial and i m not even sure what is the efficient way
i gave you hint about using table of 32b divisors and doing the division by subtraction but you went for div instead

42683129
google-chrome	firefox
if it is obeying what will happen for scenarios like x-frame-options deny sameorigin for that case what mozilla ended up implementing and safari and google-chrome ended up following is use the most restrictive policy if the framing situation violates any of them blocks the load thus the browser behavior for x-frame-options deny sameorigin is deny most restrictive
so unfortunately while there is no authoritative spec to point to on what the required behavior is if there are multiple values for the header because the x-frame-options spec rfc 7034 doesn t actually state what the requirements are in practice the current safari google-chrome firefox behavior is the expected behavior

42689015
hive	hdfs
you cannot directly insert data hdfs file into a partitioned hive table. first you need to create a normal table then you will insert that table data into partitioned table
means when ever you are populating hive table it must have at least one static partition column

42694687
hive	hdfs
if connecting to hive and not specifying any options it is likely user hive warehouse or user username folder
2 - hadoop stickybit enabled by default prevents users from writing to tmp in hdfs

42694687
kerberos	ldap
with kerberos they need a kerberos ticket not a username or password
sas 9.4 support for hadoop reference if you are not using kerberos then you can either have either the hadoop default of no authentication or possibly some services such as hive could have ldap enabled

42694687
hive	hdfs	kerberos	ldap
sas 9.4 support for hadoop reference if you are not using kerberos then you can either have either the hadoop default of no authentication or possibly some services such as hive could have ldap enabled
if you don t have ldap enabled then you can use any hadoop username in the libname statement to connect such as hive hdfs or yarn

42697533
postgresql	mysql
whereas postgresql is a lot closer to standards compliance
this is best explained in the mysql 5.7 manual sql92 and earlier does not permit queries for which the select list having condition or order by list refer to nonaggregated columns that are neither named in the group by clause nor are functionally dependent on uniquely determined by group by columns

42697942
onresume	onpause
the counterpart to onresume
you can find in the official documentation of android lifecycle onpause is called as part of the activity lifecycle when an activity is going into the background but has not yet been killed

42707918
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you used to be able to set a custom text in the onbeforeunload dialog but in most newer browsers you can t anymore starting with firefox 4 google-chrome 51 opera 38 and safari 9.1 a generic string not under the control of the webpage will be shown instead of the returned string
for example firefox displays the string this page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved. see bug 588292 and google-chrome platform status

42712569
ubuntu	centos
on ubuntu 16.10 the ctypes module of the system python2.7 is located in usr lib python2.7
not sure where this is for centos - you need to figure that out

42713717
onclick	onsubmit
in that case you wont need onclick handler in the button you can also do like this
not sure if you are using a form if you are using it you can can use onsubmit handler and return the action

42714033
entity-relationship	diagram
first your diagram isn t an entity-relationship diagram it s a table diagram
entity-relationship diagram must be able to represent the entity-relationship model which supports ternary and higher relationships weak entity sets and identifying relationships and other concepts for which table diagram don t have notation

42714188
sctp	tcp
tcp is somewhat reliable every transfer is automatically segmented padded with checksums reassembled and checked for a matching checksum - thats a pretty reliable transport protocol right there it will work out-of-the-box if you re really paranoid or simply need to create digital proof of transmission you need to choose another protocol entirely - something like sctp perhaps
after all of the bytes are sent everything has been received correctly - tcp will ensure that do not try to re-calculate checksums of individual packets or something you will introduce errors

42716706
division	subtract
further reading c# specification 7.7.2 division operator second result will give you rest which will be either equal to first result if there was no rounding or it will be equal to division rounded from zero 20 in your case
it s not clear how you are going to use your code twice but if you want to divide integer into two integer parts just subtract first result from totals first result will use integer division and it will give you result rounded towards zero 19 in your case

42716982
rsa	aes
problem until api 23 is that you were not able to store aes keys in keystore so the most reliable key for encryption was rsa with private and public key
so the solution i came up with was for apis below 23 you generate an rsa private and public key and save it in keystore generate an aes key encrypt it with rsa public key and save it to sharedpreferences

42721515
factors	matrix
it takes the upper triangular cholesky factors rather than the covariance matrix as input
so if a is your covariance matrix you want chol2inv chol a not chol2inv a just found out that this issue was answered twice long long ago

42721669
memcpy	memmove
and this makes perfect sense when you consider that memcpy uses cpu speciffic instruction that are not available on all cpus to speed up memory copy
to clarify the difference between mencpy and memove according to the docs memmove can copy memory to a location that overlaps the source memory for memcpy this is undefined behavior

42723883
tostring	string.format
if your mymethod returns type that implements iformattable - just call tostring yourself most such types for convenience also implement tostring with one parameter which is not part of iformattable interface mymethod .tostring cultureinfo.invariantculture if type does not implement such interface - string.format will also do nothing useful for it will not use formatter you passed - so nothing is lost
update since your argument is string - there is no need to pass formatter to string.format and in your specific case use string.format at all

42724523
awt	swing
checking the api it s more than clear that in swing this feature is not implemented and fully relies on awt
awt on the other hand has partly implemented the native calls to the os but it s not wired to be invokable

42728115
equals	compareto
be sure to implement equals and hashcode accordingly and keep in mind that when also implementing the comparable interface it should reflect the natural order which should be in sync with the equals method
so when calling equals for two objects 5 a and 5 b and the result is false the compareto method should not return 0

42729735
mathml	mathjax
the approaches suggested so far produce poor quality mathml and while mathjax s output handles even this awkward mathml native mathml rendered like firefox s will produce poorer results
here is f text x rendered by firefox s native mathml this is badly rendered because the underlying mathml has two separate elements and the bases for the two superscripts are not the same height one possible solution that produces better mathml is to use the double-prime unicode character u+2033 as in f x or if you are entering it in an html page as

42729735
mathml	mathjax
here is f text x rendered by firefox s native mathml this is badly rendered because the underlying mathml has two separate elements and the bases for the two superscripts are not the same height one possible solution that produces better mathml is to use the double-prime unicode character u+2033 as in f x or if you are entering it in an html page as
this is rendered by mathjax s html-css output as and as by forefox s native mathml renderer

42730548
ubuntu	linux
execute below commands if ubuntu user is not working then try with ec2-user
you need to do the following steps open your ssh client or terminal if you are using linux

42730915
fgets	fgetc
to flush a line of input read until end of file a read error or a newline is encountered a common technique is however it is not normally considered a good idea to mix character oriented input like fgets with character oriented input like fgetc since the two handle things like newlines differently
an alternative using fgets is it is necessary to use a buffer the integer c in the first form and buffer in the second form

42732244
multiplying	division
you can approximate what you had before by first dividing 255 to get your scaled disparity map then you need to multiplying by 63 to undo your previous division by 63.
oh yeah and by the way you need to convert the datatype first before doing the division or else you will be subject to truncation of the datatype and that s also where you re going wrong too be wary that you will not get it exactly the same as you had it before due to the precision loss when dividing by 63 and also when writing to file

42733187
implements	extends
fragment is the only part of url free for you to transparently implements single-page web applications which can run offline on your mobile phone for example . therefore it must not be sent to the server
i would like to extends the answer on the reason why the fragment is not sent to the server

42734666
memcpy	realloc
hunch a clever implementation of realloc should execute faster than a brute memcpy to a new array
the reason is that if realloc is able to grow shrink your array without having to copy the whole thing into a new location which can occur when there is simple not enough contiguous space then it will be faster

42736898
symfony	silex
symfony has built-in http_basic_ldap authentication provider which perfectly suits your requirements
unfortunately silex doesn t have one so you need to do it on your own

42737119
ssl	https
if your application does not manage ssl your elb should not forward https traffic to your ec2 instance
let the elb terminate https and forward it as http

42738482
ionic	angular
or do npm install angular router --save the following is what a typical package.json should look like for an angular project add other packages dependencies like ionic as well to match your needs
your package.json does not have angular router

42740032
move	drag
i think that ondrag event applies better to drag and drop data items not to move views
edited changed with a working example of how to move all the views contained in a relativelayout using ontouch

42741151
noexcept	throw
this makes noexcept impossible to use for anything serious but the most contained cases move constructors come to mind
the answer peter gave does not hit the actual problem of exception specifications for the implementor and user exception specifications cause the program to terminate or more precisely call termination handlers if the implementor failed to uphold the guarantee to only throw the defined exceptions

42742828
realloc	malloc
the call of malloc in the function is not needed since realloc can accept a null
also the realloc does not need to be in the loop

42745054
elasticsearch	kibana
turns out the oauth2 proxy is passing authorization headers to kibana and kibana by default passes this to elasticsearch
aws elasticsearch upon the existence of the authorization header requires all requests to be signed with an iam identity which i am not doing

42751375
express	node.js
if you want to set particular headers in express use res.set
both res.writehead and res.end are not implemented by express but by the node.js http module

42756107
wildfly	jboss
it is not hard to create a module for jboss and you can find enough samples and instructions... as example here is the simple one how to install a module on wildfly
maybe you need to try wildfly owners to think about it one more time.

42756744
implements	extends
in addition you can extends only one class whether or not it is abstract whereas you can implements any number of interfaces
consider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation you want to share code among several closely related classes. you expect that classes that extends your abstract class have many common methods or fields or require access modifiers other than public such as protected and private . you want to declare non-static or non-final fields

42759036
margin	text-align
center-block is also an option not referred in above answers all the class center-block does is to tell the element to have a margin of 0 auto the auto being the left right margins
however unless the class text-center or css text-align center

42759828
super	self
return super .__setattr__ name value and you must inherit this mixin in your mymodel class class mymodel validatefieldnamesmixin model # etc
you can achieve this by creating mixin that overrides setattr behavior like this class validatefieldnamesmixin def __setattr__ self name value if not hasattr self name raise valueerror invalid field name

42760158
vsts	tfs
it s only available with vsts for now tfs2017 is not support
you could also check this question tfs 2015 rest api authentication

42763778
uicollectionview	uitableview
if not you can use cellforrowatindexpath tableview or cellforitematindexpath collectionview for uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath for uicollectionview collectionview cellforitematindexpath futher i m not suggest you using scrollviewdidscroll becuase the height of the cell usually varies with the change of data if it will be more expensive
your code can like this code below uicollectionview if you do not need your app to be compatible with ios10 below you can put prelaod code to prefetch method

42764706
persistent	transient
note docker filesystems are normally transient meaning they are not persistent
in the dynamodb docker container example i have earlier it specified a way to keep persistent data during container restarts

42765315
mongodb	bson
rather than mongodb supported python-bson pip install pymongo
note install pymongo can be installed with pip python -m pip install pymongo do not install the bson package

42767370
memcpy	memmove
this is possible in your case if and you also can t assume that is the only possibility for error some computer architectures have instructions that might make it quicker to start copying from the top and work downwards in which case memcpy is safe when the source is below the destination and overlapping but not above the destination and overlapping
this would be true in your case if so with any possibility of overlap always use memmove

42768248
daemons	systemd
mongodb and mapped volumes in docker on windows are not compatible as noted for example in the mongo docker image documentation warning windows os x the default docker setup on windows and os x uses a virtualbox vm to host the docker daemons
unfortunately the mechanism virtualbox uses to share folders between the host systemd and the docker container is not compatible with the memory mapped files used by mongodb see vbox bug docs.mongodb.org and related jira.mongodb.org bug

42770914
bower	npm
in your output window bower npm you should see the npm install command being executed from your machine-wide node installation c program files nodejs npm.cmd install
for your node installation folder i m assuming you meant c program files nodejs not c program files nodesjs also you re testing the npm version from the package manager console

42780452
hash-collision	key
however rows from multiple partition key can also end up in the same partition when a hash-collision between the partition key occurs and some partitions might be empty
in summary the unintuitive aspects of are that partitions will not strictly segregate partition key some of your k partitions may be empty whereas others may contain rows from multiple partition key the behavior of df.write.partitionby is quite different in a way that many users won t expect

42785707
grafana	kibana
grafana supports lots of data sources
even if you are using grafana with elasticsearch you would not usually look at the same data logs as in kibana

42789047
ssl	https
it is not possible to enable ssl in a python module via the apache config file
what you want to use is a https-to-http proxy which wraps up scrapyd s http into an https protocol

42789150
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

42789150
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

42789150
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

42789187
virtualenv	conda
if that still applies that will be the reason for that massive difference between the virtualenv environment and the conda one
i read an answer in here which states a good advantage of conda environment is that it not only installs python libraries but also dependencies like qt when installing pyqt

42789215

42790251
clang	llvm
side note once it was claimed that one of major reasons for apple to switch its tools from gcc stack to clang llvm stack was that gcc is licensed under copyleft gpl and thus apple couldn t integrate parts of gcc obj-c backend such as code analysis or stuff useful for refactoring into xcode even if those parts were developed by apple itself without making whole xcode open source
clang llvm on the other hand uses more permissive open-source license that allows such 3rd-party usages

42794647
multiplying	subtract
i then mod by 5 and add the one back in so that we go from 1 to 5 instead of 0 to 4 since i don t know how large days-back is going to be i need something larger but i also need to have it not effect the mod 5 calculation so i just multiplying it by 5
i then subtract one so i can add it later and offset 0 to 4 to 1 to 5 and we are done

42795747
rdf	owl
e similarly from p rdfs range f and a p b we can infer b rdf type f
owl isn t about specifying what s valid or not in this regard it s about specifying what you can infer from other data

42796689
mdpi	hdpi
as of 2017 the list of densities you should support in a smartphone app is mdpi 1x optional hdpi 1.5x xhdpi 2x xxhdpi 3x xxxhdpi 4x this leaves out the tvdpi density which is not a standard one it is 1.33x and the ldpi one which is very outdated
mdpi devices as well have a very low market share and are mostly tablets

42810736
theano	cudnn
please read cudnn note because i wrote gpu cores can make only primitive calculation if you choose to use gpu but use function which is not supported of gpu theano will switch application temporary for such function for cpu. it s take time to make it
if you didn t use cudnn you code not use all power of gpu. the benefit of gpu before cpu is that gpu have a lot of real cores from 700 till 4000 ordinary cpu from 1 to 8

42811238
setinterval	settimeout
for example you shouldn t use setinterval if your callback could potentially run longer than the interval between invocations
it will not be a problem when you use settimeout and schedule yourself in every callback but on the other hand you may have less precision in the intervals that way

42814201
ssl	https
after getting a valid ssl certificate you may use the following rule to redirect to
you can t redirect https to http if you don t have ssl certificate or ssl isn t enabled on your server

42814201
ssl	https
you can t redirect https to http if you don t have ssl certificate or ssl isn t enabled on your server
you will get an ssl certificate error if you don t have the ssl certificate

bash	zsh
is a bash extension the dash does not know about
the correct posix-compatible way to write is works in all posix-compatible shells dash bash ksh zsh ash .

42818805
i2c	spi
your throughput will depend on the packet size in bits read write command address and data 2 bytes per axis the number of i2c devices if you make the calculations you will probably see that you cannot reach the full potential of you sensors
on top of that the i2c bus is slower than spi because there are control data exchanged

42819101
build.gradle	gradlew
when i created the project i chose gradlew as the build tool. for some reason my java gradlew project had the source compatibility in the build.gradle file set to 1.5 maybe because my default was originally set to 1.5...i don t know as i did not bother to reproduce it changing the sourcecompatibility to 1.8 solved the problem since the update to the gradlew file also triggers a project build
word to the wise any newbie on intelij should remember that not selecting either maven or gradlew in conjunction with your java project creation will not setup the default package src main test and src main java structures necessary

42822960
punctuation	words
you can break that string up as well by adding punctuation characters to the set of separators like so now you ll see a count of 18 like you expect
consecutive spaces and newlines aren t coalesced into one generic whitespace region so you re simply getting a bunch of empty words between successive whitespace characters

42825374
namenode	hdfs
in cases where you would want the namenode to exit safemode before executing a command this wait option can be used
consider an example script containing these lines hdfs dfsadmin -safemode wait hdfs dfs -mkdir test here the mkdir will not be executed until the namenode has exited safemode

42826509
postgresql	mysql
edit better ways to write the commands a quote characters b use single-qutoes in shell and double quotes in sql even if that s not strict to the sql standard mysql accepts it postgresql wont c write the sql into a file and use
david pointet in the right direction your problem has nothing to do with mysql - you re just not using shell escaping right

42827281
ubuntu	centos
if you run setenforce 0 you will get a better error don t forget to re-enable in ubuntu you will get the above error without running setenforce 0
this can happen when you try to enable a service that does not exist but is not specific to systemctl mask ctrl-alt-delete.target looks like this is a centos fedora etc

stealing from the man page for let s try and see with examples here i ll use a proxy which does not support client-proxy connection over ssl tls
make sure no proxy environment variables are set beforehand env http_proxy outer_scheme http inner_scheme http env http_proxy outer_scheme https inner_scheme http env https_proxy outer_scheme http inner_scheme https env https_proxy outer_scheme https inner_scheme https now i ll show the same outputs for a proxy which supports connection over ssl tls

42828989
octal	decimal
this causes values starting with 0 followed by digits to be interpreted as octal and value of 011200 octal is 4736 decimal the value of 011600 octal is 4992
in yaml 1.2 octal integer values should start with oo and therefore 011200 will be the integer 11200 try using yaml 1.2 --- service a b 011600 c 011200 and if that doesn t get you the value you want you should consider using a compliant yaml parser the yaml 1.2 specification is from 2009 so there has been ample time to get things right

42830746
dictionary	map
but not in the order of entries you could use an associative array also known as dictionary or hash map to store your words
checking whether an entry is in such a map is very fast time complexity o 1 you can add an entry to dict using don t worry about the empty right hand side

42836597
ubuntu	linux
as you said it s an ubuntu no version specified you can try just using python without a path as the python executable should be already in the path and usually it comes installed with your distribution
if that doesn t work you can figure out the python executable path running which python on the linux shell

keras	tensorflow
second unfortunately keras doesn t provide an out-of-the-box solution for using multiple gpu
keras uses automatically using tensorflow as backend one gpu

42842527
punctuation	words
yet another regex solution that separates out punctuation and ignores case when counting words
i m not sure whether you want total words count or unique words count so i did both.

42851629
jar	manifest.mf
do not know why mvnrepository can display artefact can transfer jar to you but can not send jar via maven
sources contains the following file with java manifest o.n.swing.outline manifest.mf so the algorithm is donwload jar from mvnrepository with some version

42852952
sudo	passwd
let s print the user and home sudo -u newuser can change your current user to newuser but it doesn t change your home folder which means you re running pip3 command as newuser in your home folder.that s why you got permission denied
so you can try this sudo -h -u newuser bash -c pip3 install virtualenv or use -i -h --set-home request that the security policy set the home environment variable to the home directory specified by the target user s passwd database entry

42855173
swift	objective-c
however it was not bridged to swift therefore you need some casting magic this is especially useful when your sorting is more complicated
you can simply chain up the comparison since you are using objective-c objects you could also use the old nssortdescriptor

42857021
swift	objective-c
i had the same requirement but could not work out how to override the _shouldexcludeactivitytype method in swift either
after some failed experimenting with method swizzling i came to the conclusion that using objective-c to create the derived class and then using a bridging header to expose the derived class to the rest of my swift code was the simplest and best approach

42858427
factors	matrix
in base r we can combine akrun s pmin and pmax suggestion with aggregate using the non-formula interface as follows note that this requires that and are character vectors not factors
timings this method is faster than using apply as it doesn t involve conversion to matrix

42861166
spaces	delimiter
you can find there rules for regular identifiers embedded spaces or special characters are not allowed
when identifiers are used in transact-sql statements the identifiers that do not comply with these rules must be delimiter by double quotation marks or brackets

42862724
icmp	tcp
that code does not use icmp it opens a tcp connection to a port
opening a tcp connection or actually using icmp only verifies that the host network stack is capable of responding it does not verify the health of the proxy itself

42863514
hive	hdfs
create your parquet table and you can do an insert into and hive will then store the resulting data set as parquet
not sure how you loaded your data but if you have a csv just put that on hdfs

42864235
google-chrome	safari
second of all in order for the code to work on the desktop in safari google-chrome and firefox you have to use an existing anchor tag and not create one document.createelement a
the destroyclickedelement approach only works in google-chrome because it is so forgiving and lenient

42864461
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this is an alternate to the first but it s not used a whole lot the read-only selector is supported in google-chrome opera and safari
firefox uses -moz-read-only

42864463
rsa	aes
if rsa is required the strategy is to use hybrid encryption where the data is encrypted with aes and a generated random key and then the key is encrypted with rsa
unless a public private key pair are needed rsa asymmetric encryption is not needed

42868893
build.gradle	gradlew
add the following to your app build.gradle product flavor add the dev product flavor to existing ones to remove this dev product flavor from the regular build eventually add your app module google-services.json to .gitignore app google-services.json we have previously ensured that this dev variant will only be used when parameter is specified edit .travis.yml to modify the build config will only build dev build variant using google-services.json located in app src dev google-services.json take a look at this sample project which is using google-services google project in travis log you can see that the json file being parsed is the one for the dev build variant parsing json file home travis build bertrandmartel android-googlesignin app src dev google-services.json extra note note that this method is not limited to ci and can be extended for your production build when you require a production google-services.json or a different androidmanifest.xml with some specific properties like fabric.io key check this method to prevent commitment of fabric keys embedded in androidmanifest.xml and can t be imported from gradlew that is using a different build variant and using a parameter to enable the production build
you can create a new build variant and store a template google-services.json to be used for your build on your ci platform in your app build.gradle

42871381
super	self
parent.__init__ self lastname eyecolor the line calls the super method __init__ and initializes the lastname and eyecolor if you comment this line parent.__init__ self lastname eyecolor then your object won t have members lastname and eyecolor and you cannot access these members
explanation when this line is called parent.__init__ self lastname eyecolor the __init__ method of parent class is called which will initialize members lastname and eyecolor

42871699
ostream	ostringstream
example live demo finally as commented by m.m if your ostream is a ofstream or an iostream most likely it clears its buffer so you may not be able to extract the full content as proposed above
if you have a a stringstream or a ostreamstring object or reference just use the ostringstream str method that does exactly what you want extract a string

42871699
ostream	ostringstream
but you know that and you apparently have a ostream object not a stringstream nor a ostreamstring
if your ostream reference is actually a ostringstream or a stringstream use ostream rdbuf to get a streambuf then use this post to see how to extract a string

42874718
freebsd	linux
on linux this is enabled using prctl s pr_set_child_subreaper option and on freebsd this is enabled using procctl proc_reap_acquire command see man pages for details
on linux you will be able to monitor only one child process individually this way since the orphans do not remember from which original fork call they came

42880083
client-side	server-side
angular is a client-side framework so you ll have to at least have some web server to serve your static files
other than that if you re using firebase you wouldn t technically need any server-side code to handle your logic - but naturally that depends strongly on what data your application deals with

42881149
multiplication	exponent
the result is ceil k w multiplication
this is often preferred in cryptographic implementations as the exponent is not revealed by simple timing attacks

42881173
prepare	execute
your problem is that you try to execute this statement using prepare statements
however ddl instructions such as create database are not allowed within prepare statements because a database name can t be bound to a variable

42884170
multiplying	multiplication
you cannot change the order of precedence but you can manipulate it by grouping them within blocks so changing your assignment to would multiplying v with the result of v 2
as you can see from this table the bitwise-exclusive or operator is actually lower in the precedence than the multiplication

42887325
google-chrome	firefox
most of their recent enhancements have been implemented after that functionality was initially featured by google-chrome dev tools and they look and feel surprisingly similar in firefox
for example at the moment of this writing google-chrome dev tools currently feature a cubic-bezier viewer which is not available yet in firefox

42887325
google-chrome	firefox
for example at the moment of this writing google-chrome dev tools currently feature a cubic-bezier viewer which is not available yet in firefox
i expect one to show up in firefox dev tools over the following months

42894783
fgets	fseek
fgets consumes the bytes read from the stream and stores them into the destination array
it cannot read the same bytes again unless you explicitly seek backwards into the stream with rewind fseek or fsetpos if the stream supports seeking at all

42895563
build.gradle	gradlew
you also need to add apply plugin ivy-publish thats one you not added in your build.gradle file also
for more you can go through this tutorial getting started with gradlew creating a multi-project build update#1 i have create a project in github clone the project and run the following 2 command gradlew clean gradlew jar console this will create 2 project

42901281
clang	llvm
try using clang as asm or llvm-mc -assemble
llvm-as command assembles llvm ir sources not assembler ones

42903130
equals	compareto
note that if for a given property the values of the two dates are not equals you can return the difference of those values instead of checking if it s positive or negative and then returning 1 or -1
compareto is not required to return 1 0 or -1

42904177
profiling	debugging
to run the debugging profiling just run mvn package -p debugging you can t achieve it with if-else because that s not the way that build profiling are built
first you ll have to declare 2 profiling

42905340
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

42905340
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
the svn2git utility you have used is based on git-svn and thus suffers from most of the same drawbacks

42905340
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

42907489
retrofit	okhttp
you can use headers annotation to add static dynamic header to retrofit
moreover you shouldn t create separate okhttp instance as stated in documentation okhttp performs best when you create a single okhttpclient instance and reuse it for all of your http calls

42926021
pandas	dask
we can do this by reading the csv file in pandas and identify the data type and pass that as argument in reading csv using dask
on reading csv file in dask errors comes in upon not recognizing the correct dtype of columns

42926161
profiling	debugging
credit due where credit deserved visual studio 2012 profiling remotely debugged process
visual studio allows remote debugging but not remote profiling

42926543
google-chrome	firefox
i do not think you have too many options you can not access from javascript to keystore used by browser due to security restrictions you can not create a google-chrome extension to access to keystore used by browser because google-chrome api does not publish it i am not sure with firefox you can not use an applet because java is not supported by google-chrome and edge
firefox will drop support to npapi plugins in march 2017 java uses npapi and next java versions do not include the browser plugin alternatives generate a .p12 file with the private key and certificate in client side download and open it

42931005
super	implements
typetoken subclassing the trick here is that typetoken is an abstract class and it can be parameterized letting gson analyze a usually anonymous class for the actual parameters at runtime and let the gettype method return a compile-time composed type subclasses can store information about their super classes parameterization and gson uses it at runtime
note that getrawtype returns list.class only - this is all just how java generics are implements since class cannot store actual type parameters read more for java generics and erasure

42932553
ssl	https
definitely you have to go with ssl enabled at both sides as you can not call https from http
so considering your question go with browser - https - angularjs client - https - rest api in this case you ll need to configure ssl certificate at both ends

42933376
seaborn	matplotlib
the idea is to only load the api without the styles from seaborn import seaborn.apionly as sns
what you show in the question isn t actually the matplotlib default style

42937995
intersect	contains
the problem is this will make showing the differences difficult because the other methods you re using to compare the lists except and intersect do not care about order only whether or not an item exists
so if fileold contains items cat | dog and filenew contains items dog | cat then they won t be equal but you also won t be able to show the differences fileold.except filenew will contains 0 items

42938280
postgresql	mysql
regarding postgresql on which i based my first answer i m positive you can t
edit i thought you couldn t but it turns out that i t is possible for mysql whereas it isn t available for postgresql there s an announcement dated aug 2013 which says that you can create second tier read replicas to take some load off the master

42939950
pyenv	conda
to have the python installations as clean as possible do not use homebrew to install python or packages but pyenv
also during the opencv installation the --without-numpy is important. the rough steps are use pyenv to set the global python install opencv use conda to install the python packages manually link the opencv-python packages to the active python distribution the commands for opencv2 then look like for opencv3 the main difference is in the options when installing the formula brew install opencv3 --without-numpy --with-python3 --with-contrib --with-examples --with--ffmpeg --with-java the rest can be adapted one to one from the opencv2 code

42952455
ng-show	ng-class
from the official documentation the ngshow directive show or hide the given html element based on the expression provided to the ngshow attribute. so it is not possible to do that with the ng-show directive
what you are looking for is the use of ng-class it allows you to apply a single or multiple classes to an element according to boolean expressions

42952900
g++	gcc
neither g++ 7 nor clang++ 5 warn with -wall -wextra -wpedantic
clang has a warning called -wstring-conversion that will catch the mistake but gcc doesn t have it

42960407
multiplying	multiplication
but multiplying it by 3 overflows int
10000000000 this is too big to an int so this constant is a long long so the resulting multiplication does not overflow

42963102
multiplying	multiplication
the line means this means matrix multiplication and one can t multiplying two matrices 1 41 and 1 41 inner dimensions do not match
what you need there is elementwise multiplication see docs for an explanation of the difference

bash	subshell
here s a complete example bash v4.2+ that said the modern equivalent of your is much simpler - it is posix-compliant and therefore works on older bash versions too and it requires no fiddling with global options
to complement charles duffy s helpful answer with a focus on making it work in bash by default and on bash v4.1- invariably any variable creations modifications in a multi-segment pipeline happen in a subshell so that the result will not be visible to the calling shell

bash	subshell
to complement charles duffy s helpful answer with a focus on making it work in bash by default and on bash v4.1- invariably any variable creations modifications in a multi-segment pipeline happen in a subshell so that the result will not be visible to the calling shell
in bash v4.2+ you can set option lastpipe to make the last pipeline segment run in the current shell so that variable creations modifications made there are visible to it

42965015
bash	zsh
the simplest method to set a variable is to read it seq 3 | read -d x this is specific to bash since 2.04-devel
will work in zsh but not in ksh

42965015
zsh	subshell
will work in zsh but not in ksh
however the only way to use the value of x is to do so in the subshell created by the pipe note that the exit condition of read is of failure because no character was found

42966490
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if that is not a typing mistake and you did indeed set your code up like that modifying your code to look like this will get it to work basically do not have a method inside viewwillappear but also move your action sheet display code to viewdidappear instead of viewwillappear
the way your code is provided it looks as if you added a method function inside viewwillappear

42967733
tensorflow	tensorboard
if you re not already using it you should check it out many of the higher-level apis within tensorflow already log a lot of information about the model variables during execution to tensorboard
to perform your own logging in tensorboard use something like tf.summary.scalar or tf.summary.histogram

42969166
equals	compareto
the first pair of characters that are not equals in your case s of string and c of compareto determines the result
since lexicographically s comes before c the comparison returns a negative value which means string should come before compareto

42975145
postgresql	mysql
this led to the second culprit which is the fact i m using mysql as the database which when storing datetime values does not store millisecond information unlike say postgresql
invariably what this means is that the timestamp variable that was being read after its activerecord was retrieved from the mysql database was effectively being rounded and shaved of the millisecond data while the started_at variable was simply retained in memory during testing and thus the original milliseconds were still present

build.gradle	gradlew
google doesn t update adt any more so when eclipse export a project to gradlew it use an old gradlew plugin version that android studio doesn t support. first you should check the version of gradlew plugin that you have installed. open android studio s installation directory then open the directory gradlew m2repository com android tools build gradlew you will see all version you have installed. then open android studio open tab project - gradlew scripts edit file build.gradle change the gradlew plugin to newest version you have installed such as 2.3.0 optional this step is not necessary but if you do not do this you may see this problem check the newest version of gradlew you have installed at c users your user name .gradle wrapper dists . then open tab project - gradlew scripts edit file gradle-wrapper.properties modify the gradlew version attention gradlew not gradlew plugin to the newest at the last line. finally click build - clean project done
if it still warning gradlew project sync failed... just click try again

super	extends
quick reference first thing you need to understand is class is a type in java. we will see below that wherever it is valid to use the term sub super class it is valid to use sub super type but not vice versa let me now define superclass
according to jls 8.1.4 given a possibly generic class declaration for n 0 c object fi here is type parameter the direct superclass of the class type is the type given in the extends clause of the declaration of c if an extends clause is present or object otherwise

42997463
memcached	opcache
on a medium high traffic website running on a single server i would recommend the following page cache use disk cache enhanced object cache use memcached database cache use memcached opcache opcache stores the compiled php code in the memory and definitely increases the code execution speed
it is important to understand that the opcache is a php code cache and does not store any pages database queries or objects

43002600
jlist	jlabel
if you look at the working example code from the listdemo example you will see that you add the data to the defaultlistmodel not the jlist
also you will see that you add the string to the defaultlistmodel not a jlabel

43006034
serializable	deserialization
therefore it includes a reference to classtype during serializable
server b does not import cloudpickle and then tries to find a reference to classtype during deserialization and fails

43008723
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in which check if the parent is nil of not is not a precise way to be sure of moving back to the correct uiviewcontroller
to determine exactly if the uinavigationcontroller is properly navigating back to the uiviewcontroller that presented this current one you will need to conform to the uinavigationcontrollerdelegate protocol

43012597
arraylist	treeset
it will save you from writing loops and make your remove with highest priority operation much faster o logn treeset or even o 1 priorityqueue instead of o n manual iteration through arraylist
looks like you actually need treeset but not arraylist

43015258
agda	idris
in agda programming language rewrite is just syntax sugar for pattern matching on refl
and sometimes you can replace rewrite with pattern matching in idris but not in this case

centos	linux
from the options this command is most likely designed for users running on rhel or centos docker host
it will not work on docker for windows or docker for mac but should work on other variants of linux

43018359
implements	extends
the problem with that is copy is only implements ootb in terms of case classes and identifiable is a trait so there may or may not be a copy method available at compile time hence why the compiler is yelling at you
heavily inspired by this answer i modified the provided example which uses shapeless lenses and now we can modify each id on any type extends for free yields entitya some -2485820339267038236 thu feb 01 00 00 00 ist 3917 entityb some 2288888070116166731 100 1 there is a great explanation regarding the individual parts assembling this answer in the provided link above by kolmar so first and foremost go read the details of how lensing works for the other answer which is very similar and then come back to this for a reference of a minimal working example

prepare	execute
even though a good suggestion was made in the comments as a general way to deal with such issues you could write it this way for a better way to prepare the command to be passed as argument to lxterminal please see charlesduffy s answer
as for the rest of your code i would probably use the following using as the if condition could yield 0 true and execute the body if argument 1 exists but is empty null string but a following argument is not

in a dynamic bound lisp this is not possible to do because n will not exist when the comparison happens
lecical scoping was introduces in algol and scheme

43027562
client-side	server-side
nuget packages are typically providing .net assemblies for use on the server where as npm packages are providing either client-side javascript libraries bootstrap react etc. and or server-side node features express
typically in a dot net core project you aren t using a node server you re using a dot net one so instead of using npm for package management which then returns both client and server js modules the default templated projects instead use bower which deals only with client-side modules

43027562
bower	npm
bower for client side javascript if you look under the dependencies folder in solution explorer in vs you ll find the bower folder
if you right click on that and choose manage bower packages you ll see the bower package manager or you can just edit the bower.json file in the project folder although again you won t see this in the solution explorer in vs npm if you want npm instead too then just manually create a package.json file in the project and after building the project you ll find a node_modules folder has been added to your solution and that there s now a npm folder in solution explorer under the dependencies heading if you right click on the npm folder icon there is then a restore packages option but that didn t actually work for me when i clicked it and if it did i m not sure if that is then automatically included in the build process or if further wiring up is needed

43027756
pycharm	spyder
my coworker refused to use pycharm because she was used to this feature in spyder and didn t know that it does exists in pycharm as execute selection in console feature which is typically have a shortcut combination of alt + shift + e
current pycharm feature documentation does not mention that short-cut

tensorflow	tensorboard
the tensorflow code flow is not like your conventional programming language
first a graph is created from the code which can be visualized using tensorboard and then update rules are computed using backpropagation which has been implemented internally

memcpy	memmove
what you implemented is memcpy not memmove
let s implement memcpy in c and not in assembler to see what is happening let s create a char array with the content hello world example and perform a

43034322
factors	matrix
that would reduce the number of comparisons by a factors of 64
for the general case the following may not be all that much better for thin matrix but scales very well as the matrix get fat due to the level 3 multiplication in the above i use the fact that the dot product is maximized when two unit vectors are equal

43035743
implements	extends
choosing to handle it at the service level requires you and your teams to understand better about the security process taking place you can hide it with a good library and you ll need to give them support from your security team it s may also be yourself btw you know the more service implements security the more things you ll have to think about to avoid adding unnecessary features
the big problem here is that you ll often end up stopping your tasks to think about what would help you out on this particular service and you ll be tempted to extends your authentication service and god unless you really know what you re doing don t add a single call not needed for authentication purposes

43035758
swift	objective-c
you are dealing with a problem that arises because swift native features don t always play well with objective-c
nscoding has its roots in the objective-c world and objective-c doesn t know anything about swift enums so you can t simply archive an enum

43035758
swift	objective-c
nscoding has its roots in the objective-c world and objective-c doesn t know anything about swift enums so you can t simply archive an enum
normally you could just encode decode the enumeration using raw values but as you found you can t combine associated types and raw values in a swift enumeration

43038233
bash	subshell
bash bin echo and read can be shortened to read -p function cpuutil is less portable than cpuutil single quotes prevent parameter expansion
you have to use double quotes for your bc commands i ve used here-strings instead of pipes to avoid creating a subshell power of in bc is and not the while condition is complex is uses nested command substitution within which translates the output of the bc statement 1 if the comparison holds 0 if it doesn t to true false for bash appends the string 1 to the contents of variable n unless it was declared as an integer with declare -i but that s rather exotic so you have to use something like an arithmetic context ++n the final statement should probably be but as demonstrated by karakfa s answer you can do it directly

43046736
prepare	execute
i m not familiar with objective-c but usually you can run your querys safely in 3 steps write your query with placeholders and prepare it like query b bind variables to placeholders execute your prepare statement consult your sqlite driver s documentation for details
you can prepare your querys with variable placeholders instead of constructing the full query string yourself

also if i make a count on bugs related to the word blob then firefox only has 177 bugs found vs 751 in google-chrome
if we could exclude the difference from the js engine speed google-chrome vs firefox then in theory your test case should not happen

43047296
google-chrome	firefox
if we could exclude the difference from the js engine speed google-chrome vs firefox then in theory your test case should not happen
i would advise you to take a look at the following open bugs from google-chrome regarding the blob q blob colspec id+pri+m+stars+releaseblock+component+status+owner+summary+os+modified x m y releaseblock cells ids but just to make focus on the possibility of the bug being the answer for your question i can also show you other bugs using blob in firefox xmlhttprequest of large data approx 140mb with response type blob returns a corrupt file about 600 000 bytes around 9m in the blob appear incorrect

comparator	comparable
a note you can further override equals to take a person object and compare object equality on person or you can just set it to this.compareto p2 0 as comparator should return 0 if objects are equals
this is not how you have your implementation and you are technically breaking the contract of the comparable interface

43056792
aggregate-functions	sum
this means it is valid to include an aggregate-functions call in the arguments of a window function but not vice versa
select distinct product_category avg sum revenue over partition by product_category avg_rev from customer_transactions group by date_trunc month order_day product_category the clever part is partitioning only over the product_category not selecting all the groups category only and knowing that the groups will apply only to the sum and not the average

43058535
exponent	modulo
it is easy to store them together as the public key is the modulo + the public exponent usually the value 0x10001 the fourth primes of fermat
the modulo of course is also part of the private key so that doesn t need to be duplicated

43063191
implements	extends
for example there s an issue regarding this one at the official github repo and also a great example of implements it
a bit late answer but you can extends the shape of the element not the type of the specific chart from v2

43067280
swift	objective-c
according to apple doc memory managed objects core foundation objects returned from annotated apis are automatically memory managed in swift you do not need to invoke the cfretain cfrelease or cfautorelease functions yourself
if you return core foundation objects from your own c functions and objective-c methods you can annotate them with either the cf_returns_retained or cf_returns_not_retained macro to automatically insert memory management calls

43067739
super	implements
this is the general rule of inheritance method overriding hiding and declarations and applies also to possible conflicts not only between 2 inherited interface methods but also an interface and a super class method or even just conflicts due to type erasure of generics
a brilliant explanation is at implements two interfaces in a class with same method

43067750
apache	nginx
so probably something went wrong when apache tried to send data to nginx or when nginx tried to send information to apache
as i never worked with nginx before i also did not think of checking the nginx log files

43068209
sudo	passwd
she will not be able to login with a passwd use a passwd for sudo commands or change her passwd
but since you did not provide an alternative method of login authentication an ssh key with an additional authorized_key task you will still be asked for a passwd

43069678
symfony	silex
there have been projects that are symfony bundles and also have the configurations for other frameworks as well such as silex and also appropriate laravel configurations within the same codebase
a symfony bundle can certainly be included in with other projects via a composer.json composer.lock file - it doesn t mean that there is any useful code to run within that bundle however

43071400
union	distinct
union construct is not really required here the authors used it for convenience
the reason they put a union there is to give themselves a syntax for accessing x y and z in two distinct ways by specifying the field name - that is coord.x coord.y or coord.z or by specifying the field index - that is or

43075608
3des	aes
as shown in comments the problem is a syntax error in the pkcs12 encoding params it is needed to set algorithm 3des because forge by default encrypts p12 with aes-128
as can be read in this article the rfc7292 that standarizes pkcs#12 doesn t specify a need to support aes but there is enough information to use it in an interoperable way

43076422
odoo	openerp
l10n_es.account_tax_template_s_iva4b external id is not found in odoo base module
you can manually change tax_ids in xml file or add xml file in comment in openerp .py file after that module will work

43079582
super	self
this also invokes the super class version of the __init__ method instead of setting self.view to the view passed in which allows it to do whatever other setup the default class needs to do in this case none but better safe than sorry
additionally the methods are adjusted a little bit since in this case every view will have a unique instance of this class created for it setme takes a self argument so that it knows what instance it is being called for on_activated does not take a view argument because it has access to self.view if it needs it calls to setme need to be prefixed with self

43082057
ciimage	uiimage
there is no scale and no screen a ciimage is not something that is drawn so there are no pixels
a uiimage backed by a cgimage is the basis for drawing and in addition to the cgimage it has a scale

43085593
profiling	debugging
the development provisioning profiling is the only provisioning profiling that enables debugging on the device
with this type of provisioning profiling you can run your apps only on the devices included in the provisioning profiling and you cannot publish apps in the app store mdm store

43085618
ioexception	fileoutputstream
while working on bufferedoutputstream found it does not throw an ioexception when we wrote on it after closing the stream
the bufferedoutputstream code just doesn t have that sort of checking but then neither does the fileoutputstream

43088420
portrait	landscape
but there is no event sent when switching directly from portrait orientation to reverted portrait if you have the reversed portrait enabled in your androidmanifest - marked in blue
landscape orientation to reversed landscape - marked in red please keep in mind that such direct orientation swapping to the reversed orientation is a normal interaction on regular device it is not something artificial that you can do on emulator only

43090079
portrait	landscape
that s why it crashes in portrait mode
dimen.xml for portrait doesn t have some values which are defined in landscape dimen.xml

43091481
cobertura	jacoco
cobertura can be configured to skip methods with some annotation so most of the generated code won t count against your coverage
jacoco doesn t provide a configuration mechanism to skip on certain annotations

43092658
getdate	datepart
for example if you need 11 00 today use dateadd hour 11 cast cast getdate as date as datetime
to avoid the error message the datepart hour is not supported by date function dateadd for data type date it s sometimes necessary to do a double cast after getting the current time firstly to cast it as date to get rid of the time and then back to datetime to enable adding time to it

43093606
stateless	stateful
just bear in mind that with react a component that s basically a single function not a constructor is supposed to be stateless and implement minimal logic - the kind of component that basically only renders something simple
for anything a bit more complex you should use a stateful component - using either es6 classes or regular es5 with react.createclass

43095027
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
powershell performs case-insensitive comparisons by default so to answer the first part of your question you need to do a case-sensitive comparison which is -ceq
although a simpler solution to that is to use case-sensitive contains -ccontains here s one way you might correct the case explanation first we test if the case is correct for the four permitted words -cnotcontains case sensitive not contains if it is we do nothing

43096157
super	extends
in this case super calls the parent s no-arg constructor
a class that doesn t explicitly declare its parent implicitly extends object so here super will call object s default constructor which it would also do implicitly had the call been omitted

43099673
strncmp	strcmp
if you want to match the whole argument and require it be just a single character you should use strcmp rather than strncmp
you re not calling strncmp correctly

43102124
pyenv	virtualenv
to ease the maintenance i am planning to investigate these direnvm virtualenv-wrapper mkvirtualenv pyenv if you hit the shebang command line limits the best thing to do is to change your jenkins home directory to just j
i have being using python virtualenv with jenkins every day in the last two years at multiple companies and for small side projects and cannot say i found the answer

43104407
swift	objective-c
no realm cannot store native arrays whether objective-c nsarray objects or swift arrays as properties of the object model classes
in realm swift there is an object called list that lets you store an array of realm object instances as children

43108708
implements	extends
as per the documentation for spannablestring it does not implements the serializable interface hence you got the java.io.notserializableexception exception
doc - your approach to workaround this by extends spannablestring and implementing the serializable interface will not work

43108708
implements	extends
doc - your approach to workaround this by extends spannablestring and implements the serializable interface will not work
the reason for this being that in order to make a non-serializable class serializable by extends it it needs to have an accessible no-argument constructor

43110215
spaces	delimiter
details - your initial delimiter - capturing group 1 matching - any 0+ chars other than tilde - 0+ sequences of - a tilde that is not followed with a digit from 1 to 9 - any 0+ chars other than tilde 120 3 - end delimiter however it won t capture what you need since it will include some digits and spaces at the start
maybe your starting delimiter should be and the lookahead then should be

43111265
icalendar	rrule
in terms of icalendar representation the correct way to model such exception is to have it be part of the same event same uid with an additional recurrence-id parameter
you should not add an exdate please note that the recurrence-id of the exception should always correspond to the datetime as calculated from the rrule while the dtstart of the exception may differ if on one instance you move the time of the event from 9 to 10 the recurrence-id will be t090000 while the dtstart would have t100000

43114796
intersect	contains
if you created your own class and did not override the equals -method in that class the intersect -method will only compare the references of the objects and not the properties
take the following really simple class now create two lists with both contains one object

43116192
pthreads	fork
and the pthreads spec says if a child process cannot be created or if the termination status for the command language interpreter cannot be obtained system shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error finally the manpage for unzip lists various return codes but -1 isn t among them
if the command itself can t return -1 the problem is probably with the initial fork exec due to something like a system-wide or per-user limit memory exhausted

43118014
udp	tcp
for a local reverse tethering tool it is not a problem though so i implemented udp over tcp without using socks
i am answering to my own question it s probably to avoid tcp mechanisms packet retransmission head-of-line blocking

43118496
onresume	onpause
here is my onstop and onresume methods
i m not using onpause

43122041
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
you forgot one important paragraph from treeset note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

43122182
comparator	comparable
as stated by treeset note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
consistency with equals as stated by comparable the natural ordering for a class c is said to be consistent with equals if and only if e1.compareto e2 0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals e2 for every e1 and e2 of class c

43122449
libstdc++	libc++
this looks like a qoi issue in libstdc++
using clang 4.0 libc++ does not have this issue

43125330
google-chrome	firefox
here you can compare the render of your code with different browser google-chrome firefox the firefox one is considered normal
also your issue with the shadow and selections doesn t seems to appear on firefox

43125465
vim	sublimetext	vim	notepad++	vim	atom-editor
a viewport which although it does have a defined dictionary term i ve only heard referring to vim windows in the help window doc
viewport is not a term i ve ever heard with regards to editors like sublimetext visual studio atom-editor notepad++

43126658
daemons	systemd
if journalbeat doesn t work using a syslog daemons like rsyslog to handle the task
the systemd journal is often forwarded to to syslog by default anyway

43127883
rpm	yum
you problem is probably dependencies correctly using fpm s -d flag repetitively and install with yum not rpm
use rpm -q --whatprovides on your build box to back track and figure out what rpm s provide that library

43129839
bower	npm
the reason to present this that reply appeared in question about fs and bower
alright the command npm install browserify-fs and then the solved the fs.existssnc not a function yet not the problem

43131480
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
uilabel doesn t have a method declaration matching theuserclicked
instead move the method theuserclicked in to notescardview and pass self to the uitapgesturerecognizer

43141708
profiling	debugging
it says that the provisioning profiling you have selected in the general tab does not contain the signing certificate you selected in the build settings - code signing identity
usually this happens if a distribution certificate has been selected for the debugging identity under build settings - code signing identity

43144033
client-side	server-side
by default the required option is set to true meaning that html5-ready browsers will apply client-side validation if the field is left blank
if you don t want this behavior either disable html5 validation or set the required option on your field to false also note that setting the required option to true will not result in server-side validation to be applied

43146597
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested third way in google-chrome and ie browser it was working fine
zoom is not implemented in firefox

43147238
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
a fileinputstream is for input from a file and bufferedreader uses a memory buffer so the actual physical reading does not does not read character wise inefficient
with new bufferedreader otherreader you add buffering to your original reader

43148819
bash	zsh
the array assignment works with the same syntax as zsh but the reference to the array doesn t in ksh bash syntax you d have to write modeled after to enumerate the elements of an array
because your script isn t being executed by zsh

43150129
mp3	ogg
yes you could probably just get away with providing an mp3 file but that does not mean it is necessarily a good idea
i did not find any particular reason to use ogg as a fallback as opposed to another format

43151972
spaces	linefeed
the p element renders all contiguous white spaces including new lines as one spaces
the linefeed character does not render to a new line or line break in html

43155128
mvp	presenter
this isn t the usual way of doing mvp
in mvp the model is passive and the presenter is the agent

43155128
mvp	presenter
in mvp the model is passive and the presenter is the agent
diagram from mvp wikipedia page as per the diagram above the presenter manipulates the model and the model doesn t know or care about the presenter

43155128
mvp	presenter
diagram from mvp wikipedia page as per the diagram above the presenter manipulates the model and the model doesn t know or care about the presenter
when it is necessary for the model to notify the presenter of state change events it is done through the presenter registering for callbacks from the model

43156697
super	extends
so i thought i make the class final and it s methods static but then the problem arises that super methods cannot be called from static methods
first thing is that your coremodel is final class and you can t extends final classes which you did in your personmodel and your code will not compile

43158076
super	extends
your code i assume you know but just in case super is class you extends the parent
if you override it s onstart function the normal onstart procedure isn t done if you don t call the super function

43164709
direct3d	directx	directx	direct2d
the assemblies only support the legacy directx api set with no support for direct3d9ex direct3d 10.x direct3d 11 direct2d directwrite dxgi d3dx10 d3dx11 xaudio2 xact xinput etc
since managed directx 2.0 was never released in production form the managed directx 1.1 assemblies still reflect .net 1.1 design principles and does not support or make use of .net 2.0 constructs

43165939
google-chrome	firefox
in your manifest.json make sure you request permissions for the domain you are posting to -- google-chrome doesn t require permissions for xhr but firefox does
this error manifests in firefox as a http code 404 in the xhr but no activity in the network panel

43168792
sudo	passwd
if it s the case you only have to create the following symlink sudo ln -s usr lib64 python2.7 site-packages psycopg2 opt cloudera parcels cdh lib hue build env lib python2.7 site-packages psycopg2 anyway if you re trying to understand how to install cdh i recommend you to not use the embedded postgres db but postgres as external db instead in the same machine
cloudera manager is using some scripts to generate lots of things passwd configs ... you re going to miss if you use the embedded version of postgres

43174082
stateless	stateful
horizontally scaling stateful http app it would be great if we could have all applications being stateless everytime but unfortunately that s not always possible
so when dealing with stateful http apps you must care about the http session which is a basically a local storage for each different client where the web server can store data that is kept across different http requests such as when dealing with a shopping cart

43178219
uicollectionview	uitableview
as mentioned by many above if you require only single set of data and that too not complex go for uitableview else use uicollectionview
uicollectionview is customization friendly

43178959
client-side	server-side
gtm is a client-side javascript injector
it does not have a server-side component you could download the generated javascript file and host in on your own server and it would still work

43182622
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
line break like using only css css only not cross browser compatible this css only solution works for me on the following browsers windows 10 google-chrome 56 and opera 43
it does not work on firefox 51 ie 11 or edge 38

43183805
junit	jmockit
if you use an own junit runner
jmockit does not require you to use an own runner

43183932
calloc	malloc
to ensure that the calculation of does not overflow you can divide the size_max by item_size and ensure that the resulting value is greater than or equal to n_items calloc must return null if the allocation did not succeed so calloc most probably has a check similar to one above
the size_t is an unsigned type and the maximum value of size_t is the absolute maximum size of object that can be allocated with realloc or malloc

43184866
express	node.js
that way you only have one node.js process which shouldn t grow in memory and handle a lot more client will not have to use exec and have a first try with express
your problem is that you start a new node.js process for each request that is why the memory footprint is so huge and isn t what node.js is built for

43188925
ienumerable	iqueryable
projectto is extension of iqueryable not ienumerable
provides functionality to evaluate queries against a specific data source the iqueryable interface is intended for implementation by query providers

43189174
bower	npm
my bower version was 1.5.9 and needed to bower install angular-cookies as well
i was managing angular via bower not npm

43189510
ssl	https
some 3rd party ssl tls libraries do provide an indy iohandler class for instance eldos secureblackbox
eidiohandlerpropinvalid means tidhttp was instructed to send an https request but the tidhttp.iohandler property had not been assigned an ssliohandler component such as tidssliohandlersocketopenssl to handle the encryption

43193873
implements	extends
you do not know what other custom roles you need to implements
all this means you need to extends your existing rbac implementation with attribute-based access control abac

43193896
spaces	delimiter
the first function will strip all control characters and replace with a spaces so not to concatinate words like would return as john smith the second function is a modified parse function to accept two non-like delimiter begin end
in your case a # and spaces

43194899
spaces	delimiter
since your strings have spaces in them you should not use a spaces delimiter
a comma is a common choice but semicolons and tabs you can get these using t as the delimiter are other common choices

43208585
ssl	https
the limitation comes from the cloud storage bucket presented as a website under a custom domain - you can t use ssl with that
from you want your content served through https ssl is not currently supported by the cloud storage webservers

43208585
ssl	https
from you want your content served through https ssl is not currently supported by the cloud storage webservers
thus you can only use a cname redirect with http and not with https

43210122
implements	extends
it s possible to get the current state like zoom perspective or position via autodesk.viewing.viewer3d methods getstate and restorestate but the state is not actually saved by default you ll need to implements a javascript that communicate with your backend to post and get this information
this sample extends this state

43214491
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh
so i used chere -i -s bash
on my windows machine it was not taking chere -i -t mintty because mintty shell was not available but you might have choice of various other shells like ash bash cmd dash mksh pdksh posh tcsh zsh passwd

43216885
haskell	ocaml
on the other hand haskell doesn t allow such thing and throws a compilation error
this is an intended behavior for f# and for example ocaml

43218561
shadowing	named
shadowing is a highly effective way of making the code more readable and not less comprehensible as you might think if used to imperative languages
it can actually help prevent bugs rather than introduce bugs by overriding an identifier named thereby blocking access to the former definition

43228875
apache	nginx	ssl	https
datapusher is running on apache only and thus is on http not https so there should be no issue with ssl
check your ckan config is the default datapusher s ssl_verify setting is for a later request - when datapusher makes a request to ckan at ckan.site_url which for you will go via nginx over https

43229761
sudo	passwd
but the next command in a script will run in the shell that is executing that script after the su sudo including it s child shell exit not in that child shell
processes that read passwd like su and ssh and also sudo insist on reading it from a terminal

43237610
move	drag
when the mouse button is down the mouse is captured and will continue to send mouse events while the mouse is down even if you have move off the canvas document or event outside the browser window
this means you can drag content of the canvas and not worry about losing the mouseup event

43239218
dns	spf
your problem is the spf standard specifies a maximum of 10 dns lookups to be used in the resolution of a given spf policy to prevent abuse attacks
bluehost s spf record is a total turd and you shouldn t include it

43239774
subtract	addition	multiplying	addition
the issue here is that you are generating random numbers at the start of the program but not regenerating them every time a question is asked your add function will always use a and b multiplying will always use c and d and subtract will always use e and f for all of their respective calculations the values of which never change
in addition the parameters you are inputting are of no value for multiplying and subtract as you are just disregarding them and using c d and e f respectively without note of the parameters inputted

43240255
innodb	myisam
your foreign keys won t work the way you think for several reasons the mysql.user table is myisam not innodb table in current versions of mysql
foreign keys are not supported in myisam

43243321
realloc	malloc
if realloc returns a non-null pointer you should forget about the original pointer you passed to it
the error message you re getting is pretty nice pointer being realloc d was not allocated if you are going to use realloc you need to pass it either a null pointer or a pointer that was dynamically allocated using a function like malloc or realloc

43243364
ffmpeg	libav
problem you re using the ancient dead buggy broken useless counterfeit ffmpeg from libav not a modern real ffmpeg from ffmpeg
solution fortunately you can easily download a recent version of the real thing and use it instead download wget extract tar xvf copy the binary files to usr local bin now you can run the ffmpeg command and it should use your downloaded version

43245206
textview	imageview
i read the this blog post to see i see previous supported textview has now been striked out which means its not stable and bug prone
i removed the vector drawable from textview and added a another imageview just below textview with the vector drawable using src compact so that visually they still look same i.e a text view with background

43246726
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions and subqueries are not permitted
so you can only have a chance to write your own logic to get the sum of time

43247092
bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
that includes bash ksh and zsh from your list as well as others such as dash but not windows cmd
tcsh is similar but not posix

43252413
oncreate	onstart
if user exit the app will call - onpause - onstop - ondestroy calling finish in onstart oncreate - onstart - onstop - ondestroy calling finish in onresume oncreate - onstart - onresume - onpause - onstop - ondestroy for further reference check look at this oncreate continuous after finish about finish
calling finish in oncreate will not call ondestroy directly as prakash said

43257947
postgresql	mysql
its postgresql equivalent is for contrast setfetchsize rows should throw sqlexception when the condition is not satisfied
this is not honored by mysql s jdbc driver

43258242
swift	objective-c
i went over different cases it seems all swift code works correctly
note that is allowed in url host therefore it should not be encoded and the bug is in the objective-c version

43258527
comparator	comparable
if you do want to use a set use a treeset also see when should a class be comparable and or comparator
you re comparator does not compare by mesure but by it s tostring method. you should adapt your comparator to sort by mesure

43260072
google-chrome	firefox
as of google-chrome 56 web pages that contain a password or credit card input field that are not served over https will display security warnings
i believe that firefox is planning on doing something similar they may already have done so

43260837
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
as of april 2017 all up-to-date major browsers such as google-chrome firefox and edge support the es2015 aka es6 let keyword
ios safari did not support let until os 10 e.g os 9 did not

43262639
swift	objective-c
it is not possible to do in swift
that said objective-c is generally not exception-safe

43263774
swift	objective-c
the swift - objective-c bridge has explicit support for nsobject and thus also for its subclasses but i m not sure it can handle all other root objects equally well
on the export side swift classes being exposed to objective-c it s not even possible to make an own root class

43263774
swift	objective-c
on the export side swift classes being exposed to objective-c it s not even possible to make an own root class
a swift class that shall be exposed to objective-c simply must inherit from nsobject so i d say that the bridge has not been designed with arbitrary root classes in mind

43263774
swift	objective-c
a swift class that shall be exposed to objective-c simply must inherit from nsobject so i d say that the bridge has not been designed with arbitrary root classes in mind
of course none of this explains the crash which could just be a simple bug in the swift compiler or the swift runtime

43271437
ionic	angular
ionic v3 was not officially released when you asked your question so unless you used the beta version i assume that you still use v2
you don t need angular router for url paths

43272357
realloc	malloc
quoting c11 chapter 7.22.3.5 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

43273330
hive	hdfs
hive.auxiliary.path is the default location for hive to read udf if your jar file not available on the location you won t be able to access it
because when you create a function hive know s the location of your jar as hdfs 172.16.1.151 9000 user spark sparkudf.jar but to make it available for spark you would have to deploy it on the auxiliary path because once your hive session closes hive only stores the definition of your function but not the location and for location it would go to auxiliary path

43273948
libstdc++	libc++
they are not binary compatible and libmli3 requires libstdc++
on 10.8 and earlier libstdc++ is chosen by default on 10.9 libc++ is chosen by default

43278201
google-chrome	safari
ios google-chrome is more ios safari than google-chrome itself
it seems i found an answer on my question ios safari does not support fullscreen api

43279435
realloc	memmove
so you can realloc array but not array 2 since that is a pointer to a location in the middle of a memory block
you may want to try memmove instead

43280193
mongodb	bson
mongodb doesn t return json but instead it returns extended json called bson
if your needs are simple then the quickest approach may be to just convert the bson to json in your code

43291274
union	distinct
lets suppose that the 4th column in query1 b.id is numeric and the 4th column in query2 d.specimen is text. union will fail because they aren t compatible types. you must use typecasting select a.id a.op_id a.consult_id b.id text ... union select distinct a.op_id a.consult_id d.test_name_id d.specimen ...
to use union operator all queries must have same number of columns and the columns must be of compatible type so you must use type casting

43293885
lxml	beautifulsoup
i can not find the accurate beautifulsoup reference for this but the lxml parser is just ok
below is the tested code you can ref lxml entity handling to do more things

43300504
jar	war
there is nothing like better in war or spring boot jar
they both are underhood same things where spring boot jar manages the server embedded in it and war does not have that

43300720
rspec	capybara
with an application using rspec 3+ you would not want to make an http post request with capybara
capybara is for emulating user behavior and accepting the js behavior and page content that results

43311304
client-side	server-side
node.js is server-side not client-side
the code you re referencing in your question is client-side code

43312899
profiler	gprof
the visible change is a change in timing so you d want to start by aiming a time profiler at runs that both exhibit and do not exhibit the behavior to see what changes in where the time is spent
if you re lucky you can compile for tracing and see what gprof can spit out without perturbing the behavior

43312997
move	drag
the difference is that onbegindrag doesn t get called until the touch mouse has move a certain minimum distance the drag threshold
you can set the drag threshold on the event system component

43315646
mvp	presenter
you can take a look at this sample project and this article to get more familiar with mvp
you should not pass any android objects to presenter just get the event in view for instance your activity then call a method from presenter that provides data for second combobox we call it spinner in android

43318650
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
before attempting to assign to each of the members of lp you must assign space for the struct pointed to by lp itself for example additional advice when you allocate space you should normally check the result of the allocation function malloc calloc realloc as the function may return null if it was not able to assign the memory requested
you can do this with a simple if statement after the malloc such as if

43322989
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 16.04 is a distribution of linux so you are using the wrong calling convention
linux takes system call arguments in registers not on the stack as documented here and gettimeofday is not system call number 116 on x86-32 linux

43325578
implements	extends
i think the problem is that sampleboolean implements which is a specific type and not something generic
on the other hand r is declared to extends a generic type

43325779
calloc	malloc
or to avoid last instruction you can use calloc that zeros the allocated memory last thing as per function the caller must check return value of function to ensure to not use the possible null pointer returned
c strings are nul terminated so as you can see you must leave room for a null terminator 0 malloc x + 1

43329997
build.gradle	gradlew
here are the relevant parts of my build.gradle
i was able to solve like so and now gradlew doesn t show tasks like dexguardmockrelease or dexguarddevrelease

43332699
config	ini
often it s sufficient to read from a json ini or yml config file
just make sure you set your .gitignore or equivalent to exclude that config file from the repository and make sure that the file is outside the web server s document root so that it can not be read directly

43334181
prepare	execute
for a statement that you need to issue multiple times prepare a pdostatement object with pdo prepare and issue the statement with pdostatement execute
this means that you cannot use execute on a select query - instead you must use query or prepare

43334181
prepare	execute
this means that you cannot use execute on a select query - instead you must use query or prepare
for any queries using variables or user-input use prepare and placeholders in the query for variables like below to protect your database against sql-injection

43336461
g++	gcc
g++ filename.cpp -wall -o testc
when you use gcc to build your program the standard c++ libraries are not used by the linker

43336825
uiview	subviews
explain the new uiview will take the touch and automatically pass it to the superview
this way doesn t need to subclass your subviews - it s a storyboard solution

43345631
union	distinct
maybe you can use a join not union as jens says or a group by after union or a distinct by selected fields you must to analyze what do you need
your union produce the result. you must to see your nulls the first part of union returns null in description 3 and 4 rows

43349067
ubuntu	linux
i tried to install it in a macbook running ubuntu and as you i could import cv2 but some functions were not working
from the opencv-python website macos and linux wheels have some limitations video related functionality is not supported not compiled with ffmpeg for example cv.imshow will not work not compiled with gtk+ 2.x or carbon support now you might have problems trying to install the official opencv

43352182
profiling	debugging
xcode should then automatically generate provisioning profiling etc as is shown by the various boxes being checked in the icloud tab area 3 click on the cloudkit dashboard box in order to bring up cloudkit
i don t know why but there are times you cannot connect to cloudkit the sign on screen just keeps asking for your userid and password and gives no error message ..just keep trying and you will eventually be able to connect 4 develop your records and fields schema in the development database of cloudkit 5 use cloudkit in your project by following the many blogs on the net to crud data in your project especially stackoverflow.com 6 when your project is done being debugged and is working using cloudkit s development database switch to the production database in order to debugging it as when you deploy the project to the app store the app store and testflight only use the production database

43356670
swift	objective-c
note that this is not swift code nor in any way swift related this is pure objective-c code
it s just wrong objective-c code as you will see below

43356670
swift	objective-c
but apparently swift sometimes doesn t seem to care
when dealing with objective-c objects swift seems to assume that it can always call one of theses methods that nsobject and any sub-class of it implement even though no protocol would promise that

43356670
swift	objective-c
see this answer however it cannot even satisfy that requirement as one requirement of nsobjectprotocol is to implement this method and that s simply not possible for a pure swift class as when you try to do that the compiler will complain error method cannot be an implementation of an objective-c requirement because its result type cannot be represented in objective-c which is correct a pure swift class cannot be represented in objective-c so it cannot return the required type
the swift documentation also says note that objective-c protocols can be adopted only by classes that inherit from objective-c classes or other objective-c classes

43359206
des	aes
des is not secure and should not be used in new work
it has been superceed by aes example fragment example from sunsetted documentation section aes encryption in cbc mode with a random iv swift 3+ the iv is prefixed to the encrypted data aescbc128encrypt will create a random iv and prefixed to the encrypted code

43360081
oncreate	onstart
in the oncreate method of mainactivity you need to initialize mauth update in mainactivity mcurrentuser is null because the authstatelistener has not yet run
the listener does not get registered until onstart runs

43360246
gridview	sqldatasource
the problem occurs when selectcommand output inside sqldatasource using field names with whitespaces marked with which selects all columns without using alias while boundfield inside gridview control doesn t accept field column names using whitespaces
therefore you need to use select statement in selectcommand mentioning all field names used for datafield attribute in gridview and only alias all columns that have whitespaces on them like this then in your gridview declare all datafield field names with underscores or just remove whitespaces following convention in selectcommand inside sqldatasource and use them with sortexpression attribute with these setup above the binding on boundfield should be working properly without changing field names inside db

43363050
ubuntu	debian
according to the official instructions in the readme.md file there s no need to run autogen.sh on ubuntu in fact it is recommended not to do it by default because it overwrites the original makefile s which work just fine
here are the full ubuntu instructions reproduced from the official wiki on github for convenience ubuntu debian specific info on ubuntu debian mint and similar the following sequence should work for building the latest from github get libboost program-options and zlib apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev zlib1g-dev get the python libboost bindings python subdir - optional apt-get install libboost-python-dev get the vw source git clone git github.com johnlangford vowpal_wabbit.git build cd vowpal_wabbit make make test # optional make install if these instructions don t work for you please make sure you don t have other non-standard changes to your environment

43368378
equals	gethashcode
consider this simple class now you decide that two test objects are equals if their first and second properties are equals
you generate equality members but do not override gethashcode then later you use your test objects in something like hashset

43372697
g++	gcc
though g++ 5.1.0 does not produce any warnings for this code even with this option enabled
i wounder why the compiler doesnt warns about unreachable code in something like it is pretty well explained in gcc documentaion about warnings -wunreachable-code warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed

43376210
hive	hdfs
if you are more familiar with sql then hive may also be a more straight-forward approach
also runs via mapreduce unless configured otherwise create external table if not exists records f1 int customer_key string f3 string nation int f5 string balance float f8 string row format delimeted fields terminated by | location hdfs path test.txt

43382368
namenode	hdfs
the mapping between an hdfs-file and the individual files on the datanodes is maintained by the namenode
but the namenode doesn t expect a specific blocksize it just stores the mappings which where created during the creation of the hdfs file which is usually split according to the default dfs.blocksize but can be individually overwritten

43386638
g++	gcc
you are correct in believing that this warning is issued by clang++ in these circumstances and not by g++ and that you see it on your mac because g++ is really clang++
the gcc option -ansi is meaningful for compilation and not meaningful for linkage

43390173
bash	tcsh
sourcing a bash script with tcsh shell is a nonsense because they are different languages and bash settings may not be useful for tcsh shell
the error shows tcsh cannot define and export environment variable with bash with tcsh another solution if possible is to change default shell or start bash at login the shebang

43391269
tiff	bmp
if the accepted answer isn t working it may be because image.io doesn t have support for the type of image you re trying eg tiff
add this to your pom aka put jai-imageio-core-1.3.1.jar in your classpath to add support for wbmp bmp pcx pnm raw tiff gif write you can check the list of supported formats with for string format imageio.getreaderformatnames system.out.println format

43393292
build.gradle	gradlew
and that s sufficient for most cases unless you are distributing your library as aar which does not contain build.gradle - in that case your lib s dependencies must be included in the app s
or the gradlew file that is coming with the library is sufficient enough your library s build.gradle should list all dependencies it needs

43394022
jms	jta
public void setsessiontransacted boolean sessiontransacted set the transaction mode that is used when creating a jms session. default is false
note that within a jta transaction the parameters passed to create queue topic session boolean transacted int acknowledgemode method are not taken into account

43401328
direct3d	directx
first let me tell you what happens. directshow and all other directx graphical packages like direct3d work directly with graphics card and draw directly on your monitor in layers that windows is not even aware of let alone draw something over it
so it can t be done unless you render what you want to show using directx in the same device that you have created the initial window

43401769
onkeyup	onkeydown
however preventdefault does not work with onkeyup
use onkeydown

43402894
innodb	myisam
use --single-transaction to avoid table locks on innodb tables
there s nothing you can really do about myisam though you really shouldn t be using myisam

43402985
udp	tcp
for udp that is true because all data written by the app is sent out in one udp datagram
for tcp that is not true unless the application sends only 1 byte of data at a time

43407274
vsts	tfs
more detail steps please take a look at below link analyzing with sonarqube extension for vsts tfs tfs2015 update3 and later analysis reports currently neither reports nor pull request analysis comments are supported in this mode
unfortunately the analysis reports feature is not support in this task for the integration with tfs

43408193
swift	objective-c
because of this simplified representation for objective-c protocols a value of such a protocol type p can share the same memory representation as a generic value of type some generic placeholder t p presumably making it easy for the swift team to allow the self-conformance
the same isn t true for non- objective-c protocols however as such generic values don t currently carry value or protocol witness tables

43408193
required	placeholder
unfortunately this required a language feature called opening existentials which currently isn t directly available to users
however swift does implicitly open existentials protocol-typed values when accessing members on them i.e it digs out the runtime type and makes it accessible in the form of a generic placeholder

43409315
spaces	delimiter
so as your sample strings have only spaces as separator adding something like this to your class should suffice
your function takes an input and the first step is to split your input string by delimiter however the variable _delimiters is not defined

43410119
dictionary	map
a list would be more space efficient and have the same performance characteristics mapping such numbers to values and both map to a generated dictionary in that case
python doesn t re-run a dictionary literal just because you reference it

43418100
viewdidload	viewdidappear
in viewdidload there is no parent navigation controller set up and you should not start animations from there
move from viewdidload to viewdidappear

43419278
multiplying	addition
if you use it multiple levels you are multiplying the problem with setsynchronizationcontext there s no harm in doing it more than once
if it turns out that there was no blocking deadlock where you thought there was or it had been fixed task.run now is introducing blocking over async whereas setsynchronizationcontext will not cost you anything in addition to the optimizations it makes by not resuming on the context constantly

43419334
ienumerable	iqueryable
a ienumerable is an answer it only has data connected to it but you can t tell what generated that data
it is not that a iqueryable is faster per say it just allows you to put your filtering and projections in to the question you ask to the sql server and let it return only the answers it needs to in the form of a ienumerable by calling .tolist or similar

43419334
ienumerable	iqueryable
it is not that a iqueryable is faster per say it just allows you to put your filtering and projections in to the question you ask to the sql server and let it return only the answers it needs to in the form of a ienumerable by calling .tolist or similar
if you only use a ienumerable the only question you can ask is give me everything you know then on the answer it gives you you perform your filtering and projections

43431936
calloc	malloc
two things to remember about malloc ... it doesn t initialize the memory with any specific values use calloc for that it s not guaranteed nor really even common for the memory to be contiguous or adjacent to the memory returned by a previous call to malloc therefore when you fill the previously created array-of-pointers with subsequent calls to malloc they might be in arbitrarily random places in memory
all you re doing with your first malloc call is simply creating the block of memory required to store n pointers

43433313
theano	tensorflow
the benchmark is here and was tested on an intel core i5-4460 cpu with 16gib ram and a nvidia gtx 970 with 4 gib ram using theano 0.8.2 tensorflow 0.11.0 cuda 8.0 on linux mint 18 here are some other benchmarks but they do not address mean
the here is a benchmark from some guy who claims that tf mean is significantly faster than in numpy or theano

43436834
clang	llvm
except with clang there is a flag that accept opencl device code .cl file which contains the kernels
that way you can use clang and provide also the flags and options if i remember correctly but now you would have either llvm ir or spir output not an device executable object

43438879
onresume	onpause
to your questions 1 on post-honeycomb versions of android both onresume and onstop are guaranteed to be called as stated by dianne hackborn in her addition to activity s javadoc
2 on pre-honeycomb only onpause is guaranteed to be called as stated by the earlier version of activity s javadoc 3 4 5 ondestroy will not be called only if the process hosting the entire application is killed

43441130
ssl	https
1 the web server is not redirecting to port 443 ssl https 2 the certificate is not present
i could not find any certs through https on your server

43445763
n-gram	words
as far as my experience goes the order of words in n-gram is critical
you would not want to consider the n-gram putin attacked and attacked putin to be the same as they have very different contextual meaning

43447456
translation	localization
further you should not only consider that you have to instrument your code i18n to get your app website translation
you should think about the process too - how will you solve continuous localization how you keep track of progress .

43449232
comm	grep
many thanks for the help and suggestion to use comm but meanwhile i found the answer using grep
i rather prefer grep since it s much faster than comm and also does not require the input to be sorted

43459614
tensorflow	tensorboard
despite commenting tensorboard from the higher level build files bower just kept wanting to compile here is the semi-tedious part if you dont have internet access manually download required dependencies in . tensorflow workspace.bzl from external system and transfer into local system then update . tensorflow workspace.bzl urls to file path in system
i tried a bunch of ways to remove the external dependencies used in tensorboard all of which broke the build since i am not experienced with bazel

43461870
union	distinct
rolling some of the above comments in plus more notes got rid of the other or explicit union distinct to be clear that dups are expected
toss group by and not using select distinct

43466267
ratingbar	imageview
in button click listener you can reset rating value by using setrating 0.0 updated in your ratingbar you are using and
so once you rate 1 its not possible to rate 0 by using touch on ratingbar from my point of view you can use imageview instead of ratingbar add two different icons for favorite and unfavorite in res drawable folder set desired icon to imageview as per checking favrest value

43470694
google-chrome	firefox
here is good practices for both google-chrome firefox
but if we use onkeypress function in firefox then e.keycode will not work

43472081
git-svn	svn2git
for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as a frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

43472081
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as a frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

43472081
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

43472940
union	distinct
on large tables this latter step may cause problems with the overall performances and you can confirm that by switching to union all which won t perform the distinct
if you cannot settle for union all because you don t want duplicates i found this interesting article that proposes a solution for this kind of issues

43473915
punctuation	words
if your input is a string like the one you provided which does not have any punctuation then you can do just to get a list of words
in general though you would have to take punctuation whitespace and other non-alphabetic characters into account

43475173
vim	emacs
vi and ex but not vim is specified in the posix standard
system rescue environments embedded systems notably those with busybox and other constrained environments often include vi but not emacs

43476989
bash	tcsh
if for example you have a directory .tcshrc.d and you want to include all the files in that directory in your login shell you might include the following in your .tcshrc file note that this is tcsh code and is not compatible with bash
the tcsh equivalent to the bash and posix shell

43479235
comparator	comparable
comparator interface has compare method not comparable
it should be comparator interface

43482171
coalesce	isnull
the isnull return value is always considered not nullable assuming the return value is a non-nullable one whereas coalesce with non-null parameters is considered to be null
so the expressions isnull null 1 and coalesce null 1 although equivalent have different nullability values

43482629
inline	inlining
the jvm uses certain heuristics to decide what methods to inline
the method needs to be a hotspot being invoked enough times to make the inlining worthwhile it shouldn t be very big and it shouldn t be overridden by child classes which would modify its behaviour and invalidate the optimization

43483655
multiplying	multiplication
if you multiplying each adjacent number and sum up the results your return value should be 1540
you seem to take only every other pair into consideration if you want to sum up of the results of every adjacent pair multiplication also the ones marked with not you can simply go through the array like this on the other hand if you are really 100 sure you want to leave out every other pair and get to the 962 result however this only works for arrays with an even number of entries

43487804
implements	extends
solution 1 extensions to get a uitableviewcell that conforms to the attibutevaluecellprotocol you can use an extension you will have to implements the attibutevaluecellprotocol methods as swift and objective-c have no way of knowing how they should be defined
solution 2 subclass extends the whole uitableviewcell class could create some strange side effects if you do not always want those extra methods

43492098
pycharm	spyder
if this doesn t do the trick you should check out these other posts on so interacting with program after execution disable ipython console in pycharm
short answer go to and select use ipython if available go to and select show command line afterwards tip run selected parts of your code with alt + shift + e the details if you ve selected anaconda as the project interpreter ipython will most likely be the selected console even though it neither looks nor behaves like the ipython console you are used to in spyder

43495944
google-chrome	firefox
it would appear that the user agents you re testing in take it further and also prevent the events related to hovering google-chrome and ie seem to for instance
other user agents may not firefox allows the events related to hover for instance. if you want those events you could leave the buttons enabled and then style them to look disabled and prevent clicking them doing what they otherwise do although it may make for a confusing user experience

43497088
swift	objective-c
if you are starting a fresh project with the aim to only use swift in the future then i would create a new swift project and then link to your objective-c framework
this is what we did where i work and slowly over time we have been deleting from the objective-c project anything that is not being used

43497894
stateless	stateful
a bean does not behave differently than its code demands just for being declared stateless
but if i d change stateful on stateless i expected not to store state of the bean and get in each request clean list but it always save the state of previous request and shows new number

43497894
stateless	stateful
but if i d change stateful on stateless i expected not to store state of the bean and get in each request clean list but it always save the state of previous request and shows new number
the stateful vs

43499994
istream	getline
i m not sure if you can get problems by selecting on an fd read through an istream but this works for me linux gcc
getline returns if it reaches end-of-file which happens when everything coming from the pipe has been read

43500492
strcpy	strncpy
in c strncpy has the advantage over strcpy that it does not overflow the buffer when the source is larger than the destination
strncpy has the disadvantage that when the source is larger than the destination it does not terminate the buffer with a 0

43501722
inline	inlining
you can mitigate any possible performance penalty applying my earlier suggestion about placing the isr in the data module or by inlining the code - but your compiler is free to ignore that and may do so if debugging is enabled and may also inline regardless if optimisation is enabled
some compilers have a forced inline extension that the compiler is not allowed to ignore

43504462
swift	objective-c
the filename for those files can be found with this swift code bundle.main.path forresource classifications oftype xml i don t know what your code does it load it but if you just used classifications.xml it would default to the current folder which is not an allowed path on ios for resources
it might be easier to get this to work with objective-c if you are trying to interop with c++

43504987
clang	llvm
c++ name mangling happens at the front-end clang and it s part of a pretty well-defined -documented abi standard
moreover i don t think there is a spurious underscore cause that does not produce a valid c++ name back and the mangled name in the pastebin link that you provided appears as _znst3__112basic_stringicns_11char_traitsiceens_9allocatoriceeec1emc i m not on mac os but simulating with my llvm 3.8.1 on linux using using the same source and matching the ir line by line i get the following symbol _znst3__112basic_stringicns_11char_traitsiceens_9allocatoriceee6__initemc which demangles back to which i guess does pretty much the same construction of some sort

43510847
sudo	passwd
for example on my mac if you still want to log in using username and passwd after logging in using the private_key you can add your own user for logging in later # create a user for log in sudo useradd yourusername # specify a passwd sudo passwd yourusername # then type your passwd when prompted # add the user to sudo group sudo adduser yourusername sudo # create a home folder for your user sudo mkdir home yourusername # add a shell command for your user normally bin bash sudo vim etc passwd # find yourusername line and add bin bash to the end. # the end result would look like this yourusername x 1020 1021 home yourusername bin bash now you can ssh using the new username and passwd
the new ubuntu xenial64 image doesn t come with a default username and passwd

43513137
bower	npm
bower is more focused on browser libraries and css while npm is more for server-sided stuff using node.js
but node.js also contains most if not all of the packages bower has so it s matter of preference

43513501
dictionary	map
in order to use combine_first you need to include reindex or reindex_like df2.combine_first df1 .reindex_like df1 or df2.combine_first df1 .reindex df1.index my preferred solution we can use map with a lambda on a dictionary
with this i can preserve the integer dtype by utilizing the dictionary get method which takes a default value when a key doesn t exist

43514619
profiling	instrumentation
on some platforms __builtin_return_address does not work beyond the current function so the call site information may not be available to the profiling functions otherwise.
you can probably do this with the code profiling options in gcc. -finstrument-functions generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions

43515586
erlang	elixir
here s how you can get the compiled erlang source of your files back
i don t think it s possible to get the original elixir source back since it is not present in the escript at all

43515586
erlang	elixir
only the compiled erlang bytecode is
the decompiled erlang code should be fairly readable if you know some erlang if not check out this quick erlang - elixir crash course

43518557
dictionary	map
if all the dictionary from array not contains name key then use flatmap
you can use map for that

43522773
dictionary	map
you cannot cast a dictionary to a custom object
you need to map it by writing an appropriate initializer

43522791
swift	objective-c
if you added more attributes and want to remove them you may need to not call addattributes range but replacecharactersinrange withattributedstring instead edit swift 3 version nota bene i m clearly not a swift developer this code seems to work but clearly i write swift like i write objective-c and many things since i don t use them daily and didn t read the doc are wrongly done like the conversion cast explicit type class the as the
etc. but it could be a start for you. if you are a swift developer and spots issues feel free to comment the post and suggest your modifications

43522885
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
catching the interruptedexception and throwing a runtimeexception is not consistent with how the java.util.concurrent classes are written
it s more idiomatic to let the interruptedexception be thrown than to wrap it in an unchecked-exception

43524981
mongodb	bson
the mongodb aggregation framework cannot use any javascript
you must specify all the data in your aggregation pipeline using bson

43525377
xrange	enumerate
for i in list ... this goes through the values of list not the index hence you why you get -4 to go through index you must use xrange or range for python 3 over the len list for i in xrange len list ... or use enumerate list
enumerate returns a tuple of the index value pair on any iteratable object so you would index over a list like this for index value in enumerate list ... in this situation index is likely your i

43528211
sudo	passwd
apache must be allowed to execute sudo postfix reload without a passwd
to do that you need to add the following line in the etc sudoers file i recommend in the script to use sudo path to postfix reload since the postfix file might not be in the default path of apache user

43528800
hex	binary
another option is base64 or raw hex or whatever
the data section doesn t care what datatype it contains in the binary format it s all just bytes

43528813
bash	zsh
you could get a shell builtin echo that does not interpret backslash escapes by default example the bash builtin echo has an -e option to enable backslash escape interpretation and checks the xpg_echo shell option a shell builtin echo that interprets backslash escapes by default examples zsh dash a standalone executable bin echo probably depends on which one ndash
gnu coreutils echo understands the -e option like the bash builtin the posix spec says this emphasis mine the following operands shall be supported string a string to be written to standard output

43529253
dictionary	map
it s actually a subclass of collections.mapping so depending on the use-case you might not even need to convert back to a plain dictionary
you can t use a dictionary merge comprehension yet but you can go via a chain map note collections.chainmap is new in python 3.3

43535330
interpolation	splines
another option which does not require interpolation but is limited is to compute pairwise distances between your original points and the points in your dat file
one option is to do splines interpolation on the x coordinates in your dat file in matlab and compare the result y coordinates to the ones in your dat file

43535690
junit	mockito
as a side note the testcreate method should not contain a system.out.println method because junit cannot know whether your test should pass or fail
if you are using mockito you can use the verify method to make sure certain lines of code are getting executed

43536127
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
i believe this is issue of case-sensitive comparison
this is indicated by your code working for ints and bools and not strings and by a fact that brand name is a pple not a pple entity framework uses case comparison settings on the sql server which is usually set to be case-insensitive

43536912
swift	objective-c
however this swift evolution proposal implemented in 3.1 discusses marking something as obsolete as of a certain version of swift in this example trying to use the class foo in swift 3.1 or later will give an error
with a little adjustment we can do this in this example trying to use the method examplemethodwithobject in swift 1.0 or later will give an error whereas using it in objective-c will not

43537011
spaces	delimiter
change and optional spaces to | of course assumes no other field contains for remaining lines if it doesn t contain change first occurrence of one or more spaces or end of line to |
if i understood the question correctly these are requirements convert input file into three column output with | as delimiter the third field may be empty input is space delimiter but third field may contain spaces second field in input may contain text within which may contain spaces following would work for given sample s + | change first occurrence of one or more spaces to | handle the troublesome second field first

43537339
seaborn	matplotlib
you can use to plot the seaborn distplot to a specifiy axes ax
matplotlib s plotting command ax.plot needs to be called with actual data not with an axes created by another plotting command

43543616
comparator	comparable
the method signature should be public int comparator item it instead of returning a float
at the moment you are not implementing the comparable interface

43544331
boost	allocator
just like your std vector call where you do not specify an allocator for custom and use the default you can do the same thing with boost circular_buffer
the only difference is boost circular_buffer has an extra parameter allowing you set the capacity and number of default constructed objects in the buffer at the same time

43547845
pycharm	spyder
it is not an ide like pycharm that mentioned in the comments though it can be configured with most ides
i will note that the distribution includes an ide called spyder

43551295
entity-relationship	diagram
i don t know of any tools that can generate a proper entity-relationship diagram from a relational model
one difficulty for such tools is that not all relational models can be interpreted as entity-relationship models

43552426
spaces	delimiter
a function that always concats with a spaces can be defined like so which becomes more useful if you model it as part of your domain instead of concatwithspace it could be called formatreportelements or something with meaning
i m not sure that these 2 are equivalent fsharp s string.concat is used to join a sequence of strings into a single string with a delimiter system.string.concat is used to concatenate 2 or more separate strings together

43553342
inline	inlining
i cannot make a comment and i haven t experimented with the stuff myself but i want to make the following observation - you probably cannot force the compiler to not inline the function
compilers are notoriously inconsistent when it comes to inlining even the inline keyword doesn t force it to inline its more like a hint and it also makes the function invisible to other compilation units and the absence of the inline keyword doesn t mean it cannot inline

43555145
addition	multiplication
2-3 is encoded as 2 and -3 and then you do first-second which turns into 2- -3 which is essentially addition
you could change it to do addition in both cases but this fails once you move on to multiplication and division as as +4 and -4 are valid numbers but and 4 are not

43555699
ssl	https
you will terminate ssl on youe elb and configure it to forward both http and https requests as http to your instance s port 80 therefore you will not need anymore
also in your apache configuration in you are redirecting users to https if the connection is not using ssl tls btw that condition was unnecessary request would have never reached that point if it was using https - you could just unconditionally redirect it

43557507
persistent	transient
they are not guaranteed to persistent
deleting or modifying transient from options table via plain sql isn t recommended

43557905
ubuntu	debian
see boxcutter ubuntu ubuntu template in this example the password for the vagrant user is set not root pty see wikipedia pseudoterminal and packer documentation ssh pty
you can 1 set it in your preseed.cfg file with d-i passwd root-password-again password vagrant d-i passwd root-password password vagrant see bento debian 8 - example 2 or set it as a preseed argument in boot_command where root_password is a packer user variable

43559582
shadowing	named
i can see where this reasoning might be coming from because this is how variable shadowing works here the second declaration of a1 hides the first one
for records you might perhaps expect that a record with the same named will hide earlier declaration however this does not work and you get an error message error fs0037 duplicate definition of type exception or module t1 in your definition you are defining two separate types t1 and t2 and they both happen to have the same field

43560740
uicollectionview	uitableview
use uicollectionview for things that are placed in a grid with for example three pictures in every row
use uitableview for simple and advanced lists but not necessarily if you need a feed like twitter uses to point out an example

43561618
nsexception	nserror
if you need to go through with converting an nsexception to an nserror anyway you can do it manually like so
you can t convert nsexception to nserror because nsexception they do not have the same properties

43562730
innodb	myisam
if so then there is a nasty problem in myisam not innodb that may lead to 500 additional fragmentation hits
when a myisam row is updated and it becomes longer then the row will not longer fit where it is

43564052
bower	npm
if you use npm or yarn it shouldn t really matter if the dependencies are nested your frontend dependencies will all be bundled anyway with webpack bower so the main cost of using nested packages is that it takes up more space and more download time
since npm v3 and yarn can do flat installs there shouldn t be any issues with that anyway

43564561
backtracking	greedy
example greedy matching will first attempt 3 repetitions then backtracking to less output
a different regex that will behave differently than original pattern in edge cases like t...tha....thank the bug in 2017.04.05 was due to backtracking something like this the unsuccessful longer match creates empty 2 group and conceptually it should trigger backtracking to shorter match where the nested group will be not empty but regex seems to optimize and does not compute the shorter match from scratch but uses some cached values forgetting to undo the update of nested match groups

43565336
bash	zsh
they re features of the shell language sh dash bash zsh etc. whatever you use
thus you have to call the shell as the process with the entire command as the argument of course this won t work on a system that doesn t have bash installed like windows

43566341
tensorflow	cudnn
my setup working with win10 64 and the nvidia gtx780m be sure you have the lib msvcp140.dll by checking your system path - if not get it here run the windows installer for python 3.5.3-amd64 from here - do not try newer versions as they probably won t work get the cudnn v5.1 for cuda 8.0 from here - put it under your users folder or in another known location you will need this in your path get cuda 8.0 x86_64 from here set path vars as expected to point at the cudnn libs and python the python path should be added during the python install make sure that .dll is included in your pathext variable if you are using tensorflow 1.3 then you want to use cudnn64_6.dll github.com tensorflow tensorflow issues 7705 if you run windows 32 be sure to get the 32 bit versions of the files mentioned above
the problem was the cudnn library for me - for whatever reason cudnn-8.0-windows10-x64-v6.0 was not working - i used cudnn-8.0-windows10-x64-v5.1 - all good

43566348
uiview	calayer
the shadows in uikit come from the layer an instance of calayer on uiview
since uibarbuttonitem is one of the few ui classes that does not inherit from uiview it inherits from uibaritem which inherits from nsobject you don t get access to calayer and the drop shadow

43566348
uiview	calayer
since uibarbuttonitem is one of the few ui classes that does not inherit from uiview it inherits from uibaritem which inherits from nsobject you don t get access to calayer and the drop shadow
however it is possible to init uibarbuttonitem with a custom uiview

43566580
n-gram	words
note that here no + prefix to n-gram rebuild the search like as step 4 if score 0 mission accomplished - show results - end if score still 0 then make another query but this time without + +word prefix and in natural language mode - show results - end step 2 code step 4 code select my_column match my_full_text_column against +word_1 +word_2 +word_n in boolean mode as score limit 10 step 7 code that return stackoverflow an can be used with ohers words if many to much more accurate search like as step 4 end
i have finally made an algorithm myself generate n-gram algorithm i build a words table with 3 columns n-gram fulltext words unique lang i used bigrams function to make n-gram for each words i added a char padding to each ngram to skip the full text index minimum words length ex abcd should be ab bc cd but with padding it look like abxx bcxx cdxx search algorithm i take the client written words as correct and use them to search in the real table with mysql fulltext search query using against +word_1 +word_2 +word_n in boolean mode if the score ranking 0 mission accomplished and n-gram not used show result to client if the score ranking 0 maybe misspelled words then use n-gram words table to retrieve correct words retrieve correct words from n-gram algorithm for each words generate n-gram and preform a fulltext search query using against abxx bcxx cdxx in boolean mode from words table where we have the n-gram column and retrieve the correct words

43567564
client-side	server-side
however gcm is not deprecated google will continue to support it but all new client-side features will be available on fcm sdk only
the protocol remains the same server-side though

43567639
implements	extends
the most significant difference between implements runnable and extends thread is given below by extends thread derived class itself is a thread object whereas implements runnable interface it shares the same object to multiple threads
by extends the thread class the derived class can not extends any other base class because java only allow single inheritance. on the contrary by implements the runnable interface the class still extends other base class

43569987
super	extends
you should extends jpanel super refers to the immediate parents property
so in your case you can t call super because drawpanel doesn t have a parent

43569987
super	extends
so in your case you can t call super because drawpanel doesn t have a parent
you can solve that by adding extends jpanel which will also solve your .add problem in your main method

43576492
haskell	agda
in haskell we can use such dependency to get looping without recursion probably this version of the st monad is still safe just does not have provably total writestref and readstref
here is an agda formalization by andrea vezzosi which proves that runst is safe and total for an st monad with readable writable refs

43578171
lodash	underscore.js
additionally make you should uninstall the lodash types if you are not using them npm uninstall --save types lodash npm install --save types underscore.js however importing directly from an types package is incorrect usage while using a underscore.js as a global represents a failure to leverage modules
here are examples of how you should reference underscore.js after having installed the types package

43578738
gson	moshi
moshi uses okio to optimize a few things that gson doesn t
when reading field names moshi doesn t have to allocate strings or do hash lookups

43578759
multiplying	multiplication
you can t multiplying this
multiplication can only be done with numbers server.sendmail sentfrom to msg does not result in a number

43586083
swift	objective-c
you could also probably make this a method in a category on nsexpression and then the return nil for error fill in nserror pattern would probably be imported to swift as a swift throwing method
i should say by the way that an objective-c exception is not really guaranteed to leave your program in a consistent state

43591824
sqoop	hadoop
to run sqoop commands both sqoop1 and sqoop2 hadoop is a mandatory prerequisite
you cannot run sqoop commands without the hadoop libraries

43591824
sqoop	hadoop
you cannot run sqoop commands without the hadoop libraries
sqoop works in local mode too so it is not a requirement that the hadoop daemons must be running

43591824
sqoop	hadoop
sqoop works in local mode too so it is not a requirement that the hadoop daemons must be running
to run sqoop in local mode sqoop on spark is still in-progress

43596529
bash	subshell
sourcing a file ignores the shebang so the fact it refers to ksh doesn t prevent bash to process it
the issue is with that line under ksh the last component of a pipeline is run by the main shell while under bash it is run by a subshell

43597003
spaces	delimiter
lines with just 1 spaces s delimiter string are also ignored as not at least 1 substring could be assigned to specified first loop variable
the line must have at least 2 spaces s delimiter strings with for running the commands in the loop body

43605703
margin	text-align
date has some width that will compromise centering the text. you can give a negative left margin to virtually reduce its width to null or set its width to 0 and reset direction to let text overflow to the left set it in absolute position
in any case float center is not valid you can either use text-align center

43605797
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
you run into this issue is caused by you do not know the difference between the viewdidload method and the viewdidappear method
viewwillappear called before the view is added to the windows view hierarchy viewdidappear called after the view is added to the view hierarchy the controller s view add to the window s view hierarchy is between viewwillappear and viewdidappear the viewdidload is in front of viewwillappear so you can not do that

43607254
jar	war
an executable jar will not work because of a hard coded file pattern in tomcat
with jetty it should work if you use war packaging an executable war will work and will also be deployable to any standard container

43608427
serializable	deserialization
mongodb does not support java s bigdecimal serializable deserialization
what i ended up doing is creating my own serializable deserialization using string values

43609957
sudo	passwd
try using sudo mysql -u root command to access the mysql-server
if that does not work create a new user through phpmyadmin create user username localhost identified by passwd

43614246
client-side	server-side
it will not be possible to decrypt it on the server and when clients download the encrypted files decryption needs to happen client-side the s3 client deals with that for you though
unfortunately i think you misunderstood server-side encryption in s3

43614537
wildfly	glassfish	wildfly	weblogic
the jar contains the extra bit of magic for a client to be able to setup and maintain ejb remote invocations with the wildfly server just using jndi isn t going to cut it
and there is no one jar to rule them all each container wildfly glassfish weblogic etc. has its own implementation for a client library

43615825
git-svn	svn2git
for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

43615825
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

43615825
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

43616801
comparator	comparable
the classcastexception happens because treemap is a sorted set and requires that every key in it implement the comparable interface or else you have to provide a custom comparator
linkedlist doesn t implement comparable so you get an exception

43618461
awt	swing
first of all you are using the swing tag so your application should be using swing components not awt components
swing components start with j except for canvas where the swing component is jpanel

43622908
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

43623476
memcpy	malloc
if you had allocated your 3d array in a contiguous fashion then memcpy would work
you have multiple calls to malloc which means your 3d array is not contiguous in memory

43632355
hive	hdfs
sqoop hive import sqoop importing data into hive
typically sqoop import doesn t support column name while importing data into hdfs

43636051
swift	objective-c
fmdb is a wonderful objective-c library that has not been updated for swift and sometimes feels awkward in swift
you may consider using a library like grdb.swift which is written in swift robust fast and grants you the same features as fmdb grdb also allows you to avoid writing sql when you don t want to

43636696
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
even though cassandra 3.0.x runs on windows dse does not support windows as a platform per i recommend you fire up a rhel centos or ubuntu vm or cloud instance if you want to kick the tires on graph
if you re aiming to install dse on more than one system lifecycle manager in opscenter 6.1 has a point-and-click interface for doing so which might minimize your time on the linux command-line if you don t enjoy working in bash

43641189
ssl	https
you need to have unproxied direct requests from a client to properly assess the state of their ssl
do not put an https load balancer in front of how s my ssl

43643922
bash	zsh
you can create a new dockerfile that uses the base image and installs zsh or you can install it within the container temporarily and launch from bash
it looks like zsh is not installed on that image as bin zsh would likely be the path

43648099
swift	objective-c
objective-c cannot see a swift enum at all
in swift an enum is an object type

43649640
aggregate-functions	sum
under this mode which agrees with the ansi sql standard every column in a group by aggregation query must either appear in the group by clause or appear in an aggregate-functions sum
in the case of your above query you are selecting the columns sku and name but they do not appear in group by nor do they appear inside an aggregate-functions hence the error

43649817
interpolation	splines
the recommended replacement available in scipy 0.19.0 is the bspline make_interp_spline combo notice it is not bspline x y k bspline objects do not know anything about the data or fitting or interpolation
if you are using older scipy versions your options are cubicspline x y for cubic splines combo

43652527
division	addition	division	multiplication
performance caveats avoid division as it s still slow for floats although not as bad as it is for integers
multiplication is nearly as fast as addition for floats

43652527
addition	multiplication
multiplication is nearly as fast as addition for floats
multiplication by 2 -x for any whole x is guaranteed to be equivalent to division by 2 x while not losing precision

43661697
google-chrome	firefox
but as you have added the location of the binaries in the environment variables knowingly unknowingly while installation configuration of google-chrome ms internet explorer or other dependent softwares those binaries are easily located used automatically
- it is not only firefox but also for google-chrome ms internet explorer to work with selenium 3.4.0 you need to mandatory download gecko driver v0.16.0 or above from here or google-chrome driver or iedriverserver and save it in your machine

43661697
google-chrome	firefox
- it is not only firefox but also for google-chrome ms internet explorer to work with selenium 3.4.0 you need to mandatory download gecko driver v0.16.0 or above from here or google-chrome driver or iedriverserver and save it in your machine
upgrade your mozila firefox or google-chrome or ms internet explorer to the latest stable version

43663805
prng	random
randomness is the responsibility of the prng not of the seed
the 64-bit processor timestamp isn t random at all so there is no need to preserve randomness when narrowing it to 32 bits

43665029
client-side	server-side
so yes it s just fine if you want to use es2015 aka es6 and later features in your server-side node code and restrict yourself to es5 and earlier features in your client-side browser code
you don t have to though and it s surprisingly hard once you get used to writing let and const and arrow functions to make yourself not write them in your client-side code by accident

43669628
centos	linux
so centos with openmpi 1.10.3 probably will not work with this virtualized rdma by azure as openmpi 1.10.3 is not the intel mpi library 5
in official docs azure lists intel mpi as rdma-enabled too with sles 12 sp1 hpc vm set up a linux rdma cluster to run mpi applications - 2017-3-14 customize the vm in a sles 12 sp1 hpc vm we recommend that you don t apply kernel updates which can cause issues with the linux rdma drivers. intel mpi complete the installation of intel mpi on the sles 12 sp1 hpc vm by running the following command if you want to set up a cluster based on one of the centos-based hpc images in the azure marketplace instead of sles 12 for hpc follow the general steps in the preceding section

43674853
awt	swing
don t use the awt thread to render swing componentes
even if swing does call the awt thread you should not mix bought your self

43674853
awt	swing
even if swing does call the awt thread you should not mix bought your self
imagin that swing invokelater implementation changes you would be using the old implementation calling awt directly

43675819
implements	extends
it might be used from javascript as follows activitystarter is just a java class that implements a react native java interface called nativemodule
the heavy lifting of this interface is already done by basejavamodule so one normally extends either that one or reactcontextbasejavamodule the name of this class doesn t matter

43681506
set	bag
out of the box this method is not present because it is inherited from the trait redirectsusers so just wrote it and complete as needed and it will be executed just when the user had been authenticated as the function name say as you can see the trait redirectsusers is looking for a defined redirectto function or using the variable you define as otherwise if the parameters you would like to pass is a simple get parameter you can use the same authenticated function and set it with the parameters as you prefer also dynamic params like for the redirect purpose this is more clear then using other functions like the authenticated ones suggested before
one way to pass a message bag is to create a redirectto method in the logincontroller

43683067
google-chrome	safari
set flex-shrink to 0 instead of the default 1 to avoid unwanted shrinkage. source i m guessing the google-chrome has fixed this since then but safari hasn t
google-chrome opera and safari do not honor the default min-content size of flex items

43687970
daemons	systemd
in short docker command would be docker run --cap-add sys_admin --device fuse -v host_mount_dir container_mount_dir shared image command if you get error like path foo is mounted on foo but it is not a shared mount ... then your docker daemons runs in different mount namespace than systemd
there is an easy way to make it in same namespace and restart docker daemons

43689313
implements	extends
you can and often do create anonymous classes that implements interfaces with runnable being a common example but your example above is not basically implementation of an interface
yes your first class is anonymous since it is inline and extends from thread

43689313
implements	extends
to clarify if you have a nested class that has a name you can declare a variable of its type but if you have an anonymous class you can t do this side bit you should almost never extends thread and instead either implements runnable or even better use executors to help you do your threading
yes you do create a brand new class but no you do not necessarily implements an interface

43689313
implements	extends
yes you do create a brand new class but no you do not necessarily implements an interface
in fact your example above has nothing directly to do with interfaces and all to do with extends an extant concrete class

43689706
ppm	pgm
your get_image_data does not handle the ppm format netpbm p6 format correctly
just like the other binary netpbm formats -- pbm pgm ppm pnm -- the p6 format can have comments before the maximum component value which is followed by exactly one newline 0 followed by the binary data

prng	random
it is a pseudorandom number generator prng
that means what they do is not to produce truly random numbers

.htaccess	httpd.conf
in case of .htaccess restart is not required if it is not working probable reasons include
allowoverride may not be set which user can set inside httpd.conf or might have to contact server admin

43695665
super	implements
for example our abstractaction or super actionlistener
you appear to be making several basic mistakes including what looks to be trying to add a class that implements actionlistener to your gui as if it were a button but it s not

43701688
jar	manifest.mf
however if your file name is accurate and this is actually a source jar it will never be runnable by only changing the manifest and you need to learn how java works
to partially answer the question asked if on windows which you didn t say and isn t the only system with a command prompt a jar file is really a zip file underneath and explorer in all supported versions xp s03 can treat a zip file as a directory subtree so just rename to have the extension .zip and open in explorer go to meta-inf select manifest.mf and open with plain-text editor of your choice such as notepad

43701832
multiplying	multiplication
dr explanation you are trying to multiplying a complex matrix with an int64 type
apparently the multiplication operation is not defined for this type in octave

43706400
bower	npm
the problem is that bower doesn t running in the same time for these reason is not possible get access to it
so expose the ports for bower ports - 3000 3000 - 3001 3001 - 8000 8000 and execute npm docker exec -it uzman_web_1 bash -c cd code uzman static

43710605
google-chrome	safari
i contacted google developer support by email regarding this issue and they instructed me to use google-chrome to access the play console i was using safari
on google-chrome you can see the down arrow next to the closed beta testing option which is not visible in safari due to a css issue as given in andrewprocter s answer above

43715625
profiling	debugging
after days of debugging ensuring our thread objects were strongly retained and trying various weak-strong combinations and thorough profiling using instrumentation we have come to the conclusion that this is an apple bug as also reported here that only appears on recent ios versions ios10 for us but i reckon it will be present from the version when libbacktracerecording.dylib started appearing
symptoms of not reproducible on ios8.x only happens when in debugging mode exc_bad_access in random parts of the code without any pattern might indicate this

43715693
tiff	png
the code you posted appears to be getting a tiff encoder not a png encoder
just because you name the file with a .png extension does not mean that you will get a png file

43716029
comm	grep
comm throws when the inputs are not sorted
grep -f works perfectly

43718459
calloc	malloc
interesting enough calloc does not allocate the pages either and instead just points to a single zero page
even more complicated is that gcc will convert malloc followed by memset 0 to calloc

43718843
comparator	comparable
if you do not specify what type of objects you want to compare leave it as it is it will default to object which it does that s from your code so you either use generics or write logic for comparator object o
in order for comparator to work you should implement the method provided by the comparable interface

43720731
lxml	elementtree
that s not really answer the question but alternatively but you can use lxml library and it s wonderful e factory method you ll get to go further you ll get introduction to lxml the lxml xml toolkit is a pythonic binding for the c libraries libxml2 and libxslt
it is unique in that it combines the speed and xml feature completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a native python api mostly compatible but superior to the well-known elementtree

43723730
implements	extends
as for what you want to accomplish you won t be able to get compilation errors for not implements the static method when extends the class but you can get runtime errors code in playground
based on your comment here s how you can achieve what you re looking for code in playground if you comment out one of the members name you ll get this error class test incorrectly implements interface config

43724978
tensorflow	cudnn
don t know if the renaming trick for 6.0 mentioned at cannot import tensorflow for gpu on windows 10
you need to install cudnn

43725777
express	node.js
express-jwt - an express middleware for jsonwebtoken cookie-parser - an express middleware to parse cookies morgan - just a log-ing service
ok so you should understand a bit of theory here passport with passport-local strategy is a statefull authentication mechanism which is supposed to save if the user is authenicated or not in a session if you restart the node.js server if you did not persist your sessions in a third party service as a database file etc.

43726052
setinterval	settimeout
in case you need to run the function execute after every 3 seconds then you need to replace the first function setinterval with settimeout
i am not sure why you need setinterval for the calling the check function

43727118
hex	binary
it s only hex when you wrote it as a literal in your source code
like every other value it is not stored on your computer in hex or in decimal but in binary

43729868
hex	binary
if i understand correctly you are trying to find a way to send binary data as python bytes objects and hex data as python bytes objects in the second part
it may be counter intuitive but pythons b syntax doesn t stand for binary but bytes hence why b 0010101 doesn t work like you want

43731325
division	modulo
better not to have to follow a branch than do an integer modulo which costs roughly as much time as an integer division
edit it turns out that the modulo is pretty slow vs

43731513
equals	compareto
refer to java doc of treemap note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
since compareto of bigdecimal maybe not consistent to equals compareto may return 0 but equals return false . use hashmap instead which consider hashcode and equals for the key

43731513
equals	compareto
since compareto of bigdecimal maybe not consistent to equals compareto may return 0 but equals return false . use hashmap instead which consider hashcode and equals for the key
refer to java doc of bigdecimal equals method compares this bigdecimal with the specified object for equality

43731513
equals	compareto
refer to java doc of bigdecimal equals method compares this bigdecimal with the specified object for equality
unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equal only if they are equal in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by this method

43733768
sudo	passwd
i used this tutorial myself step 0 create folders create folders local on all nodes sudo mkdir -p dockerlocalstorage data mongodb sudo mkdir -p dockerlocalstorage backup mongodb step 1 create keyfile create keyfile as root user and give correct permissions depending on the mount type you might need to use dockerlocalstorage to keep the certs
mongodb will complain if the permissions are not set correctly which could be harder to achieve on lets say a cifs mount step 3 setup first node create mongodb container without auth keyfile log in to container docker exec -it mongodb mongo create root users dont forget to change the passwd exit and remove the container exit docker stop mongodb docker rm mongodb step 4 start nodes change node_nr step 5 setup replication connect to node 1 docker exec -it mongodb mongo use admin db.auth root passwd

43734972
implements	extends
nowadays the same is done using extension from purecomponent export default class uiwidget extends react.purecomponent i believe the decorator is not part of react therefore it is probably implements somewhere in your project or in a dependency similar to pure-render-decorator
historically react implements that using pure-render-mixin however mixins couldn t be used with es6 classes only with react.createclass therefore alternative solutions were introduced

43735402
implements	extends
extends component class helps to implements your own shouldcomponentupdate if you need some performance gains by performing you custom comparison logic between next current props and state
there are three ways to define a react component functional stateless component which doesn t extends any class a component that extends purecomponent class a normal component that extends component class for simple presentation-only components that need to be easily reused stateless functional components are preferred

43735403
keras	tensorflow
the way ctc is modelled currently in keras is that you need to implement the loss function as a layer you did that already loss_out
your problem is that the inputs you give that layer are not tensors from theano tensorflow but numpy arrays

43735504
spaces	delimiter
how it works -p switch loop over input lines default var _ and print it -l switch chomp line ending n and add it to output -e inline command unpack function takes defined format and input line and returns an array map function apply block to each element of array regex to remove heading trailing spaces join function takes delimiter and array and gives string _ affects the string to default var for output
it seems it s not delimiter but fixed-width format

43739699
inline	inlining
if it runs into multiple definitions of a token not flagged inline it instead generates an error
this property is called inline because prior to lto link time optimization taking the body of a function and inlining it at the call site required that the compiler have the body of the function

43745059

onclick	onchange
but its a bad practice to use onclick as it add some overheads
try this details below working fiddle instead of onchange onclick is used here so that function calls on every click irrespective of whether the selection is changed or not

43758578
ionic	angular
ionic doesnt provide support for 4.4.2 see github issue key points you can use crosswalk key commands ionic browser add crosswalk when u will use this however angular date pipe will break. as per comment hello windwp
ionic 2 does not currently support the android browser although we do support chrome for android

43760691
sudo	passwd
if you were to attempt to start the server with the change above you would not successfully run server because sudo usage requires a passwd input
in order to allow sudo privileges without a required passwd entry you need to edit the sudoers file i did this under the root user b c you need permissions to change or even view this document

43762247
implements	extends
once you ve covered the above you should find that implements what you want to do is reasonably trivial and that you can ask more directed questions that will get better responses
this isn t a very specific question so that limits the answer i can give - from what you want to do i d suggest making sure you understand how the model-view-controller paradigm works in swing looking into the observer observable framework and how it fits in with mvc extends some sort of swing component to reflect changes in your model

43764807
calloc	malloc
you then re-assign pdata to point to the address of a variable with automatic lifetime in the process losing the address that calloc gave you and then try to free that
that s not how it works you have to keep a copy around of the address that was given to you by calloc to be able to free it side note use new delete in c++ instead of malloc calloc free

43765603
super	implements
if child is not supposed to support particular behavior say method then such behavior can should not be abstracted using parent super base class whatever
such abstraction will always result in empty methods in child classes or at the most they will throw not implements exceptions this is even worse

43770736
keras	tensorflow
theoretically this make senses and should be possible and it is possible with tensorflow just not keras
the problem keras requires an explicit batch size for stateful rnn

43773315
client-side	server-side
receiving e-mails is not something you can do entirely client-side
you need a server-side component to do this

43775519
ssl	https
the ssl certificate must be signed with trusted organization
the https port must be 443 not a custom port

43777343
tensorflow	cudnn
supported cards include but are not limited to nvidia titan nvidia titan x nvidia k20 nvidia k40 you can see their official docs tensorflow gpu support
the gpu-enabled version of tensorflow has the following requirements 64-bit linux python 2.7 nvidia cuda 7.5 cuda 8.0 required for pascal gpus nvidia cudnn v4.0 minimum or v5.1 recommended tensorflow gpu support requires having a gpu card with nvidia compute capability 3.0

43783842
serializable	deserialization	super	implements
verify all the modulenode super classes implements serializable interface and their serialversionids are not changed during deserialization
verify all the super classes of modulenode have empty argument constructor since the exception happened during deserialization

43784285
tensorflow	cudnn
there s an open bug report that you can follow on the tensorflow github page to find out when they start supporting cudnn 6
at this time tensorflow does not support cudnn 6

43784285
tensorflow	cudnn
at this time tensorflow does not support cudnn 6
if your error is that it cannot find libcudnn.so.5 and you have only installed cudnn 6 which provides libcudnn.so.6 you ll have to install cudnn 5 until cudnn 6 support is introduced

43784793
draggable	droppable
this is because of tolerance fit which according to the documentation fit draggable overlaps the droppable entirely
droppable widget - this still causes problems now that the clone is positioned absolutely as it s width is not calculated to be the same as the original .hexagon the original s width 20

43785589
google-chrome	firefox
i d say that firefox is correct in being stricter than google-chrome here even though i m not entirely sure the base uri has changed and this new uri should be used for the relative uri #symboltype1 too
the final word by robert longson firefox was right but the specification has changed recently . firefox 55 will reflect the new specification and ignore the base tag for urls that start with # however it s normal that both fail rendering the absolute uri in the canvas actually in the element. you can t load external resources from s content

43786615
octal	hex
also - do not be tempted to use the hex code x27 instead of the octal 047 as the hex doesn t always behave as expected see
the right way to do this is to just replace any literal s with the octal code for it 047 that s the right approach as it ll work in or out of a script file and will will work inside a regexp literal unlike using a variable to hold the quote character which would force you to use a dynamic regexp with the additional complexity that requires for some cases

43788285
octal	binary
even as per the regex patterns in oracle docs 0n is the chars with octal value 0n 0 n 7 xhh is the chars with hexadecimal value 0xhh thus your number 0101 be it in int or long format is treated as an octal representation of a number
the numbers 1010l and 0101l are not in binary representation just to avoid the confusion

43791635
implements	extends
for example say i have a task class that performs some action now to execute a task in separate thread i don t really need to extends thread class rather better choice is to make task implements runnable interface implements its run method and then pass object of this task class to a thread instance and call its start method
well technically that was possible but design wise that would have been a poor choice reason being runnable has no state associated with it and neither it offers any default implementation for the run method task would have to extends it thus it couldn t extends any other class task has nothing to offer as specialization to runnable class all it needs is to override run method in other words task class needed a capability to be run in a thread which it achieved by implementing runnable interface verses extends the thread class that would make it a thread

43794849
realloc	malloc
additionally after calling realloc to grow the block you are not currently zeroing pointers in the new memory so it doesn t provide conceptual parity with your create operation
so in your case i would argue to use malloc which will not give unrealistic expectations about the state of your unused data

43795044
keystore	jks
you cannot store secret keys in jks type keystore s
pkcs12 -- this is like a keystore but a different type called pkcs12

43795990
comparator	comparable
the recommended language is note this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals. therefore if you want your object to be comparable and yet still not allow two unknown objects to be equals via the equals method you must make your comparator inconsistent with equals. an appropriate implementation would be otherwise you could make it explicit that unknown values in particular are not comparable
the documentation for comparator mentions this situation it is strongly recommended but not strictly required that generally speaking any class that implements the comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact

43796827
equals	compareto
that s how you get the consistency. then special-case the unknown values on the left or right-hand sides and finally delegate to comparison of the id field i d recommend implementing equals so that you can do things like filter unknown values of a stream store it in collections and so forth
once you ve done that there s no reason not to make compareto consistent with equals

43797432
stateless	stateful
also if the component is stateless all the variables in it are in the local scope it is safe to store objects created from it in that scope
though if the component is stateful it stores data from previous requests or user specific data in it it is not safe to store objects created from it in the application scope because this may cause data leakage and other unexpected and unwanted results due to race conditions or incorrect access

43797817
strcpy	malloc
in case you re trying to use the memory location directly read to or write from pointed to by any pointer example destination of strcpy without any prior assigment then you need to allocate memory first
obligatory suggestions please see this discussion on why not to cast the return value of malloc and family in c

43799611
division	modulo
floor as already mentioned in the comments sympy provides a floor function which could be used to acquire an integer division as which is also how the operator for expressions is implemented however floor does not support simplifications and therefore fails the second test
criteria i assume that you want a function div that passes the following tests modulo you can realise an integer division using the modulo as follows as sympy supports modulo arithmetics and is capable of simplifying it this function passes the above tests

43801695
cloudant	couchdb
you can then backup the design documents to text files - you find more information about tools for backing up couchdb in this ibm cloudant blog post
it depends on how you made the backup but couchdb uses plain json not bson which is mongodb-specific

43805062
super	extends	implements	extends
you should not implements equals and hashcode in a super class
the reason is that when equals returns true hashcode must return same value imagine you have class point2d and class point3d extends the other

43819487
super	self
when you do that all your widget classes must be precedented with tk tk.label ... tk.frame ... ... in class number1 tk frame you should write tk.frame or simply frame if you keep your imports as they are you are using unecessarily super in super number1 self .__init__
please read the answer of bryan here best way to structure a tkinter application and replace that line by this one tk.frame.__init__ self master for the future take in consideration python s super is nifty but you can t use it regarding this line the first option to pass to tk.label and any other widgets you will create is the parent widget in your case self.master i find the 2 lines related to self.toptitle useless and i do not understand what you are trying to achieve with them besides you should not name that label that way

43820469
translation	localization
i would recommend looking into a i18n lib that is ready to be used in different frameworks i18next there is some vue libs too vue-i18next or panter vue-i18next further you should not only consider that you have to instrument your code i18n to get your app website translation
you should think about the process too - how will you solve continuous localization how you keep track of progress etc.

43820620
translation	localization
i would recommend looking into a i18n lib that is ready to be used in different frameworks i18next there is some java based lib too i18next-android as said in the beginning you should not only consider that you have to instrument your code i18n to get your app website translation
you should think about the process too - how will you solve continuous localization how you keep track of progress etc.

43820858
translation	localization
i would recommend looking into a i18n lib that has a mature ecosystem i18next there is some android lib too i18next-android it has good support for multiple plural forms too i18next-android#multiple-plural-forms further you should not only consider that you have to instrument your code i18n to get your app website translation
you should think about the process too - how will you solve continuous localization how you keep track of progress etc.

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome has its google-chrome sandbox that can also be tuned like this
safari and firefox also have sand-boxing features although i am not familiar with their particularities

43825157
calloc	malloc
2 really the only requirement that you use something that calls calloc under the covers or performs the equivalent zero-fill optimization but based on my tests more idiomatic c++ approaches like just do the allocation followed by a memset
gcc does optimize malloc followed by memset into calloc but that s not useful if you are trying to avoid the use of c routines anyway

43826063
pickle	dill
not having full language serialization limits the ability to operate in parallel computing so hopefully pickle will learn from dill how to serialize more objects
simple answer is that pickle cannot serialize most objects in python the thread.lock object included

43826063
pickle	dill
simple answer is that pickle cannot serialize most objects in python the thread.lock object included
if you want to serialize one of these objects use an advanced serialization library like dill

daemons	systemd
as of ios 10 syslog is not the primary logging daemons
some logs end up there but most end up in the new logging systemd

43828665
pyenv	virtualenv
pyenv basics and use with virtualenv the pyenv-virtualenv plugin is now built in - type pyenv commands | grep virtualenv to check
i wouldn t use the pyenv-virtualenvwrapper plugin to start with - see how you get on with pyenv-virtualenv which is more integrated into pyenv as this covers most of what virtualenvwrapper does

43828665
pyenv	virtualenv
pyenv is modelled on rbenv a good tool for ruby version switching and its only dependency is bash
pyenv is unrelated to the very similarly named pyvenv - that is a virtualenv equivalent that s part of recent python 3 versions and doesn t handle python version switching caveats two warnings about pyenv it only works from a bash or similar shell - or more specifically the pyenv-virtualenv plugin doesn t like dash which is bin sh on ubuntu or debian

43828765
serializable	deserialization
that s because you implements serializable interface in the product class and if you do not define serialversionuid in the specific class there s no guarantee that different machines use the same id also in different versions of class the autogenerated serialversionuids will also be different. actually the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details and may vary from different jvm implementation and result in an unexpected invalidclassexceptions during the deserialization process
edited read this -- serializable interface s docs if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serialization runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serialization specification

43828765
serializable	deserialization
edited read this -- serializable interface s docs if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

43828985
single-quotes	double-quotes
you have four problems though only the first is giving you the current error single-quotes are for quoting text literals not column names
in ms sql server you can quote column names using double-quotes or square brackets but you don t need to quote them at all

43832673
arraylist	treeset
just because the first elements in each treeset have ascending order in your arraylist does not necessarily mean that all elements would be sorted
you can try sorting your arraylist using a custom comparator

43833679
theano	keras
theano doesn t require anything from you if you re using keras
keras can be configured with channels first or channels last besides allowing you to define it in every individual layer so you don t have to change your data

43833802
apache	nginx
mod_perl is an apache module
it cannot be used with nginx

43844107
git-svn	svn2git
for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

43844107
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
the svn2git tool you use is based on git-svn and thus suffers from most of the same drawbacks only fixing some in the post-clone actions

43844107
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the svn2git that is based on it is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

43845073
inline	inlining
a few rules of thumb avoid large methods as those methods are often not inline into other methods even if the jvm considers this to be a good idea
this is to avoid memory overhead as inlining large methods would create a lot of duplicate code

43845339
equals	compareto
the return value 0 for compareto means the objects are equals so if and only if
treeset guarantees oredering so it uses the compare method and hashset does not so it uses the equals method

43845339
equals	compareto
treeset guarantees oredering so it uses the compare method and hashset does not so it uses the equals method
try changing the compareto method to a positive negative number instead

43850020
bash	zsh
bash dash and zsh process your .

43850259
sudo	passwd
sudo su - root # switch to root user cat .ssh id_rsa.pub # create if not already existing sudo su - ubuntu # switch back to normal user now i can pull clone from my repository without passwd authentication
so what might be a problem is that you add your ssh-key as the ubuntu user but you git clone the repository with sudo

43851602
mvp	presenter
we have a special case with mvp where the fragment needs to notify the presenter that the view has become visible and the presenter is injected by dagger in fragment.onattach
setuservisiblehint is not enough we ve detected 3 different cases that needed to be addressed onattach is mentioned so that you know when the presenter is available fragment has just been created

43852346
persistent	transient
the fields were annotated with transient so the fields are not persistent as we are using lombok the annotation hides the field from the response body takes care of the format for parsing the date on the url query parameter then i changed the way of generating the querydsl classes from jpaannotationprocessor to querydslannotationprocessor
this way fields annotated with transient are still generated on qmyentity but are not persistent

43853006
octal	decimal
as a side note 0170 is not the same as 170 0170 is actually the octal notation for the decimal 120
a zero at the beginning of an integer literal indicates that the literal is written in the octal number system

43855001
decimal	ieee
on the other hand when you are dealing with physical measurements the decimal result is itself just an approximation
i do not believe any physical quantity has been measured to the precision of ieee 754 64-bit float the commonest implementation of doubles

43855536
namedtuple	dictionary
namedtuple metaclass based default values etc. plus some built-in enums multivalueenum -- several values can map to one name not aliases noaliasenum -- names with the same value are not aliases think playing cards orderedenum -- members are order-comparable by definition uniqueenum -- no aliases allowed
not only can __prepare__ set attributes on the namespace dictionary so can the namespace dictionary itself -- and _enumdict does _member_names a list of all the attributes that should be members

43858407
bash	zsh
you can verify that the command you are trying to execute is hashed with the type command to clear the entire cache or just one entry for additional information consult help hash and man bash
i use zsh not bash and hash -d nosetests gave me an error message

innodb	myisam
innodb further boosts the performance of that pk due to clustering
i hope you are not still using myisam

43859578
memcpy	memmove	strcpy	memmove
for that you d think you could now use strcpy or memcpy however that s not possible - the strings source and destination overlap and the manual pages for both specifically state that the strings must not overlap and to use memmove instead
so you can move the contents of the string after the d to after the instead memmove andloc + 3 andloc + 5 strlen andloc + 5 + 1

in your situation the foundation library throws an objective-c nsexception as can be seen if you set an exception breakpoint lldb bt thread #1 queue com.apple.main-thread stop reason breakpoint 1.1 frame #0 0x00007fffbe5cb45d libobjc.a.dylib objc_exception_throw frame #1 0x00007fffa9855c3d corefoundation + nsexception raise format + 205 frame #2 0x00007fffab3a001a foundation + nsjsonserialization jsonobjectwithstream options error + 178 objective-c exceptions cannot be catched in swift unless you use an objective-c wrapper see for example catching nsexception in swift
evaluates the expression and returns nil if a swift error is thrown during the evaluation

43862536
bash	subshell
now even in bash your for construct s syntax is incorrect you need the arithmetic operator not subshell
presumably the shell of your cron is dash not bash

43872209
swift	objective-c
but you should be able to create such an enum by declaring the enum in obj c and then importing it into swift over the bridge
that is because objective-c enums are c-compatible enums which intentionally do not emit any reflection information about their cases

43887643
gruntjs	package.json
although gruntjs integration for papaparse does not exist its api can be utilized by configuring a custom function task inside your gruntfile.js
install papaparse via npm firstly cd to your project directory install papaparse via npm and add it to the devdependencies section of your projects package.json

43893664
unicode	ucs
i would suggest you rely on unicode properties in particular id_start and id_continue such that your .qx file contains quex then samples the ucs database and you won t have to worry about the particular code points
also if you only want to support a subset use intersection to cut out the desired ucs range as in the following example ps your solution is not totally wrong

43894922
email	dkim
best case you ll have an email from the domain that does or does not contain a dkim signature
a domain is very unlikely to have dmarc if it doesn t have dkim

43901140
bash	subshell
bash v4.2+ solution ccarton s helpful answer works well in principle but by default the while loop runs in a subshell which means that any variables created or modified in the loop will not be visible to the current shell
in bash v4.2+ you can change this by turning the lastpipe option on which makes the last segment of a pipeline run in the current shell

43904237
required	placeholder
so setting the bound property to false will remove the required validator from that control and vice versa...either way the directive effects the formcontrol.required value so binding it to a property that it changes won t really do much
the only difference is that the directive adds the asterisk to the placeholder while validators.required does not

43905929
lisp	prolog
note that lisp is functional and a lisp function can return values
this isn t the case in prolog so you need two arguments

43906764
bash	zsh
in bash and ksh as opposed to zsh - but see exception below output may arrive after the command has finished
subsequent commands may start executing before the commands in the process substitutions have finished - bash and ksh do not wait for the output process substitution-spawned processes to finish at least by default

43906764
bash	subshell
bash v4.4+ can wait for the most recently launched output process substitution with but argument-less wait does not work making this unsuitable for a command with multiple output process substitutions
however bash and ksh can be forced to wait by piping the command to | cat but note that this makes the command run in a subshell

43911213
implements	extends
because it was removed but you can easily roll out your own streamable implementation if you need it if we take the example of the strategy pattern you would then define it like so which can easily be implements based on any backing object providing a method returning a using a method reference
for example if you have a collection if collection was extends such a streamable interface you would indeed not need to use the method reference

43913374
ssl	https
i fixed by right clicking on the web service project and in the properties window not project properties setting ssl enabled to true and using the https version of the url instead in the web service call
this seemed to be due to the fact that the office add-in was using https and the web service was using http

43917042
comparator	comparable
from the sortedset documentation note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals

43920817
ubuntu	debian
fixed in version hashdeep 4.4-3 md5deep binary is missing - ubuntu 15.10 - 2015-12-11 -- 2017-03-29 binary not available in package - 16.04 - 2016-05-02 -- 2016-11-03 the program has different options and features when run with the names hashdeep and md5deep
tldr this is bug of hashdeep package since debian

43921102
udp	tcp
.sendto is only used with udp sockets that have not been connected to a particular client.
a tcp server socket is not actually used for sending receiving data

43921348
namedtuple	dictionary
this differs from dictionary equality comparisons which do take into account the keys and it may not be what you wanted nor expected from the namedtuple type
if you only have one dictionary rather than a bunch of dictionary sharing the same set of keys then there is no point to create this namedtuple in the first place

43935935
cpython	pypy
answer to the question is really depends on the use case and would also suggest you consider that different python interpreter implementations do not have the same gc behaviour as cpython
pypy in particular does not call __del__ as-soon-as an object is del -eleted or goes out of scope but some time later

43940489
ubuntu	linux
be aware that ubuntu 16.x is not supported by ephesoft you can update the installer script but i won t recommend it
i ll just switch to a supported linux os

43940601
inline	inlining
the compiler is free to inline or not a function call and might decide that after devirtualization
the inlining decision is the freedom of the compiler so inline keyword like register is often ignored to make optimizing decisions

43940601
inline	inlining
the inlining decision is the freedom of the compiler so inline keyword like register is often ignored to make optimizing decisions
the compiler often would decide to inline or not every particular call so every occurrence of the called function name

43940601
inline	inlining
but inlining does not always speed up execution time because of cpu cache and branch predictor issues and many other mysteries.... and that is yet another reason why sometimes a compiler won t inline a particular call
for gcc compiler read about inline functions and various optimization options notice that and will give different inlining decisions

43942377
google-chrome	firefox
the only odd thing is that ie11 is very slow to load but can quickly close while google-chrome is very quick to load but closing the vs2017 debugger takes ages
i m guessing this is a vs2017 bug with the new debugging functionality they have for ie and google-chrome because firefox loads and unloads quickly but doesn t have the breakpoint debugging in vs2017

43944690
client-side	server-side
i came with an idea to create a simple abstractextension based on a client-side connector that extends a specific component and listens to all click events on a page
if the target of the click was not inside of the extended component it notifies server-side connector

43945090
ssl	https
if you don t have ssl on the piwik server it can t receive https requests it will give a certificate error if it s even running on port 443
your comment suggests you don t have ssl on analytics.mydomain.com which means you need to force the code to not use https when you use protocol-relative urls like without http or http it tells the browser to call piwik with the same protocol that the original page is in

43947321
equals	gethashcode
from msdn if equals returns true for a pair of objects then gethashcode must return the same value for these objects. that is not the case in your implementation
for tuple 1 2 gethashcode produces 63 for tuple 2 1 this would be 33

43948406
vbscript	vba
as vbscript doesn t have a native function you will have to either create your own or find another workaround like a com library that will do it for you
in the past i ve used this code which has worked well originally taken from this gist which was inspired by a vba solution on stackoverflow

43949305
pthreads	fork
i note that although the #define was necessary to expose pthreads symbols the initializer was accepted by gcc 5.4.0 without problems
when i then run the program i get very similar output to what cong reports getting in a comment before fork before waitpid handler 17 handler no child processes main child 101681 exited with status 0x7f00 main no child processes after waitpid loop after fork it is curious indeed that on linux the process is sent a sigchld signal and yet wait cannot wait for it in the signal handler

43949876
pyenv	virtualenv
this is not a big issue try to use pyenv and you will be able to have a stand alone python version and if any import calls not resolved it ll search the path of the specific python installed by pyenv you used to create your virtualenv instead of the sys python path
install pyenv install specific python version use the specific python version you installed by pyenv to set up your virtualenv

43951348
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
obviously throwing the generic nullpointerexception is a really bad choice as it does not signal a contract violation in and of itself
illegalargumentexception would be a better choice

43953651
super	extends
and the changes would need to be in the super call like this manipulation outside of super of the headers property does not work
the other option in extends the baserequestoptions is to do it once in your module there used to be a way in earlier versions of angular2 where you could access the _defaultoptions object on http but it is now protected and inaccessible

43955127
margin	text-align
it s not a margin creating that space
the label above it and the button are a lot wider than they appear on the page and the label is text-align right

43956183
swift	objective-c
thanks for the answers i really liked the extension but i have not converted to swift yet
for those old schoolers still in objective-c this should help a little d happy coding

43960069
swift	objective-c
details depend on the version of swift
if you find some enum label is not imported into swift check the original source in objective-c and confirm it really has integer value 0 then replace it with init rawvalue 0

43960069
swift	objective-c
if you find some enum label is not imported into swift check the original source in objective-c and confirm it really has integer value 0 then replace it with init rawvalue 0
only one you can find is in the xcode release notes xcode 8.0 swift the none members of imported ns_options option sets are marked as unavailable when they are imported

43962207
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome firefox and edge support both xlink href and href
safari doesn t support href yet you need to use xlink href instead

43963168
n-gram	words
the query that you would want to use is this common terms query returns the relevance score based only on important terms important n-gram terms with less frequency
here the words that have a document frequency greater than 0.1 will be considered as common words and will not affect the relevance score

43963563
ionic	angular
then there is the issue that ionic is held together with cordova which is not a default import in a standard ng2 app
so there is a lot of configuration that you have to implement on top of the default angular stuff

43963826
ionic	angular
you cannot just copy angular source code into ionic project
you must rewrite your code in ionic way

43964025
decimal	ieee
as you probably know computers store numbers not in decimal but in binary format
and when it comes to floating point numbers they use ieee 754 standard

43968005
implements	extends
in my recent project i experienced the very same problem and after some research the solution which i came up with is as follows implements your custom mytheoryattribute extends factattribute along with mytheorydiscoverer implements ixunittestcasediscoverer and several custom mytestcases extends testmethodtestcase and implements ixunittestcase to your liking
your custom test cases should be recognized by mytheorydiscoverer and used to encapsulate your enumerated theory test cases in form visible to xunit framework even if values passed are not serialized natively by xunit and do not implements ixunitserializable

43968589
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome your div with class carousel-inner in style has only display block or display none
but in firefox same div in style has transform translatey some number also in firefox this div has some other extra classes that are not in google-chrome

43972468
google-chrome	safari
hope this helps edit your issue may lie with the use of flex which unfortunately has issues in safari which is marked as fixed because it used to appear in google-chrome also but was fixed in google-chrome 51
it still occurs in safari according to caniuse in safari the height of non flex children are not recognized in percentages

43972508
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
i do not know how your server works but if like a html5 audio then you should convert your file to a supported extension mp3 ogg wav or you should use another plugin
the real problem is the mediaplugin does not create an mp3 that s only an appearance

43972508
mp3	wav
the real problem is the mediaplugin does not create an mp3 that s only an appearance
so you can use wav asd or anything the mediaplugin will play it correctly

43975776
onchange	onsubmit
the onsubmit property should be given in the form and the onchange on an input element see the example below that will work for you the above code will redirect upon the onchange event so you actually do not need on submit as upon changing the page will already redirect
see below for the onsubmit example here we redirect on the form submit function

43981580
google-chrome	firefox
you could respond to keypress on document by filling in that key in the input and giving it focus if the target of the keypress isn t an input i was intrigued to find that if i didn t prevent the default setting the focus made google-chrome type the character in the input but not firefox
hence the preventdefault to keep google-chrome from doing that

43986616
namedtuple	dictionary
defining a custom class can get slightly tedious so you can try using the namedtuple type instead you still need to write the tuple - json code and iirc namedtuple both the regular version from the collections module and this typed variant are less performant then classes but perhaps that doesn t matter for your use case
mypy is correct here -- if the values in your dictionary can be strs ints or bools then strictly speaking we can t assume will always evaluate to exactly an int

43987267
factors	mean
alternatively make sure the location for the executable for sh is in the path being used by your jenkins instance which depending on other factors may or may not be the same as the system path
some examples on windows you might want sh to mean powershell

43988572
multiplying	multiplication
the minimum value to add to change the number is determined by the machine epsilon the best way to toy with the limit is not to add but to multiplying by 1+flt_epsilon amounts to add the number times flt_epsilon this prints the number unchanged
absorption ignored the multiplication

43991859
setinterval	settimeout
in any case it doesn t make sense to use setinterval from within a loop like that - it would make more sense to use settimeout which only schedules a single execution of the function you pass it
you are calling the writeit function immediately on each while iteration and passing its return value undefined to setinterval whereas setinterval expects a function reference

43992320
profiling	debugging
the best way to tell if the cost is meaningful or not is to use a profiling or similar tool to analyze where your program spends most of its time
as donald knuth wrote programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about or worrying about the speed of noncritical parts of their programs and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered

43993428
setinterval	settimeout
you will notice that once in while the counter may jump a second or may display the same number of seconds twice because setinterval does not guarantee that the calls will be exactly separated by the given delay
you could counter that effect by calculating when the next second will expire and provide that dynamic delay to settimeout
