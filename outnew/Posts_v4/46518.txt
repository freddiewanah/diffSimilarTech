decimal	ieee
the floating point representation of a decimal fraction that cannot be represented exactly may be either slightly lower or slightly higher than the original decimal fraction
if you start with 0.29 convert it to the nearest ieee 754 64 bit float and multiply by 100 you will actually get the floating point equivalent of 28.999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375 converting that to int with rounding towards zero gives 28 not 29

google-chrome	firefox
i assume you are running the examples with google-chrome and get the following error xmlhttprequest cannot load file ... data.csv
cross origin requests are only supported for http. try firefox and the example should work

14003371
svg	vml
it seems very odd to be missing given that it is supported directly and easily in the group hierarchy of svg itself.
well raphaël is not an attempt to elevate the svg specs to a javascript based api but rather to offer an abstraction for vector graphics manipulation regardless of the underlying implementation be it svg in modern browsers or vml in ie 9

14003371
svg	vml
well raphaël is not an attempt to elevate the svg specs to a javascript based api but rather to offer an abstraction for vector graphics manipulation regardless of the underlying implementation be it svg in modern browsers or vml in ie 9
thus set s are by no means representations of svg groups

14003854
fgetc	fread
fgetc is often implemented as even though fread itself may buffer 64k or 1k the system call overhead makes the difference compared to
the reason for slowness of fgetc is not the amount of function calls but the amount of system calls

14006428
awt	swing
as i understand it javafx s rendering engine is far more up to date then swing s swing relies on awt and its rendering engine which can cause issues in some edge cases - this has been a criticism of swing for a while now the reliance on awt
swing has been used in a large number of large high quality high demanding applications for a number of years and while i m sure javafx can probably meet the challenge the number of projects of the scale aren t very numerous

14006797
vsto	add-in
a vsto add-in can t create udf s so you need to create a separate add-in for the functions
although this add-in can be in the same dll as the vsto add-in you cannot communicate between the vsto and the udf s without special trickery

14007860
glfw	sdl
you may not even have to change the rendering context set up if you used a library like glfw
it s also worth mentioning things like sfml and sdl

14008006
accelerometer	gyroscope
sensors proximity ambient light ecompass battery temp accelerometer
add this line in the manifest so your app will not be filtered and if your app doesn t works without gyroscope you can add a notice in the description of the app. otherwise you say to google that is a required function to use the app and all devices are filtered according the google db

14008461
google-chrome	firefox
ie 9.0.8112.16421 - performs the same misapplication of rules as google-chrome my findings coincide with the browser compatibility chart on the first pseudo class page
that is an unknown compatibility for google-chrome and a not supported compatibility for firefox

14011197
arp	udp
if you try to send to a non existing ip on your lan you won t see any packet sent since arp will fail before your packet is even transmitted
if you re sending an udp packet to an ip address that is not known by your machine it will ask for the machine s mac address first via the arp protocol

14011197
arp	udp
if you re sending an udp packet to an ip address that is not known by your machine it will ask for the machine s mac address first via the arp protocol
if it gets a response it will send your packet to the mac address it receives if it cannot get a response about the mac address the udp packet won t be sent at all

14011771
implements	extends
to make it work you could wrap the int variable in a custom class bindableinteger that implements ieventdispatcher
another options is to use objectproxy which allows you to add eventlisteners and make an object bindable even though it doesn t extends eventdispatcher or implements ieventdispatcher

14011910
ubuntu	freebsd
but the long and short of the matter is that mysql as compiled and distributed by ubuntu 12.04 does not support using load data local infile directly from the mysql client as is
if you search the mysql reference documentation for error 1148 further down the page linked above in the comments posted by aaron peterson on november 9 2005 4 35pm with a defalut installation from freebsd ports i had to use the command line mysql -u user -p --local-infile menagerie to start the mysql monitor else the load data local command failed with an error like the following error 1148 42000 the used command is not allowed with this mysql version .

14012667
awt	swing
adding to them do not use keylistener use a keyadapter however as you are using swing and not awt you should use keybinding s for swing see here for example
dont forget to create and manipulate swing components on event dispatch thread via swingutiltities.invokelater .. block see here for more

14012669
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if you use you will not get an error as you call findviewbyid after calling setcontentview
you get an error because you try to use findviewbyid before calling setcontentview

14013018
awt	swing
so swing awt would also run in the physical machine where the webserver runs and thus definitely not in the physical machine where the webbrowser runs
basically when swing awt shows some ui it would be shown in the monitor attached to the webserver not the one attached to the webbrowser

14014284
super	self
nope - you just have to write it as class beta alpha def fie self super beta self .fie see - and quoted from there as it explains it better than i could
according to the python 2.7.2 standard library documentation super return s a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. so in the case of single inheritance it delegates access to the super class it does not return an instance of the super class

14014284
super	self
according to the python 2.7.2 standard library documentation super return s a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type. so in the case of single inheritance it delegates access to the super class it does not return an instance of the super class
in the example above this means that when you instantiate b the follow happens enter b.__init__ call super on b and call __init__ on the proxy object enter a.__init__ call super on self.__class__ and call __init__ on the proxy object the problem is that when we get to step four self still refers to our instance of b so calling super points back to a again

14015126
move	drag
i noticed that the image does not become darker until you move your finger
if you connect an action to touch drag inside and check .highlighted you should see that it has turned true again

14015896
mp3	wav
not all browsers support the mp3 or ogg format so both are usually included to insure cross-browser compatibility
the wav can also be included and unlike mp3 and ogg it supports every browser minus internet explorer

14017089
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has a native boolean type where true is represented by the string literal t and false by f there are other literals but those are the most common ones
mysql doesn t have a native boolean type and uses c-style integers for booleans instead

14018368
google-chrome	firefox
there is a css3 property for selected text selection but it does not work inside the input or textarea tags in google-chrome or safari
it only works in firefox

14018735
g++	gcc
the errors related to gcc g++ path not found will now be gone
you need a gcc g++ compiler toolchain on your windows machine for the eclipse which you have manually downloaded one of the options can be done implicit via cygwin installation by selecting proper development packages for gcc g++ and then add the location of the compiled gcc g++ package like c cygwin etc alternatives to the path variable for windows environment

14021507
strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc
that makes strdup one of the hidden malloc convenience functions and that s presumably also why it is not part of the standard library
as long as you use the standard library you know that you must call one free for every malloc calloc

14021885
printwriter	bufferedwriter
fyi opencsv wraps the writer you give it in a printwriter
after running some benchmarks with google caliper it appears that the bufferedwriter option is the fastest but there s really not much of a difference so i d just use the option that you re comfortable with

14022798
setinterval	settimeout
what i see in chrome on this page try using window.prototype instead and here is what it returns tostring webkitpostmessage postmessage close blur focus ondeviceorientation onwebkittransitionend onwebkitanimationstart onwebkitanimationiteration onwebkitanimationend onsearch onreset onwaiting onvolumechange onunload ontimeupdate onsuspend onsubmit onstorage onstalled onselect onseeking onseeked onscroll onresize onratechange onprogress onpopstate onplaying onplay onpause onpageshow onpagehide ononline onoffline onmousewheel onmouseup onmouseover onmouseout onmousemove onmousedown onmessage onloadstart onloadedmetadata onloadeddata onload onkeyup onkeypress onkeydown oninvalid oninput onhashchange onfocus onerror onended onemptied ondurationchange ondrop ondragstart ondragover ondragleave ondragenter ondragend ondrag ondblclick oncontextmenu onclick onchange oncanplaythrough oncanplay onblur onbeforeunload onabort getselection print stop open showmodaldialog alert confirm prompt find scrollby scrollto scroll moveby moveto resizeby resizeto matchmedia settimeout cleartimeout setinterval clearinterval webkitrequestanimationframe webkitcancelanimationframe webkitcancelrequestanimationframe atob btoa addeventlistener removeeventlistener captureevents releaseevents getcomputedstyle getmatchedcssrules webkitconvertpointfrompagetonode webkitconvertpointfromnodetopage dispatchevent webkitrequestfilesystem webkitresolvelocalfilesystemurl opendatabase temporary persistent constructor object
that is because settimeout is not on that list

14024340
move	drag
sounds like a bug the drag event is not called after the last move
the problem is very visible if the user move the mouse quickly

14025877
trie	dawg
typically you cannot store per-word information in a dawg the same way that you could in a trie or other data structure
the reason for this is that multiple different words in a dawg might all share nodes so there is a risk that information for one word leaks into information for other words

14026880
thin	unicorn
summary it s really hard to configure unicorn out of the box to work well or at all for everyone whereas thin can just work to get people running with fewer support requests
thin is easy to configure - not optimal but it just works in the heroku environment

14026943
icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
in a conventional network the link layer 802.3 ethernet or 802.11 wi-fi presents frames to the network layer ip icmp the network layer assembles the frames into packets which are passed on to the next layer in the stack - the transport layer the transport layer in turn passes the bytes on to the application layer
the application layer api is really what distinguishes between data streams in tcp and datagrams in udp the osi stack isn t really used in practice any longer

14027113
queue	fifo
a queue fifo generally works well for a bfs
it need not be a priority queue but it often is because giving weights is very common queues typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner

14027113
queue	fifo
it need not be a priority queue but it often is because giving weights is very common queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner
among the exceptions are priority queue which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements natural ordering and lifo queue or stacks which order the elements lifo last-in-first-out

14027437
innodb	myisam
this is because you have innodb tables with lot of rows
innodb does not store the number of rows in a table but myisam does

14027437
innodb	myisam
innodb does not store the number of rows in a table but myisam does
so for each innodb table phpmyadmin invokes query which is very slow if number of rows is very high

14027686
namedtuple	dictionary
do note that namedtuple is immutable and the values assigned on instantiation cannot be modified later
the error basically says that classes aren t meant to just store data as you re basically treating the class as a dictionary

14027756
spaces	delimiter
insert one spaces between the comment delimiter and the comment text but the default implementation of commenting in visual studio doesn t insert any spaces
one way to do it would be select the text press cntl + k c to comment ctr+e+c move the cursor to the first line after the delimiter and before the code text

14028263
persistent	transient
per jpa specification when field-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the instances variables and the persistent provider runtime accesses instances variables directly
all non-transient instances variables that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

14028263
persistent	transient
all non-transient instances variables that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent
when property-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the getter property accessors 7 and the persistence provider runtime accesses persistent state via the property accessor methods

14028263
persistent	transient
when property-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the getter properties accessor 7 and the persistent provider runtime accesses persistent state via the properties accessor methods
all properties not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

14028263
persistent	transient
all properties not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent
mapping annotations must not be applied to fields or properties that are transient or transient

14028802
google-chrome	firefox
this will work in notepad and in many other programs on windows word internet explorer google-chrome
it may work in firefox too but if it doesn t use ctrl-shift-x to set right-to-left direction in firefox

14028965
multiplying	multiplication
they may give very slightly different results in some cases. multiplying by 10 first note that for a percentage you d want to multiplying by 100 not 10
multiplying first is probably simpler than using floating point if you only want an integer result and if you know that the multiplication will never overflow

14029736
aggregate-functions	sum
in standard sql the group by clause must contain every selected value except the ones which are aggregate-functions
select a b c d sum e from table group by a -- invalid select a b c d sum e from table group by a b -- invalid select a b c d sum e from table group by a b c -- invalid select a b c d sum e from table group by a b c d -- valid the query generated by hibernate is thus invalid and afaik the only possible way to make a group by hql query work is to list every scalar column you want to select explicitely see select m.foo m.bar m.creationtime m.batchuser from manualurlbatchmodel m where m.status in status group by m.foo m.bar m.creationtime m.batchuser order by m.creationtime if your original query works with mysql it s because mysql doesn t respect the sql standard and allows queries with group by not listing every selected column

14030366
sudo	passwd
i do not recommend to use the sudo command directly in your php since you probably have to store the passwd for this somewhere which off course you do not want
you don t want to post your passwd by accident somewhere or another developer which you don t want to have root privileges to your code

14030818
jar	war
it works only if the jar containing the managed bean is in war s web-inf lib folder and thus not when the jar is in ear s lib
and that the jar has a jsf 2.0 compatible meta-inf faces-config.xml and thus not a blank one

14032074
implements	extends
you cannot implements a class extends an interface that is implements
and more generally you can implements several interfaces but only extends one class abstract class java does not have multiple inheritance

14032673
division	subtraction
so the main problem for a general solution is avoiding integer overflow either in the division or the subtraction
if we know that x and y are non-negative and n is positive then overflow and division by zero are not possible and we can confidently say that x - y n is defined

14033424
decimal	ieee
to answer your exact question the 2 is coming from a slightly different conversion of the decimal string fraction into the float format
because the fraction cannot be represented exactly it s possible that two computations will consider different amounts of precision in intermediate calculations and ultimately end up rounding the result to a 52-bit ieee 754 double precision mantissa differently

14034516
google-chrome	safari
intel mac os x 10_8_2 applewebkit 537.11 khtml like gecko google-chrome 23.0.1271.101 safari 537.11
google-chrome is hardly seeing any memory pressure from your program 1.23 mb is very low memory usage by today s standards so it probably does not think it needs to gc aggressively

14034759
google-chrome	firefox
i am using google-chrome version 23.0.1271.97 m and there are no issues with your 4 images
since google-chrome does not have in-browser image info like firefox does i inspected the image in current version of firefox via and the image specs check out ok

14038388
hex	binary
if you consider look at the coa8010b c0 in hex is equal to 192 in decimal a8 168 01 1 and 0b 11
in short this is a binary representation not a string representation of 192.168.1.11

14042429
serializable	deserialization
deserialization is essentially creating an instance of a serializable class and restoring its properties
during this process the constructor of the serializable class is not called

14047924
actionscript	mxml
it s just not how actionscript was conceived
i suppose the main reason behind this construct is that you wish to separate mxml from actionscript code or in more abstract terms separate the view from the logic

14049220
opera	firefox
opera 12.02 opera does not fire the onmouseout -fired alert or console.log message until after the onclick -fired alert and log message and you move the mouse assuming you ve moved it off of the input button element after clicking it
this seems weird but more palatable than the firefox and ie behaviors

14050719
implements	extends
you can customise claims to suit your domain and treat them as an extension to your authorisation logic - standard security properties usually only provide you only with basic information such as roles. you can of course extends this but then your doing much more work and is often difficult to implements eg
extends ad is often not so much a technical challenge but a policy constraint - admins are reluctant to modify the ad schema to accomodate a specifioc application

14050778
rar	zip
i you do not have that extension a simple command can be used instead i assume you are running on linux if not replace command with zip rar windows equivalent note make every effort to protect this file from being accessed by unauthorized users otherwise a malicious user will have a copy of your site code including config details
basically what you want to do is zip the application folder and download it fairly simple to do

14051066
factors	matrix
to my opinion the answer is a bit more complex than portrayed by natan. i think there are two factors his answer does not take into account possible necessary copies of memory when you under-estimate a matrix size and you re-allocate it all its old values should be copied to the new allocated location
continuity of memory chunks sometimes matlab is able to allocate new memory continuously at the end of the old matrix

14053401
noexcept	throw
declare it noexcept if it cannot throw an exception and the the vector implementation can use it
since your move operator can throw an exception std vector can t use it

14055813
rdf	owl
if you are getting this then your rdf file does not include this you can define this like so g.namespacemap.addnamespace prefix new uri i guess an ontologygraph should really define the owl namespace automatically i ll add this in the next release
the error message refers to the following part of your code g.createurinode owl class this uses a prefixed name as a shortcut for the full uri which requires the owl prefix to be defined in your graph

14056377
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has a few proprietary selectors to change some shadowdom elements but not all
firefox has even fewer as far as i know and opera has none

14056934
spaces	delimiter
for example this outputs both the hex values of each character as well as the text for easy lookup ps -aux | xxd -g 1 # -g 1 outputs each character individually however i think your issue is that ps -aux uses multiple spaces between the fields
cut does not handle multiple consecutive delimiter so it prints whatever s between the first and second space nothing

14057448
pascal	delphi
an example of this using pascal would be like so on the java side i guess the code would look like this bearing in mind that i know absolutely nothing about java
a delphi or freepascal string is a managed type that cannot be used as a jna type

14057662
nsmutablestring	nsstring
take into consideration to use a nsmutablestring
assign it a nsstring is immutable you can t change it s characters that s why stringbyreplacingcharactersinrange doesn t rearrange the characters but returns another string built from scratch

14057714
ubuntu	linux
and it s not defined on my system. i ve searched for open_max word match so excluding fopen_max on my ubuntu system and found the following these are obviously just brief excerpts usr include x11 xos.h usr include i386-linux-gnu bits local_lim.h usr include i386-linux-gnu bits xopen_lim.h
for what it s worth the 4th edition of beginning linux programming was published in 2007

14063665
multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtraction
addition and subtraction are the same as is the low-half of a multiplying
a full multiplying however is not

14066161
client-side	server-side
mustache-style client-side templates are portable scalable easily understood by other developers and work on all browsers even ie6
if you plan for your web application to grow big you ll be thanking yourself down the line when your page generation is offloaded to the users browser and not handled on the server-side

14067579
profiling	instrumentation
you can use sampler instead of profiling
another possibility is to define root methods and instrumentation filter so that classes instrumented by jpa are not profiled by visualvm

14068125
client-side	server-side
php is indeed a server-side application and thus cannot perform client-side validation
if you really want to do client-side validation you ll probably have to use javascript

14071186
portrait	landscape
otherwise it will go into the portrait mode but then you can t do anything about that because it doesn t support the landscape orientation in the first place
if the screen device is already in the landscape orientation then the new email activity should use it if it supports it

14071547
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
2. google-chrome and safari then made a second request to the web service now that they have the authorization details of the service.whereas firefox and ie did not prefer to make a second ajax request to the service since there was an http 500 error for the pre-flight request
hence both google-chrome and safari were able to communicate with the service

14072422
ienumerable	icollection
this may seem redundant but keep in mind that not all ienumerable implementations have a count defined
as any collection that implements icollection or icollection must specify a count property

14072808
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome stock browser on android doesn t require this
firefox mobile does

14072913
prepare	execute
an insert would look like note you could replace prepare + execute with note i m assuming is a valid table designation
i m not familiar with execute but the message says the first argument should be an identifier not a sql query

14074519
super	implements
you don t show any of your actual drawing code so its difficult to see where you might be going wrong with that but as a starting point don t call super if you ve directly overridden uiview
it s quite likely that there is some under-the-hood shenanigans going on with uiview and that the base class doesn t actually implements drawrect or some sneaky optimisation is happening

14074519
super	implements
the documentation does say not to call super if you are directly overriding uiview and it also says you don t need to implements drawrect if all you do is set a background colour or you populate the content in other ways the default implementation of this method does nothing
subclasses that use native drawing technologies such as core graphics and uikit to draw their view s content should override this method and implements their drawing code there

14075455
floating-point	fractions
usually these kind of numbers are represented using the ieee-754 floating-point format it s sort of a binary encoding
but not every fractions rational real number can be represented in binary so it may be the case that your 1.85 is actually 1.8499274 or 1.85010374 or whatever

14077633
jtextfield	jtable
use jtable instead of hundreds of jtextfield s i can get the source from an actionlistener but an actionlistener only fires when the user presses the enter key
actionlistener is fired only if enter key is pressed and for jtextfield jformattedtextfield and jpasswordfield can attach a documentlistener to the associated document of the jtextfield but there doesn t seem to be a way to get a reference to the jtextfield itself

14083018
persistent	transient
this can be more easily done by making sure an entity isn t referenced in many places until it is made persistent
if you do end up referencing a transient entity instance in various places you can make sure that its .net runtime identity remains the same for the lifetime of the instance

14083448
google-chrome	safari
i have this working through my desktop version of google-chrome and also running on mobile safari ios 6 only of course as web audio is not supported in older versions
it takes a couple of seconds to load on mobile safari vs less than 1 second on desktop google-chrome but this might be due to the fact that it spends time downloading the sound fonts

14083461
g++	gcc
if you want to -static you need to wrap it around libraries that you want to be static and let the other libraries remain dynamic otherwise gcc g++ will try and go down into every library and compile everything statically which may not be possible
see this so post static link of shared library function in gcc

14085136
uiview	calayer
specifically single uiview this approach would require you to create a calayer for each shape and then do your own hit-testing and finger-dragging when the shape is moved
this approach will perform much better if you have many shapes be sure to use an indexed lookup to do hit testing rather than an o n search since calayer s are lightweight. do not take the approach o drawing the shapes in their current location in a single uiview via a single call to drawrect

14085136
uiview	calayer
this approach will perform much better if you have many shapes be sure to use an indexed lookup to do hit testing rather than an o n search since calayer s are lightweight. do not take the approach o drawing the shapes in their current location in a single uiview via a single call to drawrect
this will perform extremely poorly especially when you are move the shapes during a drag and as you indicate is very complicated to implement well one uiview per shape this approach is very easy to program as you don t have to do the hit-testing and the touch get s sent to the shape being touched

14086662
jar	manifest.mf
in your case this does not make it the jar s main execution class
the main class is set in meta-inf manifest.mf

14087635
comparator	comparable
you can create a treemap without a comparator but then any attempt to put any keys that do not implement a natural order will throw a classcastexception
natural ordering is just the order provided by the comparable interface

14089600
vb.net	vb6
but there are exceptions two languages i know which doesn t support short circuit evaluation are microsoft vb 6 and vb.net
vb6 doesn t support it at all so here nesting if s if common optimization technique. moreover in expressions like if not rs is nothing and not rs.eof not using nesting if s gives execution error while rs is nothing

14093926
equals	compareto
it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals
this means that if you just compare x variable then two different datapoint objects with same x will be considered equal with respect to compareto

14094833
jar	manifest.mf
this does not make it the jar s main execution class however
the main class is set in meta-inf manifest.mf

14100841
ng-view	ng-include
ng-view is not going to help you here
instead you should combine ng-include with ng-switch or ng-show

14102328
phpstorm	aptana
an ide i know of that does this is phpstorm which is very good with the static code analysis part
afaik aptana and also other eclipse php editor plugins like pdt do not report undefined variable warning notices for the problems view

14104003
arp	icmp
go back to 2 if you don t see an arp request for x n+1 is the subnet searched
one flaw might be that a overambitious network stack implementation might learn the mac from the incoming icmp request but i personally do not know of any end-device stack that works this way

14104551
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
in general the rules are simple and as follows argument constraint violations must be indicated as fast as possible - fast fail in order to avoid illegal states which are much harder to debug in case of an invalid null pointer for whatever reason throw nullpointerexception in case of an illegal array collection index throw arrayindexoutofbounds in case of a negative array collection size throw negativearraysizeexception in case of an illegal argument that is not covered by the above and for which you don t have another more specific exception type throw illegalargumentexception as a wastebasket on the other hand in case of a constraint violation within a field that could not be avoided by fast fail for some valid reason catch and rethrow as illegalstateexception or a more specific checked exception
never let pass the original nullpointerexception arrayindexoutofbounds etc in this case

14104551
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
never let pass the original nullpointerexception arrayindexoutofbounds etc in this case
there are at least three very good reasons against the case of mapping all kinds of argument constraint violations to illegalargumentexception with the third probably being so severe as to mark the practice bad style 1 a programmer cannot a safely assume that all cases of argument constraint violations result in illegalargumentexception because the large majority of standard classes use this exception rather as a wastebasket if there is no more specific kind of exception available

14107317
implements	extends
a lower bound is only specified in the wildcard usage jls#4.5.1 good question that got me digging in the jls and i don t know why this not implements in java it is just not specified
according to the jls a type parameter the t extends object term consists out of optional you see the typebound there is only the usage of extends specified. unfortunately a lower bound type parameter using super is not specified

14109185
implements	extends
if you want to share code among all vehicle instances then you can use a possibly abstract class as a parent for any classes that need to implements that interface
java interfaces cannot extends classes which makes sense since classes contain implementation details that cannot be specified within an interface

shadowing	named
you can see this in the traceback the preceding module has a full filepath but the new.py file does not making it a local file that is shadowing the relative import in scipy.stats.distributions
you have a local file named new.py

14111531
n-gram	words
n-gram will also fit right in with your approach if you are using tf-idf weighting
include all of the words and let the svm decide which are useful - the classifier needs to be able to distinguish between the positives and negatives and negatives can also be characterized with words that are not in your target domain porn thus making the split between the examples potentially clearer

14112196
libstdc++	libc++
boost spirit wants the c++11 header which is a different header though they do contain some similar functionality in different namespaces. the problem is probably that you re using the libstdc++ that comes with apple s ancient version of gcc 4.2 which doesn t support c++11
if you want to use c++11 you either need to use clang with libc++ or install a newer gcc to get a newer libstdc++

14112684
required	placeholder
although mysql ext do not support native prepared statements they aren t required for the safety
we can easily fake prepared statements using manually handled placeholder just like pdo does voila everything is parameterized and safe

14113115
oncreate	setcontentview
the not working well oncreate of the activity is the following black screen during 5 seconds and after can see the ui no exception thrown the layout is only displayed after onresume is called so by blocking the ui thread in oncreate you have created the blank screen
then when the thread resumes both layouts are drawn but you ll never see the splash screen since the next setcontentview is called a few milliseconds later

14113394
mp4	webm
2 must reads - the quickest way to convert a mp4 to webm without software is to upload it to youtube once the video is there copy the link and go to keepvid.com then download the webm
remember the highest quality webm file is not always optimal do to the size of mobile devices and slow internet connections planetwide

14116212
scheme	racket
notice that not all scheme implementations allow an if without the alternative part as suggested in the other answers - for instance racket will flag this situation as an error
in racket you can explicitly write void to specify that a procedure returns no useful result check if this is available in mit scheme

14117781
variance	kurtosis
there are two errors 1 as flodel points out you need central moments not raw moments this won t make much difference for point estimates of the moments but it does make a difference for estimates of their variance
2 there is a bug in the computation of the kurtosis when using all.moments

14124340
gif	png
it s best not to use gif at all yes even for anims
png no it hurts compression as data from each pass is statistically quite different

14125791
super	implements
if a subclass is initialized but doesn t implements +initialize whatever super up the chain will have theirs called again
orthogonally automatic kvo is implements by creating dynamically derived subclasses of the class of the observed instance

14126316
mp4	h.264
update as of version 0.1.0 jcodec supports h.264 encoding here s a simple class that you can use to turn your sequence of images into an h.264 video in mp4 container update 1 use this code to convert from interleaved yuv 4 2 0 byte array to jcodec picture
jcodec does not support encoding of h.264

14128125
serializable	deserialization
first we need to create a special class that inherited from observablecollection within this class we need to add a method that allows us to add a range of records in this case in list form and indicate that we do not want notifications to occur while we are adding the records finally we need to override the collectionchanged-related elements and either suppress or manually execute the associated events finally we need to change the implementation inside graphviewmodel slightly in order to suppress the serializable of the foocollection and add a serializable list properties
the deserialization speed is most likely due to the events that the observable collection raises

14130540
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode is a first check for the more expensive check equals your equals method has an error should be also if the list or the array type you re using isn t of type you also need to override the equals method
the distinct method works as follows check if the two objects has the same hash code using gethashcode

14131664
factors	matrix
for a push_back function to not be prohibitively expensive it must increase the matrix s capacity by some factors when it runs out of space as you have done
however when dealing with matrix memory usage is often a concern so having a matrix s capacity be larger than necessary could be problematic

14132768
google-chrome	firefox
in ie safari and google-chrome you can do the following
it is not possible in firefox

14134613
daemons	systemd
java language specification says that program exit a program terminates all its activity and exits when one of two things happens all the threads that are not daemons threads terminate
some thread invokes the exit method of class runtime or class systemd and the exit operation is not forbidden by the security manager

14135622
textview	imageview
you can align the image around textview using setcompounddrawableswithintrinsicbounds now just two line in your activity
this is how i ve done it your gridview.xml now your gridview items xml now i made an adapter class which set the image and text you do not need to include imageview

14136235
gtk	gdk
there is no gtk.gdk in gtk 3 all of that functionality or its equivalent must be available using from gi.repository import gdk
the previous gtk.gdk hierarchy was actually for convenience but didn t make any sense because gdk is a completely independent package and is not part of gtk

14138000
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome it can be done it is just not as easy and straightforward as firefox profile manipulation is
since the webdriver bindings expose the ability to add in custom abilities and command line parameters you can give it any of the command line switches that google-chrome knows about with this we can give google-chrome a profile to load just as you do with firefox

14139095
translation	localization
so in your case no german translation files are available but that doesn t mean that the program can t continue working
because that s how localization generally works

14139223
google-chrome	firefox
demo try before buy the demo will run in safari and google-chrome only
ie and firefox seem to not fire autofocus in an

14140609
implements	extends
abstract class has no property _template and your _tohtml method does not implements template output
you need to extends from mage_core_block_template class

14141649
hex	binary
other times it deals with bit comparisons as my statement in a comment 4 bits binary digits convert to 1 hex letter so a3 10100011
other times it s either fun or breaks the monotony though people not familiar with hex may think that you are doing things with pointers i sometimes use it to check bounds of things like ints

14143470
ienumerable	icollection
you can not remove an item from an ienumerable
it can only be enumerated as described here you have to use an icollection if you want to add and remove items

14145242
primefaces	richfaces
while my answer isn t 100 applicable but most search engines find this as the first hit i decided to post it nontheless if you re using primefaces or some similar api p commandbutton or p commandlink chances are that you have forgotten to explicitly add to your command components
as the primefaces user s guide states in section 3.18 the defaults for process and update are both form which pretty much opposes the defaults you might expect from plain jsf f ajax or richfaces which are and respectively

14145502
archetypes	dexterity
register the view for dexterity containers too the view is registered for the archetypes folder interface products.cmfcore.interfaces._content.ifolderish but your dexterity container does not provide this interface but plone.dexterity.interfaces.idexteritycontainer . the reason may be that the product and or the view is not compatible with dexterity
anway you can try it out yourself by registering the view also for the the idexteritycontainer interface by putting a little zcml in the configure.zcml in your package see also the creating a package section of the dexterity developer manual the is copied from the collective.documentviewer configure.zcml but i ve changed the interface to the dexterity container interface so that the view also works for dexterity containers

14147211
thin	unicorn
this unfortunately only applies to thin as rack does not have built-in support for unicorn and others
for servers that have rack handlers again sadly unicorn does not you can do a bit of a hack to get rails server to use them

14147211
unicorn	webrick
for servers that have rack handlers again sadly unicorn does not you can do a bit of a hack to get rails server to use them
in your scripts rails file in the root of your rails project you can add the below just above require rails commands this essentially resets the handler for webrick to point to the handler for the server you would like to use

14150796
http	spdy
you can t use haproxy s http load balancing mechanism with spdy
first you need to use the latest development branch to enable support for npn and hence spdy and after that you will have to configure it to run closer to simple tcp load-balancing mode -- haproxy does not understand spdy

14151035
sudo	passwd
execute the command visudo and enter either of following if you use the first one then when you execute the script with sudo command it will prompt for apache user s passwd
but with the second one it will not even prompt for a sudo passwd

14152198
webclient	webrequest
edit here s the example code for webrequest because it appears that you need to specify the timeout value which is not possible with webclient
the main task of post would be quite simple if you use webclient class

14153297
lxml	libxml2
if you didn t use pip re-doing the manual sudo python setup.py install from a clean copy of the tarball or re-doing the sudo easy_install lxml or doing a sudo pip install lxml over top of what you already have will probably work but that isn t guaranteed
if i m wrong about lion coming with decent libxml2 please say so in a comment and i ll give you the options for getting it without reinstalling macports

14156071
opera	firefox
by the way if i m not wrong opera have another problem with the size too
i m not sure why firefox do this but i always come across this problem and the last time my solution was to set border none

14156388
onclick	onchange
in your example alert interrupts the program flow breaking handling of onclick
this code jsfiddle here demonstrates that onchange does not interfere with onclick by default i had a similar problem but the actual reason that the onclick event was not handled was that the element being clicked scrolled down as a result of the onchange handler

14156676
prepare	execute
and even though ci doesn t support prepare statements it does support query bindings
with prepare statements you have to call some type of prepare function and then some type of execute function

14157484
super	extends
btw you should call super in constructor of your class which extends jdialog not in some other method
i think this can cause a problem super new jframe please select a record...

14157680
ubuntu	debian
then we use chmod apparently it doesn t pose any security threat as the system fixes it by itself sudo chmod 666 dev bus usb 00x 00y for me for instance it was sudo chmod 666 dev bus usb 001 003 then follow the instructions given to you by the german guy volker - the link you cited . on my side i was running ubuntu 12.04 debian bro so i could use the fingerprint ppa
i don t know if ubuntu ppa s work on debian

14159673
stateless	stateful
1 i reject the premise that modern web application should be stateless and i would like to see some citations for that statement
you can achieve scalability in a stateful application same as you can build a stateless application that doesn t scale at all

14160749
google-chrome	firefox
this will horizontally align the checkboxes. see also text-align right has margin or buffer in google-chrome adjust the width of both input elements in that form to 1em
google-chrome seems to automatically expand the width of these to the available space in the container while firefox does not

14160809
cypher	gremlin
in my projects i typically use gremlin and then call cypher from within gremlin or not when i need tabular results or expressive pattern matching- both are a pain in the gremlin dsl
the neo4j team s efforts on cypher have been really impressive and it s come a long way

14163010
implements	extends
now if you want to use the instance of childclass by the implements interface ichildclass like then you cannot call obj.somemethod
then you need to do this you can find in java 1.2 documentation the the interface java.util.list doesn t extends java.util.collection which it does in the latest version

14164507
realloc	malloc
most code i have seen doesn t correctly handle failure of realloc
allocate the block using malloc not new and then use realloc

14164507
realloc	malloc
allocate the block using malloc not new and then use realloc
realloc knows how much free space is available after the block for expansion

14164598
realloc	malloc
the first option also implies copying if realloc finds that there is not enough free space after the block
even if you used malloc for allocating the array which is the only correct option to use realloc at all. however if you double the size of the array on each reallocation or multiply its size by a constant 1 the operation increase array by one uses constant time on average

14165942
super	self
it finds c.__init__ and therefore super d self .__init__ calls c.__init__ self
notice that super is not trying to access getattr b __init__

14167448
union	distinct
sqlfiddle demo code select one as val from saturday_combinations where one is not null order by one desc limit 4 union select two as val from saturday_combinations where two is not null order by two desc limit 4 union select three as val from saturday_combinations where three is not null order by three desc limit 4 if answer to my comment is no then please clarify
here is the code based on your sample date select distinct x.one as uniqunumbers count x.one as counts from select distinct one as col1 one from sat_comb union all select distinct two as col1 two from sat_comb union all select distinct three as col1 three from sat_comb as x group by x.one

14167680
super	self
one common pattern for object initialization is to define a new method for the class which looks like this new super new initialize this pattern depends on initialize returning self
it s not normal however to add a self at the end of an initialize method

14168190
draggable	droppable
an alternative solution is to move the already dropped draggable back to its starting position before appending the draggable being dropped fiddle you just have to take care to not erase a draggable unintentionally
when you move the droppable a little bit after it is already placed in the drop target and it loses draggability it is because of in the drop handler the draggable is still inside the drop target

14169247
uiview	calayer
unfortunately there is no way to do a non-composite blend between uiview on ios
uikit doesn t provide the functionality and you ve already noted calayer can t do it either

14170292
jlabel	jlayeredpane
why not simply add a jlabel using an appropriate layoutmanager to position it with the inbuilt swing warning icon uimanager.geticon optionpane.warningicon like so see here for more
update as per your comment i would rather use glasspane and add jlabel to glasspane for this as opposed too jlayeredpane

14171433
lxml	libxml2
from the lxml documentation on parsing broken html the support for parsing broken html depends entirely on libxml2 s recovery algorithm
it is not the fault of lxml if you find documents that are so heavily broken that the parser cannot handle them

14171611
persistent	transient
the easiest solution would be to add a persistent attribute sectionnumber to your entity and use that for sectionnamekeypath and for the first sort descriptor
if you want an frc with sections you have to add a sort descriptor to the fetch request and that sort descriptor cannot be based on transient attributes

14173712
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
edit to further expand my answer which allows painting on the qgraphicsview for other purposes it s the viewport which needs to receive the update redraw not my qgraphicsview object
after looking through the qgraphicsscene api i found an easy workaround for having to manually manage the selection box the drag mode needs to be set to rubberbanddrag

14173806
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
i do not see a reason for realloc -ing a scalar
there is a vitally important requirement to non- null pointers that you pass to realloc they must themselves come from a call to malloc calloc or realloc otherwise the behavior is undefined

14173860
realloc	malloc
if you call realloc with an invalid pointer one which was not obtained from malloc calloc or realloc then you get undefined behaviour
you could pass realloc an integer pointer to an allocated space of sizeof char bytes 1 byte but you d be in danger of invoking undefined behaviour

14176467
gtk	cairo
have your gtk button open an soegtk window with the graphics of interest learn a different drawing library say cairo or diagrams
no there s not a really meaningful way for soegtk and regular gtk to interact

14176905
udp	tcp
udp is not very well.
may be you can use tcp check tcp stats of s.o

14176989
floating-point	fractions
but keep in mind that floating-point actually stores values in binary not decimal
for example the value 0.01 cannot be stored exactly as a binary fractions any more than 1.0 3.0 can be stored exactly in decimal

14178905
implements	extends
your first problem has to do with the fact that you did not implements onclicklistener and instead casted your click class into an onclicklistener
modify your code as follows first the class declaration public class click extends activity implements onclicklistener then change button1.setonclicklistener onclicklistener this

14179160
factors	mean
the same estimate for your macbook gives a frequency of at least 1e9 2.7 hz so roughly 370mhz of increments - factors in os overhead an the fact that the loop needs the extra increment the jump and the comparison this works out fairly close to your processor freq so i would guess that your compiler for the mac program actually keeps the loop.
the relevant technical explanation has been given by andreyt but here is a quick and dirty estimate that helps looking in the right direction suppose the arduino actually managed 1 billion 1e9 increments in roughly a millisecond 730 microseconds and disregard the extra increment and check for the loop counter as well as the jump instruction that would mean that the arduino can process increments at a frequency of at least 1e12 hz which is 1000 ghz note that this is an estimate for the frequency of processed increment instructions which is not necesserily equivalent to cpu frequency but a fairly okay estimator in the absence of any other information

14179604
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome win mac safari win mac firefox win and ie8 by the way the issue of the span.click event i encountered on firefox and safari could be solved by using the triggerhtmlevent function above i haven t tried it though
mogelbrod i used your code above and it worked perfectly on google-chrome tried it on firefox and safari did not work

14181856
kombu	celery
kombu takes care of the whole messaging between consumers producers and the message broker which in order are the celery workers webworkers or more in general scripts that put tasks in the queue and the message broker you are using
you need kombu to run celery it is actually in the requirements if you look at its setup with kombu you can use different message brokers rabbitmq redis ... so the choice is not between using kombu or rabbitmq as they do different things but between kombu and redis or kombu and rabbitmq etc etc

14183044
multiplying	modulo	division	modulo	division	exponent
the division probably doesn t work because you use integer division instead of multiplying with the modular multiplicative inverse of the right side
you re using math.pow base exponent modulo for modular exponentiation

14183778
serializable	deserialization
if the view scoped bean is serializable all transient fields are skipped
jsf doesn t reinject managed properties after deserialization so you end up with a view scoped bean without a session scoped bean property which will only cause npes

14184058
jar	war
use the maven jar plugin to set the main-class in the manifest and then write a main method with something akin to this or that calls into code like this you can register your servlets and wire up the webapp accordingly
the issue with bundling a war file proper inside of a jar file is that you would need a specialized deployer that understands deploying a war file from within a jar not a common thing

14184058
jar	war
the issue with bundling a war file proper inside of a jar file is that you would need a specialized deployer that understands deploying a war file from within a jar not a common thing
so creating an uber type jar is probably the better way to go

14184344
spaces	delimiter
note there s an actual spaces after the dash. notes the slashes above are not part of the regex you won t have to type them
they serve as a visual delimiter here

14185278
photoshop	fireworks
however in order to have an exact replication of a layered fireworks png in photoshop it s necessary to export that layered png as a flattened png
thus opening it in photoshop and flattening it is not the solution

14185278
photoshop	fireworks
thus opening it in photoshop and flattening it is not the solution
the solution lies in opening it and flattening it in fireworks

14185855
inline	inlining
this is the only pertinent use of the keyword inline in fact - actually inlining functions is up to the compiler.imo the keyword is even less than a hint in that sense
inline tells the compiler not to export the symbol

14186368
uiview	subviews
you re trying to add a subviews to something that isn t a uiview - in your display method s context self refers to an object of type fraction
if fraction doesn t have a uiview property called view and doesn t inherit from one that does such as uiviewcontroller there is no reason for it to recognise what you re trying to do there

14189393
addition	multiplication
a thought experiment is to consider implementing it using repeated addition and consider what happens when it overflows
since the order of doing additions doesn t affect the result with int s even with overflows then neither does doing the multiplication as repeated additions in a different order

14192124
glut	lwjgl
regarding primitive geometry creation- i wouldn t bother to look into glut in such a case.those are made using old deprecated fixed opengl pipeline.today is 2013 and opengl is currently on 4.3 version and if you want to be synchronized with the current state of this technology and benefit from many new capabilities in opengl i would strongly recommend moving forward to opengl 3.3 onward.doing this you need to code geometry manually.but there are many other benefits you gain like a total control over the way your rendering pipeline works.also there are many online examples and tutorials on how create geometry for the programmable opengl. hope it helps
what about jogl or lwjgl .their apis are 1 1 to c++ glut.if you use the fixed pipeline you also have glu lib with all you need inside.i didn t work with jogl seriously because i didn t like the way it manages contexts and windows but i did do commercial projects with lwjgl and can tell this lib is fantastic.also you can use it for mobile development

14192581
mp4	webm
as you see in the code i suggest you to create the video not only in mp4 format but also ogg and webm
format compatibility internet explorer 9+ supports mp4 but not webm and ogg

14192581
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 6+ supports all the three formats
firefox 3.6+ supports webm and ogg but doesn t support mp4

14192581
firefox	safari	mp4	webm
firefox 3.6+ supports webm and ogg but doesn t support mp4
safari 5+ supports mp4 but doesn t support webm and ogg

14192581
mp4	webm
safari 5+ supports mp4 but doesn t support webm and ogg
opera 10.6+ supports webm and ogg but doesn t support mp4

14196752
octal	binary
since binary is not very compact octal was invented
in octal the 00001010 binary value would be 012

14196752
octal	hex	octal	binary
in octal the 00001010 binary value would be 012
but most computer words are some multiple of 8 bits and octal does not evenly represent multiples of 8 bits so hex hexadecimal was invented

14196752
octal	hex
but most computer words are some multiple of 8 bits and octal does not evenly represent multiples of 8 bits so hex hexadecimal was invented
in hex 00001010 is represented as 0a

14197211
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
error and runtimeexception are both unchecked-exception and so are all their subclasses
you will note that all three classes extend throwable and the javadoc for throwable states that for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions throwable and any subclass of throwable that is not also a subclass of either runtimeexception or error are regarded as checked exceptions

14197211
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
you will note that all three classes extend throwable and the javadoc for throwable states that for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions throwable and any subclass of throwable that is not also a subclass of either runtimeexception or error are regarded as checked exceptions
classical examples of in famous unchecked-exception outofmemoryerror extends error

14199884
gitolite	gitosis
note gitolite does no access checking when you do this
the don t panic page can help for gitolite v3 not the old obsolete gitosis lost admin key access if you lost your gitolite admin key or access here s what you do

14202069
innodb	myisam
if you are using innodb if you are using innodb since you verified the row was inserted it should have been returned with the select as long as the select was querying the key of the actual row that was inserted
that could prevent the row from being returned. if you are using myisam since myisam doesn t support transactions the select should return the insert but i cannot find anything that states this is actually guaranteed

14204143
scheme	racket
update in addition chez scheme has recently been open sourced it may not be as small as larceny but it has a very aggressive optimizing compiler.
i do recommend racket to new-comers since it provides one of the nicest ide s for scheme beginners or rather programming beginners who happen to be using scheme or better still working their way through htdp

14205068
implements	extends
it only defines behavior specifies which methods the implements class must implements
you cannot have a class extends from more than 1 class

14207243
dbcontext	objectcontext
the generated context is also based newer dbcontext api instead of objectcontext api used by visual studio 2010 that is the reason why it doesn t have the method - the equivalent method in dbcontext api is
both t4 and dbcontext api are currently recommended approach for using ef

14207424
ssl	https
https is enabled configured outside of your servicestack service web application layer so servicestack itself doesn t require any special attention when enabling ssl
setting up https on servicestack is the same as any other iis asp.net or httplistener application

14207984
glut	sdl
sdl provides all the facilities that glut does but generally better
you can use the event queue sdl provides for input and not glut s keyboard function

14207984
glut	sdl
you can use the event queue sdl provides for input and not glut s keyboard function
second i m pretty sure that attempting to use any glut functions without calling glutinit argc argv will cause it to hard shut down the program

14208236
implements	extends
the abstract button is a framework-provided class that implements some but not all behaviors of a button
most likely you won t ever have to extends it

14210963
namedtuple	dictionary
you can either use a dictionary like michael proposes but then you need to access the contents of v with which is a little cumbersome or you can use the equivalent of c++ s struct a namedtuple this is similar to but simpler than defining your own class etc
note however as volcano pointed out that the values stored in a namedtuple cannot be changed a namedtuple is immutable

14217809
decimal	ieee
if your decimal number calculations require precision use java.math.bigdecimal
double and float in java are internally represented as binary fractions and can therefore be not precise in representing decimal fractions ieee standard 754

14220574
factors	matrix
in this case the sin and cos factors of + - pi 2 end up being + - 1
if matrix multiplication isn t your thing draw on paper or just imagine a sample vector in any quadrant

14220833
super	implements
in java 5.0 override could only be placed on methods overriding a method defined in a super class not one declared in an interface
in java 6+ you can place override on implements and overriding methods

14223901
zsh	subshell
zsh will wait for second-script to finish so you may continue script right after vim command in case information from second-script is not needed it would be hard to get from there
second script will be launched from a subshell

14224875
super	self
as noted in comments with 3.x you do not need to include the arguments to super you can just use super .__init__ param1
here is the proper way to handle a scenario like this class item object def __init__ self param1 # do something with param1 class itemchild item def __init__ self param1 param2 param3 param4 super itemchild self .__init__ param1 # do something with params note that item inheriting from object is important because super only works with new-style classes

14226533
apache	nginx
apache defaults to one thread or process per connection so even if the threads aren t doing very much as is expected with an sse connections they sit there using up resources
servers like nginx have a slightly different model each thread handles multiple requests asynchronously

14226538
punctuation	words
to split a line into an array of words use this the regex means not a words char or an apostrophe this will capture words with embedded apostrophes like can t and skip over all punctuation
edit a comment has raised the edge case of parsing a quoted words such as this as this

14226684
inline	inlining
operators are similar - they may or may not be inline
since the compiler can t be forced to inline there are probably no strong reasons to use or avoid using inlining hints

14227853
codeigniter	cakephp
there are not much new improvement done in codeigniter
to take advantage of the new php 5.3 i would recommend you to use cakephp instead

14229045
libstdc++	libc++
also you should use the libc++ library instead of the default libstdc++
the included version of libstdc++ is quite old and therefore does not include c++11 library features

equals	compareto
what is special about bigdecimal is that even if the type is the same and the values are equivelent but have different scales they are still not equals prints 0.0 equals 0 is false 0.00 equals 0.0 is false 0.00 equals 0.00 is true 0.00 equals 0.000 is false the way around this is to use compareto which adjusts for the scale and gives you a more natural comparison
system.out.println bd2 + compareto + bigdecimal.zero + is + bd2.compareto bigdecimal.zero

14234295
sudo	passwd
if not something like sudo etc init.d mysql start should sort you out
edit your edit suggests you are definitely using the wrong passwd

14237031
webclient	webrequest
if the form isn t very complicated then you might just try using webclient to post to the url and read the results
use webrequest if things are a little more complicated

14242148
comparator	comparable
if you want to call the comparator wtv method of your parent classes then you have to do super.compareto wtv inside any other subclass methods
it doesn t matter that you are casting your bobo object to polarbear animal or comparable the run-time type of the object will always be polarbear since you instantiated it as therefore whenever you call .compareto wtv it ll call the polarbear implementation

14242585
google-chrome	safari
the behavior of safari and ie on this is the same as google-chrome s v8 s
from v8 google-chrome javascript engine bug tracker not a bug

14242585
google-chrome	firefox
from v8 google-chrome javascript engine bug tracker not a bug
firefox is the only browser that does what you re expecting

14244533
config	ini
reason why it is happening is because on exit mc will overwrite ini with current config and your changes are lost
when you edit .mc ini file or .config mc ini in newer versions it is important to not edit it from within mc itself using mcedit

14244931
mockito	jmockit
8.1.1.2 final classes of the java language specification 8.4.3.3 final methods of the jls 4.10 of the java virtual machine specification that mockito cannot bypass means mockito isn t currently able to overcome final classes or final methods in order to mock them because at moment mockito uses cglib to generate subclasses of the type to mock
but other frameworks like powermock or jmockit may be able to do it as they have other strategies to overcome this

14245694
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this does not include some versions of opera and many mobile web browsers
however this method of redirection is discouraged by the world wide web consortium w3c . 7 tested with google-chrome and firefox

14246185
prepare	execute
it would be a lot better if you used a prepare statement and supplied the start and end date as parameters for this query
if you use pdo it would look something like this this way you can be sure there will be no messing with your query and it also will be execute faster as the query parser doesn t have to evaluate whether your variables contain any sql syntax

14248134
union	distinct
note nested types and functions cannot be declared within an anonymous union
end note the names of the members of an anonymous union shall be distinct from the names of any other entity in the scope in which the anonymous union is declared

14248478
strcpy	malloc	strncpy	malloc
the answer to why it doesn t work is - you should use either strcpy after ensuring that the element in valid_words can hold up to maxsize characters or use strncat nb not strncpy after ensuring that the first really zeroth character in the element in valid_words that you are inserting is 0
some observations assuming maxsize is a #define d constant this is better - than the malloc calls that you have by the way sizeof char is one by definition. likewise you are better off changing the last parameter of checkfile to and thus changing the arguments in all the calls to checkfile

14249744
uiview	uiwindow
this is also not as nice as option #1 because you don t get a uiviewcontroller just a uiview
the most extreme approach is that you can create another uiwindow and give it a higher window level such as uiwindowlevelalert and put your touchdisplay view in that

14252074
hash-collision	key
hash-collision happen when two key result in the same hash hence they get put into the same bucket a good hash function is one that distributes the key evenly into a number of buckets hence improving key searching performance
by design hashtable is not meant to store duplicate key

14252092
super	implements
you cannot instantiate a class which has unimplemented abstract methods from super classes or interfaces
the only objects of type list you will be using will be types which actually implements list like arraylist linkedlist etc

14252386
hash-collision	key
the signature is not so what you have created is a hash-collision where two objects have the same hash code key but they are not equal according to the equals method because your signature is wrong it s still using the operator and not your this.key h.key code
as opposed to a key collision where the objects both have the same hashcode and are also equals as in your first example

14253094
wordpress	joomla
if not this article will guide you through the process of creating your own wordpress plugins
joomla usually refers to a module

14253693
implements	extends
delegates or protocols respectively may be an option or extends an existing class without implements a subclass
quite unique to objective-c if i am not much mistaken however in general it may not be a good idea to extends or subclass uitableview although it can be done

14253931
glfw	lwjgl
lwjgl supports fbos but glfw is just for cross-platform setup of opengl and not for rendering
for convenient cross-platform fbo usage i d recommend to use a library like oglplus on top of glfw

14254983
implements	extends
and then to extends the boxobserver protocol and implements any of these callback methods that you are interested in please remember to remove your object from the observers before you expect your object to be deallocated because observers are currently retained.
we have the same problem but we manage to get the answer for this although we did not try to implements it yet

14255898
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
numberformatexception extends runtimeexception which is an unchecked-exception that does not need to be caught
excerpt from the java tutorial because the java programming language does not require methods to catch or to specify unchecked-exception runtimeexception error and their subclasses programmers may be tempted to write code that throws only unchecked-exception or to make all their exception subclasses inherit from runtimeexception

14256105
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
numberformatexception extends runtimeexception and therefore it is one of the unchecked-exception classes and doesn t have to be catched or thrown be the method
from the java language spec the unchecked-exception classes are the runtime exception classes and the error classes

14259787
thin	unicorn
when ruby is not installed in the location usr bin ruby you need give a full path of ruby which means you need to use command like follows full path to ruby etc init.d thin start hope this also works for you
i got the some error when using sudo gem install unicorn and find a solution here

14260078
clang	llvm
so bottom line if you re very careful you can use llvm ir across multiple platforms but not without doing significant additional work which clang doesn t do to abstract over the abi differences
llvm ir can be cross-platform with the obvious exceptions others have listed

14261162
octal	hex
yes you can do it relatively easily four octal digits always convert to three hex digits so you can split your string into groups of three hex digits and process each group from the back
if you do not have enough hex digits to complete a group of three add leading zeros

14261177
concave	convex
otherwise decompose your concave shape into a set of disjoint convex shapes and sum their volumes
if your shape isn t too complicated you can compute the volume of its convex hull and subtract the volumes of all the convex hulls of its concavities

14261621
uiview	subviews
and later on i can change it up by doing this now i ve got a reusable class rather than 12 uiview instances floating around my nib with various settings and properties
the problem here is that my uiview master does not layout it s subviews automatically when the device rotates and the springs struts layout method used to position the image and interior uiview was inefficient

14261880
implements	extends
you can find the types that extends the protocol by looking at the impls key in the protocol map the second case directly implements a protocol via deftype or defrecord is more difficult because what s happening is the java class generated for the type or record will directly implements the java interface defined by the protocol you can implements any java interface in a deftype or defrecord not just a protocol
any approach to find types that extends a protocol in this manner is going to require some deal of scanning and reflection

14262903
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in 1 you are assigning a destinationviewcontroller type uiviewcontroller to an object of type uitabbarcontroller
this is compiler-legal uitabbarcontroller inherits from uiviewcontroller so they are both of type uiviewcontroller but it doesn t reflect really what is going on

14262903
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this is compiler-legal uitabbarcontroller inherits from uiviewcontroller so they are both of type uiviewcontroller but it doesn t reflect really what is going on
your segue will be to the uiviewcontroller or it s uinavigationcontroller

14264707
fseek	fgetc
if you want to overwrite the character you just read you have to use fseek to rewind the position one step
you can use fgetc and fputc for the same file in the same loop but you have to remember that after you called fgetc the file pointer is positioned at the next character so that the fputc call will write over the next character and not the one just read

14265600
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
figured it out works for firefox google-chrome and ie
i m not sure about safari as i don t have it installed

14265941
clang	llvm
you should either update xcode or see if there s a more recent version of clang installed somewhere else
the version you re using is apple clang version 3.1 tags apple clang-318.0.61 based on llvm 3.1svn although this says 3.1 it s not actually the same 3.1 referred to by the c++ status page you looked at

14265941
clang	llvm
apple clang version 3.1 is based on llvm 3.1svn which means it s based on a pre llvm.org 3.1 revision in the llvm.org source code repository and may not have all the features of the final llvm.org 3.1 release
apple clang 3.1 is kind of old now

14267928
mdpi	hdpi
now just multiply the unit results 117.5 and 80 with these scaling factors ldpi 117.5 3 352.5 80 3 240 mdpi 117.5 4 470 80 4 320 hdpi 117.5 6 705 80 6 480 xhdpi 117.5 8 940 80 8 640 these sizes are now in perfect 3 4 6 8 scaling ratios
i don t agree with answer by michael allen because the resulting resolutions for ldpi mdpi hdpi and xdpi doesn t satisfy the 3 4 6 8 scaling ratios for alternative bitmaps mentioned in the google docs here under alternative drawables therefore i would suggest that you take the baseline example that has a minimum size of 470 x 320 dp now using formula from same documentation we calculate full screen resolution for baseline screen size px dp dpi 160

14269218
portrait	landscape
note that the game center login still comes up in portrait orientation there doesn t appear to be anything you can do about that
but the rest of the game will remain in landscape mode

14269356
passenger	webrick
assuming you have a working ruby and rubygems installed gem install passenger put all files in a subdirectory called public example project dir . any old crap that will not be on the website public favicon.ico images ajax-loader-large.gif bg.jpg bg_home.jpg bg_nav.gif index.html javascripts jquery.livesearch.js robots.txt stylesheets all.css then run passenger start the first time it will install a bunch of things including nginx but you won t have to worry about configuring it but it should work faster after that
the webrick example works great thanks to brian

14269667
selecteditem	selectedindex
the symptoms of the bug are that selectionchanged doesn t fire selectedindex selecteditem aren t reliable and that back navigation into a page with panorama resets the panorama selected item
for example the following code sample will never fire the messagebox and selectedindex selecteditem won t indicate the correct expected values

14269817
nuxeo	alfresco
for example in the java world alfresco exo nuxeo etc
i wouldn t call it light but you can run alfresco on a laptop

14270401
google-chrome	firefox
strangely enough this isn t an issue in google-chrome
so for example this won t work in firefox but it will work in google-chrome

14270921
draggable	droppable
if it s not necessary to know the index then you can just access the draggable as ui.draggable without setting or getting .data
the problem is that replaces any previously defined droppable functionality so not soluble with a closure

14274081
apache	nginx
stop nginx usr bin nginx -s stop start apache sudo etc init.d apache2 start you can also use restart and stop instead of start make shure the apache2 conf httpd.conf file is correct to uninstall nginx
the nginx installation should not overwrite any apache files

14274081
apache	nginx
the nginx installation should not overwrite any apache files
i bet you just have to stop it and start apache

14274922
collabnet	svn
the collabnet install does not include them at the moment
yes there is one published by collabnet -- in svn server 1.8.0 fsfs-stats and svn-bench were introduced

14274964
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
in a default apache prefork mpm - mod_php setup you probably are randomly sent to different forked processes which will most likely result in n different ids cycling through while n depends on your apache configuration of minspareservers n pconnections maxspareservers n pconnections maxrequestsperchild tmax when you reach maxrequestsperchild the process is terminated and the persistent connection on this child as well
in a apache worker mpm or any other fastcgi-capable webserver like lighttpd or nginx combined with php-fpm or php-cgi + fastcgi i am expecting the same behavior now not caused by the webserver but by the php processes

14274964
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
in a apache worker mpm or any other fastcgi-capable webserver like lighttpd or nginx combined with php-fpm or php-cgi + fastcgi i am expecting the same behavior now not caused by the webserver but by the php processes
in parallel to the apache settings described above the relevant settings are php-fpm pm.min_spare_servers n pconnections pm.max_spare_servers n pconnections pm.max_requests tmax fastcgi php_fcgi_children n pconnections php_fcgi_max_requests tmax in all configurations the maximum lifetime of a persistent connection is in amount of requests handled by that process tmax the max amount of parallel persistent connections n pconnections simulating this on the command-line php-cli edit acually i forgot to mention a second limitation. connections of course can be closed anytime by the server itself. this heavily depends on the server settings and protocol you are using

14276069
implements	extends
read it but don t write anything - leave that to activecollab or implements desired functionality as a module link provided above
if you are not building a module which is recommended way to extends the system than best approach that you can take is to read activecollab s session id that s stored in a cookie http only not available to javascript

14276937
implements	extends
a big difference is that you cannot extends multiple abstract classes but you can implements multiple interfaces
so in this way objects can have multiple purposes and be used in various different scenarios if they implements multiple interfaces

14278331
icmp	udp
ping which is a very old protocol uses the icmp protocol
i believe this is actually a layer down or possibly in the same networking layer as udp but it is not a udp message

14280144
vbscript	jscript
otoh if - as i need this not to hardcode some input parameters of the script seems to indicate - the real work is done by starting vbscript scripts then selecting constructing parameters for such scripts in a hta gui should be easy for html savvy people
for people who know html it s very viable to write guis controled by vbscript or any other activescript language perl python ruby jscript ...

14282930
firefox	safari
firefox really enjoys one of the fastest reloads around
but keep in mind this is a browser issue so what seems fast in firefox will not look so fast in other browsers like safari and opera

14284083
aggregate-functions	sum
in other rdbms you would either have to use a different aggregate-functions or else test the boolean and return a result that can be used in sum
use the having clause to filter the groups note that sum boolean works in mysql because it does not have true boolean types

14285895
fgets	getchar
alternatively you could use fgets followed by some hack to discard characters until end-of-line
use scanf with a specially-crafted format string some explanations 11 elements in the array - you know why means name can contain anything except the newline character - as opposed to a more conventional s - name can contain anything except space characters means read but not store getchar at the end consumes the end-of-line character suggestion by danielfischer such a complicated format string is needed because you want to read 10 characters and discard the rest

14286703
margin	text-align
says that the top and bottom margin should be 0 this doesn t matter for centering ad that the left and right margins should be auto - they should be equal to each other
the element is really just a block-level element with text-align center

14287155
matlab	simulink
the add-on product matlab builder ja will archive and encrypt your matlab source code and create a standalone .jar file wrapper that enables you to call the matlab code from java but it doesn t produce java source code
note that matlab coder and simulink coder produce c not c++ code and that matlab compiler works in a similar way to builder ja archiving and encrypting your matlab code and producing an executable wrapper

14287155
matlab	simulink
note that matlab coder and simulink coder produce c not c++ code and that matlab compiler works in a similar way to builder ja archiving and encrypting your matlab code and producing an executable wrapper
edit since release r2015b functionality to produce .jar files has been moved from matlab builder ja to the new product matlab compiler sdk which will also produce .dll files and .net assemblies

14288350
viewdidload	viewwillappear
2- when viewdidload is called the bounds have not been set so you need to put any calls that pertain to the orientation in viewwillappear or viewdidlayoutsubviews
3- if for some odd reason you need to use the bounds before viewdidload or maybe to do something in a model i have found that the best way to put settings that pertain to the orientation is to trust the statusbar which you can call as follows for example

14289986
emacs	textmate	emacs	sublimetext
if you do any significant javascript development i recommend checkint out js2-mode which turns emacs into a great js ide
according to textmate and sublimetext aren t doing the right thing

14290569
strcpy	strncpy
notice the routine is strncpy not strcpy
strcpy is unsafe

14292066
octal	binary
every three binary digits 0 or 1 represent exactly one octal digit from 0 to 7
so i think the algorithm is simple iterate over every 3 subsequent characters and convert them to one octal digit extra care need to be taken in the beginning if the length of the string is not a multiply of 3

14292423
spaces	delimiter
i couldn t find a solution to your problem all i can do is suggest you a workaround if you don t want to write this each time you have a directory with spaces in it s name you can make a method that does it for you
i think this may be an apache commons issue it doesn t work for me in fact it might not work because spaces are interpreted as delimiter for command parameters

14293200
persistent	transient
there may also be some data in your application which you would like to have shared among all instances of your app but does not need to be persistent forever
in such cases memcache can improve the scalability of your app by providing a fast and efficient distributed storage system for transient data

14294600
super	self
the correct alternate version would be super queue self .append
given these two choices you should use self.append because your code using super is not valid python

14294616
super	extends
go for self putting aside that your use of super is incorrect as borealid stated
however i believe that in this case it s better to not extends deque but rather wrap it

14299929
prepare	execute
when using mysqli you cannot have more than one prepare statement active on a single connection at the same time
by active i mean is has been sent over to the server by calling it s execute at least once

14304885
ssl	https
zsh 29354 curl curl 51 ssl peer certificate or ssh remote key was not ok as you see it doesn t give much details on why the certificate is invalid but otherwise it should be as good as a headless browser and much lighter
curl and libcurl uses openssl for https urls and checks certificate validity unless -k --insecure option is enabled

14307642
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
modal segue the code hiding behind a modal segue is the uiviewcontroller method in a modal segue to a navcontroller viewcontroller combo the destination viewcontroller is whatever the segue line points to
if it points to a viewcontroller that is the segue.destinationcontroller and the uinavigationcontroller will be ignored which is not what you want here

14308338
rpm	yum
so there are really just two types of package management systems rpm and deb which use a command-line program rpm and dpkg respectively to actually do the installation
most distributions also come with a gui front-end for those programs too not the synaptic-style package management software which is a gui front-end to apt-get or yum but something simpler

14314378
equals	compareto
so if its not about sorting and the retrun value is not important i would say one should use the first.equals second or if the comparison is culture specific for example in languages like in german equals first second stringcomparison.currentculture take a look a these links how to compare strings c# programming guide string.compareto method object
well msdn states you shoul use the comparision function according to the task you need to perform the compareto method was designed primarily for use in sorting or alphabetizing operations

14315067
inline	inlining
the inline getter syntax is an example of a meta annotation which tells the compiler that the inline annotation should be placed on the generated getter method as opposed to the constructer parameter which would be the default here meta annotations the final marks the generated field and getter as final so they cannot be overridden by subclasses
this particular combination was used here to trick the scala compiler into directly accessing the fields of tree instances instead of calling getters and relying on the jvm optimizer to perform proper inlining

14315366
comparator	comparable
your comparator is simply useless
normally we need a comparator because the target object to be compared are not comparable or the default comparing does not fit our use

14315366
comparator	comparable
if you want to optionally let user provide comparator refer to the way done in treemap
basic idea is if comparator is provided then use the comparator if not then cast the entry to comparable and do the comparison

14315366
comparator	comparable
basic idea is if comparator is provided then use the comparator if not then cast the entry to comparable and do the comparison
if you insists to use a comparator that s what you mentioned in your comment though i don t get the reason behind it as you needs your elements to be comparable so you need to put this restriction in your generic type param and simply make a comparator to compare for comparable

14316142
coalesce	nvl
the only short circuit i have seen oracle do relates to nvl vs coalesce
select nvl 1 1 0 from dual select coalesce 1 1 0 from dual nvl evaluates both sides and throws an error the coalesce doesn t

14316718
srt	subtitle
both cases enclosing the url of your srt file of course
it might be perfectly possible that your dmr does not support subtitle at all

14320467
bash	subshell
read this link for more details but in general when you redirect the stdin of a loop in bash the loop will execute in a subshell
because the loop is a subshell variable assignments inside the loop will not be visible outside of the loop

14320971
oncreate	setcontentview
it turned out that in oncreate constructor i was instantiating not main2 but the other one
i had setcontentview r.layout.main

14321555
implements	extends
such pattern implements in transactionscope class
you can extends idisposable with method complete and use pattern like that if an exception is thrown inside the using statement complete will not be called before dispose

14322145
postgresql	mysql
if you re worried about any of those points you should go with postgresql
mysql has indirectly been bought by oracle and considering they also had their own database before acquiring mysql i wouldn t put it past them to just drop it somewhere along the line

14322673
super	implements
in this particular case it means t must extends where f must be of type t or a super type of it
this means thay if you have the following classes you can still pass to collections.sort notice that dog implements not as usual

14325284
daemons	systemd
on your embedded systemd your best option is probably a small wrapper that monitors your daemons and restarts it when necessary
the rc.d init.d startup script convention does not provide for respawning daemons

14325284
daemons	systemd
the rc.d init.d startup script convention does not provide for respawning daemons
that s one of the main reasons why alternatives like upstart and systemd have been created

14325875
comparator	comparable
comparable items can be sorted as they have a comparator if items are not comparable they need a comparator object to do the comparison a bridging comparator is trivial and you did it already
wrapping every t item with some comparable adapter having a comparator seems useless. first of all not inheritance but as field one needs to wrap the item

14327449
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu add the following to etc apache2 httpd.conf adddefaultcharset utf-8 wihtout it the browser caches the output of the cgi script
the debian ubuntu and solaris too obviously apache package stock configs doesn t specify the character set like on redhat

14327650
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
note if you run the following command linux and you have a result like ... rename perl script ascii text executable then this seems to be the right tool this seems to be the default rename command on ubuntu
to make it the default on debian and derivative like ubuntu sudo update-alternatives --set rename path to rename explanations s is the base substitution expression s to_replace replaced check perldoc perlre d+ capture with at least one integer d or more + in sprintf is like printf but not used to print but to format a string with the same syntax

14329686
inline	inlining
some of the inline warnings are a tiny bit more helpful by the way - like could not inline required method f because bytecode unavailable
which happens in the repl the compiler help explains -yinline-warnings as emit inlining warnings

14330697
onclick	onmouseup
ya though w3c says the right click can be detected by the click event onclick is not triggered through right click in usual browsers
in fact right click only trigger onmousedown onmouseup and oncontextmenu

14333069
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
in order to do that you can pass the onclicklistener to the adapter in the following manner the adapter should be as follows and in the getview method just add the following lines that set the click listener after inflating the row view set a click listener on the row itself row.setonclicklistener callback
set the position as tag so it can be retrieved from the click listener because the click listener itself does not provide the position like done in the onitemclicklistener row.settag position

14335851
istream	getline
there are a couple of ways to solve this the simplest is probably yo start using std getline instead of istream getline
std getline reads the newline but doesn t append it to the string

14336021
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable is a simple enumerator and does not support indexes
from msdn about ilist represents a non-generic collection of objects that can be individually accessed by index

14336157
portrait	landscape
this will be because the uiimage is not actually portrait
all photos taken with the iphone camera are landscape in their raw bitmap state eg 3264 wide x 2488 high

14336691
implements	extends
i ve implements a simple crud over rest api in both frameworks
here are my thoughs angular is harder because it s convention over configuration new concepts like directives and such you need to think with extends html instead of javascript hacking which can be not that difficult for flex practitioners

14338613
layoutparams	viewgroup
mainlayout will see that childlayout has the proper layoutparams instance which has the values used in the layout file and doesn t call its generatedefaultlayoutparams
the main difference between the two inflate methods is the second parameter the viewgroup parameter and its use in setting the proper layoutparams for the root view of the inflated layout file

14339557
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is similar to isnull and would usually be recommended except for a few odd situations - for one it s part of standard sql useful if you ever have to work against other rdbmses for another it can accept multiple arguments and returns the first non- null one
for a third it uses the most appropriate data type for the result considering the types of each expression - isnull always tries to convert the second argument to the type of the first i m also not sure what you we re doing in your case expressions - you d already established that ocareof was null - there was no need to then use an isnull expression to obtain as conrad points out on sql server this does depend on concat_null_yields_null being on but it is by default and it really should be in a future version of sql server concat_null_yields_null will always be on and any applications that explicitly set the option to off will generate an error

14343292
gif	png	bmp	png
all of the major image types bmp gif png jpeg are raster types and do not support vector graphics
the png image is your example is rastered.

14345123
pthreads	fork
using pthreads shell semantics now there are two screens both have the same name fess hostname-1068 screen -ls there are screens on 19431.nameofscreen 01 15 2013 10 53 31 am detached 19180.nameofscreen 01 15 2013 10 11 02 am detached but we know the difference and we can accurately ask it to quit now there s just the original one again fess hostname-1071 screen -ls there is a screen on 19180.nameofscreen 01 15 2013 10 11 02 am detached
you can use screen -dms nameofscreen which does not fork a daemon process allowing you to know the pid

14347772
prepare	execute
well you should be using pdo s prepare statements i m not gonna rewrite all that code for you but thats a good place to start
as far as saftey goes iirc pdo only allows you to execute one query at a time so sql injection is a bit harder

14349085
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
this means that quicksort will have a very small number of cache misses which on modern architectures is critical for performance
heapsort on the other hand doesn t have very good locality it jumps around all over an array though most mergesort implementations have reasonably locality

14349085
quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
many sorting algorithms can be parallelized including mergesort but the performance of parallel quicksort tends to be better than other parallel algorithms for the above reason
heapsort on the other hand does not

14349661
sudo	passwd
the error sudo nginx command not found indicates that nginx is either not installed or not installed where you think it is
sudo uses your login passwd

14349944
mathml	mathjax
obviously the built in mathml support will be a lot faster than a javascript implementation
for tex-like input you could give jqmath a try it is much smaller and faster than mathjax but doesn t try to do such a complete job for mathml input webkit and firefox now support that by default but getting math fonts installed by default on the platforms is still an issue and it may take a while for the mathml support to reach all relevant browsers

14349944
mathml	mathjax
for tex-like input you could give jqmath a try it is much smaller and faster than mathjax but doesn t try to do such a complete job for mathml input webkit and firefox now support that by default but getting math fonts installed by default on the platforms is still an issue and it may take a while for the mathml support to reach all relevant browsers
for example mathml is in chrome 24 released last week but neither the mobile version of chrome nor the android stock browser use a new enough webkit base at present

14350007
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
check out uiviewcontroller containment for lifecycle handling
basically just this in your root view controller if the rootviewcontroller is not yours eg a uinavigationcontroller you can use a category but to retain the _semimodalviewcontroller you ll need to use an associative reference ie add a property to the category to store the modal vc while its in use

14356855
mongodb	bson
if your problem is with export and console you probably are not converting your data to utf-8 before uploading it to mongodb
bson can only be encoded in utf-8

14361144
google-chrome	firefox
seemingly ie firefox use same format as os while google-chrome does not this sometimes causes an issue with date validation
maybe this will solve your problem unobtrusive validation in google-chrome won #39

14361591
oncreate	findviewbyid
remember don t forget to pass through fragment lifecycle events such as oncreate onresume onpause and ondestroy to the corresponding methods on the mapview
second if you try to call anything like findfragmentbyid or findviewbyid inside oncreateview before you return a view they ll be null because you fragment doesn t have a view herarchy yet

14361689
octal	decimal
you have to pass a base parameter to parseint if you don t do that then strings starting with 0 are interpreted as octal constants not decimal
of course 08 and 09 are meaningless octal constants

14362003
g++	gcc
the problem is that under solaris if g++ cannot compile even an empty body that
if it s undefined then gcc cannot compile c code

14366426
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
self.navigationitem is a readonly property created on demand when using a uiviewcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller
you can certainly create custom uinavigationitem but thats often frowned upon in a standard uinavigationcontroller setup and you shouldn t need to

14368144
set	bag
the data you generate is called your training set
note that the bag of words model tend to have a huge feature space - so you are going to need a classifier that is not sensitive to non informative features

14370448
gif	png
the gif compression format is a tricky one because all of the blank space isn t treated like it would be in a jpg or png bitwise
however as the number of animations increases and the number of colors increases the gif format will begin to break down

14380058
g++	gcc
below code works with gcc at least not tested with g++
if you are on linux using gcc you can declare main as an alias to any other function

14381702
memcpy	strcpy
1 you should get an eror in the compilation if you change your const char array in this way 2 you should get a warning if you modify your const char array via memcpy or via strcpy change it to and you can not use strcpy because your character array contains x00 in the middle so this will affect the strcpy function
because strcpy stop when it find x00 in the char array char array contains x00 in the middle so to find the length of with strlen will not work properly

14383139
express	node.js
our custom middleware will then check to see if the document that is being requested is a protected document or not if it isn t it continues down the middleware chain probably hitting the docpad middlewares and rendering normally or if it is a protected document then we ll forward it onto the express basicauth middleware
if you re planning to host on a node.js hosting provider then you can use the following gist the idea is that we use the serverextend event to add a new express.js middleware

14386129
config	ini
additionally ext database can wholly be configured within ini config files while ext sqla cannot
details config in the config file ext database needs at least session.url defined to point at the database

14386858
mvp	presenter
if it s not too much for your introduction to presentation patterns i d urge you to take a look at the presenter-first variant of mvp
in this variant and providing an answer to your question the presenter knows both the model and view but only via interfaces

14388707
udp	tcp
in connectionless mode udp sockets that were not explicitly bound when data is sent over them for the first time are usually automatically bound by the system as an unbound udp socket cannot receive any reply data
same is true for an unbound tcp socket it is automatically bound before it will be connected

14388707
udp	tcp
for udp sockets the data is usually sent pretty soon if not immediately but for tcp sockets there can be a relatively long delay between adding data to the send buffer and having the tcp implementation really send that data
as a result when you close a tcp socket there may still be pending data in the send buffer which has not been sent yet but your code considers it as sent since the send call succeeded

14388942
union	distinct
note i don t think this would be fast to execute but i know in mssql union will do a distinct on the results
does this work in sqlite select col1 from table union select col2 from table union select coll3 from table or select col1 from table where col1 is not null union select col2 from table where col2 is not null union select coll3 from table where col3 is not null to eliminate nulls

14390549
punctuation	words
b does not treat punctuation as part of the words
b treats punctuation as part of the words using only whitespace as words delimiters

14390594
inline	inlining
of course the point of inline asm is to have the compiler inline it and then no function call even takes place
many peole wrongly think inline means embedded in the c source file and use it as convenience feature even when no actual code inlining is required. gcc is also quite capable of putting things in the register you want them in not that you particularly care about the counter being rcx here

14391127
imperative	declarative
this will let you have a imperative export as well
this is not an attribute free imperative approach since the export is attributed declarative

14391320
inline	constexpr	constexpr	inline-functions
yes dcl.constexpr 7.1.5 2 in the c++11 standard constexpr functions and constexpr constructors are implicitly inline 7.1.2 . note however that the inline specifier really has very little if any effect upon whether a compiler is likely to expand a function inline or not
it does however affect the one definition rule and from that perspective the compiler is required to follow the same rules for a constexpr function as an inline-functions

14394019
mp3	wav
the second problem with your code is that you are not actually creating an mp3 file
the wavefilewriter makes a wav file

14396337
ubuntu	linux
e.g mingw32 if you are in ubuntu sudo apt-get install mingw32 i586-mingw32msvc-cc main.c -o main.exe
you can not convert a linux executeable into a windows executeable. but you can compile the source with cross-compiler

14397939
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
richfaces has in essence nothing which primefaces doesn t already offer
the html output of the suggests that you re mixing primefaces with icefaces

14398264
union	distinct
the union method should return the result without duplicates
depending on the query ef will generate either union all with distinct or just union so your explicit distinct is not necessary

14398264
union	distinct
depending on the query ef will generate either union all with distinct or just union so your explicit distinct is not necessary
the linq equivalent of union all is concat

14401183
pascal	delphi
asm shift unrolled 4040 lut called 3011 lut inlined 977 pascal unrolled 10052 pas
unrolled inlined 849 pascal math called 4614 pascal math inlined 6517 and below the explanation all calls to inlined functions were eliminated. yet about passing the parameters delphi made three different decisions for the 1st call it eliminated parameter passing together with function call for the 2nd call it kept parameter passing despite function was not called for the 3rd call it kept changed parameter passing which proved longer then function call itself

14402293
jar	war
if you want to organize your jars either look at ant maven or at eclipse s build path and deployment assembly to automatically put the jar files which are organized elsewhere in web-inf lib folder of the built war
yes jar is in same path web-inf lib oracleadf adf-richclient-impl-11.jar this is not right

14402416
postgresql	mysql
offset equivalent to vendor specific limit and top both tested in sql-fiddle test-3 q4 works in postgresql and sql-server 2012 . note that this one will give different results than the 3 first queries because the fetch syntax does not resolve ties returns only one row from the tied ones
other generic ways that should run in most dbms and do not use the mysql specific limit keyword and this both tested in sql-fiddle test-1 works in all 4 postgresql sql-server oracle mysql except the 2nd query which doesn t run in postgresql

14402416
postgresql	mysql
other generic ways that should run in most dbms and do not use the mysql specific limit keyword and this both tested in sql-fiddle test-1 works in all 4 postgresql sql-server oracle mysql except the 2nd query which doesn t run in postgresql
for those dbms that have window functions and the over clause there is also another way works in postgresql oracle sql-server 2012 and what would be the standard way is the following

14404502
couchbase	couchdb
we ve decided to use bigcouch fork of apache couchdb that supports clustering as the server technology and then couchbase mobile on the mobile devices
as a note touchdb for android will replace couchbase mobile but it s not stable yet. the reason we went with couch technologies is that couch has good replication over http

14406172
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
other functions such as calloc realloc etc. were not supported
there were also bugs when using both malloc and routines such as printf scanf etc

14406697
prepare	execute
from snip sql prepare statements prepare execute deallocate prepare can be used in stored procedures but not stored functions or triggers
thus stored functions and triggers cannot use dynamic sql where you construct statements as strings and then execute them

14407368
keystore	jks
java does not use pem format for keystore containers as openssl does so you will have to convert these into a keystore either pkcs#12 or jks
you can do the conversion by code using bouncy castle or you could use a tool to create a keystore from the pem file and use the keystore in your application

14407827
selecteditem	selectedindex
i just spun up a prototype 501+ and it appears that if the ienumerable that the combobox is bound to changes but the elements in the ienumerable do not then selecteditem is not nulled out
so within the btnsave_click event handler you change this itemssource which probably does not have the same instances that are already in the combo thus nulling out selecteditem for all comboboxes bound to this property and then only update cbono s selectedindex

14408056
pthreads	fork
the pthreads standard limits the type of system calls that are allowed after a fork and before an exec to so called async-signal-safe system calls
creating a thread isn t explicitly listed as an async-signal-safe system call therefore pthreads doesn t allow a child process to create threads after a fork and before exec

14409069
shadowing	named
similarly if a named is already declared as a variable or parameter named then that outer declaration is shadowed throughout the scope of the local variable provided that the shadowing does not cause a compile-time error under the rules of 14.4.2
the shadowed named can sometimes be accessed using an appropriately qualified named

14409883
super	self
using the keyword super in a category is not allowed
only the word self which is why there s a need for subclassing

14412742
mri	rubinius
with mri ruby you ll only get improvements when doing lots of i o operations reading from the database writing something to disk ... . the condition checks will not be run in parallel because of the global interpreter lock
however when you re using rubinius 2 or jruby you ll get ruby interpreters that don t have a global interpreter lock and are therefore capable of doing the condition checks in parallel using threads

14416133
division	modulo
or you could do this with an if and a single modular division unless x is not far from x_min and x_max and is reachable with very few sums or subtractions think also error propagation i think the modulo is your only available method
without division keeping in mind that error propagation might become relevant we can do this with a cycle note on probabilities the use of modular arithmetic has some statistical implications floating point arithmetic also would have different ones

14420912
serializable	deserialization
so you will need to implement writeobject and readobject in b to handle the serializable deserialization of a.aa
just because b implements serializable that does not retroactively include the fields of the non-serializable superclass in what gets serialized

14420912
implements	extends
just because b implements serializable that does not retroactively include the fields of the non-serializable superclass in what gets serialized
this makes sense especially when you consider that being able to serialize private and package-private fields of any class just by extends it and implementing serializable would violate its encapsulation. a field declared in a will behave the same as a field declared as transient in b

14421769
queue	fifo
you have probably been reading a text book or some lecture notes or something that describe how an idealised fifo queue works
but what you have failed to realise is that not all queues are fifo

14421769
queue	fifo
for instance if hypothetically the president obama went to a busy macdonalds restaurant you would find that he was immediately moved to the front of the queue
that s a queue behaving in a non-fifo fashion. anyway the java queue is an interface for any kind of queue not just fifo queues

14421769
queue	fifo
that s a queue behaving in a non-fifo fashion. anyway the java queue is an interface for any kind of queue not just fifo queue
it also supports priority queue and any other queuing semantics you could dream up .

14421813
queue	fifo
java queue is not necessarily fifo
queue api says queues typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner

14421813
queue	fifo
queue api says queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner
it depends on implementation for instance priorityqueue is not fifo but linkedlist that you used is fifo

14422674
innodb	myisam
i have two thoughts both of which lead me to the same recommendation even though i am not as familiar with the internals of myisam as i am with innodb
as an aside i d recommend innodb over myisam. the index on your primary key was presumably on the table when you began inserting data while the new index was added while most or all of the data was already there

14426452
jtable	jlabel
when jtable s need to render a cell they pass all the information about that cell its value whether or not it is selected etc. along to a tablecellrenderer
there is a defaulttablecellrenderer installed by default which renders your cells as jlabel

14429695
udp	tcp
if you are using udp though things are a bit different you would need to use a custom means of identifying each client
if you are using tcp ip this is very much possible - the socket that listens for incoming connections only does that - it does not handle the communication with each individual socket

14431974
spaces	delimiter
note that this example will not work if there are spaces within the band album or trackname
output however this example will work with spaces by not using them as a delimiter

14431974
spaces	delimiter
output however this example will work with spaces by not using them as a delimiter
unfortunately this means that the spaces will not be trimmed from the results

14435909
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception do not need to be explicitly handled by the calling code
runtimeexception are a subset of unchecked-exception for exceptions from which recovery is possible

14435909
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception are a subset of unchecked-exception for exceptions from which recovery is possible
unchecked-exception are not checked at compile-time which means that the compiler doesn t require methods to catch or to specify with a throws them

14438601
implements	extends
if you for whatever reason want to customize the way a stack trace is printed you can implements a utility method which takes the throwable and then uses the various methods from stacktraceelement to create your own layout something like you could also use delegation and create a list of customstacktraceelements and implements additional logic like different hashmap in the customstacktraceelement class
i want to customize the stacktraceelement class by extends it stacktraceelement is final and hence can not be extended

14439278
laravel	cakephp	laravel	codeigniter
here is some examples of them all laravel codeigniter cakephp lithium for alternative database mongodb
you can use a framework that uses an orm like laravel but then you are not writing your own sql-queries or its not recommended else you can just use mysqli but neither of them removes any objective view i think

14441659
punctuation	words
a better solution here is xsl analyze-string if you use a regex that allows for punctuation between words this ensures that the punctuation will not be lost
you could also reverse the test and have a regex that matches words rather than interword delimiters

14441793
udp	tcp
so if you can control the behaviour of the udp traffic either in the application or my network quality control tools that would help your tcp traffic a lot
while the host s tcp implementation probably do not timeout the connection even if there s no activity for a long period of time but be aware that some tcp option exist to handle and control that behaviour like rfc 5482 tcp user timeout option most networking equipments routers nat boxes firewall etc. have some timeout policy where idle connection will be terminated

14441793
udp	tcp
so if you are flooding your network connection with udp it is possible that a simultaneous tcp connection is not able to get a even a single packet out thus resulting in the router to terminate the connection
while tcp try to be well-behave and prevent flooding of the network link udp don t care at all

14442107
macports	homebrew
so i guess my experience was that macports with pip3 was not a good idea for my particular goal whereas homebrew with pip3 was better but still incomplete for scipy packages with python3
although perhaps if i had tried installing from source to supplement macports the way i did with homebrew then macports would have sufficed also. looking back on the experience i think there is a great need for more detailed and comprehensive documentation for new users on how to start from scratch and build these capabilities because i tried many different strategies and it was ultimately only through trial and error and lots of different bits and pieces of advice from all over the web that i finally got some of it going

14442626
required	placeholder
it only required you to set the on the input and include the script file
as said in the comments use html attribute placeholder for the older browsers that does not support this attribute there are some jquery plugins that can handle this

14443620
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you are calling a popover so the main screen should not call viewdidload method because the main view still on the back
it should be calling the viewwillappear and the viewdidapper methods instead

14443762
vsts	tfs
it s not possible at the moment there s another answer that links to blog post on how to add it yourself for older on-prem tfs for vsts and the newer work item forms this should be possible to add via the web ui see this thread on msdn forums for details and it also cover s your question
this paragraph explains the reasoning for leaving out original estimate and completed work with the scrum template we deliberately tried to keep to the minimum set of fields that we thought were required to match the scrum methodology and make certain core tfs features operate correctly

14445380
directx	direct2d
that same amount of time had my game loop going and sprites moving around in monogame. so i repeat if you don t already know directx and you are making a 2d app don t go down the directx sharpdx road
the directx 2d route is further hindered by windows phone 8 not supporting direct2d

14445380
directx	direct2d
the directx 2d route is further hindered by windows phone 8 not supporting direct2d
directx has a subset called direct2d for 2d rendering

14447858
hive	hdfs
note that this behavior of moving hdfs directories only exist in more recent versions of hive
before that the rename command was only updating the metastore and not moving directories in hdfs

14449982
strdup	calloc
strdup is not defined by iso c but it s defined by posix.
a partial solution would be to compile everything with and probably likewise for calloc and realloc

14451644
vsto	add-in
excel projects are very similar to their vba counterparts if your project involves functionality that can only be accessed when a specific workbook is opened you re writing the vba code behind that specific workbook in the vba editor - in vsto that s a workbook project in excel 2007+ it s a macro-enabled workbook .xlsm in earlier versions it s a workbook that runs code macros
however if your project involves functionality that runs at the application excel level and is available regardless of whether a workbook is opened or not - let alone whether a specific workbook is opened you re writing an excel add-in

14452664
g++	gcc
there is no stable way to demangle in g++ reason is that mangling rules aren t portable even between different g++ versions
also #pragma weak is c-extension declared in gcc c-family c-pragma.c file and don t normally work with c++ in terms of gcc development correct solution is to provide code for something like #pragma cpp-weak and commit to gcc but it seems to be rather complex task

14455055
jqplot	highcharts
jqplot is another option but i m not too familiar with that
i would recommend looking at highcharts instead of making your own

14455286
mediacodec	mediarecorder
some sample code create video from screen grabs in android and encoding h.264 from camera with android mediacodec
i think what you are looking for is a way to encode videos to h.264 in a way similar to what mediarecorder does but not from the camera

14455980
svg	vml
kendo ui dataviz uses svg for charts in newer browsers and vml for old ie 7 and 8
you can use css to change the text font but the vml part wouldn t be affected

14456136
daemons	systemd
a daemons would watch a directory and print when necessary
php is not designed for systemd programming

14458029
super	extends
you can indeed also abstract it away as a super bean but this is not reusable and you would keep repeating yourself in every jsf project
also a class can extends from only one class

14459850
equals	gethashcode
by default you ll get reference equality. note that as soon as you start trying to use contains in a query which will execute in the database it could behave completely different - it wouldn t be looking at your equals gethashcode methods at that point
well contains is going to call equals on the elements - and may also use gethashcode i doubt it but you should override it consistently anyway

14460576
move	drag
that will make all the aligned field move together with it another thing would be on crystal xi you can also click on the vertical ruler then drag it to the left to create a new section this will split an empty section at the top and field in a small section at the bottom would be best with pictures but not allowed you can then remove the upper section in the section expert
i don t have much to help you but instead of moving fields you could move the guide lines

14461419
swt	swing
note that eclipse is swt based while idea is swing based so mouse event management is completely different
if jdk cannot recognize your device button clicks it will not work in any swing applications netbeans jedit etc

14461836
apache	nginx
for ease of support unless you have a compelling reason not to go with apache
apache is still the most popular web server on the internet estimated to serve about 55 of all websites in existence compared to nginx s 12 in jan 2013

14462471
firefox	safari
andrew m said it s working on safari 6.0 5.1 and firefox 11 - both in windows no version mentioned perhaps not win 7 - and mac
i just tested the code below on safari 6.0.2 chrome 24.0.1 firefox 18.0.1 and can confirm it s working

14464983
innodb	myisam
in this case the requirement for a primary key is satisfied and innodb creates no implicit column
re your comments i try not to use myisam

14466940
prepare	execute
otherwise you can also fix it by checking the result of pdo prepare before you call execute on it
check the docs for pdo prepare it does not always return a pdostatement object

14467492
strcpy	strncpy
you can initialize it with strcpy for example you have to be very careful that the data you re copying is no bigger than the allocated space
no strncpy is not the answer to this problem . void main is incorrect

14470174
prepare	execute
you cannot nest actively running prepare statements on the same connection to mysql
once you call execute on any statement you cannot run another one on the same connection until that prepare statement is closed

14470174
prepare	execute
once you call execute on any statement you cannot run another one on the same connection until that prepare statement is closed
any fetches on the first prepare statement will fail once you start executing on the second one

14470723
ng-switch	ng-show
alternatively you should look into selectively showing elements with ng-switch
unlike ng-show hide ng-switch does not simply add display none to the css

14473134
apache	nginx
i am not an expert in deployment but in my experience nginx is much faster and more friendly to django compared to apache
one advantage which i think might be of particular interest to you is nginx ability to have multiple worker processes and its ability to use proxy_pass to hand of requests to django process es

14473354
firefox	safari
this will not fix the missing devtools issue within safari but it might help to locate errors on a device update2 mozilla released a firefox add-on to enable web development across browsers and devices
one can debug on the device by using bookmarklets especially within mobile safari

14478587
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if you present modal view controller in viewdidload the error will occur coz the view is still not loaded into widow hierarchy
you can call that method in viewdidappear

14479945
primes	modulus
however since a power of two is not a primes there would be more collisions especially with hash values having the same lower bits
the modulus performed against the size to get the bucket slot index is simply calculated by hash size-1 which is exactly what s used in hashmap to get the index

14481138
factors	matrix
if there is a factors of 1 million between them and they represent length express one in kilometers and the other in millimeters
you cannot invert a matrix with determinant equal to zero

14481946
udp	tcp
however all the examples of the pointer string are only showing cases of udp not tcp
i suspect this may have to do with the statelessness of udp

14481946
udp	tcp
i suspect this may have to do with the statelessness of udp
where the practicality of not knowing what is in the client buffer and what its length is as to read it may be the preventative reason i don t see any examples of it being used on tcp

14482527
kerberos	ntlm
this is why usually in iis the negotiate is set as the authentication scheme - this tries kerberos first and then switch back to ntlm if the authentication authority is not directly available to the browser
the following answer is based on my understanding of ntlm kerberos and some speculation on how xmlhttprequest reuses the information known to the browser

14483645
ssl	https
you do however have ssl https support for your entire site when using the set of urls
it s not yet possible to use your own ssl cert with shopify

14484302
implements	extends
also as java doesn t support multiple inheritence using class s when your class is already extends another class and you need threading in your class implements runnable is the way to go in such scenarios
it is always recommended to implement runnable rather than extends thread as implements runnable would force you to implement run method

14484302
implements	extends
it is always recommended to implements runnable rather than extends thread as implements runnable would force you to implements run method
extends thread wouldn t force you as thread class it self implements run method

14485764
punctuation	words
if you want to exclude other punctuation that may be at the end of an url you could change the positve lookahead accordingly
note that the above regex is not intended to only match valid urls and you may want to replace the s with to only match urls containing words characters and .-

14486847
persistent	transient
the external object can make use of an internal entity of another aggregate however it reference should be transient - meaning that it is not persistent
1a a reference to an entity may be needed to support a domain operation however that reference should be transient in that it isn t held after the operation

14491364
persistent	transient
basically all object instances live in persistent memory this means any object instances created with new
this is also the case for any object created by the platform where the api does not explicitly specify that the result is transient

14492919
punctuation	words
given the relatively simple decomposition words separated by white-space or punctuation i think a more prosaic solution may be necessary
iterate imperatively over the characters of the string but not via an implicit conversion to any kind of and find the words dumping them into a

clang	llvm
so the version of clang llvm that ships with xcode checks to see if the deployment target is set for 10.6 when using libc++ and prevents you from compiling
however this flag is not included in the open source version of clang llvm

14494912
qthread	qobject
a good explanation of how to and not to do threading with qthread read both..the first one now describes the default behaviour
you should us qthreads in your qt application to make the frame work do all of the hard work for you put your time consuming work in a worker class that is derived from qobject in you class that is caling the plotting add something like and communicate with your worker via signals slots

14497080
memcached	apc
the memcached getresultcode will return memcached res_data_exists if the item you are trying to store has been modified since you last fetched it. however apc is an local cache it implement through share memory is it thread-safe or not i don t known
memcached is and distribute cache the data cached on memcached is on the remote server and memcached provide cas lock optimistic lock you can use it make your thread-safe application value memcached- get key null cas

14497887
eventlet	gevent
i just want to add that there is no aggressive patching in eventlet probably gevent feature
also if library uses select that is not a problem because eventlet can monkey patch that too

14498014
mp4	h.264
and if it is only the container that you are interested in set vcodec to h.264 or libx264 and you will get similar results as mp4
h.264 has very good compression algorithm and can acheive very low bitrates but the same cannot be said about other older codecs like flv1

14498176
directx	gdi
anyway it seems to be a more or less simple wrapper around directx headers so it shouldn t add much overhead to your application unless performance is really critical
maybe i won t answer your question directly but i guess that qt uses standard system routines to perform graphical operations so it means gdi and or gdi+ here

14498878
client-side	server-side
how i would rewrite your code i would rewrite your whole code into the following that removes implied global variable datastring doesn t pollute global scope with additional functions and uses settimeout instead of interval which may in some cases be problematic although in your case since it only runs every 2 seconds it shouldn t be a problem if there s no additional very complex client-side script execution i ve kept everything within function closure local scope this code requires your server side processing on mail send to understand that when nothing is being posted no data that it doesn t add empty line in the conversation but rather knows that this is just an update call
this functionality now uses only one server-side url and not two of them

14501885
jar	manifest.mf
when you have an executable jar myapp.jar with entry in the manifest.mf class-path lib sqljdbc4.jar this means that the jar has an external dependency to sqljdbc4.jar in the relative folder lib
it is not included in the jar you created

14504364
serializable	deserialization
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

14508758
realloc	malloc
since realloc will return null if it cannot grow the buffer this can result in the new value of buffer being assigned to null and the old value being leaked
the usual metaphor is something like also best practice in c is to not cast the return from malloc or realloc

14509625
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the given answer is hard to understand more like a vague hint so it s a try to explain more detailed the problem is that the root view controller which viewdidappear method is presented in the question looks like to a be simple uiviewcontroller
and how we can see in apple s documentation for wantsfullscreenlayout the default value of this property is no which causes the view to be laid out so it does not underlap the status bar this root view controller presents uinavigationcontroller modally so presented navigation controller uses not the whole screen

14510681
cpython	ironpython
for the messy details see cpython s fileobject.c . there can be differences between the c library behavior and the underlying os s behavior but in this particular case that s not a factor
if you re using ironpython or jython it s going to use the standard .net or java file object for its underlying implementation which in turn is going to use the standard c library or os implementation

14513872
octal	decimal
btw 777 decimal is 1411 octal which would seem to explain why you re having trouble overwriting
maybe you should try 0777 which is octal -- and not the same as 777

14515140
super	implements
if repeater would have a different constructor it wouldn t work you have to explicitly return the result of calling the super constructor for it to work so as other typed constructors are kinda confusing broken i d suggest avoiding them and using a class method to instantiate these objects instead of new now for missing methods in order to have the same interface as requested in the question we can do something similar in the proxy handler but instead of directly calling a special method propertymissing on the target when it has no property with that name it returns a function that in turn calls the special method methodmissing unfortunately i couldn t find a way to distinguish property accesses from method calls in the proxy handler so that dynamicobject could be more intelligent and call propertymissing or methodmissing accordingly it makes sense though as a method call is simply a property access followed by a function call
if i had to choose and make dynamicobject as flexible as possible i d go with the propertymissing implementation as subclasses can choose how they want to implements propertymissing and treat that missing property as a method or not

14515288
ubuntu	linux
also you d think monospace would have a native bold style by now if you re in ubuntu you can download unsettings and change the default monospace font so when you open programs that have monospace as font it ll be the one you chose
btw this is not unique to linux

14517676
udp	tcp
if your application server cannot handle this do not use udp
if you want to be sure no data packet gets lost use tcp

14518330
ssl	https
ssl does have null cipher suites which disable encryption but as said this doesn t make sense in your case
https ssl layer to be precise provides transport-level security and encrypts the whole channel

14518523
ssl	https
from what i understand from these lines the origin_specified_in_html can specify https but the origin_to_fetch_from can only specify http modpagespeedmaporigindomain this directive lets the server accept https requests for www.example.com without requiring a ssl certificate to fetch resources - in fact this is the only way mod_pagespeed can service https requests as currently it cannot use https to fetch resources
for example given the above mapping and assuming apache is configured for https support mod_pagespeed will fetch and optimize resources accessed using fetching the resources from which can be the same apache process or a different server process

14518523
ssl	https
so the mod-pagespeed output filter does not even know it was requested for an ssl domain
and when it modify the html content applying domain rewrite maybe it cannot handle the https case

14519015
mp3	ogg
internet explorer 10 doesn t support ogg audio files but mp3 files
convert your ogg to an mp3 and it should work fine

14519667
visualvm	yourkit
start with visualvm as it is built in and free and does a decent job
if this is not enough try a commercial profiler such as yourkit for which you can get a free evaluation license usually works long enough to fix your problem

14520706
sudo	passwd
sudo can be configured not to ask a passwd and it s probably a better solution for your specific example than storing any passwd in a file
there are obvious reasons not to do that but if you really want you may use pyexpect module to drive applications interacting with the terminal programs asking passwd

14521472
implements	extends
java doesn t have multiple inheritance but you can implements multiple interfaces
public class myapplet extends japplet implements serializable somethingelse you don t need to extends object since all classes will extends it

14521997
queue	fifo
for this the structure to use is std deque which is the structure that std queue uses under the hood by default
it isn t wise because a queue is fifo so you need to pop from the opposite end that you push into

14523911
comparator	comparable
in the end it all depends if your object have a natural ordering because they implement comparable or you give the objects the necessary comparator to do the work
because is not restricted to objects that implements comparable because you can construct it passing a

14525705
factors	matrix
a simple but probably not numerically stable way to solve it is to multiplying both parts of the equation to the transpose matrix p to get rid of non-square matrix then multiplying both parts of the equation to the inverted p t p p t p x p t q x p t p -1 p t q applying singular value decomposition to matrix x gives two rotation matrix and a matrix with scale factors x u s v here s is a diagonal matrix with scale factors one scale for each coordinate u and v are rotation matrix one properly rotates the points so that they may be scaled along the coordinate axes other one rotates them once more to align their orientation to second set of points
example 2d points are used for simplicity after solving the equation after svd decomposition here svd has properly reconstructed all manipulations i performed on matrix p to get matrix q rotate by the angle 0.75 scale x axis by 4 scale y axis by 3 rotate by the angle -0.25

14531315
rvm	bundler
also be sure that you do not delete such general gems as rake bundler and so on during rvm gemset empty if it is the case then install them manually via gem install prior to bundle install
if you re using rvm you may use rvm gemset empty for the current gemset - this command will remove all gems installed to the current gemset gemset itself will stay in place

14531517
codeigniter	cakephp
for example in codeigniter you can use the language class and in cakephp you can use the i18n class
note that codeigniter currently uses plain php files to load the languages so it s probably not as efficient as cakephp that can load the files from .po .mo files or databases

14533865
onkeyup	onkeydown
for the sake of clarity and not wanting to leave this question appear unanswered i m repeating the accepted answer from the comments section also here the order of events related to the onkeydown event onkeydown - onkeypress - onkeyup answer taken from w3schools.com
using onkeydown event instead seems to have solved the op s dilemma i tried using the .change and .keypress events instead - unfortunately they were timed to fire after keyup and it needs to be before

14536262
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you look at viewcontroller life cycle you can note that viewdidload calls only at one time when you loads first time after that when you switches again to same viewcontroller it does not calls to viewdidload
instead of calling to viewdidload it calls to - void viewwillappear bool animated

14536659
mp4	h.264
here is an image containing all supported video formats in html 5 and for audio support see this pic update firefox now supports mp4 h.264 aac or mp3 note mp4s encoded with a high profile will not run on lower end hardware such as low end firefox os phones
mp4 type isn t supported on firefox

14536659
firefox	safari
mp4 type isn t supported on firefox
it s only supported in safari 3.0+ google chrome 5.0+ and ie 9.0+

14538599
consistency	acid
if the system needs consistency then this is the highest availability you can achieve
couchdb is in the same boat they are acid when viewed from a single node but not consistent when viewed from cap

14539564
puma	thin	puma	unicorn	thin	webrick	thin	unicorn	unicorn	webrick
application servers that are popular now thin webrick puma unicorn in context of heroku you have a choice of application servers but not a choice of web servers
when hosted yourself the use of unicorn versus thin can help give you zero downtime deploys

14540687
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i ve performed extensive logging and breakpoint setting investigating if didreceivememorywarning unloads the view when a uiviewcontroller is not the visibleviewcontroller
the results a uiviewcontroller s view does not get unloaded tested using arc in a uinavigationcontroller -based project

14543502
viewdidload	viewdidappear
doing so gives nil as viewdidload is implemented before segue
and i wouldn t recommend to use viewdidappear as as the values will be changed after the view is loaded witch makes the change process be visually visible

14544789
punctuation	words
a words is defined as one or more characters that are not punctuation and are not white space
then we use a filter to remove words from the above

14547183
implements	extends
otherwise if you cannot or don t want to inherit a specific class you can implements the interface any way you want
you re not forced to extends a specific class you can use your own class hierarchy

14552905
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
errors and runtimeexception are collectively known as unchecked-exception
runtimeexception are exceptional conditions that are internal to the application and that the application usually cannot anticipate or recover from

14556525
casting	autoboxing
also getting converted to character is not about casting but about autoboxing unboxing
simply because character is not a string doesn t fall in the common hierarchy and hence doesn t allow casting

14565457
jar	war
this happens simply because the jar file is already in tomcat lib so the portlet container refers to the class javax.portlet.filter.portletfilter that has been loaded from the common classloader of tomcat and your filter implements the class javax.portlet.filter.portletfilter that has been loaded from the classloader of your webapp from web-inf lib even if the fqn of these 2 classes are equal they are not considered as the same classes that is the reason why expectedclass.isassignablefrom clazz returns false
i must admit that i have no idea what is the exact version of gatein you used to meet this issue but anyway i could reproduce this issue with gatein-3.2.0.final-tomcat7 by simply keeping on purpose portlet-api-2.0.jar in the web-inf lib directory of my war file

14567075
octal	decimal
since 9 isn t a valid digit for octal numbers that might be what s going on
try printing out the decimal value of 010l and see whether is says 8 to confirm

14567305
cmmotionmanager	uiaccelerometer
in comparison you are using the shared uiaccelerometer which won t ever be gc ed while you re creating your own cmmotionmanager which could be
there s not enough source code to see if you keep a reference to your cmmotionmanager instance

14569386
serializable	deserialization
i have rolled back the project to the initial state without classes map or custom serializable and changed the struct type to class type and it worked
in resume this exception error is related to structs deserialization not with interfaces deserialization

14570620
ssl	https
i thought i would post my answer to my problems with wordpress https for those that maybe stuck like i was for days. you must when using https on a wordpress have a vaild ssl certificate we bought one from rapidssl for 16 per year. without the valid ssl certificate we were constantly getting 310 errors from browswrs like google complaining about redirect loops
once ssl was installed these went away. the wordpress site url and wordpress home link did not have to be changed from http at all

14570620
ssl	https
once ssl was installed these went away. the wordpress site url and wordpress home link did not have to be changed from http at all
using the wordpress https plugin for the secure pages that we needed ticked the boxes in edit page to force ssl and with everything ticked in https settings except admin ssl login

14571635
svg	vml
if you need browser supported zoom and size of your map exceeds 3000px then canvas does not work and you have to use svg
if you need ie7-8 then you have to use vml it is only supported graphics mode there

14574460
innodb	myisam
i m also assuming you re using innodb tables because myisam tables wouldn t support transactions anyway
every ddl or dml operation on a myisam table implicitly commits immediately

14575332
comparator	comparable
if you look at the documentation for treemap you ll see it says constructs a new empty tree map ordered according to the given comparator
all keys inserted into the map must be mutually comparable by the given comparator comparator.compare k1 k2 must not throw a classcastexception for any keys k1 and k2 in the map

14575586
realloc	malloc
it means that the code is attempting to free something that was not allocated using malloc realloc
in your case i think the problem is in which should be probably also want to check the result of realloc just for form

14576120
bmp	png
bmp is not supported in silverlight
bmp is a very old and not a very efficient format compared with png jpg so they have not bothered to support it

14576120
bmp	png
bmp is a very old and not a very efficient format compared with png jpg so they have not bothered to support it
silverlight only supports jpg png format images the best way to display them is to convert them on the web server so they can be served up as pngs

14577919
realloc	malloc
you can try to change the size of a block by using realloc but that s not deleting an arbitrary part of that block
if both the array and the indicvidual items in the array have been allocated using malloc then your approach is correct

14579406
g++	gcc
i d suggest instead being explicit using but it should be default for g++ -ansi so not really different
but generally i ve never seen anything that would be accepted by newer gcc and rejected by older gcc on the grounds of being invalid

14581095
tostring	string.format
i ve found that you can still use old-style format strings with the numberformatinfo class - it s just that inexplicably it doesn t work when you use tostring
if you use string.format instead then it works

14583117
profiling	instrumentation
the mono profiling only measures managed objects while the allocations object measures most but not all native allocations in addition to the managed ones
if the number of uiwebview instances go down in the mono profiling but not in instrumentation it means native code is holding a reference to those instances preventing them from getting released

14583117
profiling	instrumentation
if the number of uiwebview instances go down in the mono profiling but not in instrumentation it means native code is holding a reference to those instances preventing them from getting released
i suggest you enable the record reference count option in the allocations instrumentation and then investigate the retaincount when the uiwebview instances only show up in instrumentation - you need to pair each retain call with a release call but there will be at least one you can t pair up and that s the one you re looking for

14583171
dbcontext	objectcontext
but you can do the same using the dbcontext api
applycurrentvalues is an objectcontext api method so first you have to gain access to the objectcontext that is wrapped in the dbcontext note that the wrapped context does not have members like accounts so you have to use the objectcontext method itself

14584642
subtract	addition
so subtract it from current time will return same value as current time
do not use setting of string type to store timespan object as habib already stated subtraction or addition of datetime objects produces timespan

14587069
client-side	server-side
i do not access the api directly from the client-side portion of the web application javascript in the web browser
instead i access the api server-side and store the api key encrypted in a secure configuration file

14588026
clang	llvm
a good place to start with how do i do this c-like thing in llvm ir questions is to first write what you want to do in c then compile it to llvm ir via clang and take a look at the result
in your particular instance the file will compile to so we can see the clang compiled g to receive not an array

14588440
sudo	passwd
anyway if the pg_hba.conf file does not have that line edit the file add it and reload the service with sudo service postgresql reload
then you should be able to log in with psql as the postgres superuser with this shell command sudo -u postgres psql once inside psql issue the sql command alter user postgres passwd newpassword

14590493
implements	extends
a class is a type but a type isn t necessary a class since class implements type
basically your mytype could also be any of the implementing classes of the interfaces genericarraytype parameterizedtype typevariable or wildcardtype since they all extends the type interface

14590911
mp4	webm
the methods suggested by that msdn article referenced earlier seem to be directed towards this issue but in testing each of those methods none of them fixed the problem of an ie9 browser playing an mp4 video file
the solution to my problem came from this stack overflow ticket html5 video not working only in ie9 i actually had to add the following lines to the .htaccess file on the website addtype video ogg .ogv addtype video mp4 .mp4 addtype video mp4 .mov addtype video webm .webm then i also needed to make sure that the first line of code used this .

14596449
listview	gridview
the gridview does not support all the same stuff that listview supports which is what makes this so difficult
you could crack open the android listview source code and try and replicate what they do

14601722
noexcept	throw
remark the expression inside noexcept is equivalent to
the standard does not generally guarantee that swap doesn t throw

14604552
sum	coalesce
that means in particular that assumptions like used disk space is equal or even close to the sum of the sizes of all files free disk space can be allocated completely to a newly-created file or an existing file could be grown by that amount a size change growth or truncation of a file would be reflected in an equal change of free used disk space free disk space is an exact exactly knowable quantity total disk space is constant are incorrect
that s because the filesystem is free to implement techniques like compression - makes used space less than the sum of file sizes and makes exact free space unknowable because compression ratios of future data to be written can t be predicted deduplication - similar effect on used free disk space snapshots - makes the filesystem retain deleted data so disk space isn t freed even though you think you released space previously used by your files sparse files - old technique could call it zeroes compression don t allocate disk space if all that s written are zeroes space reservations - the filesystem may set aside a certain amount of space for use only by privileged apps users and or only to be used through specific interfaces online filesystem resizing - might grow shrink the total amount of disk available to the filesystem live defragmentation - might coalesce used space block redistribution - for flash devices might lead to coalescing on erase block level and allow the flash ftl to free space journal rolling - might either free up or increase usage depending on the types of transactions in the log .

14605195
apache	nginx
i would recommend checking apache server status right after failure service httpd status
not much details for better judgement but one of likely scenarios would be that apache fails on nth request so nginx cannot forward request to apache and returns 502 bad gateway to you

14605195
apache	nginx
not much details for better judgement but one of likely scenarios would be that apache fails on nth request so nginx cannot forward request to apache and returns 502 bad gateway to you
the apache failure may be both programmatic and misconfiguration issue

14614342
haskell	agda
while hammar s answer is a correct port of the haskell code the definition of is too limited compared to since it doesn t support dependent functions
when adapting code from haskell that s a standard necessary change if you want to apply your abstractions to the functions you can write in agda

14614393
apache	nginx
so probably something went wrong when apache tried to send data to nginx or when nginx tried to send information to apache
as i never worked with nginx before i also did not think of checking the nginx log files

14616736
innodb	myisam
what you were doing on the myisam table cannot be done with innodb
see my answer on a similar problem creating primary key based on date mysql docs in the using auto_increment section explain it for myisam tables you can specify auto_increment on a secondary column in a multiple-column index

14617976
rspec	capybara
this is not an rspec problem rather an request integration vs functional controller spec issue
capybara or more specifically request or integration specs do not provide access to the request methods like put or get - these are only in controller specs that live specs controllers

14618056
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately ubuntu 12.10 doesn t seem to include this library either
it remains to be seen if the debian ffmpeg maintainer will keep using that fork or if they ll switch back to original ffmpeg that contains libswresample as well as for full compatibility libavresample

14619490
stateless	stateful
a stateless protocol does not require the server to retain session information or status about each communications partner for the duration of multiple requests
in contrast a protocol which requires the keeping of internal state is known as a stateful protocol

14619778
armadillo	openblas
if you already have armadillo installed on your machine have a look at usr include armadillo_bits or usr local include armadillo_bits
armadillo doesn t prevent openblas from using more cores

14619778
armadillo	openblas
armadillo doesn t prevent openblas from using more cores
it s possible that the current implementation of openblas simply chooses 2 cores for certain operations

14624944
spaces	delimiter
they might not be the spaces character but tabs etc
use preg_split with the delimiter

14626429
udp	tcp
since udp is not connection oriented you can start sending packet and reciving so the nat will think one packet is a reply form the other
see udp hole punching also to make udp as reliable as tcp you can use an implementation of tcp over udp

14626809
client-side	server-side
you can t put a client-side action in between server-side code
your code prepares the client-side confirm but doesn t send it to the browser until the response is completed

14627362
awt	swing
awt is not mvc based
swing works faster

14627362
awt	swing
awt does not work faster
swing components are light weight

14630757
lisp	scheme
f 1 2 is not valid in lisp
some lisp dialects like scheme allow that

14631504
comparator	comparable
from the treemap javadocs ...map performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal.
and from the comparable javadocs thanks brian it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals

14632097
firefox	safari
safari nightly also has it functioning edit stupid compass forgot the prefixes references nb as of firefox 21.0a1 it does not support flex-wrap at least you can validate the property works
it seems that as of today the flex-flow property is one that isn t in on firefox at least the cr 2012 version

14634001
decoder	encoder
you could make a decoder but not an encoder because encode only takes images binaries or strings
maybe just having a decoder is enough for you though

14635398
.htaccess	httpd.conf
addtype application x-httpd-php .php .php3 .phtml .html you could probably add it to an .htaccess in the docroot of you site as well but i ve not tried this personally
you can enable parsing of php in files with .html extensions in your httpd.conf file

14636535
mp4	webm	h.264	webm
internet explorer 9+ supports all profiles of h.264 video and either aac or mp3 audio in an mp4 container
it will also play webm video if you install a third-party codec which is not installed by default on any version of windows

14640492
daemons	systemd
i generally get this error when the mongo daemons is not running
try running something like this sudo mongod --fork --logpath var log mongodb.log --logappend the method used to automatically start on systemd boot will vary depending on your os

14641936
prepare	execute
identical code except with set to without the extra bits around it. if you re trying to dynamically declare a stored procedure in the more general case you may or may not have better luck using dbi s do method instead of prepare execute to declare it and then running it with execute as a separate step
i m not particularly familiar with pl sql but i do know that your sql string looks an awful lot like multiple statements and as a security precaution dbi will only execute one statement at a time

14642269
base	fractions
the trivial example def bob puts time.now.strftime m s. n sleep 1.0e-6 puts time.now.strftime m s. n end produces 31 07.373858000 31 07.373936000 31 08.430110000 31 08.430183000 31 09.062000000 31 09.062079000 31 09.638078000 31 09.638156000 so as you can see even just a base ruby version on my machine running nothing but a simple io line doesn t reliably give me microsecond speeds
you can get fractions second resolution with celluloid

14644455
vim	emacs
no this isn t possible in vim
i think emacs has this separation where you can connect multiple clients to a single server

14647364
profiling	debugging
my few observations in favour of stored procedures after some time of project life in most cases the bottleneck is the database not the web server - and stored procedures are much much faster using sql profiling with orm generated sql queries is very difficult
this is easy with stored procedures you can deploy a fix for stored procedure instantly without a service window for performance it is easier to optimize a stored procedure than orm-code you may have many applications using the same db stored procs any complex data scenario is a vote for stored procedures in favour of application orm you may use code repository with stored procs it is still possible but expensive java c# language is a better tool to express business logic java c# is easier to debugging except for the dynamically-generated orm sql independence of database engine however this is not very likely that a project will change database to another one orm provides data model which is easy to use in my opinion for large projects - go for stored procedures for the others - application orm will work fine

14647730
opera	safari
to support this onbeforeunload in opera though the onunload event doesn t work completely you can use onunload to show a warning if a user clicks a link to navigate away from a page with an unsaved form
onunload not working in safari .

14649172
google-chrome	firefox
this works only in firefox not in google-chrome webkit or ie
if you replace display none by visibility hidden then it ll also work in google-chrome but still not in ie

14650493
draggable	droppable
the problem about draggable is that all it does is move items around in a free space and doesn t concern itself with ordering
droppable can help but that s more concerned with figuring out if an object is inside of a container

14655102
punctuation	words
this is not tested but it should solve the case where the words has punctuation
it is also more robust because it iterates accommodates for files longer than 3 lines long and it also removes any 4 letter words instead of only the ones you know about

14655471
jar	war
this jar is not needed
you can remove it from your build path and your war directory

14657796
gruntjs	package.json
would suggest you may want to look into using a build tool such as gruntjs to perform the various tasks
it s not possible to specify dependencies as global from a package.json

14659261
apache	nginx
if apache is not a requirement then you can use another server for example nginx
there is a tutorial for getting nginx running on an ec2 environment

14659261
apache	nginx
if the ssl certificate does not have to be signed you can create a self-signed certificate here is an example of tutorial where you can stop after the step that creates the certificate or if you want to use apache proceed with all the steps
some good tutorials here is a start to finish - serving django with iwsgi nginx on ec2

14662870
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is not in safari or google-chrome but rather firefox doesn t handle margin-top in percentage properly
i tried setting margin-top 100 and only safari and google-chrome mac version render the label below the switch

14665409
google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox doesn t seem to have a problem but google-chrome seem to
as a result google-chrome doesn t execute the javascript and submits the form always

14667964
uiview	cashapelayer	cashapelayer	calayer
using cgcontext in either way isn t wrong and there probably are cases in which it s best but cashapelayer is the easiest way for most purposes particularly in cocoa touch where every uiview is backed by a calayer that you could put the cashapelayer into
yes the cashapelayer will draw the path into a context for you

14669941
layoutparams	viewgroup
notice that you still need to provide a viewgroup because it will be used to determine the value of the layoutparams
when you provide a viewgroup to be used as the parent the view returned by inflate is this parent vg in your case and not the newly created view

14677811
hex	binary
if you are going to filter for such binary attributes it is mandatory to declare every single byte that has to be compared in hex code
for instance if you search for objects with the attribute inventory which has the value 0x01aaf5ef then the appropriate filter will have to read unfortunately wildcard search is not allowed when searching for binary attributes

14679446
implements	extends
it really isn t that different from implements a traverasable
there are only two abstract method on linearseq and three on linearseqlike which you should also extends

14681064
knitr	latex
you cannot let latex call knitr or r
what knitr does is to parse your document for r code and evaluate the code

14681086
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
instead if you shift your viewwillappear operations into your viewdidappear methods assuming they don t effect the ux then the lag will not happen
check your viewwillappear methods if there are lot of things going on there then there ll be a lag when you switch tabs

14683334
udp	tcp
it s true but successful reassembly is only guaranteed by tcp and it doesn t raise the upper limit of udp use tcp
i have read somewhere that i can send over than 65k data not via udp you can t

14687478
translation	localization
you can always do it in different way by using only the db-based texts to not bother about changing defaults in your code and translation in database because it s easy to miss something when resources are in few places
when i was checking code of nopcommerce maybe 2 years ago i ve seen that when they do localization with resources from database only

14688122
innodb	myisam
the main difference is that innodb is capable of transactions
which means that statements can get reverted when anything fails while this is not possible with myisam

14689275
spaces	delimiter
to interpret i m trying to split a string that can either be comma spaces or semi-colon delimiter
it could also contain a spaces or spaces after each delimiter literally try this has the property that consecutive delimiter except white spaces will not be treated as a single delimiter

14693253
passenger	unicorn
12 you see for unicorn in the unicorn.rb config file set worker_processes 10 for passenger under nginx in your config set for passenger under apache in your passenger apache config passengermaxpoolsize 10 if this doesn t answer your question tell us what application server or ruby infrastructure you are running
both passenger unicorn and other popular ruby app servers allow you to configure the maximum number of worker processes

14694416
set	bag
a similar approach with a bag instead of a set will get you counts
retainall collection coll remove any members of the bag that are not in the given collection respecting cardinality

14695581
hive	hdfs
somehow the gzip files were not fully getting decompressed in map reduce jobs hive or custom java map reduce
mapreduce job would only read about 450 mb of the gzip file and write out the data out to hdfs without fully reading the 3.5gz file

14698249
vsto	add-in
further troubleshooting enable your vsto log file by adding the following on your system environment variables name vsto_logalerts value 1 there might be an exception error that is why your add-in is not loading
you can check this source for more info on vsto logging and alerts but in essence you change two environment variable values depending on what you need to do displaying vsto alert prompts to display each error in a message box set the vsto_suppressdisplayalerts variable to 0 zero

14698663
memcpy	memmove
you cannot memcpy memory that is overlapping that is the purpose of memmove
nevertheless you can use memcpy as long as the copy occurs in the right order

14700441
google-chrome	firefox
oh i forgot to mention -- we can t use datatransfer.getdata on google-chrome to get our dragstart set html -- it appears to be some kind of weird bug in the specification
firefox calls the spec out on it s bullcrap and gives us the data anyways -- but google-chrome doesn t so we bend over backwards and to set the content to a global and go through hell to kill all the default behavior.

14710561
datamapper	activerecord
yes because you used datamapper now your app depends on datamapper
understand that because activerecord is the default that many other gems build on activerecord to do their thing so they may not work with datamapper

14710561
datamapper	activerecord
understand that because activerecord is the default that many other gems build on activerecord to do their thing so they may not work with datamapper
that is not datamapper s fault or rails

14712242
aggregate-functions	sum
if you change the aggregate-functions to max then it should work see sql fiddle with demo if you want to create this as a function then you can use see sql fiddle with demo the result is | outputtablesid | 1 | 2 | 3 | 25 | ---------------------------------------------- | 236 | text | text | text | text |
your code is very close but you are trying to use a sum on a varchar which will not work

14713331
super	implements
i would like to request the super users not to delete the answer as that could help others who wants to find the solution for their issues.
i have implements the the following custom security manager using key-value pair dictionary collection for caching

14714532
google-chrome	firefox
but as you can check in this issue in chromium as of now it is not supperted in google-chrome and they seem to be in no hurry as priority is 2 normal
according to mozilla developer network it is supported in google-chrome with prefix webkit in firefox 11+ with prefix moz and in firefox 16+ without any prefix

14714970
innodb	myisam
however it is a strange choice to make the posts table innodb
mixing the types can be beneficial as myisam tends to be faster on tables that are not changed that often

14717205
google-chrome	firefox
referenceerror cufon is not defined error permission denied to access property tostring you also have similar errors on google-chrome s developer tool but firefox stops working and doesn t load the rest of the resources after encountering an error
the solution for you is to fix the errors listed in the js console in the firefox firebug developer tool

14718010
jar	war
entries in a jar war are not files
you should refer to properties and any other kind of resource in a war using clojure.java.io resource instead of clojure.java.io file or a bare path string

14719651
pthreads	fork
since the pthreads implementation of multiprocessing uses fork without exec to create child processes this would explain why it fails on os x but not linux
and on windows there is no fork just a spawn equivalent so this isn t an issue. the simplest solution would be to drop multiprocessing

14722325
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
i recently faced a problem that was difficult to reproduce and changed some variables who were initialized in my viewdidload method and for who i couldn t understand that they were changing
possible methods to init variables in your viewcontroller are - init - viewdidload - viewwillappear - viewdidappear to explain my point i started a new project with the template tab bar application

14722336
prng	random
two fixes i can think of instead of generating random numbers mod 4 generate them mod 4 length and extract the bit pairs use a better prng like std mersenne_twister_engine
disclaimer i m not an expert on random numbers

14723007
git-svn	svn2git
after spending a number of hours on this trying various methods for performing the conversion i did not try thekbb s proposed solution because i had not seen it before i found an answer i ended up ditching git-svn and going with subgit which converted the whole repository first time without any hassles
i don t want to get into hot water here by pitching one against the other but i will say my experience with subgit has been far better than that with git-svn or the wrapper svn2git

14723889
mayavi	matplotlib
i d really propose to use mayavi instead
i cannot definitely deny that this is possible in matplotlib but it s definitely not the intent of mpl

14723945
clang	llvm
edit apparently i m mistaken and clang does use some other integer types as well see jens s comment below
yes llvm does not make a distinction between signed and unsigned integer type so both will be lowered to i32

14723986
allocator	stl
because allocator_traits itself cannot be specialized users always have to pass a fully defined allocator policy in order to customize their containers memory allocator and no silent odr violations can occur
note that as a library-writer one can still specialize traits class templates as the stl does in but it is good practice to pass all user-defined specializations through policy classes into multi-valued traits that can extract the specialized behavior as the stl does in

14725354
pandas	pytables
that said pytables as well as numpy pandas were not thought to be used that way
pandas is really just a wrapper around numpy.ndarray

14725655
udp	tcp
for such a route i search in all connections tcp than udp if not found in tcp for connection using this route the first end point is my host address
nota this won t work with ppp connections nota2 this won t work on a totally quiet host without any opened network connection. you could do something like for ensuring that something where found in proc net tcp

14730771
actionscript	mxml
the metadata isn t set up so you ll have to add the event listener in actionscript
you should be able to use the dot notationin mxml to accomplish this i m pretty sure this syntax was introduced in flex 4

14731001
scheme	racket
there is a more extensive list at schemewiki but that page does not immediately provide command-line invocation syntax. here s how you run a number of implementations at the command line chez scheme scheme petite mit scheme mit-scheme scheme 48 scheme48 rscheme rs racket racket but i recommend trying the racket ide especially for beginners. guile guile bigloo bigloo chicken csi gambit gsi gauche gosh ironscheme ironscheme.console kawa kawa java kawa.repl larceny larceny scm scm
most scheme interpreters that i am familiar with can be run from the command line

14734236
implements	extends
generally what happens is that if you have shared functionality you abstract that and put the code in static methods another package a library implements the functionality against which you link your app a content provider you should explicitly not implements this functionality in the application class
there are uses for extends the application but doing so results in code smell and is a common antipattern for beginners

14742828
super	implements
sending a message using super is the same as sending it to self but explicitly uses the superclass method implementation
but your class probably doesn t implements the -class method itself so you re already inheriting the implementation of -class from your superclass already

14743617
opera	google-chrome
everything works correctly for me in safari 6.0.2 firefox 18.0.2 mac firefox 10.0.1 win opera 12.12 mac and ie 9
as well as and embeds are not displaying correctly in google-chrome 24.0.1312.57 mac win or 26.0.1405.0 canary mac whereas embeds are working fine

14743879
super	self
super a self .do_work will call the do_work function as seen by the parent class of a - that is object.do_work which probably doesn t exist and thus would likely raise an exception
super b self .do_work will call the do_work function as seen by the parent class of b - that is a.do_work

14746264
mp3	wav
naudio does not come with an mp3 encoder or decoder - it simply gives you access to the codecs that are already installed on your system
until windows 8 windows did not ship with an mp3 encoder so your best option was to convert to wav using something like lame.exe

14746444
sudo	passwd
edit seems that sudo accept passwd from stdin use the -s flag
seems sudo doesn t accept passwd by pipe so following the documentation normally if sudo requires a passwd it will read it from the user s terminal

14746444
sudo	passwd
seems sudo doesn t accept passwd by pipe so following the documentation normally if sudo requires a passwd it will read it from the user s terminal
if the -a askpass option is specified a possibly graphical helper program is executed to read the user s passwd and output the passwd to the standard output

14749213
email	dkim
there are also third-party email hosts you can use that specialize in making sure web-app related email gets delivered
to get my web app s emails through the gmail spam filter i had to 1 set up dkim on mail server and sign all outgoing emails 2 set up spf records 3 make sure emails are multipart contain both html and plaintext not just html 4 make sure html email is formatted correctly html open and close tags etc.

14754647
consistency	acid
but if only store the paths ids to external files that are not managed by the db you lose acid consistency one or more db records could point to one or more files that aren t there or one or more files could exist that don t have one or more associated records in the database
another argument for storing files on the file system is that you can stream files but pg large object stores files on the filesystem in a way managed by postgres to both ensure acid consistency and allow streaming which you can t do with a normal blob rails binary type

14755895
setinterval	settimeout
second these methods return a token that you can use to cancel a setinterval do this instead later when you want to stop
first you are using settimeout not setinterval

14756423
bash	zsh
unfortunately bash has no built-in which like zsh which tells me immediately that kill is a built-in shell command and usr bin which has no way to know of your shell built-ins
i hope that bash has something equivalent for quick checks whether command is built-in or not

14759281
bash	tcsh
if you re going to use bash set path using in .bashrc and or in .bash_profile
you source your script which is perfectly valid for into your running shell which happens to be bash and not tcsh

14759281
bash	tcsh
you source your script which is perfectly valid for into your running shell which happens to be bash and not tcsh
if you re going to use tcsh just run it by typing tcsh and ensure that your .tcshrc has the desired effect

14760176
textview	imageview
if i read it correctly and you are referring to this scrollview your textview s layout_width was set to 0dip when you need a wrap_content or static width
also your textview q1question was not attached to the right of imageview q1image

14760232
move	drag
dragging a file from one group to another does not move it to a different folder on the disk
it simply moves a reference to a file with a certain name to another group which might mean that after you drag a file you haven t really moved it or copied or relocated it in any way you ve just moved an alias from a place where it could resolve properly to a real file to a place where it can t

14761868
postgresql	mysql
this is the same behavior as with other databases according to my test postgresql and derby
there are some databases that do support what you want mysql for example but this is not part of the sql standard

14764821
ssl	https
redirecting calls to ssl in normal pages and it doesn t affect direct file url for images this way
you appear to have configured your server to force https possibly via .htaccess

14765150
cpython	ironpython
note that this is a cpython implementation detail and not strictly speaking part of the language python itself
for example jython and ironpython have no gil and can fully exploit multiprocessor systems

14766131
mp4	webm
it has capability to stream mp4 webm ogg files without the need of server side players such as jwplayer etc
does not require flash installed in client browser also provive light weight flash player for browsers and devices that do not support html5 its open source and free to stream videos from s3 in mp4 format with videojs player check this howto

14767927
implements	extends
first you should be absolutely sure that adapterview is what you want because not all dynamic or not pre-determined views can be implements via adapterview
sometimes you d better create your view extends viewgroup

14771554
jar	manifest.mf
this can be set in the main jar in meta-inf manifest.mf as class-path so you do not need to add it from the command line. look with 7zip into the jar
the current run has to happen from the build directory with main jar and lib subdirectory

14772837
octal	decimal
in c numbers starting with 0 are in base 8 octal not decimal
so your number 0126 is indeed 86 in decimal

14772921
onclick	onchange
here s an example working jsfiddle example one more thing do not use onclick .
or onchange .

14774042
serializable	deserialization
in this section i want to discuss some of the points others have brought forward as arguments for using lazy initialization unconditionally serializable ericj states in one comment an object that may be serializable will not have it s contructor invoked when it is deserialized depends on the serializable but many common ones behave like this
putting initialization code in the constructor means that you have to provide additional support for deserialization

14774251
viewdidload	viewdidappear
seems like i m asleap at work again the effect of doing things in the other methods do not apply since the statusbar are already displayed by the calling from viewdidload
i did remove the code from there and then got the desired effect from viewdidappear

14775112
implements	extends
step 1 create a custom class for scroll view step 2 create a scroll view listener interface step 3 add the view in your layout step 4 implements that interface in your class and you are done
scroll view does not provide any method to check if you ve reached bottom of the view so the best technique is to extends your own custom view with scroll view

14775696
setinterval	settimeout
the advantage of this pattern over or a setinterval call is that only a single timer event is ever queued at once
in general repeated calls to settimeout are better than a single call to setinterval for a few reasons setinterval calls can queue up multiple events even if the browser isn t active which then all fire as quickly as possibly when the browser becomes active again

14775696
setinterval	settimeout
in general repeated calls to settimeout are better than a single call to setinterval for a few reasons setinterval calls can queue up multiple events even if the browser isn t active which then all fire as quickly as possibly when the browser becomes active again
calling settimeout recursively guarantees that the minimum time interval between events is honoured

14780135
super	implements
so you can perform cast between them provided you are not breaking the rules at runtime that is having the super class reference holding the reference to some other sub class instance which is not covariant with the sub class you are casting to
now for your example since the treemap also implements the navigablemap interface which is a sub interface of map interface so you can use it instead of map interface

14781467
email	dkim
some email services will automatically reject any mails without spfs and dkim
technically gmail is exactly the same as any other email service when it comes to the protocol so i guess it s not a code-related problem

14781467
email	dkim
technically gmail is exactly the same as any other email service when it comes to the protocol so i guess it s not a code-related problem
what i d check is your outgoing email server and domain especially two things spf records dkim signature these are email forgery prevention techniques

14782325
bash	zsh
works in ksh and zsh but not in bash
in bash variable expansion always happens after brace expansion

14782503
hex	binary
write base64-decoded value to the file and open it in hex editor. public key for p256 curve should be 65-byte array starting from byte with value 4 which means non-compressed point next 32 bytes would be x value and next 32 - y value
not all of characters are shown since they are binary

14783508
hex	binary
however this doesn t mean that the firmware blob is the result of some übergeek furiously punching in hex code all day long these files most often start their lives in toolchains that support a workflow that is quite comparable to regular programming source code is produced in some higher language but not necessarily one of the common ones like c or c++ and that code gets compiled to a binary file - the firmware file
so although this may be a neat trick to wow people at the first barbecue of the summer the practical applications of programming hex are close to nonexistent if you really want to go deep assembly is more than deep enough

14785369
onclick	onsubmit
it works because the input hides the form s submit function so any call to form.submit calls the submit button s onclick function instead std behavior for all browsers
because it s a submit button it causes the form s onsubmit event to fire which would not normally happen if you called form.submit directly

14786765
implements	extends
as far as i know you cannot configure this in japerreports server as is you d need to implements some logic around import control validation which might be rather complex given the fact that input control rendering is based on a single template and lots of configuration
however you can implements the desired validation easily in the report itself create another parameter datediff that contains as default expression the calculation of the date difference in months the parameter needs to be specified below the 2 date parameters the way to utilize this information depends now on your particular report design here an example extends your report query with where clause

14787338
pthreads	fork
if you want a supervisord-like process manager that runs on most pthreads os and is python-based like supervisord then you should look at honcho which is a python port of foreman ruby-based it works great on mac linux but actually not yet windows.
editing my initial answer where i had said optimistically it was already working on windows based on a pull request that has been discarded since there is a fork that provides windows support here and some work in progress to support windows here .

14790953
strdup	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
instead you cound use memcpy or strcpy or in your case even strdup
strncpy is always wrong if the result is too long the target string will not be nul-terminated if the target is too long the third argument the trailing end will be completely padded with nuls

14792027
factors	mean
when you get to hundreds of kilobytes the timing increases by a factors of 3-10
if you aren t sending huge amounts and i mean megabytes every minute of data or extremely often hundreds of packets every minute i would expect the send or write to be fairly quick

14792355
super	implements
the abstractthreadedsyncadapter the syncadapter super class was simply not written to handle multiple authorities
it contains a final isyncadapterimpl class that was implements as a singleton so every time startsync is called a sync will occur using the same authority

14794462
queue	fifo
more generally the implementation shown is not how a queue works
queues are fifo no need for a position parameter

14795105
udp	tcp
moreover if you are sending requests this quickly consider using udp over tcp
tcp requests take much longer in my experience due to overhead of ensuring that a packet is delivered but if you loose one or two it s not a huge deal for you if your average case performance is much better 90 of the time you see updates every 100ms

14795653
ubuntu	linux
i can t speak directly to ubuntu 12.04 but in general you can download the linux sources as a package for your distro and it shouldn t require you to download install gcc
failing that you can manually download the linux headers for the version of your kernel uname -a and use an include directive to cflags to specify the directory to look for those

14796411
ienumerable	iqueryable
possible solutions rewrite the query to not use asenumerable if you want an iqueryable returned or you could change the return type to be ienumerable if that is a better fit for your problem
your problem is the call to asenumerable - it converts the iqueryable to a ienumerable

14796411
ienumerable	iqueryable
your problem is the call to asenumerable - it converts the iqueryable to a ienumerable
and therefore you cannot return it as an iqueryable

14796601
comparator	comparable
this class guarantees that the map will be in ascending key order sorted according to the natural order for the key s class see comparable or by the comparator provided at creation time depending on which constructor is used
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface

14796601
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

14798327
pbkdf2	md5	scrypt	md5
i would go with such an approach or similar scrypt or pbkdf2 if i were you
hashing algorithms such as sha1 and md5 are not suitable for password storing

14798348
charat	indexof
you cannot find characters using charat - it s for getting a character once you know where it is
you need to use indexof for finding positions of characters

14803723
hex	binary
it isn t in hex in the array
it is binary in the array

14805339
calloc	malloc
you can use calloc to automatically clear the memory or memset to clear it manually
malloc doesn t clear the memory so you get garbage in your allocated blocks

14806083
comparator	comparable
the idea is that if you have objects with a natural sort anything that extends comparable you can just ask for the sorting otherwise you can just pass in a comparator that describes how you want objects compared with any custom logic you want roughly - this is off the top of my head and doesn t have error checking but should be enough to give you the idea -
the simplest way to do this in java or at least with the least mess is to use a custom comparator

14806924
activemq	rabbitmq
first a disclaimer - my experience is around sonicmq activemq and tibcorv
i saw your question as an opportunity to spend some time investigating what rabbitmq has to offer which i have not used in anger to date

14809913
n-gram	words
this is not the same as using n-gram features in a classifier indeed using a classifier isn t usually done or really necessary at least not in the conventional sense
the reason for this is that often just a few characters can be sufficient to do language identification whereas bag-of-words based classifiers and more so bag-of-ngrams require the same words or phrases to be used as were seen in training

14815186
sum	coalesce
select coalesce sum t.optlevel 0 + coalesce ....
without understanding your question there s this cool function coalesce which returns the first of its parameters which is not null

14817340
viewmodel	caliburn
for example here is part of a sample viewmodel from my app this will allow you to not worry about initializing the metadata store in every viewmodel since it is all done in one place
coming from a silverlight background where i used a lot of wcf ria services combined with caliburn micro i used this approach for integrating breeze with durandal

14817545
nfa	dfa
this is not true for nfa s a is dfa of l d is for complement note to construct complement dfa old dfa must be a complete means there should all possible out going edge from each state or in other words δ should be a complete function
complement reference with example complement dfa for regular expression below is dfa named a but not this dfa is not complete dfa

14823444
implements	extends
in other not to implements everything you can use a mouseadapter which implements mouselistener and other interfaces but already providing stub methods
mouseclicked mouseentered etc.. following your edit class basic_book extends jframe implements actionlistener mouselistener use a comma to separate the interfaces

14823859
scheme	racket
but one could claim that this mistake is easy to make in scheme because the language encourages the use of lists and pairs to represent everything and so there are not always safeguards stopping you from passing a coordinate one kind of list into a spot where a coordinatelist another kind of list is expected
some dialects of scheme such as typed racket provide ways for the user to define datatypes statically so that the compiler can again provide such assistance. of course in languages like c the type system is primarily in place in order to tell the compiler how to layout objects in memory

14823859
scheme	racket
structure definitions via syntax extension and in other scheme dialects even though r5rs scheme does not have a special form for declaring structures r5rs does define a macro system where one might define such record syntax
also several scheme dialects such as racket and chez provide linguistic extensions for defining structured data known as records

14824200
equals	compareto
so in order to fix this we need to test for equality between the keys note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface.
the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equal . since we originally overlooked equality in order to force the set to add equal valued entries now we have to test for equality in the keys in order for the set to actually return the entry you re looking for

octal	decimal
a leading zero on a numeric constant is automatically treated as octal and 8 is not a valid octal digit
in addition the superscript-2 character you re referring to is decimal 178 u+00b2

14826841
bash	zsh
the directory containing an up-to-date git is probably not present in variable for zsh but it is in bash
it s likely caused by items being added in your .bashrc and or .bash_profile file which zsh doesn t source on startup

14826914
client-side	server-side
scorm requires a pure client-side solution with javascript handling course-to-lms communication
there is no best way to use php or any other server-side language in a scorm course and by using php your course will not be scorm-conformant

14827834
swt	swing
when i needed to play video not specifically from a webcam but it shouldn t matter in swt i used xuggler and converted the images it produced to swt format but it s currently not being developed further
the simplest option is to embed swing components in swt using swt_awt bridge

14836281
gmail	hotmail
second option is to use gmail smtp or hotmail smtp. i tried and failed miserably
i don t know why gmail doesn t work for me but i googled whole internet and found out that people randomly have problems with gmail

14839008
cassini	iis
cassini does not support https
instead you can use iis or iis express which do

14839117
equals	compareto
all you have to do is provide an equals and not equals object for the parent class to use for checking
since the compareto method is part of the comparable interface it s actually split out into another test case - the comparabilitytestcase

14840440
setinterval	settimeout
debugging is a bit easier as you re not interrupted by the continued firing of setinterval hope this helps
i wanted to respond to your comment about setinterval and flickering i have noticed that proper use of setinterval settimeout and even requestanimationframe allocates memory without my request and causes frequent garbage collection calls

14842056
g++	gcc
so running the gcc command automatically includes the c standard libraries running g++ automatically includes the c++ standard libraries etc
but notice running gcc does not automatically link in the c++ standard library

14842056
g++	gcc
if for some reason you want to use gcc and not g++ you ll have to explicitly state that you want the standard library using a flag like -lstdc++
also unless you really want gcc and you re installing the latest versions of it yourself on os x you may want to switch over to clang clang++ and the libc++ implementation of the c++ standard library

14844003
implements	extends
pimple is designed to be accessed like an array it implements the arrayaccess interface
if you want a method-like interface instead simply extends pimple and use the __call magic method usage as for why pimple doesn t come with this functionality out of the box i have no idea

14846642
xlib	xcb
the xlib interface is blocking so you have to use an arcane sequence of function calls to read data check that there are events pending and then only read events from the queue if they exist otherwise your application will block until events appear
the xcb library is alternative to xlib which is much better all around and supports a non-blocking interface but it doesn t play well with opengl

14846908
innodb	myisam
innodb not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than myisam in many benchmarks
there was once a time many years ago when people thought of myisam as the faster storage engine

14847532
jar	war
the failure indicates that the jaxb engine was not initialized with information about this user class. . in this use case the class com.somecom.lib.business.xml.comidentifierxml is packaged in a jar at the ear level

14850202
client-side	server-side
html included by client-side javascript is not visible for search engines
generally speaking if you just want to include html once a requested webpage gets loaded use the server-side method using the include tag

14855927
uicollectionview	uitableview
the uicollectionview method is probably better but to be honest either option would require a lot of work
no this is not possible using uitableview as it was intended

14856320
sudo	passwd
you can make libreoffice work with sudo without requiring a passwd by adding this line to you sudoers file
you can do this with libreoffice for reasons not clear to me you might need to run this with sudo

14861459
implements	extends
it just means that the generic type parameter for any class that implements this interface must itself be a positionedvertex
the interface isn t extends itself

14862415
bash	subshell
assuming a bash -like shell the variables that you are looking to create do not exist when the while -loop exists
this is because you are piping the results and creating a subshell with a new environment which is not shared with the parent shell

14862509
serializable	deserialization
it is more a design approach than an implementation aproach but in this way you will completely decouple how the data is stored and you will avoid serializable issues and you will save kbs of network traffic etc
first of all is not a good idea to have data serialized on viewstate one reason is this deserialization missmatch your expriencing but the other problem is that the data is traveling to the server and going back on every postback

14862907
memcpy	strcpy
you probably want to be using something that forces a length like strncpy or memcpy
if not the strcpy call in rapi_strcpy may be running off the end and therefore copying beyond size allocated in the target

14863983
sudo	passwd
try this first sudo library startupitems mysqlcom mysqlcom start if that fails cd usr local mysql sudo . bin mysqld_safe enter your passwd if necessary press control-z bg i havent tried this but check this out if you are working with mamp and php - maybe even try a re-install and follow these docs - in addition plenty of brainstorming on this page -
try note the sudo mysql wouldn t let me start up the server without root access to both the computer and mysql itself

14864519
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
according to the javadoc for treeset note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

14865577
bash	subshell
and if your version of bash is new enough 4.2 or later there is an option that allows the while loop at the end of a pipeline to execute in the current shell not a subshell
you set the value of testerror in a subshell induced by your pipeline

14865889
printwriter	bufferedwriter
testing checkerror is good but you shouldn t really be using printwriter over a network at all because it swallows exceptions
it would be better to use bufferedwriter and let the exceptions tell you about things going wrong as they happen rather than on the next write as you are doing here

14874800
serializable	deserialization
when custom converters are registered javascriptserializer uses the converters both to serializable managed types and to deserialize json strings to managed types
and from javascriptconverter remarks the javascriptconverter class enables you to implement serialization and deserialization processes for managed types that are not natively supported by the javascriptserializer class

14875805
bash	subshell
if you re using ksh or bash they both support io redirection to from a socket using the dev tcp ip port construct
in this korn shell example i am redirecting no-op s std-in from a socket the shell prints an error if the socket is not open you can therefore use this as the test in an if condition the no-op is in a subshell so i can throw std-err away if the std-in redirection fails

rspec	capybara
one unrefactored and rspec flavored way to do this capybara.current_session.driver.delete controller_path model_instance capybara.current_session.driver.response.should be_redirect visit capybara.current_session.driver.response.location
just something to be aware of with mike mazur s answer if your controller does a redirect on the #destroy action invoking the delete method on capybara s driver doesn t actually follow the redirect

14881134
union	distinct
this shows that the return is which is a varchar2 which you can also see if you create a view if you convert the varchar2 returned by wm_concat into a clob the next problem is that oracle doesn t support doing a distinct on a clob column which is required in order to do a union
assuming that you don t really need to remove duplicate rows you can use a union all rather than a union

14882511
hex	binary
i have no idea why all the examples from zebra show the data as encoded into a hex representation
it s worth noting that most print servers hp jetdirect lantronix lps1-t and almost certainly the zebra built-in and external print servers will form a binary connection to the printer if you spit data at them on port 9100 using netcat for example you get no feedback from the printer except for the label having printed or not

14883290
elementtree	beautifulsoup
here s an elementtree approach it s easy to extend this to work from a list of files however this is a very poor and duplicate question
this is not html from what i can tell so i m not going to use beautifulsoup

avro	thrift
if you are not using java then you have to go with one of the other protocols - thrift rest avro etc
for example python has some libraries for thrift i recommend happybase as well as rest

14890057
innodb	myisam
writing to an innodb table tends to be slower
note i m merely pointing out that this is a potential cause of an application running slower i m not recommending that you change an innodb table to myisam

14890057
innodb	myisam
note i m merely pointing out that this is a potential cause of an application running slower i m not recommending that you change an innodb table to myisam
no transaction if using innodb you can speed up bulk operations by doing them inside a transaction

14890615
client-side	server-side
asp.net dropdownlist server control keeps it s options in the viewstate when you add options client-side they will not be in the viewsate when you post-back server-side
so you can either do a full postback to add options server-side best way is put the dropdownlist in an update panel so at least the full post-back goes via ajax use javascript to put the selected optoin into a hidden textbox and read that when you get server-side or you may be able to read the raw form data in request.form dropdownlistid but it s been a while so i m not certain of this one

14892493
implements	extends
finally to address your original question according to the phpseclib documentation the keys are null-padded to the closest valid size but i m not sure how to implements that in python
simply extends the length of the string with 6 spaces is not working

14894210
jsf	seam
however you have to keep in mind that cdi named + jsf viewscoped isn t working together without using seam 3 or apache myfaces codi
you need a converter here as jsf will assume strings by default that is the way you coded it

14897898
dictionary	map
i fixed the problem by replacing the none with an empty dictionary prior to insert the cql driver accepts empty dictionary fine as new value for a map type while none is not allowed even though querying the map column returns none if it is empty
returning none and not accepting none did not feel intuitive so later i decided to create custom wrapper for cursor.fetchone that returns a map of columns instead of a list of columns and also checks if maptype listtype or settype has returned none

14903409
memcpy	malloc
just as the size of the allocation returned by malloc is not changed when you call memcpy on the returned pointer
glbufferdata is like malloc

14904467
prepare	execute
when this is done the prepare phase will not be performed when the call to execute is made with none or the same string object as the statement
... cursor.executemany statement parameters prepare a statement for execution against a database and then execute it against all parameter mappings or sequences found in the sequence parameters

14905134
opera	google-chrome
so as you can see it s greatly different for each browser then there s all the outliers safari opera etc... let s not forget a lot of these browsers also are cross-platform and depending on how you attack the problem you may have to take that into account
it s also worth noting google-chrome is an asynchronous model each tab plugin lives isolated from each other and communicate using asynchronous messaging basically

14906191
bash	subshell
note that this is not strictly true in bash exporting a variable makes it an environement variable in the current shell but in other shells dash for example exporting the variable does not make it an environment variable in the current shell
it does cause it to be set it in the environment of subshell however. however in the context of the shell it does not really matter if a variable is an environment variable in the current process

14909045
g++	gcc
see equivalent of __declspec naked in gcc g++
the problem is here this doesn t compile because __declspec naked is a microsoft extension that is not supported by gcc

14910433
nunit	mstest
it could still be done via reflection if you are determined enough but it might just be simpler to use the technical restrictions around mstest to build a case to migrate your unit tests that require a sitecore context to nunit
according to this stackoverflow post the api used by mstest is sealed and private which is not going to help you in exposing a test runner that mimics the nunit testsuitebuilder functionality

14910564
super	implements
when switched on or off it automatically switches the internal mode in all existing and future js buffers defun my--mode-set-maybe my--mode if my-super-mode 1 0 define-minor-mode my-super-mode super mode only in effect in js buffers. nil nil global t dolist buf buffer-list with-current-buffer buf my--mode-set-maybe add-hook js-mode-hook my--mode-set-maybe
one solution that comes to mind is to define a buffer-local minor mode that implements the actual functionality but is not invoked directly by the user and its name prefixed by an internal prefix to prevent accidental triggering define-minor-mode my--mode mode implements blah invoke it with m-x my-super-mode. nil super nil

14913626
profiling	debugging
i decided then to profiling this as you can see almost the entire time is spent inside the .get_most_viewed method so that looks like the issue you ve got
could be wrong there but your profiling suggests that 2.028 out of 2.037 of the time is spent there so about 99.6 of the time my orm skills aren t really up to figuring out exactly how you ought to be dealing with that fairly complex query and would in any case need to see the model definitions but you need to look into debugging and simplifying that query rather than looking at other parts of the view

postorder	inorder
if you moved the print to after the loop it would be postorder
inorder would not make too much sense in this case

14915885
ssl	https
this openssl error indicates that wget sent the initial ssl clienthello message but gets an unexpected response from the server or proxy which was not an ssl serverhello message
this can be because the proxy speaks plain http with the client instead of https because of a configuration error with squid if port 443 is redirected to a http_port instead of https_port with the transparent option or because it does not support transparent proxying of ssl at all

14916462
innodb	myisam
you need to use innodb tables for real fk support
because myisam does not support foreign keys

octal	binary	octal	decimal
your number is not being interpreted as binary but rather octal base 8
octal 0110 is 72 in decimal or 1001000 in binary

14917319
octal	binary
it s common in programming languages that a leading zero means octal
depending on the language you are using there may or may not be a way to specify a binary literal

14917327
octal	binary
0110 is an octal constant because it starts with a zero this is python but the same is true of many other languages with octal constants java c javascript ...
not all languages provide binary constants

allocator	stl
stl containers use allocator to get memory space and create object
but note that as custom allocator is possible an allocator does not necessarily manage memory like new delete

14923979
memcpy	malloc
memcpy dst src dst- num_vertex sizeof vertex_type
original answer assuming vertex points to an array of vertices and that each vertice contains 3 longs x y z update because i realized this might work but isn t clean or especially safe as i mentioned in comments code would be cleaner if you had and then did dst- vertex vertex_type malloc dst- num_vertex sizeof vertex_type

14924043
prepare	execute
but prepare returns false on error
the value false isn t an object and doesn t have an execute method

14925160
awt	swing
if not there is something wrong with the awt gui support of your java rjava
at least a swing joptionpane test bring your rstudio in back and you should see a dialog window. if not there is something wrong with the swing support of your java rjava

14925910
implements	extends
perhaps a better solution would be to implements interleave yourself something like however i d say that even better solution would be not to mix operations and numbers
instead you could declare a special class for well-formed expression formed from your symbols something like untested sealed abstract class symbol sealed abstract class operation extends symbol case object add operation case object subtract extends operation case object multiply extends operation case object divide extends operation case class num val valu float extends symbol sealed abstract class expression

ssl	https
relative answer preparing my asp.net mvc site to use ssl
there is a nice module that can help you to switch automatically from http to https in asp.net i suggest to use http for all pages that have not to do with sensitive data and only https on the one that have sensitive data

14927010
vmware	virtualbox
btw for vmware .vmdk you need to use vmware-vdiskmanager -k xxx.vmdk to do the same
virtualbox does not automatically reclaim disk space on host when you delete files within the vm

14927066
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you actually need to call it whenever the view appears onscreen in case the device was rotated while it was offscreen whenever the device is rotated but you should keep the view creation code in viewdidload as you only want to create it once
make a property to keep a pointer to the view so that you can refer to it from all of these places in your code create it in viewdidload but don t worry then about the geometry as you can do this in viewwillappear make a generic orientation method call it from viewwillappear triggered every time the view comes onscreen call it from viewwilllayoutsubviews triggered every time the view is onscreen and the device rotates by the way i am not sure your frames are correct - in portrait you are shifting the left edge offscreen in landscape you are shifting the top edge offscreen

14927703
sqoop	hadoop
even though calling sqoop in a way that you do is quite common and working
based on the log i would guess that your java application that is executing sqoop do not have hadoop configuration on the classpath

14927703
sqoop	hadoop
based on the log i would guess that your java application that is executing sqoop do not have hadoop configuration on the classpath
thus sqoop won t get information about your cluster and will work in local mode

14928234
spaces	delimiter
this is because the keys aren t case-sensitive and they don t need to be surrounded by spaces or other such delimiter
but you can put spaces in the keys themselves if you specify them as strings so this works better still doing reword templates without escape characters tends to be tricky and a little bit slower so it s not done as often

14929119
factors	mean
so for a 3 level factors with default treatment contrasts if you really think that only the first contrast is important you can create a new variable that compares to and ignores and then run your regression using that lm y x_1vs2 + x_1vs2 z
one key point you re missing is that when you see a significant effect for something like x2 z that doesn t mean that x interacts with z when it means that the difference between and or whatever your reference level is interacts with z

14929323
srt	subtitle
although the idea of changing the file extension to prevent the compression is nice but i prefer to copy the srt file from the resources to the app local directory on the device but anyways for the sake of completeness here is a list of extensions that won t be compressed
.jpg .jpeg .png .gif .wav .mp2 .mp3 .ogg .aac .mpg .mpeg .mid .midi .smf .jet .rtttl .imy .xmf .mp4 .m4a .m4v .3gp .3gpp .3g2 .3gpp2 .amr .awb .wma .wmv the solution steps are simple create a mediaplayer instance and prepare it by either calling mediaplayer.create or player.setdatasource then player.prepare if the subtitle files does not already exists on the android device copy it from the resource folder to the device call player.addtimedtextsource with the first argument a string that contains the full path of the subtitle file on the device and mediaplayer.media_mimetype_text_subrip as the second argument select the timedtext track by calling player.selecttrack and pass the index of timedtexttype by searching the returned from player.gettrackinfo i find it usually 2 set up a listener with player.setontimedtextlistener and then start playing the media file player.start here is the complete class to run this exact class you will need two files under your res raw folder sub.srt and video.mp4 or whatever extensions

14930640
queue	fifo
just to clarify a few of the approaches i tried...the usb code ran in it s own thread and was given max priority no luck - i tried api calls libusb native c and other methods no luck - i buffered and polled and queue no luck - ultimately i decided android could not handle usb data at high speed constant 3.2mb sec w no flow control
i built an 8mb hardware fifo buffer into my design to make up for it

14932048
awt	swing
but this will not solve your problem because we see that it is not a rnetlogo problem but a problem already arising with rjava. seems that there is something wrong with your java configuration not supporting visual displays -- awt swing
you haven t written what kind of java you have installed oracle sun jre sun jdk openjdk ... . but i think it is not a java problem in general because you have been able to create the point object which leeds to the conclusion that the awt libraries are installed but a configuration problem the jvm started by rjava seems to be running in headless mode

14934166
jboss	glassfish
i think you have to use the values for jboss ap but i didn t prove it
last in glassfish i have to put in beans.xml and i don t know why the following bean i think in jboss ap it isn t necessary but you might prove it in your web.xml you need reference the persistence units your application will use

14935229
jar	war
there are a couple of reasons that you might not want to have all dependencies to be default compile scope reduce the size of final artifact jar war... by indicating different scope
when you have a multiple-modules project you have ability to let each module have it s own version of dependency avoid class version collision by provided scope for instance if you are going deploy a war file to weblogic server you need to get rid of some javax jars like javax.servlet javax.xml.parsers jpa jars and etc

14936415
onresume	onpause
the somewhat unclear distinction is being made because onpause occurs relatively often and also under many circumstances where you probably wouldn t save the state for an onresume of the same activity
hence everyone wants you to think twice before you perform expensive operations in onpause

14937865
exponent	addition
double precision floating point numbers work like this 1 bit for sign 11 for exponent and 52 bits for the mantissa
the final number is -1 sign 1.mantissa exponent - 1 10 so when the addition is made between 2 numbers this is what happens for multiplication division it s a bit simpler so what happens is if the exponents are too far apart there will be a loss of data when the shift occurs meaning the precision for double floating point in general are not 100 precise especially since some numbers turn into periodical decimates

14938648
profiling	debugging
if you wish to disable the profiling you can do it in app config config_dev.yml web_profiler toolbar true only-exceptions true intercept_redirects false
check to see if your environment is running in dev development mode if so make sure it is on prod production . in dev mode alot proccessing is done for debugging reasons and this is not needed for your clients

14940573
kerberos	ntlm
keep in mind that kerberos is not really compatible with the way application pools and spns are handled and is likely to fail
ntlm - which is the fallback for windows authentication in iis - will not work due to lack of password on the server

14942631
super	self
this question doesn t make sense in an instance method since there super is not really a concrete actual pointer-to-instance it just indicates that the implementation of the superclass must be called
and since in the case of most objects except class clusters all methods return self

14942632
super	self
when you use super you are referencing parent methods not a parent instance
self is always pointing to one instance

14942724
octal	decimal
so it is returning 00 a valid octal number followed by 911 a valid decimal number
the reason is that tokenize is interpreting 00411 as an octal number which 00911 is not

14942725
octal	decimal
in python 2 integer literals beginning with 0 are interpreted as octal numbers base 8
accordingly your first sourceline is actually syntactically invalid because 9 isn t a valid digit in octal so it seems the tokenizer is parsing it as a valid octal literal beside a decimal literal

14943003
backtracking	greedy
consumes all the characters in the input it then has to start backtracking giving one character back and testing if the next pattern matches and if not it gives back another character and checks the match character by character
so by putting a greedy universal match as your first expression you re actually asking the engine to only find the last match

14944258
mvp	presenter
frankly i m not sure the term mvp ought to catch on
it implies it s a totally different pattern and presenter seems focused on the ui when sometimes it s just a relationship between model and controller

14945029
uiview	subviews
a monotouch.dialog.element is based on a uitableviewcell not on a uiview
because of this the element should be part of a uitableview and can not simply be added to a uiview as a subviews

14945029
uiview	subviews
because of this the element should be part of a uitableview and can not simply be added to a uiview as a subviews
if you want to have a uiview similar to an element you have to create a custom view inheriting from a uiview

14946099
serializable	deserialization
for example if a serializable file has the version of the class which has boolean sharpteeth
but the class doesn t have that field then it will be ignored during deserialization

14946581
client-side	server-side
that said there is certainly a growing trend toward using client-side routers in general not specifically backbone.js s to create one-page apps ember.js
here are your options only server-side routes this is the classic approach that is a big component of frameworks like rails

14948532
postgresql	mysql
heroku does not directly support mysql you can either convert your mysql database over to postgresql database or host it on a different provider
heroku provides the cleardb addon for this purpose or you can use a service like amazon rds i found converting the data to postgresql even with the ruby plug in they suggest to be a complete pain in the butt and wouldn t recommend it unless you need to save a bunch of data you already have

14951929
rtp	rtsp
rtsp is only a control protocol the streaming part delivery of media data is done via rtp which is udp based protocol and hence not supported on app engine
rtsp itself has a similar format to http so you could implement it on gae

14952609
vbo	vao
i would use b as you aren t changing vao vbo state often just changing 6 values 1 for each face
1 i use this module to render cubes in opengl 3+ render cube with vbo if you don t have a model view projection matrix just pass in numpy.identity 4 which will leave the vertices centred around the origin. this also means that the camera will appear inside the cube so it may not be visible

14952823
mongodb	bson
also mongodb does not require json php what-ever that is handling knowledge
all results from mongodb come into the driver as bson and are then de-serialzed to a standard dict within php namely an associative array

14953653
gruntjs	package.json
npm install gruntjs --save-dev the save-dev switch isn t strictly necessary but is a good idea because it will mark gruntjs in its package.json devdependencies section as a development only module
the command line tools are not included with the latest version of gruntjs 0.4 at time of writing instead you need to install them separately

14959072
google-chrome	firefox
try comparing the break points for google-chrome and for firefox
if they are off about 20px the difference is because ie firefox and opera follow the w3c spec of including the scrollbar width in the media query where webkit browsers do not

14959402
profiling	instrumentation
this is useful for code profiling but not so much for memory profiling
build mono.cecil for the cf and use it to instrumentation emit right on the target device

14963484
persistent	transient
instead you should use onpause to store persistent data such as data that should be saved to a database when the user leaves the activity
from the developer guide on activities note because onsaveinstancestate is not guaranteed to be called you should use it only to record the transient state of the activity the state of the ui you should never use it to store persistent data

14965444
bower	npm
unfortunately there aren t too many examples yet because of the transition from one yeoman command to using yo alongside bower and yo
i imagine there will be some level of unit testing on the generator.prototype.method as well as e2e testing that involves writing bash scripts to run yo npm bower and grunt

14968398
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
update 2015-05-04 support for the gamepad api has gotten better since this answer both firefox and google-chrome have support going back several versions now and opera supports it too
but not all browsers do safari and ie do not

14968878
move	drag
it s purpose is not to allow you to move elements around in a sandbox but rather to let you move data around with visual feedback
when you drag something around using jquery draggable it is to affect a visual change on the screen

14971162
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the ios sdk contain many examples of uiviewcontroller subclasses
a few of them contain only a small amount of generic behavior and are essentially useless without customization glkviewcontroller uicollectionviewcontroller uitableviewcontroller and some of them provide significant generic behavior but are still mainly containers for your own view controllers uinavigationcontroller uipageviewcontroller uisplitviewcontroller uitabbarcontroller but most of them are essentially complete packages with little or no need or ability to customize their behavior abnewpersonviewcontroller abpersonviewcontroller abunknownpersonviewcontroller ekcalendarchooser ekeventeditviewcontroller ekeventviewcontroller gkachievementviewcontroller gkfriendrequestcomposeviewcontroller gkgamecenterviewcontroller gkleaderboardviewcontroller gkmatchmakerviewcontroller gkturnbasedmatchmakerviewcontroller mfmailcomposeviewcontroller mfmessagecomposeviewcontroller mpmediapickercontroller mpmovieplayerviewcontroller pkaddpassesviewcontroller qlpreviewcontroller skstoreproductviewcontroller slcomposeviewcontroller twtweetcomposeviewcontroller uiactivityviewcontroller uiimagepickercontroller uireferencelibraryviewcontroller uivideoeditorcontroller if you think about what all of these have in common you may conclude that they all have two things in common each has a specific model in the mvc sense that it interacts with and that model is not specific to your app

14975425
moq	justmock	moq	typemock
no it is not possible because the function s implementation looks like you cannot use moq to fake this function
you need more powerful mocking framework which will allow you replacing static function call - probably microsoft fakes typemock isolator or justmock

14976036
uiview	calayer
because you are not accessing any calayer properties or methods directly unless you change the properties of the uiview s layer
internally uiview uses it

14976496
gruntjs	package.json
if you still cannot get it working somehow with the above steps you can change gruntjs latest to gruntjs 0.3 in your package.json file and run npm install in shell
the tutorial that you are talking about uses gruntjs 0.3. gruntjs has updated since then and if you use gruntjs latest in your package.json file then you will get gruntjs 0.4 by default

14978616
textview	imageview
the android background set to a textview in this context doesn t have the attribute or any other value for that matter
that attribute is found on imageview and imagebuttons

14981901
equals	gethashcode
the documentation of gethashcode specifies this behavior by saying if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

14981901
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
your emp1 and emp2 generate different hashcodes so the dictionary does not need to run equals

14984025
prng	random
they are generated from a prng so they have pretty similar properties to generating a random 122 bit number the remaining 6 bits are fixed
its entropy source has much higher quality than what random uses but it s not guaranteed to be cryptographically secure

14984530
equals	gethashcode
it does not matter what the result of gethashcode is it does not have to be prime at all as long as the result is the same for two objects that are considered to be equals
however it is nice but not required to have gethashcode return a different value for two objects that are considered to be different but still not necessarily prime

14987530
client-side	server-side
indexeddb is designed for client-side storage scenarios
the api is not designed to handle synchronization to a server-side database

14987659
requestfactory	gwt
afaik there isn t any open-sourced library to use requestfactory in ios projects
what you can do is to develop a standard gwt app and package it with phonegap aka cordova

14987854
aggregate-functions	sum
any time you use an aggregate-functions you must include a group by that includes all columns that are not being aggregated
you are also using sum in your where clause which will not work

14990990
mathml	mathjax
personally i prefer writing in latex not mathml
i have used jsmath and most recently mathjax

14993379
opera	google-chrome	mp4	h.264
firefox and opera does not support mp4 within the html5 tag
also google has announced in 2011 that they will be removing h.264 support from google-chrome

14993379
h.264	webm
fall back to adobe flash player when h.264 is not supported
create multiple encoded versions of your videos including mp4 webm and ogg in order

14993668
box2d	scene2d
box2d is for physics modeling and is not like any of the other api parts you mentioned which are mostly about rendering
finally scene2d is mostly about creating animated user-interface elements like buttons lists and sliders

14993689
orientdb	neo4j	neo4j	titan
you would probably be best looking at either one of these two camps neo4j with springdata free for single instance or tinkerpop blueprints possibly rexter if not using java scala on one of these technologies titan on cassandra with hadoop multi master no point of failure orientdb neo4j these databases are graph databases. tinkerpop blueprints is a standard that allows you to abstract the specific implementation
springdata currently only supports neo4j for graph technologies

14994028
actionscript	mxml
first in actionscript you would import the class
you wouldn t reference the mxml namespace conceptually like this import com.mypackage.msns

14997738
udp	mtu
with udp you have to take care by yourself of transmission order udp datagram number 1 could be received after a udp datagram number 2 and lost packets udp doesn t grant delivery of the datagram you should use tcp for big size transfers where the order of the packets matters
about mtu you don t have to care if it is smaller than the size of the data you re going to send

14997939
bash	subshell
test it by setting set -o posix in bash and seeing the error
it is because piped while loop creates a subshell and a child process cannot change parent s environment

14998828
google-chrome	firefox
just to expand on gil s answer the unicode character entity for star was not showing for me in google-chrome but it was in firefox
i found that just as gil says it did work in google-chrome when it was in the html at page load but it did not work in google-chrome when the html containing the star was loaded subsequently via ajax

15001918
client-side	server-side
this will validate the value client-side using javascript
however it can be circumvented if javascript isn t enabled so server-side you need to do use the regex class then if the you re good

15002223
aggregate-functions	sum
i quote the manual on aggregate-functions it should be noted that except for count these functions return a null value when no rows are selected
in particular sum of no rows returns null not zero as one might expect since you seem to have a weak spot for performance optimization here s a detail you might like is slightly faster than count vote

15003663
udp	mtu
the maximum size of udp payload that most of the time will not cause ip fragmentation is ejp talked about 534 bytes but i would fix it to 508
this is the number of bytes that for sure will not cause fragmentation because the minimum mtu size that an host can set is 576 and ip header max size can be 60 bytes 508 576 mtu - 60 ip - 8 udp by the way i d try to go with 1472 bytes because 1500 is a standard-enough value

15007050
oncreate	onstart
when talking about application in general you can implement an application class where you override its oncreate callback method which is called every time application starts. when talking about activity class instances use activity class callback methods to check if current activity comes to foreground becomes visible to user
for example you may need to implement onresume and or onstart lifecycle callback methods......... android application class does not have onresume method

15008293
google-chrome	firefox
edit by the way there is a dart way of initializing webgl context old answer this code prints webgl is not supported on google-chrome javascript console when i turn on disable webgl under google-chrome flags
however with webgl disabled under firefox about config - webgl.disabled

15012078
bazaar	svn
as per storing some kind of unversioned attributes the closest thing i ve seen to that was in the bzr-svn documentation subversion has a concept of versioned properties that is not currently present in bazaar
this means bzr-svn cannot set any versioned properties such as svn keywords svn eol-style and svn mime-type

15012583
apache-poi	docx4j
disclosure i m docx4j project lead what apache-poi is doing seems to be legal per the specification but isn t ideal
per ecma-376 part 2 getting the content type of a part docx4j should find the content type of the docx when specified the way apache-poi does it

15014585
apache	nginx
this is valid directive whether you use apache or not
you don t have to use it but you better do because nginx is very good at serving static files

15015122
dictionary	map
by default wcf does not represent dictionary as json objects - it represents them as arrays of key value pairs instead
so to send that map to the wcf service you ll need to covert it appropriately see code below

15015136
ubuntu	linux
eventually when someone decides to make a deb for ubuntu or an rpm for redhat or whatever they ll do the right thing for their distro and either submit a patch to you or maintain it separately
that s sys.platform the second part is also easy but not in the way you wanted to hear how to make a script run at startup linux mac osx windows you don t

15016546
bash	subshell
as others have said bash doesn t allow it so you ll have to use your favourite scripting language to do it
for example in perl this will fire up a subshell bash with the property.name environment variable set but you still can t access that environment variable from bash although your program will be able to see it

15016881
rethinkdb	couchdb
couchdb 3 provides durable writes but no multi-doc transactions rethinkdb 4 provides durable writes but no multi-doc transactions
most of the time is their querying support i d say rethinkdb has the most advanced one covering pretty much all types of queries sub-queries joins aggregations etc. their history read production readiness -- here i d probably say couchdb is in the lead their distribution model you mentioned that s not interesting for you their licensing ravendb commercial couchdb apache license rethinkdb agpl

15018912
opencms	magnolia
e-commerce if it s a shop you might want to look into broadleaf commerce it s not a cms but an open source shop system but built on the technology stack you re looking for. other than that i used to work with opencms for many years since 2005 and you could integrate it with spring which is what we did see my answer to this question here what java based cms can manage existing pages #39
and integration of java application with opencms however if i d built a new site with a cms on java i d probably go with magnolia cms because the documentation and community is more mature despite that it s newer than opencms. spring integration regarding the architecture magnolia uses jackrabbit as a jcr-compatible repository while opencms uses its own approach with the downside imho that they store all content files inside a mysql database instead of on the file system

15021902
comparator	comparable
treemap relies on the keys being sortable - not just equatable the map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys or by a comparator provided at map creation time depending on which constructor is used
bitset doesn t implement comparable

15025312
vbscript	vba
accpac actually uses vba and not vbscript although the syntax is almost identical
i have done lots of vba macros in accpac that use sql databases for much more complex tasks than just logging

15026200
firefox	safari
actually firefox is the only browser that doesn t return 0 for window .scrolltop on domready or window.onload
chrome safari and ie all return 0

15027285
union	distinct
union removes duplicates which does not seem to be needed in this case
if you do need them removed then do it at the source level from select distinct name from source rather than doing it implicitly with union

15028200
multiplying	subtract
you cannot meaningfully add two addresses together in c or multiplying an address by a number or another address
the two operations that are allowed are subtract addresses that point to a contiguous block of memory and adding a positive or a negative integer to an address

15030694
client-side	server-side
i m also not convinced that having the client-side libraries actually helps you in terms of the real-time collaboration feature which depends heavily on the server-side.
etherpad lite is the most viable option i ve seen so far personally i favor this one because it s open source you can host your own has few server-side dependencies node.js it has an api so you can build your app in any language attempting to steal google s work is probably not a good long-term plan

15031370
subtraction	addition
with x subtraction works return d3.select circle .attr cx - 17
addition doesn t return d3.select circle .attr cx + 17

15031370
subtraction	addition
unless you force it to do math not concatenate by adding 1 before the 17 same with y works with subtraction return d3.select circle .attr cy - 3
doesn t work with addition return d3.select circle .attr cy + 3

15033631
portrait	landscape
for the height of a lockscreen widget you have the following options if the widget does not mark itself as vertically resizable android resizemode vertical then the widget height will always be small on a phone in portrait mode small is defined as the space remaining when an unlock ui is being displayed
on tablets and landscape phones small is set on a per-device basis

15035252
jsdom	cheerio
see this jsdom isssue workaround would be to use something like cheerio here s an example from the home page
it appears jsdom relies on a native library that does not work on cloudfoundry same thing appfog uses

15035621
g++	gcc
gcc doesn t link against the c++ standard library by default g++ does
anyway none of the answers so far has mentioned the actual reason why linkage doesn t work with gcc but does so with g++

15039086
sudo	passwd
and your command doesn t work that you sudo only echo and what is after pipe is executed under current user credentials
this should work shell_exec sudo -u root -c echo test2 | passwd --stdin testuser

15043960
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you cannot call findviewbyid until after you call setcontentview
please move to after setcontentview r.layout.activity_send

15044335
jar	manifest.mf
you should compile your source code files .java to produce .class files and package those into your jar
thats because your jar apparently contains java source files and not compiled java class files. your jar layout should be meta-inf manifest.mf test test.class mainframe.class mainpanel.class image.png your manifest is fine

15049582
ienumerable	icollection
use icollection instead icollection inherits from ienumerable so it not only still get deferred execution lazy loading purpose but also has more methods to modify collection
ienumerable is immutable collection which you cannot modify add or remove

15054712
multiplying	multiplication
from what i ve read i m not sure how you can multiplying two matrices in agal
you might have to do the matrix multiplication in actionscript

15056391
dictionary	map
the keys in your dictionary don t have to conform to and are not copied using -copywithzone which means your dictionary is not an nsdictionary or nsmutabledictionary
any time you see nsdictionary used in code you should be providing a key-value map where the keys are copied not retained

15057616
implements	extends
you have to implements the role assignment on your own fosuserbundle does not have predefined forms for this
since your are using fosuserbundle your user entity extends fos userbundle model which implements groupableinterface

15058240
jsf	seam
well imo the move from jsf beans to cdi beans is a natural evolution of the technology
jsf beans have had a good run but the likes of spring guice and seam made it obvious that the technology was not sufficient

15060464
decoder	encoder
android at least till 4.1 does not include a flac encoder although there is a decoder supported from 3.1 onwards source
i do not have direct experience but have seen people use ffmpeg as a flac encoder

15065102
ssl	https
here the pre-requisite is that your should be using ssl https otherwise these http authentication headers will become vulnerable to man in middle attack
if your website doesn t use and ssl then you should probably look to other methods of authentication this article discusses in detail about all those methods

15067895
ssl	https
the ssl session id attribute name - javax.servlet.request.ssl_session_id should not be revealed and hence it won t get carried over to http
you should not move from https to http as you will loose confidentiality if you still wish to do this you can manually pass on the session id from login https to the redirected page http

15070097
spaces	delimiter
rlab and clab are string variables that contain the row and column labels delimiter by spaces
so spaces in the title are not natively supported

15070416
innodb	myisam
i m assuming you are using innodb so this answer is only valid for that engine or any other transaction-capable engine meaning myisam isn t included
by default innodb runs in auto-commit mode

15071095
rdf	owl
it should not be difficult to prove the following anything you can express in owl can also be expressed in rdf since you can express any owl utterance as triples
anything you could express in rdf triples could be expressed in owl by simply modelling the rdf triples in owl

15073314
uiview	subviews
in no way complete but simple answer a single uibutton created with ib is automatically a subviews of some other uiview at least the .view of your uiviewcontroller and is pointed strongly to because of that
an iboutletcollection is a nsarray or nsmutablearray not a uiview displayed anywhere and uiviews obviously have no property pointing to outlet collection s that point to them so nothing is pointing to iboutletcollections

15074241
viewdidload	viewwillappear
most view initialization should be done in viewdidload
viewwillappear isn t appropriate because it can be called many times in a view controller s life

15074623
rdf	owl
owl can be serialized as a rdf graph too and is particularly useful coupled with a reasoner
so owl can express everything that rdf can but rdf alone cannot capture some of the statements available within owl

15074719
implements	extends
according to mads post on implements angular intellisense the html editor isn t extended in the same way
instead you would extends c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 11.0 common7 packages schemas html commonhtml5types.xsd

15077212
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you can also not guarantee that viewdidload will be called again to reset the reference
you should probably be setting this in viewwillappear

15077926
mongodb	bson
i guess the layout used by mongodb is not any fancy data structure
it s simply composed of header offset length... bson data and padding factor

15078963
innodb	myisam
look at the engine column of the output +-----------------+--------+---------+------------+------+----------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------+-----------+----------------+---------------------+-------------+------------+-------------------+----------+----------------+---------+ | name | engine | version | row_format | rows | avg_row_length | data_length | max_data_length | index_length | data_free | auto_increment | create_time | update_time | check_time | collation | checksum | create_options | comment | +-----------------+--------+---------+------------+------+----------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------+-----------+----------------+---------------------+-------------+------------+-------------------+----------+----------------+---------+ | physician_role | innodb | 10 | compact | 0 | 0 | 16384 | 0 | 16384 | 0 | 1 | 2013-02-25 15 56 26 | null | null | latin1_swedish_ci | null | | | | visit_physician | innodb | 10 | compact | 0 | 0 | 16384 | 0 | 16384 | 0 | null | 2013-02-25 15 56 26 | null | null | latin1_swedish_ci | null | | | +-----------------+--------+---------+------------+------+----------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------+-----------+----------------+---------------------+-------------+------------+-------------------+----------+----------------+---------+ if the engine is myisam or another storage engine it s likely that creation of the constraint will not work
if you want to change the storage engine to innodb you can do this then you should be able to re-execute the creation of the constraint

15081802
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you need to implement these methods to support both pre-ios 6.0 and ios 6.0+ edit- if your uiviewcontroller is within a uinavigationcontroller s hierarchy if your view controller is within a uinavigationcontroller s view hierarchy the rotation methods are actually called on the navigation controller not the view controller .
this was implemented funny by apple in my opinion but here s what you can do to allow the view controller to respond to these methods instead- create a category on uinavigationcontroller with the methods as follows edit 2 - if your uiviewcontroller is within a uitabbarcontroller s tabs there s the same issue if your view controller is within a uitabbarcontroller s tabs

15081958
profiling	debugging
the error here was to profiling the code in debugging mode -g compiler flag generate debugging information for device code
the behavior of the program is deeply changed and this should not be used to profiling and optimize one s code

15081958
profiling	debugging
the behavior of the program is deeply changed and this should not be used to profiling and optimize one s code
one other thing a thorough documentation of nvcc s debugging mode is hard to find

15082972
namenode	hdfs
unrelated to posix mapr have small block size and not single point of failure namenode . mapr has multisite replication
lets look on dark side also a having mutable data instead of not mutable hdfs makes system more complicated

15086706
svg	vml
a few examples of clipping and masking in svg can be found here and here
svg can do this but raphaël doesn t support masks probably some vml restriction

15086706
svg	vml
svg can do this but raphaël doesn t support masks probably some vml restriction
simple rectangular clipping is supported however see the raphaël documentation you want clip-rect which is raphaël s abstraction limited-version of svg s clip-path

15086753
alloca	malloc
a few cons c99 provides variable length arrays which would often be used preferentially as the notation s more consistent with fixed-length arrays and intuitive overall many systems have less overall memory address-space available for the stack than they do for the heap which makes the program slightly more susceptible to memory exhaustion through stack overflow this may be seen as a good or a bad thing - one of the reasons the stack doesn t automatically grow the way heap does is to prevent out-of-control programs from having as much adverse impact on the entire machine when used in a more local scope such as a while or for-loop or in several scopes the memory accumulates per iteration scope and is not released until the function exits this contrasts with normal variables defined in the scope of a control structure would accumulate alloca -ed memory requested at x but memory for a fixed-sized arrays would be recycled per iteration
modern compilers typically do not inline-functions that call alloca but if you force them then the alloca will happen in the callers context the stack won t be released until the caller returns a long time ago alloca transitioned from a non-portable feature hack to a standardised extension but some negative perception may persist the lifetime is bound to the function scope which may or may not suit the programmer better than malloc s explicit control having to use malloc encourages thinking about the deallocation - if that s managed through a wrapper function wonderfulobject_destructorfree ptr then the function provides a point for implementation clean up operations like closing file descriptors freeing internal pointers or doing some logging without explicit changes to client code sometimes it s a nice model to adopt consistently in this pseudo-oo style of programming it s natural to want something like - that s possible when the constructor is a function returning malloc -ed memory as the memory remains allocated after the function returns the value to be stored in p but not if the constructor uses alloca a macro version of wonderfulobject_allocconstructor could achieve this but macros are evil in that they can conflict with each other and non-macro code and create unintended substitutions and consequent difficult-to-diagnose problems missing free operations can be detected by valgrind purify etc

15088472
client-side	server-side
client-side validation should be used to minimize the server-side round-trips so that you save bandwidth and the requests per user
server-side you should not assume the validation successfully done at client side is 100 perfect

15090286
google-chrome	firefox
i believe it s stayed the same i could not find any limits on google-chrome and safari
both are based on webkit and it seems to have similar limits as firefox has

15090645
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
the pointer being passed to realloc must be .
previously allocated by malloc calloc or realloc and not yet freed with free otherwise the results are undefined

15096410
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
3.2.3 uri comparison when comparing two uris to decide if they match or not a client should use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire uris with these exceptions a port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default port for that uri-reference
comparisons of host names must be case-insensitive

15098177
bison	jison
you can use bison s glr-parser option or a tool like btyacc that can deal with non-lalr 1 grammars
i m not at all sure what jison supports however

15100554
super	implements
if you an http accessible resource already and you don t have any super stringent requirements that might otherwise suggest a more robust messaging solution i would not force one in where it s not warranted
if you are commensing totally tabula-rasa and you must implements both sides from scratch...

15101234
super	self
first this code is equivalent to this objc code when what you want is the pyobjc equivalent of the latter is or in 2.x in objc super isn t the superclass but a special magic object which is effectively self as an instance of the superclass
it s almost exactly like python 3 s super or the less-magical python 2 super and pyobjc does the extra work to mean you can ignore that almost

15105344
implements	extends
in other words i m implements similar code to c# libraries not that similar simulating will be the correct word
as an example in c# you use microsoft.window.forms so i can use jsoop and use method extends and overriding to create the same scenario

15108783
inline	inlining
if the call is inline there is no difference between the two approaches - as long as the parameter is known at compile time which it must be a decent compiler will remove the unnecessary switch in both cases
the only case where you would see a difference is if inlining does not occur - in this case the templated approach would allow the switch to be removed while the other would not

15112223
client-side	server-side
try something like this the url.action display customer is processed on the server-side and the rest of the string is processed on the client-side concatenating the result of the server-side method with the client-side
the url.action method is proccess on the server-side so you cannot pass a client-side value to this function as a parameter

15112223
client-side	server-side
the url.action method is proccess on the server-side so you cannot pass a client-side value to this function as a parameter
you can concat the client-side variables with the server-side url generated by this method which is a string on the output

15113156
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you should use nsstring when you need a string as a fixed immutable string value and nsmutablestring as an editable mutable string container buffer
if you re not sure use nsstring primarily

15113156
nsmutablestring	nsstring
use nsmutablestring at there
because nsstring cannot be changed it needs making a new object when you need some new string value

15115466
implements	extends
even though we havent implements anything note that the list class isn t designed to be inherited
you should be encapsulating it not extends it

15117358
casting	autoboxing
of course you could cast the parameters to local variables before the actual invocation but this doesn t make it clearer for the reader - casting the parameter directly where it is used is the best option in my opinion to make it clear which method is called
by the way the reason the api is so ambigious in this case is that at the time the api was made there was no autoboxing so it was not possible to write ambiguous code in the first place

now if you try to login you ll get redirected so that you talk over ssl if you re not already as noted by the https moniker
even after you actually login you will still be communicating over ssl

15119044
ssl	https
even after you actually login you will still be communicating over ssl
even if you try to manually switch to not using ssl while you are logged in by removing the s from the protocol part of the url it ll still send you back to using https

15119044
ssl	https
just make sure your url s used to reference those external images are defined using the https moniker so that it uses ssl
update the reason you re getting two hits in the log like that is because you re login link is being requested over http the require https attribute hits first realizes you re not using ssl and redirects you back to itself with the https protocol

15119815
ffmpeg	libav
you re using a crippled fake version of ffprobe that originates from libav not ffmpeg ubuntu switched from ffmpeg to libav because the debian ubuntu ffmpeg package maintainer is a libav developer
the intentional usage of the names ffmpeg and ffprobe for something not from ffmpeg was disappointing and is misguiding to users and misrepresents the work of the ffmpeg developers

15122083
fgets	getline
the best way to do this sort of thing assuming you have getline looks like this if you don t have getline fgets is often good enough
warning do not confuse fgets with gets

15127002
client-side	server-side
you will need to acquire users mac addresses using client-side means that the user allows to run
php is being executed server-side so it does not have any access to the client s computer

15127237
multiplying	multiplication
for numpy array you can not use to multiplying coz is for element-wise multiplication
if you are multiplying with matrix like y x.t should be written as y.dot x.t read this page about the difference in use of array and matrix in numpy

15127435
onresume	onpause
i was calling a setupcamera method in onresume which checked for a null camera object and then called camera.open
what fixed my problem was to get rid of the null-check and just call camera.open whether it was null or not i had already set on onpause after reading the camera docs

15132637
mp3	wav
if you convert the resulting file from mp3 to wav which is what you do you always get a larger file and you never get back to the original audio quality
you cannot optimize the size of a wav file its size depends on the audio data written into it

15132847
implements	extends
mouseinputlistener extends mouselistener and mousemotionlistener and of course a class can implements several interfaces class x implements a f
in java multiple inheritance is not permitted for implementations classes only for interfaces interface a extends b c e.g

15135431
serializable	deserialization
in fact it doesn t really matter since the binaryformatter in default automatic mode is only really useful if you want to serializable objects and deserialize them again in the same application for example for copy paste or a similar operation
in that case you have no versioning issues since it will be the same code doing both the serialization and deserialization

15135617
vsto	add-in
the thing to understand is a vsto add-in installer isn t a 64bit msi it s a 32bit msi that deploys an anycpu dll with registry entries for either 32bit or 64bit office
it s the bitness of office ultimately that determines the bitness of your add-in

15136577
jar	manifest.mf
not using relative paths for files outside the jar for example log4j should be used with log4j.appender.x.file app.home logs my.log or something alike check the procrun manual and this tutorial for more information
with procrun you need to copy prunsrv to the application directory download and create an install.bat like this i presume to run this from the same directory where the jar and prunsrv.exe is the jar has its working manifest.mf and you have shutdown hooks registered into jvm for example with context.registershutdownhook in spring .

15141303
client-side	server-side
the google analytics code you ve quoted all occurs client-side
it triggers server-side code of some kind at their end but that s not relevant. your nodejs code is server -side

15144988
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
this is possible with not only webkit latest google-chrome or safari but also in latest firefox
here is the example html css webkit css firefox - gecko firefox uses -moz-element to do the reflections whereas webkit uses a proprietary vendor prefix for reflections

15145530
clang	llvm
there are two llvm frontends available in xcode - the old gcc-based one llvm-gcc which supports openmp 2.5 and the new clang which does not support openmp
clang has extensive static code analysis capabilities and also much nicer error reporting especially with c++ code

15146576
google-chrome	firefox
i think when you read that google-chrome has implemented it they meant that it was in the development version because it certainly isn t in the current release v25
see the caniuse site for compatibility charts same applies to firefox

15149084
super	self
i m curious why i can t call super thread self .__init__ instead of thread.__init__ self when my class inherits from thread
because that s not how super works

15149084
super	implements
but threading.thread has specific checks to make sure it gets initialized properly so you re probably getting something like this assertionerror thread.__init__ was not called if your parent class is a c extension class it probably doesn t have any ancestors and it probably doesn t implements super even if it does so you ll usually get an error that way too
you may want to read python s super considered super if you want to understand how all of this works because the docs linked above aren t necessarily the best introductory discussion

15149618
set	bag
customer is a set
books is either a bag or a set depending on whether duplicate books are allowed i ll assume it is a bag though it doesn t matter

15149618
set	bag
books is either a bag or a set depending on whether duplicate books are allowed i ll assume it is a bag though it doesn t matter
then customer.books is a bag of bags of books one bag per each customer and is a bag of all the books owned by customers

15149618
set	bag
catalog.books is either a bag or a set doesn t matter
the select operation returns only those books that are contained in the given catalog and belongs to some customer since we are selecting from the bag constructed before

15150534
fgets	getline	istream	getline
but the problem is you do not compare apples to apples as istream std string or char is reading a word separated by space not what fgets does
so use std getline for std string or istream getline for char to have similar functionality and your comparison will make more sense

15154367
clang	llvm
clang is big excluding it will improve your memory footprint clang is not easy to maintain it depends on presence and exact locations of the headers depends on some parts of gcc etc
without it bare llvm can be used on its own and dependencies may be kept self-contained

15154367
clang	llvm
clang is generating an extremely non-optimal llvm ir deliberately
llvm should care for all the optimisations not the frontends

15155046
mvp	presenter
in proper mvp view class if it is also should not implement a constructor
a typical example of mvp will consist of these parts data access layer datamappers orm etc business logic like validation and computations passive view class it could be a template but it would be better to stick with a class the presenter that bridges both model and view an example of how to implement model-view-presenter with php note a model in real-world scenario is not class but abstraction layer that contain a lot of classes to deal with application logic

15156290
apache	nginx
if you know apache just stick with it
the learning curve for nginx is quite high and not needed here if you haven t already done basic tuning

15156814
ember.js	backbone.js
pay attention to angularjs it combines both knockout and backbone.js it s faster leaves html readable has two way data-binding validation and much more. also you can try ember.js
knockout is good but when your models contain many variables and functions this will result in very dirty and hard readable html. backbone.js is good but it does not have observables which make knockout so easy to use

15157605
dbcontext	objectcontext
i normally use dbcontext rather than objectcontext which i belive is essentially a wrapper around objectcontext with some extra functionality
i m not sure if this helps or not but if you were to use dbcontext you would be able to do this..

15162800
lisp	sml
moreover you can invoke the compiler easily at runtime it will produce native code for you and add it to the ml environment in the manner of eval in lisp but it is statically typed and real machine code not interpreted one
the structure polyml.compiler provides various relatively stable interfaces to do that beyond the official sml standard

15166759
strcpy	strncpy
from that code seti signal might be uninitialized and therefore not properly null-terminated and strcpy corrupts memory and this causes undefined behaviour which luckily is segfault
use strncpy remember adding terminating 0 char at last array index yourself or snprintf instead of strcpy and also strncmp instead of strcmp

15168088
oncreate	setcontentview
have setcontentview on the line after oncreate reply to comment like this
try setcontentview r.layout.yourxml you cannot do it your way because you must set your view to your xml first

15169046
ecj	javac
eclipse compiler for java jdt ecj is much smarter tool than actual javac
it s a new tool for me with bunch of parameters but jdt provides pretty cool ant javac adapter and we can use it in javac ant task - set build.compiler property and then launch normal android ant -compile task but this will not work unless you have ecj.jar

15171639
setinterval	settimeout
the problem in your code is that you aren t passing a function to setinterval you are passing the one time result of the function call frasecasuale 1 so the result of that function is what is being passed to setinterval
since you want to pass a parameter to it settimeout lets you specify arguments after the function pointer and timeout interval such as setinterval frasecasuale 5000 1

15171946
division	subtraction
have a look at wikipedia the simplest division algorithm historically incorporated into a greatest common divisor algorithm presented in euclid s elements book vii proposition 1 finds the remainder given two positive integers using only subtractions and comparisons just add a counter in your while loop to keep track of the number of iterations which is what you will want to return and after your loop n will contain your remainder if it is not 0 of course
what you re original post is trying to do is the division by repeated subtraction algorithm

15171955
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested successfully in firefox 19.0 google-chrome 25 and safari 4.0.4
it doesn t seem to be a problem with alertify.js but with firefox

15173133
google-chrome	firefox
all modifications are announced in the google-chrome release blog
as far as i see it google-chrome isn t just a faster firefox

15173262
clang	llvm
so till now you can not refactor your c++ code and hope you will get it with new release of clang llvm xcode
i thought because xcode depended on the clang front end for all of its code coverage features that it would eventually be able to refactor c++

15174836
dbcontext	objectcontext
there are 2 ways that i know of to load related collections with a dbcontext
one is the option you have asked about but there is another way that i have been using for some time now and does not require a reference to objectcontext

15175104
innodb	myisam
the lock table in innodb is stored so space-efficiently that lock escalation is not needed typically several users are permitted to lock every row in innodb tables or any random subset of the rows without causing innodb memory exhaustion
source mysql uses table-level locking for myisam memory and merge tables allowing only one session to update those tables at a time making them more suitable for read-only read-mostly or single-user applications

15175609
spaces	delimiter
which is not the case since your pattern matches strings containing a white spaces and a token can t contain one
the documentation says a scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern which by default matches whitespace

15176875
rsa	aes
generally it doesn t make sense to encrypt long messages directly with rsa
rather you would use hybrid encryption choose a random key for a symmetric cipher like aes encrypt the message with the symmetric cipher and then encrypt the symmetric key with rsa

15176875
rsa	aes
unpadded textbook rsa is not secure
or use a scheme like rsa-kem which doesn t need padding. don t use ecb mode for aes either

15178360
tostring	string.format
you have two options override tostring and return something meaningful for your new type read off a property or something instead also note that string.format can take multiple arguments there s a lot more to string.format than what i have shown here so click the link to the documentation first line of this answer to learn more
you would use string.format note that all objects have a tostring method which means that all objects can be used as arguments to string.format however the default response from tostring is to return the full name of the type which might not make much sense

15178562
innodb	myisam
either way it s not likely be truly efficient mysql 5.6 has the ability to perform fulltext searches within innodb
if you re using a lower version you can only do this with myisam tables there are many reasons why myisam may not be a good idea

15179098
ioexception	filewriter
public filewriter string filename boolean append throws ioexception ioexception - if the named file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file does not exist but cannot be created or cannot be opened for any other reason
i think problem is in this line instead try this explanation heapfile.getname refers to your file name so lets say heapfile.txt. so when you ask filewriter to write to this file

15179647
dbcontext	objectcontext
i would encourage you to use dbcontext as it is a simplified version of the objectcontext
if the dbcontext is not suffice the wrapped objectcontext can be accessed from the dbcontext iobjectcontextadapter dbcontext .objectcontext the generate views option is also available for code first dbcontext in ef power tools

15179647
dbcontext	objectcontext
if the dbcontext is not suffice the wrapped objectcontext can be accessed from the dbcontext iobjectcontextadapter dbcontext .objectcontext the generate views option is also available for code first dbcontext in ef power tools
right-click a file derived from dbcontext and select entity framework generate views

15180084
scheme	rebol
and this is in addition to the r2 command port scheme being built-in native code which also wouldn t be portable to r3 even if it were open sourced because r3 s system model is different too
and regardless of its portability r2 contains a lot of commercially licensed code that rebol technologies doesn t have the right to open source - pretty much everything that it could open made it into r3 already

15180367
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
problem is you are calling this line before setting content view by setcontentview method in oncreate so you are getting nullpointerexception
do not forget that before calling findviewbyid you have to set content view

15184281
factors	matrix
in running some experiments with your code i found that in many cases i would get determinants that were not exactly zero but were very close to zero -- perhaps indicating that numerical precision may be the limiting factors
i tried specifying the matrix using 64-bit values instead of 32 and got different but not necessarily better answers

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
i will not write about the advantages of switching from couchdb to the couchbase server because those are described pretty much everywhere see the future of couchdb by damien katz or couchbase vs
apache couchdb by couchbase

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
apache couchdb by couchbase
instead i will try to enumerate features of couchdb that you will not find in the couchbase server

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
today i think most people believe that couchbase server is a new version of couchdb but it is in fact a new version of membase
it still uses the memcached protocol and not the restful api of couchdb

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
features this is what i found to be a list of couchdb features that are not supported by the couchbase server no restful api only for views not for crud operations no _changes feed no peer-to-peer replication no couchapps no futon there is a different administration interface available no document ids no notion of databases there are only buckets no replication between a couchdb database and couchbase server no explicit attachments you have to store additional files as new key value pairs no http api for everything you need to use the couchbase server sdks or one of the experimental client libraries at couchbase develop so no experiments with curl and wget no couchdb api it uses the memcached api instead you can t do everything from the browser you have to write a server-side application no two-tier architecture for web apps is possible you have to write a server-side application to sit between the browser and the database like with relational databases no eventual consistency not entirely open-source free software not a drop-in replacement for couchdb seems like a drop-in replacement for memcached instead those features of couchdb may or may not be important to you so whether the lack of them is a disadvantage or not is strictly subjective but i think that the decision whether to switch from couchdb to couchbase server or not should be based on those differences and your dependence on those feature in your current couchdb deployments
for example if you ve got interested in couchdb after watching the couchdb changes feed nodecamp talk by mikeal rogers or one of the great couchapp tutorials by j

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
chris anderson then you have to realize that if you want to switch to the couchbase server then you will have to forget about pretty much everything they were talking about
because of that i would say that couchbase server looks like an evolution of memcached and membase not an evolution of couchdb and as such it looks like a great product if you are currently using memchached or membase

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
because of that i would say that couchbase server looks like an evolution of memcached and membase not an evolution of couchdb and as such it looks like a great product if you are currently using memchached or membase
if you are using couchdb in the most basic way then you may consider using the couchbase server for the same things and it may or may not perform better if you don t mind the license restrictions

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
if you are using couchdb in the most basic way then you may consider using the couchbase server for the same things and it may or may not perform better if you don t mind the license restrictions
but if you are actually using any of the features that are unique in couchdb like the changes feed couchapps two-tier architecture peer-to-peer replication etc. then you can either forget about those features or stay with couchdb. in any case make sure to read and understand the migration to couchbase for couchdb users tutorial before you think about switching

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
it s couchbase. that couchdb is somehow obsoleted by the couchbase server or that it is an old legacy version of couchbase
meanwhile couchdb is an actively maintained open-source project couchbase server is a completely separate project it is a newer project but it is not a newer version of couchdb - they are not even compatible and since even new tools for creating couchapps still keep being developed eg

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
meanwhile couchdb is an actively maintained open-source project couchbase server is a completely separate project it is a newer project but it is not a newer version of couchdb - they are not even compatible and since even new tools for creating couchapps still keep being developed eg
see the kanso project then couchdb is not going anywhere soon

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
in addition to membase server and our new mobile products we also offered couchbase single server which was a packaged distribution of apache couchdb
on top of that we began releasing developer previews of couchbase server 2.0 which incorporated couchdb technology into membase server but this product was not compatible with couchbase single server or couchdb

15184612
couchbase	couchdb
on top of that we began releasing developer previews of couchbase server 2.0 which incorporated couchdb technology into membase server but this product was not compatible with couchbase single server or couchdb
... membase server will be renamed couchbase server 1.8 on its next release in january a tiny step that simply alleviates name confusion

15184879
listview	gridview
so you would use an emptyitemtemplate inside your listview tag but outside your itemtemplate like so
i recommend you learn about and how to use data controls which are designed to be used in cases where multiple rows can be returned and data is repeated in the same format such as yours now comments . example controls gridview listview repeater going into detail about each control here will not answer your question but is important

15185485
strdup	malloc
if you did something like since strdup does a malloc see the manual you have to free it and you can update the string after its creation
when you do the name pointer is not alloced by malloc it points to a stack variable which is stored in the strings table of your binary file at compile time hence you can t free it

15185893
operands	scalar
in scalar context or if the left operands is not enclosed in parentheses it returns a string consisting of the left operands repeated the number of times specified by the right operands
in list context if the left operands is enclosed in parentheses or is a list formed by qw string it repeats the list

15185912
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
safari will return file size 0 opera does not support append method of form data firefox 6 does not work correctly
on safari 5.1.7 firefox 6 opera 12.14 form data is suported but it is buggy

15186115
equals	gethashcode
this way is not the ideal one after all 0.9 being not equals to 1.0 but equals to 0.0 seems to be wrong but at least the transitivity rule is held
specifically for your case it could be this way another problem with your code is that your gethashcode is not aligned with equals if a.equals b then a.gethashcode must equals b.gethashcode

15186458
arp	tcp
as for the arp table i am not sure why you are bringing that up since that s at a lower layer the data link layer and doesn t really have much to do with what happens at the ip much less tcp layer
but yes the arp tables of nodes on the same local network as a such as a local router now have a stale entry for a s old ip address

15188978
uilabel	uitextview
this feature is not there in uilabel
you need to use uitextfield or uitextview

15191367
postgresql	mysql
you can import export postgresql dump files from heroku as described here if you really want to use mysql you have two paths to follow
1 run mysql locally but convert to postgresql when migrating to heroku using the mysql2psql gem as described here 2 use a mysql addon like however my recommendation would be to use postgresql end to end as it is baked into heroku and you ll be working with the default ways of using heroku not against them

15192092
debian	linux
t 38675 and on also read this linux debian crontab job not executed after some research it seems that it has something to do with an imutable bit
has to do something with cron bug in debian ubuntu ispconfig works by setting various cron jobs to do the work

15193201
google-chrome	safari
the problem exists in safari 6 webkit but there is no problem in google-chrome also webkit
so one cannot contend it is a webkit problem. in my case the vertical scroll bar displays in safari 6 but it is frozen

15194137
division	modulo
python s integer division is not exactly the same as the integer division offered by some other languages like c since it rounds towards negative infinity rather than towards zero
together with the modulo you can say that

15197157
floating-point	fractions

you can also see that dbl_min the smallest positive normalized double value has 1022 digits in the fractions part and of those there are 715 significant digits

15197216
prepare	execute
beware that if you want to do that in any host and not only the one where you prepare your setup you will have to embed the nsis distribution in your setup to be able to call makensis.exe and all the included files that could be necessary included files plugins and other resources
sure it could be possible like from any batch file you need to call execwait to call makensis.exe for the compilation part and you can call the final executable with either execwait or execute depending on you need to wait for the result or not

hive	hdfs
d if you want to insert data into other hive table
i think the best way is a copy data into hdfs if it is not already there b create external table over your csv like this create external table tablename id int name string row format delimited fields terminated by lines terminated by n stored as textfile location place in hdfs

15200534
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian
check if prelink is installed with dpkg -l prelink # ubuntu debian derived rpm -qv prelink # centos red hat derived and check the configuration usually in etc prelink.conf and one of etc defaults prelink or etc sysconfig prelink
on ubuntu but not on centos rh directories under usr local bin sbin lib are included for processing

15204098
ubuntu	linux
for people unfamiliar with setting up linux systems it may be easier if you just go with a system like ubuntu which has fairly recent pre-built packages although not the latest - i don t think any linux system keeps up with mono releases rather than wrestling with the learning curve of how to build everything yourself
i m not sure if you ve already seen this but this may help the most common problem that new developers have when coming to linux from systems like windows is not properly setting up their environment variables and so when they do the standard routine when it involves a number of source packages like mono does any package that depends on the core package won t pick up the correct location for that base package

15206590
implements	extends
in order to work around this limitation of the namespace configuration you will have to fall back to defining that provider as a normal bean and refer to it by the id in the config the above referenced expirationchecker bean must implements userdetailschecker which is a call-back interface receiving the userdetails object where you could throw a specific exception if the user s trial period has expired note that the last three checks are not related to the expiration checking but you have to have them here as the default implementation which is abstractuserdetailsauthenticationprovider.defaultpreauthenticationchecks is now overridden by this class
since the default implementation is a private inner class you cannot simply extends it but need to copy the code from there to prevent locked disabled etc

15208663
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
throwing runtimeexception sparingly isn t really a good policy -- effective java recommends that you use checked exceptions when the caller can reasonably be expected to recover
programmer error is a specific example if a particular case indicates programmer error then you should throw an unchecked-exception

15210117
domcontentloaded	onload
in modern browsers you could also replace that with document.addeventlistener domcontentloaded init
that event will trigger when the dom is ready but doesn t wait for other resources like images unlike onload

15211557
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s not only google-chrome
firefox is showing a message that a pop-up is blocked safari will block it too and in ie the form will not submit

15215020
cpython	pypy
basically all you have to do is build and install the module just as you do with cpython
make sure you do the install with pypy not with cpython

15215020
cpython	pypy
make sure you do the install with pypy not with cpython
besides the fact that each python installation on your system has a separate site-packages directory cpyext requires modules to be built against the pypy headers and libs not the cpython ones

15215020
cpython	pypy
besides the fact that each python installation on your system has a separate site-packages directory cpyext requires modules to be built against the pypy headers and libs not the cpython ones
if you re installing manually just do pypy setup.py install instead of python setup.py install

15215838
ssl	https
on heroku ssl is terminated at the routing layer and a x-forwarded-proto https header is added to the request so your app can know that the request came in over ssl
in other words from your app s perspective the request is plain http and doesn t need to do anything special but you can always check for the x-forwarded-proto https header if you want to make sure the request was made securely

15217975
shadowing	named
you declare a local variable shadowing the argument well it s almost shadowing the argument because the spelling of the named are different
a variable named outval is not the same variable as one named outval

15219503
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this is the common mistake to setup subview s bounds in - void viewdidload - void viewdidload
this is an exceptionally good place to put a lot of setup code. but be careful because the geometry of your view its bounds is not set yet. if you need to initialize something based on the geometry of the view use the - void viewwillappear bool animated

15220223
d3.js	raphael
raphael is not built on d3.js
raphael will help you draw elements

15220223
d3.js	raphael
so at first glance d3.js is your answer
however given that there doesn t seem to be a widget for d3.js which handles the simile timeline for you either raphael or d3.js could be a good choice

15222464
d3.js	raphael
being a data framework d3.js also comes packed with tons of algorithms and layouts force layouts stack layouts trees etc some basic data wrangling functionality nesting cross group by rollups - see these examples jquery style selections and also visualization primitives d3.svg comes with everything you need for simple graphics
as it stands d3.js is not just better than raphael and processing in many cases but is also a viable replacement for jquery underscore.js and other frameworks

15225750
shadowing	named
this semantic is inherited from js the question that is sometimes asked is why not adding a way to explicitly declare the scope of a variable like a let keyword thus shadowing other variables with the same named in enclosing scopes or make always introduce a new variable in that scope and have something like to assign variables from enclosing scopes without declaring one in the current scope
the motivation for this would be to avoid this kind of errors coffeescript s argument for not having a special syntax for shadowing variables is that you simply shouldn t do this kind of thing

15225750
shadowing	named
the motivation for this would be to avoid this kind of errors coffeescript s argument for not having a special syntax for shadowing variables is that you simply shouldn t do this kind of thing
named your variables clearly

15225750
shadowing	named
because even if shadowing would be allowed it would be very confusing to have two variables with two different meanings with the same named one in an inner scope and one in an enclosing scope
use adequate variable named according to how much context you have if you have little context a top-level variable you ll probably need a very specific named to describe it like currentgamestate especially if it s not a constant and its value will change with time

15226169
nexus	artifactory
i will not argue why and if nexus is better than artifactory as it would not be fair and would only cause flame wars
my own reasoning is this the sonatype guys are the ones behind maven nexus and maven central

15228348
textview	imageview
i had to do this myself not too long ago and i did it with a relativelayout with an imageview of the cart icon and a textview for the numbers with a 9-patch badge as the background
the trick is to align your number textview to the left and bottom of your cart icon imageview and then use the left and bottom margins to push your number badge to the top and right of your cart icon

15228549
xslt	schematron
the schematron version you make use of does not require xslt 2.0 however the file you have makes use of xslt 2.0 features
xsltprocessor in php supports xslt 1.0 only

15229434
strtol	atoi
use strtol or strtoul instead
atoi is not suitable for error checking

15232187
icmp	udp
on a udp-datagram socket this error indicates a previous send operation resulted in an icmp port unreachable message
microsoft explain the true meaning of sio_udp_connreset sio_udp_connreset opcode setting i t 3 windows xp controls whether udp port_unreachable messages are reported. - set to true to enable reporting. - set to false to disable reporting. the problem is in fact not connection reset but reachability

15235846
equals	icomparable
a is equals to b an integer value equals to 0
and of course icomparable is not limited to integers

15235846
comparator	comparable
and of course comparator is not limited to integers
you can implement comparator to compare any two objects that you think should be comparable

15238969
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need not do a setcontentview layout
also replace findviewbyid getcurrentfocus .getid by findviewbyid r.id.layoutid

15245835
aggregate-functions	sum
the problem is you are using a group by without an aggregate-functions
in your current query you are not using sum on the sec column which is the column you want to rollup

15249840
union	distinct
or just use selectmany as shown by mattytommo possibly with a call to distinct to get just distinct elements as union would
this isn t a matter of union - it s a matter of trying to read from any uninitialized local variable

15250221
jar	war
not all versions of the java client libraries are the same even though they may share the same name gdata-client-1.0.jar you need to use a new one if you want it to depend on guava and not the old collections jar 1.4.7.1 - download here be careful to manually remove and re-copy your jars into war web-inf lib as eclipse won t fully manage this for you especially if you re updating a jar of the same name finally a tip to help track down runtime errors by resolving which files you are sourcing your dependencies from system.out.println url + thread.currentthread .getcontextclassloader .getresource com google common collect immutableset.class
google-collect-1.0-rc1.jar is deprecated and has been replaced by the guava jar which is described here problem is that as the op states some google api s are indeed incompatible and need some very careful handling

15252915
matlab	simulink
there should not be any penalty because of use of matlab function block
when compiling the model matlab function block compiles its matlab code into c like other simulink blocks

15253235
rspec	capybara
i think i found the problem - i had been requiring capybara dsl in my spec_helper.rb instead of capybara rspec so the proper should_not behavior and error messages from capybara rspecmatchers were not included in that spec
edit it turns out if you re requiring rspec rails it will automatically bring in the correct capybara stuff for you

15254464
matlab	simulink
the link you give doesn t really say or imply that using an matlab function within a simulink model can severely impact its performance . it can in some instances but in many cases it is just as fast as build-in blocks
the interpreted matlab function block calls back into matlab every time it needs evaluating at every time step

15256979
macports	homebrew
to get this working again i had to install homebrew and move my macports out of the way
then do the following after removing 1.9.3-p392 and 2.0.0-p0 there was something not working with my macports and openssl and make and configure

15258408
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you don t have to use a uitableviewcontroller and are not using a uinavigationcontroller in your app already you can set your view controller up as a regular uiviewcontroller with a toolbar and tableview
to do this in ib drag out a uiviewcontroller object and add a toolbar and tableview

15260103
icmp	tcp
icmp is a completely different network protocol from tcp which is used for https
a host can be responding to https connection attempts but not respond to ping because a firewall on the host itself or somewhere on the way between you and the host you re trying to ping drops icmp echo request packets or responses and vice versa because the host is not running a web server or access to it is restricted firewalled

15260103
icmp	tcp
ping is the right tool to see if you can reach a host that is configured to respond to icmp echo request packets if you can reasonably assume that there s no firewall in between you and the host or on the host filtering out this type of network traffic and to determine the response time between you and the host
however if you want to test if a host is responding on a certain tcp port port 80 for a http web server or 443 for an https web server you can use telnet in terminal telnet www.google.com 80 if there is a server listening on that tcp port you ll see something like if it s a web server you can then even talk http to it if you like to get and it ll reply now that we have this out of the way the question remains why your host does respond to ping through ethernet but not through wi-fi

15260103
ethernet	wireless
however if you want to test if a host is responding on a certain tcp port port 80 for a http web server or 443 for an https web server you can use telnet in terminal telnet www.google.com 80 if there is a server listening on that tcp port you ll see something like if it s a web server you can then even talk http to it if you like to get and it ll reply now that we have this out of the way the question remains why your host does respond to ping through ethernet but not through wi-fi
one reason could be that many networks permit unrestricted access to all internal hosts when using a wired ethernet connection but have a firewall in place that restricts connections from the wireless network to hosts on the lan or dmz

15261921
vmware	virtualbox
i also have vmware on my ubuntu host but it just does not run as well as it does on windows. at least for me
my 0.02 if its virtualbox you are using i would go with ubuntu for certain

15265813
implements	extends
since your class stepdisplayer only implements steplistener and speakingtimer.listener interfaces you can make it extends the activity class
e.g public class stepdisplayer extends activity implements steplistener speakingtimer.listener in case you cannot do that for whatsoever reasons you can pass the context from the activity class which is calling the said method in stepdisplayer and use that to call the findviewbyid method

15266062
notepad++	sublimetext
sublimetext 2 is not really good when it comes to handling huge files and i had found that notepad++ was pretty good till certain size of files
and of course notepad++ is free

15268095
move	drag
so if you move it one pixel to the right left is 1
you then set it to 0 but when you without stopping drag it another pixel to the right ui.position.left is actually 2 not 1

15271269
keystore	jks
you will find that other formats like jks allow for different passwords for keys and keystore
as i mentioned earlier though the difference here is that jks was not defined as a personal storage mechanism unlike pkcs#12

15275739
vb.net	vb6
many people when coming from vb6 to vb.net miss control arrays
but in reality it s the other way round vb.net doesn t have control arrays because it doesn t need them any more controls can be put into normal arrays and collections in vb6 control arrays were a hack to work around the fact that you couldn t create normal arrays of controls

15280676
udp	tcp
the situation is a bit different with udp but that s probably not important here
rule of thumb with tcp socket programming - count your bytes

15282875
base	fractions
you can also do this same process with fractions 2.5 irrational pi or even imaginary 2i base except the base cannot be between -1 and 1 inclusive
decimals fractions bits in other base are surprisingly unintuitive considering they work in exactly the same way as integers

15283684
haskell	agda
in haskell this is not possible
it is possible in other languages with type-class like constructs scala agda but it is not possible in haskell

15283684
haskell	agda
it is possible in other languages with type-class like constructs scala agda but it is not possible in haskell
it is possible to make an instance of a class in haskell and then to use it and it is true that instances do act a lot like data -- and they are represented by data at runtime

15284027
viewdidload	viewwillappear
it s probably currently in viewdidload
put that logic in viewwillappear like this if your uilabel creditslabel in that example isn t a property it will need to be one for this to work

15285202
namedtuple	dictionary
normally calling vars returns a dictionary but for namedtuple it seems to return an ordereddict
if the ordereddict doesn t bother you you can leave off the extra call to dictionary

15289889
serializable	deserialization
to create an appropriate wrapper you need a table that maps the uid-s towards functions that create the wrapper associated with the type uid. this table must be pre-initialized for all the types you need to be able to serializable deserialize
but this goes long away your original question that doesn t speak about serialization deserialization

15289889
serializable	deserialization
but this goes long away your original question that doesn t speak about serializable deserialization
if the problem is serializable the type erasure is not a complete solution

15292551
postgresql	mysql
one more note you should upgrade to postgresql 9.2 or at least 9.1 . postgresql 8.4 is very old and not supported very well
enclosed by is mysql syntax

15293314
config	ini
i don t really agree with ms here since textual config files not necessary ini files provide some features that the registry doesn t like the ability to use existing text tools
by default i would read the config once on startup and i d do that not only on ce but on any other system too

15295631
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
firefox and opera aren t able to read mp3 files
you should have the same file in ogg or wav to have it work on every browser

15296422
email	dkim
i copied it into dreamweaver stripped the extra characters and i m now receiving sign email from my server
the answer was two parts 1 no you do not apparently need a traditional ssl installed to use dkim 2 my error was due to copying my private key from an rtf document which added extra characters

15298826
ienumerable	iqueryable
this makes it up to the caller whether they want the iqueryable methods to be used or the ienumerable methods to be used
if someone were to do then they clearly want the object to be processed as an ienumearble not an iqueryable

15301870
spaces	linefeed
i will not use spaces and new lines.i will not use spaces and new lines.
an example of usage would be strict means that white spaces cr linefeed are rejected at decode and cr linefeed are not added at encode

15301870
spaces	linefeed
an example of usage would be strict means that white spaces cr linefeed are rejected at decode and cr linefeed are not added at encode
note that if the folowing is accepted with strict the above is not accepted because of the trailing n linefeed and the following line will throw argumenterror invalid base64 exception so strict accepts expects only alphanumeric characters at decode and returns only alphanumeric at encode

15301870
spaces	linefeed
please try the following and see how one encodes wraps the lines every 60 characters with n linefeed and the strict doesn t print base64.encode64 i will not use spaces and new lines
i will not use spaces and new lines

15305030
strcpy	strncpy
use strcpy or add a null terminator after using strncpy
strncpy does not add the null terminator 0 where as strcpy does

15314261
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
it works in google-chrome firefox opera and ie9+ but not in the above-mentioned webkit browsers
it also seems to work in ie8 though i haven t quite figured out why since my first version the one that works in safari breaks in ie8

15315070
opera	google-chrome
for example animatetransform tag which is the direct child of a svg tag does not animate the svg in firefox and google-chrome though w3 document says it should animate the svg so it will be better to test your svg in opera
google-chrome upto version 25.0.1364.152 does not support svg fully

15315070
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome upto version 25.0.1364.152 does not support svg fully
some svg feature are not supported in firefox too

15318809
ssl	https
the purpose of protocol-agnostic urls is to automatically use either an ssl connection or a regular connection when loading resources based on what is currently being used to load the page
whether or not you are using an ssl connection on your website if you want to support older versions of wordpress then i would use https instead of when possible

15318809
ssl	https
whether or not you are using an ssl connection on your website if you want to support older versions of wordpress then i would use https instead of when possible
please note this will only work for external scripts that support an ssl connection like google s hosted scripts

15319152
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the fonts wouldn t display properly in firefox but they were fine in safari and google-chrome
turns out there is a hidden preference in firefox that needs to be checked in order for firefox to display custom fonts on a web page

15319700
google-chrome	firefox
what is happening i have noticed this issue in google-chrome but not firefox or ie
in fact google-chrome is performing a get but it is tying the post and the get together -- i suppose there is some optimization involved

15321023
google-chrome	firefox
in that case you are not able to modify the source of google-chrome browser content browser.xul file
afaik such functionality is available through xul overlays in plain old non-bootstrapped firefox add-ons those that need restart of web browsers to install

15324104
implements	extends
however i would expect two different list classes implements list to be easily swappable and compatible on this particular level of detail
also not every list implementation would extends abstractlist - it s a convenience not a requirement

15325482
implements	extends
i cannot explain the reason for this but in one of my projects i face similar requirements implements 0 null magic in a custom nhibernate type and using a custom id generator
in my project the custom id type directly implements iusertype and the id generator directly implements iidentifiergenerator and iconfigurable it does not extends nhibernate s tablegenerator

15325662
implements	extends
however if you wish to apply a global rule that isn t implements in your action then you could extends this interceptor and override the parametersinterceptor.acceptablename string method
parameternameaware this interface is implements by actions that want to declare acceptable parameters

15326533
stateless	stateful
check out for an application developers it is stateless always
for end users it is appears to be stateful now each http request results in a new invocation of a servlet a thread calling the servlet s service and doxxx methods regardless of whether the connection is keep-alive or not

15327337
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
i d say sqldatasource is not very appropiated for n-layered applications except n 1 since it talks directly to sql server
on the other hand objectdatasource is a perfectly acceptable option since allows you to call methods from classes on any of the layers the web layer has access to

15328595
innodb	myisam
you can improve it by changing your table engine to innodb like this innodb engine is fully transactional and does not lock whole table during insert update or delete so your problem should go away
it seems that you are using old myisam db engine

15330093
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
on the other hand vc1 on the stack does not call its viewdidload when vc2 is popped since vc1 is still loaded in memory remember you were pushing vc2 on top of vc1 so vc1 must have stayed in memory
so in a way if you want some code executed when the back button is pressed you should put that code in the viewdidappear or viewwillappear method of vc1

15330442
comparator	comparable
have it contain objects that implement comparable have a custom comparator object that compares the elements of your treeset
since you want to have your treeset contain bitset s and bitset does not implement comparable you need to give your treeset a custom comparator

15330442
comparator	comparable
since you want to have your treeset contain bitset s and bitset does not implement comparable you need to give your treeset a custom comparator
how you implement that comparator is up to you

15331558
implements	extends
the framework contains several paradigms for asynchronous programming already - but when it comes to wcf you kinda fall back to how to implements an asynchronous service operation that will provide some infrastructure but not necessarily the ability to automatically cancel an operation
speaking strictly about the cancellation as this is your question you will have to extends whatever your solution ends up being for cancellation

15337282
ssl	https
encryption for free encryption is already a solved problem https ssl both with regard to transport as well as with regard to what you have to implement on your end and it s just a matter of setting it up
server authentication for free https ssl doesn t only solve encryption but also server authentication so that the client can verify whether it s actually talking to the right service

15337282
ssl	https
server authentication for free https ssl doesn t only solve encryption but also server authentication so that the client can verify whether it s actually talking to the right service
guaranteed to work on the internet http https traffic is common on the internet so you won t run into routing problems or firewalls which are hard to traverse

15337397
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there are browser reset libraries take your pick to rectify this very issue -- not just when a single browser changes between versions but also for ie vs firefox vs google-chrome vs safari vs.
firefox is but one browser and 19 is but one version of that browser

15339825
bash	tcsh
with some inspiration from chepner i now have a solution that works but only when called from a bash shell or bash script
it doesn t work from tcsh

15340318
spaces	linefeed
-e the code tr n r d transliterate all characters in the left hand side n r to their corresponding character in the right hand side a spaces and d delete any entries which do not have a corresponding character
so basically this will take the file test.xml store a copy in test.xml.bak change all newlines to spaces delete all linefeed characters r and save this copy as test.xml

15340323
debian	linux
this is not entirely linux specific or debian specific
i think is has something to do with linux standard base or posix specifications maybe

15343676
mp3	wav
you ll need to convert your mp3 to wav first if you want to use this
the xna soundeffect class doesn t support mp3 only wav unfortunately

15344127
kerberos	ldap
internal authentication using login accounts and passwords object permission management based on the grant revoke paradigm client to node encryption using ssl for data going from the client to the cassandra cluster datastax enterprise offers additional security not included in datastax community to enterprises for mission-critical data kerberos authentication a network authentication protocol that allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner using tickets
you can also set up kerberos to use ldap for authentication

15346306
ssl	https
as of having them to work together there is a solution but i don t really see the point ... you will need to disable require ssl checkbox for the web site
if you do not want to do that then you can create two web sites in iis one with http binding and another with https binding and then add this rule to the web.config file of the site with http binding

15346404
google-chrome	firefox
border radius css styling for an object containing a google map v3 is not rendered in google-chrome
other browsers such as firefox and opera respect the settings

15350488
clang	llvm
make sure you have a working and recent enough installation of clang don t forget to build it with arm target support
then cross-compile llvm with the following cmake toolchain definition you should not chroot into your root fs at this stage

15353083
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
and note that the vowels are case-sensitive while other characters are not
since you are not doing an anchored match match the whole input string instead of allowing a match to start and end arbitrarily in the middle of the input string you can write it like this or you can turn on the case-insensitive flag i demo the only assumption that the answer above makes is that the rest of the words before a and after u are english letter

15353467
antialiasing	transparent
hmm the text isn t getting antialiasing properly blending from black to black
as though the background is transparent

15355254
setcontentview	findviewbyid
but this is not your exact problem. actual problem is setcontentview r.layout.main_layout
you can call findviewbyid function after setcontentview

15355555
postgresql	mysql
the offset of the initial row is 0 not 1 for compatibility with postgresql mysql also supports the limit row_count offset offset syntax
there is no difference. from mysql reference select syntax a few examples limit 5 limit the result to the first 5 rows limit 10 5

15358024
cypher	gremlin
neo4j gremlin likewise when you want to execute a neo4j cypher query use the cypher object stored on the graph object
there are three cypher methods unfortunately these aren t documented on the website yet g.cypher.query used when returning a list of nodes relationships -- it will initialize them to objects

15360075
dbcontext	objectcontext
you can access the underlying objectcontext whenever you need to use features that are not supported by dbcontext
if you can t do it on dbcontext you can always cast to objectcontext and use its functionality

15360821
icmp	tcp
also icmp does not have ports whereas tcp obviously does
i like the explanation for net ping s using tcp though

15364557
implements	extends
treebasedtable extends standardrowsortedtable which extends standardtable which implements serializable
btw a simple check would have helped you since the compiler doesn t complain about this line you know that treebasedtable implements serializable

15365786
bower	npm
it seems bower doesn t automatically pick up proxy settings like npm does
if you set the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables then bower should work

15366908
profiling	benchmarking
profiling can have their own overhead
they re good at telling you which parts of your code are bottlenecks but they re not good at actually benchmarking two different things reliably

15367249
super	extends
i m not quite sure what you mean by this but the method which prints super is held in the class definition of the superclass the method which prints sub is held in the class definition of the subclassing
since sub extends super the definition of the sub class includes a reference to the definition of the superclass

postgresql	mysql
mysql isn t necessarily the wrong choice either and the nosql options can be of interest i m just suggesting alternatives. indeed postgresql can build index on immutable functions which mysql can t as far as i know and in recent versions you could use plv8 on the json data directly to build indexes on specific json elements of interest which would improve the speed of your queries when searching for that data
key-per-column for the data i need to search and json for others in the same mysql database

google-chrome	firefox
possible duplicate google-chrome equivalent of firefox firebug css select path bookmarklet google-chrome extension i would still like other people s answers suggestions and tips on how to best deal with this in google-chrome
google-chrome doesn t have it so people have made google-chrome extensions bookmarklets and other tools for google-chrome to replicate this functionality

15370006
google-chrome	firefox
i couldn t get it to work at all on google-chrome for android
it did work on firefox for android but with a pretty lousy framerate

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
bounds and frames are not guaranteed to have been set till viewwillappear viewdidappear
move your code to viewdidappear

15372000
opera	firefox
i know opera doesn t fire it. also window.onbeforeunload is used to ask the user if they want to leave the page or not
if you return a string from the event that will be presented to the user except in firefox

15374125
daemons	systemd
please note that rufus-scheduler s cron feature doesn t leverage the underlying systemd s cron daemons
as indicated in the readme rufus-scheduler understands cron strings like in on your osx gnu linux systemd type man 5 crontab in a terminal to have a detailed explanation of that format

15375034
ssl	https
this would prevent tampering but may not prevent replay attacks -- ssl would help some with that as the transmission would be encrypted but replay attacks would still be possible via perhaps a man in the middle attack
no https alone does not provide you with the security you re looking for

15377211
apache	nginx
another way to do this probably harder but also more flexible in the long run would be to run two completely separate instances of apache or one apache and one other server such as nginx each with its own php version
apache has some documentation for doing this but it isn t complete

15378605
g++	gcc
gcc is for c g++ is for c++
gcc s linker will link against the c standard library which doesn t contain the functions provided by the c++ standard library which results in undefined references

15378605
g++	gcc
so use the correct g++ g++ -g -o hello hello.cpp additional remark usually gcc identifies a c++ source as such
however it is most-likely that your ubuntu installation doesn t have g++ installed if you didn t install it yourself

15379023
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome does not offer nightly builds although they do have an open source project called chromium that does offer nightly builds google-chrome is based on chromium but they are not identical
similarly safari does not offer nightly builds either though again they have an open source project based on webkit

imperative	declarative
the idempotent property of a pure function means the function call on its variables can be substituted by its value which is not generally the case for the arguments of an imperative procedure
pure functions seem to be declarative w.r.t

15382180
imperative	declarative
but the composition of pure functions does not maintain any such consistency because it is possible to model a side-effect global state imperative process in a pure functional programming language haskell s iomonad and moreover it is entirely impossible to prevent doing such in any turing complete pure functional programming language
as i wrote in 2012 which seems to the similar consensus of comments in your recent blog that declarative programming is an attempt to capture the notion that the intended semantics are never opaque

shadowing	named
this is referred to as shadowing
remove the type on this when you include the type declaration you re creating a new variable with the same named that s local to the try block not assigning to the class-level field

15387101
floating-point	fractions
the arithmetic operation will introduce error if the exact mathematical result is not representable in the floating-point type
there are two ways in which the results might not be representable one is that the number of bits or digits generally when not using binary floating-point needed to represent the significand fractions portion do not fit in the floating-point format

15387101
floating-point	fractions
there are two ways in which the results might not be representable one is that the number of bits or digits generally when not using binary floating-point needed to represent the significand fractions portion do not fit in the floating-point format
another is that the magnitude of the result exceeds the range of the floating-point format resulting in overflow or underflow

15391358
primes	modulus
you cannot use random data to construct the public key directly for a number of reasons the modulus must conform to a specific structure it is the product of two large primes whereas your guid in binary form generally will not be
in order to decrypt the rsa-encrypted data you must know the two primes used to generate the modulus

15391358
primes	modulus
in order to decrypt the rsa-encrypted data you must know the two primes used to generate the modulus
even if your random modulus was magically the product of two large primes you wouldn t be able to determine them since this would require factoring the modulus which is an intentionally difficult thing to do indeed the difficulty is the entire basis of rsa s security

15392513
laravel	codeigniter
another more recent entry is laravel which i have read about but not yet tried
look into codeigniter it is a lightweight php mysql framework with very good documentation

15399141
cpython	pypy
you should use easy_install that is installed by the 32bit version of cpython
easy_install can work with not only 32bit and 64bit version of cpython but other implementations of python like pypy

15401262
implements	extends
now to your question i am not clear on what you are trying to achieve but if you want your app with menu to behave like say the google+ app then one way of doing it is to implements a base class that extends the activity class or what ever base activity used in your project and let the base set the slidingmenu
then you would simple extends your base activity in each of the activities that are supposed to have a menu

15401698
move	drag
more telling to us was that when changing the android settings to overlay touch events on the screen a touch with a small drag does not register as a motion event highlighted by the fact that the crosshairs from the android os do not move
from this our conclusion is that the minimal drag distance is being enforced at the os level and your application will never be aware of drag events smaller than the touch_slop value

15401914
prepare	execute
the later does prepare execute in one call
pdo query and pdo execute will not return the results on the other hand the pdostatement object will allow you to specify the data you want to return

15402155
strcpy	strdup
then to copy the string you want to use strcpy the way you had it was just assigning a pointer to your old string and in the process leaing the memory you had just allocated
it s also common to use strdup which combines both of these steps this is convenient but strdup is not part of the official c library

15402558
google-chrome	firefox
so edit this has also been suggested as working the really fancy thing is that google-chrome takes you a not and raises you all
it of course sees nothing wrong with matching both while firefox dutifully only looks a bit lime

15403744
google-chrome	firefox
add this to get it working this will center the div if it doesn t render full width or leave things the same in google-chrome
firefox is rendering the div tags around the btn differently

15407762
domcontentloaded	onload
so another way to check dom readiness is to use domcontentloaded event see for more info
your code probably doesn t work because the dom is not ready when your function runs. there are several ways to check if the dom is ready before executing any code. the most common way is to wait for the onload event to occur. in your case that might look something like one of the problems with waiting for onload is that if the page take a long time to load execution of your code will be delayed. and in fact the dom can be ready even before the page has loaded

15407783
arp	mtu
grr from there you can find your default gateway in the arp table if it doesn t show up issue a single ping then check again then fail
the following devfs files will provide this information proc net arp proc net route find the route entry with 0 0 as the host mask iface destination gateway flags refcnt use metric mask mtu window irtt eth0 00000000 b91a210a 0003 0 0 100 00000000 0 0 0 and convert the gateway field it s in little-endian hex.

mtu	tftp
if an option can take multiple items such # as the dns option they can be listed on the same line or multiple # lines. # examples #opt dns 192.168.10.2 192.168.10.10 option subnet 255.255.255.0 #opt router 192.168.10.2 #opt wins 192.168.10.10 #option dns 129.219.13.81 # appended to above dns servers for a total of 3 option domain local option lease 864000 # default 10 days #option msstaticroutes 10.0.0.0 8 10.127.0.1 # single static route #option staticroutes 10.0.0.0 8 10.127.0.1 10.11.12.0 24 10.11.12.1 # arbitrary option in hex form option 0x08 01020304 # option 8 cookie server ip addr 1.2.3.4 # currently supported options for more info see options.c #opt lease num #opt subnet ip #opt broadcast ip #opt router ip_list #opt ipttl num #opt mtu num #opt hostname string # client s hostname #opt domain string # client s domain suffix #opt search string_list # search domains #opt nisdomain string #opt timezone num # localtime - utc_time in seconds

setinterval	settimeout
here s another stackoverflow on the same topic ios 6 safari setinterval doesn #39
t get fired and another setinterval pauses in iphone ipad mobile safari during scrolling and here is the closest thing you ll get to a bug report on it apple doesn t make bug reports public to maintain the illusion of perfection so developers made their own bug site this bit of code will unfreeze timers that are broken lost destroyed by ios during a page scroll this is another attempt to fix the freeze ios 6 js events function not called if has settimeout in it unfortunately there is nothing you can do to fire events while page scrolling

15410234
onclick	onsubmit
you should hook into onclick event of submit
a form can have onsubmit event but a button cannot have the onsubmit

15413011
udp	tcp
so the things you might look at switch to udp instead of tcp and implement your own low-latency reliability ack resend mechanism choose a wifi channel without other users if possible if you must stay with tcp disable nagle use the phone in access point mode though that is perhaps undesirable as you may not want the pc s other traffic to go that way use bluetooth instead of wifi
you should not expect low-latency behavior of tcp as it is not designed for that purpose

15413682
freebsd	linux
the freebsd kernel probably allows this
in general there s gdb remote debugging procedure i m not sure the linux kernel can be debugged that way

15414600
ssl	https
note i haven t tried something similar having two separate domain ssl certs pointing to same https port so not sure what the result could be
in windows azure cloud service the ssl certificate binds to the port which you have enabled in the service first as external in your case it is 443

15414600
ssl	https
now in your case you have another ssl certificate and want to bind to same 443 port there is the problem because you have already used the port 443 by binding previous certificate and it will not work
when an iis server supports multiple websites within it runs all of them on different port internally both http and https and based in incoming header the request is sent internally to different site domain which works fine

15415511
ciimage	uiimage
somewhere you are using the uiimage instance rather than the ciimage instance.
ciimage has a function called extent on it from a quick google and uiimage doesn t

15417525
super	implements
even it doesn t look super clean
unfortunately it looks like the character is not implements in ml-lex according to this manual the dollar sign of c lex is not implements since it is an abbreviation for lookahead involving the newline character that is it is an abbreviation for n . and it is also noted in this user guide the dollar sign of c lex is not implements since it is an abbreviation for lookahead involving the newline character that is it is an abbreviation for n. so.

15418013
scrollable	panels
it looks like the scrollable area is a container like a panels
if that s the case printing the form isn t the problem it s printing the scrollable control

15418019
bash	subshell
this is both an implementation-specific and platform-specific detail. in bash both require the same number of processes
if lastpipe is not enabled there is a process for each pipeline element plus a subshell for either substitution plus the parent process

15419151
octal	decimal
it could look like this just note that will succeed not only for decimal but also for octal and hexadecimal numbers too
to make sure that only decimal value will be read you could read it into the temporary std string object and validate it before you use it to retrieve the number

15419344
octal	decimal
when you start a number with a 0 python sees it as an octal
so while yes octal 04 is equal to decimal 04 but octal 08 does not even exist because octal digits can only be in the range 0 7

15420397
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome or safari webkit you can use the extension prefixed by -webkit- read more here
firefox doesn t support scrollbar styling

15421320
comparator	comparable
additionally implementing the interface means implementing the comparator method yourself in your implementing class
comparable is an interface not a class

15422394
super	implements
actually i think there is no way to jump through this from your latinkeyboardview on api 14 or maybe higher because you can not even use the isineditmode because you definitely have to invoke the view s constructor with super
and that constructor will try to get the audio system service which just simply fails because i guess you try to run this in eclipse graphical editor actually i got this error when i tried to place my custom view into a layout in the grapical layout editor i think that the only way to hack this is to implements your own keyboardview without the getsystemservice

15424040
lxml	beautifulsoup
while not exactly answering your question it seems most people recommend going to lxml from beautifulsoup even the author of beautifulsoup
we used beautifulsoup in house for a project and found going to lxml gave us more control over the html parsing we were doing as well as less odd issues

15424095
mdpi	hdpi
mdpi hdpi and xhdpi are all select based on screens density - basically the size of the pixels - not the number of pixels
so if your 1080p screens is very large it could conceivably be an mdpi screens yes it happens

15424549
portrait	landscape
if the device is not flat you can visibly see the orientation changes from portrait to landscape
i do not understand what you mean by blocked but if the screen is turned off the os seems to set the orientation to portrait

15424549
portrait	landscape
i do not understand what you mean by blocked but if the screen is turned off the os seems to set the orientation to portrait
you can test this by getting an app to a landscape mode lay it flat down and turning off the screen

15424769
udp	tcp
you will also need to take care for message order since udp datagrams may be reordered by the network and missing datagrams because udp is not reliable
the question that you quoted is about tcp channels which are different from the udp channels that you are using

15427473
daemons	systemd
i just use chris tutorial to see how to build a non-graphical daemons main program not a uiapplication copy it to my myappname.app folder and create a com.mycompany.mydaemon.plist file that defines the launchd daemons
once the plist is installed in systemd library launchdaemons on the phone you can start it without having to reboot the phone with launchctl load -w systemd library launchdaemons com.mycompany.mydaemon.plist at the command line on the phone

15432835
cakephp	yii
the plugins extensions in yii are so easy to create compared to cakephp
cakephp till i know did not support modules

15440326
implements	extends
solution in the long run in the long run there may be a better solution if when #2337 is implements but we probably won t implements that
unfortunately extends jooq to thoroughly support a new sql dialect isn t very straightforward

15441025
vsto	add-in
the action uses shadow copy to copy the vsto .dll into a temporary location and loads it from there
anti-virus tools like mcafee actively kill this shadow copy operation hence the add-in will not load on protected computers or any with tight security permissions

15441462
cstring	bstr
if the bstr doesn t have nul s embedded inside you can simply pass it to a cstring constructor that will make a deep-copy of it and you can locally work with your cstring
modifications to that cstring won t be visible on the original bstr

15441570
swt	swing
javafx also integrates with swt and that integration is currently simpler than the javafx swing integration because there is only a single gui thread to worry about
here is a screenshot of javafx swing interop sample from oracle i went over a few answers on so with regards to which one to use and i still can not make up my mind

15443528
comparator	comparable
if the class doesn t let you pass in your own comparator then you re stuck monkeying with the keys or creating your own subclass with the comparable interface the alternative code would look something like this
you ve named the two ways to do it pass in a comparator or have key be comparable

15447189
udp	tcp
udp does not allow for chunked reading like tcp does
reading a udp message is an all-or-nothing operation you either read the whole message in full or none of it at all

15448308
queue	fifo
i guess that the bottom line is that you cannot be absolutely sure that your browser will queue its events in the order they happen
i did extensive tests against a test site i created and i eventually got all browsers i tried to fail ie to queue in other than a fifo sequence

15453215
gson	jackson
while not exactly the same jackson has tree model representation similar to gson so you need to traverse it step by step
edit august 2015 there actually is now since jackson 2.3 support for json pointer expressions with jackson

15456301
emacs	sublimetext
solution # 2 -- sublimetext 2 install create a macro and bind it to your favorite keyboard shortcut solution # 1 -- emacs -- define two functions and create a macro
solution # 1 -- sublimetext 2 for whatever the reason super+d aka +d aka find_under_expand do not work with macros

15457274
google-chrome	firefox
ie is c microsoft and ibm wouldn t be able to ship it chromium the google-chrome core would be a different story
xulrunner a step sister of firefox was choosen to be able to provide the integration into the notes client like opening new windows or sending receiving composite events

15457517
prepare	execute
well activerecord implicitly checks whether the codeblock was given and either execute the underlying sql statement and iterates through result or returns an iterator with prepare but not yet execute sql statement
the latter will be lazy execute and cached on demand

15459550
punctuation	words
the default tokenizers do not ignore punctuation characters but treat them as words separators
so the text body or match string book s will end up as two words book and s . these will never match a single work like books

15460332
implements	extends
this doesn t magically solve all problems but at least that s the proper way to implements general purpose functions
if you are really concerned about structure and keeping things independent don t even start with singletons or inheritance that extends functionality

15460382
d3.js	leaflet
so d3.js has a point no pun intended and the multipolygon should be closed by adding the start coordinate at the end
d3.js is not wrong the data is incorrect and leaflet is more lenient

15460382
d3.js	leaflet
d3.js is not wrong the data is incorrect and leaflet is more lenient
taking litchfield top left county as an example the multipolygon is not closed its end does not equal the beginning. i ve plotted the coordinates marking the first coordinate red and the last one green as you can see the last coordinate gets discarded by d3.js

15461402
noexcept	throw
next big performance optimizations can be achieved in containers like stl vector when your type s move constructor and move assignment are annotated with noexcept
when stl utility std move_if_noexcept detects that your moves do not throw it will use these safe moves rather than copies for some operations like resize

15466759
move	drag
this answer to the question board drawing code to move an oval shows how to drag an object on a canvas
in your case you re not resetting the base of the delta as you move the object

15467514
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
c- throw runtimeexception
4- if the parent s method throws unchecked-exception then the child s method can a- not to throw any exceptions

15468379
nsmutablestring	nsstring
your nsmutablestring creation calls aren t balanced properly
you re promising the compiler that you re creating a nsmutablestring but you ask an nsstring to create an instance

15468636
fgets	fread
and 2 fread will not null terminate the input string for you unlike fgets etc
when it comes to writing fwrite would be the logical complement to fread but you can perfectly well continue using fprintf and friends or fputs or putc or any of the other standard i o writing functions

15468889
profiling	debugging
statement in your code will cause the debugger to break there node-webkit-agent a heap and cpu profiling tool that uses the chrome developer tools interface to profiling your node.js application
debugging is not currently supported but apparently is on the way long stacktraces sometimes you can get errors that don t have any stack associated with them

15470127
persistent	transient
from a jpa perspective - no merge was not meant for associating your xstream streamed transient objects to persistent
jpa intends for merge to work with the normal jpa lifecycle - create new objects persistent them get find them detach them modify them including adding new objects merge them optionally modifiy them some more then persist save them

15471521
implements	extends
if your class is implements the runnable interface then you only override the run .so this instance creates a separate thread and every individual thread runs separately but not as a single heavy thread in your program. another thing since java does not support multiple inherited if you implements the runnable you ll avoid problems of multiple extends so if you implements runnable interface you can extends any class that you are required other than thread class
if your class is extends the thread class then it becomes a single thread which inherits the properties thread class so it ll be heavy

15472302
backgrounding	multitasking
all ui updates go to the main queue all heavy backgrounding processing to a backgrounding queue
the usual code pattern looks like this allocating a task to a specific core is something that should be left to the system you re running on a multitasking os and there are many things that your app doesn t know about

15472762
rsa	aes
the problem is that you cannot use an rsa key to encrypt data which is longer than the size of the key which is 128 bytes in your example
you should use a symmetric encryption algorithm for large blocks of data - aes

15473659
bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
fancier shells like bash and zsh permit you to set a variable and export it as an environment variable at the same time like so with a standard posix bourne shell the equivalent is achieved by doing it in two commands note that once you ve exported a variable you can reset it to a different value later in the script and it s still exported you don t need to export it again
also you can export several variables at a time you mentioned tcsh in your comment but csh and derivatives are completely different from bourne-based shells and not recommended for use

15478154
uiview	subviews
the application does the following create s a uiview adds 10 000 layers to that view s layer rendering begins when you touch the screen it s an ios sample app creates a background thread renders the uiview s layer into a context which in turn renders its sublayers creates a uiimage with the content of the render context adds the new image to the screen in a uiimageview it does all this while running a timer on the main thread showing that the background thread actually doesn t block the main thread here is the code.
first create a subviews with a lot of layers second create a method that will start a timer and then triggers the render.

15481468
udp	tcp
udp does not guarantee sequence or reliability so it might be possible that one packet overtakes the other so the user receives the world before the hello or even that one gets lost the user only receives hello or only world
the standard socket class however uses tcp by default

15481522
client-side	server-side
if you want to use the fashionable modern client-side font rendering what most programss written today are using you have to use one of the toolkits or xft2 or cairo libraries
if you want to use the old-fashioned now-deprecated server-side font rendering method you cannot change the font size you need to load the correctly-sized fond

15483809
persistent	transient
hibernate merge was not meant for associating transient objects to persistent ones. the merge should ideally work for you because you are actually dealing with detached object
since you are setting ids in the transobj before calling merge hibernate would consider them as detached not transient

15484655
uiview	calayer
i m leaving them so as not to deprive vansfannel s comment of context and also because it s still a good warning to have for uiview now for calayers if you set the frame like _videopreviewlayer setframe self.view.bounds that will cause _videopreviewlayer s actual rendered frame to be self.view.bounds even if _videopreviewlayer has a non-identity transform
it s important to remember that calayer s frame is actually a derived property

15486250
concave	convex
if your polygon is convex the easiest way is to use gl_triangles with the indicies 0 1 2 0 2 3 0 3 4 ... it will look like this the situation for concave is more work
an algorithm that also works for concave polygons not ones with holes

15488698
prepare	execute
to create one call prepare in the thread that is to run the loop and then loop to have it process messages until the loop is stopped
looper | android developers in other words and in a simple manner the main ui does have a message queue already prepared and that s why you don t see that error when calling new handler within oncreate onstart onresume etc... but for any worker thread created the system needs a queue to send the messages to when using handlers although the code doesn t show it i bet that code is being execute in a worker thread either normal thread or doinbackground method of an asynctask and that s what causes the error to avoid it remember to always call looper.prepare before creating a handler from a worker thread

15490575
directx	gdi
wpf s underlying technology isn t gdi gdi+ instead it uses directx
so wpf uses directx no matter what type of user interface we create

15492676
scheme	racket
this is a scheme solution
car and cdr which have historical importance but are not in your learning racket vocabulary

15493022
super	self
if the call to super returns nil then the object was not setup properly so you should also return nil
doing self super initwithnibname nil bundle nil

15493766
serializable	deserialization
if sticky sessions are not used then i d probably use sql state provider or something else some other product that can do deserialization faster to handle this
if you are not using sticky sessions meaning that once a session is created your load balancer will maintain the request always to the same box then you need to make sure that in your web.config the outofproc state provider is configured to point to the ip address of the server running the asp.net state service -by default it points to localhost- also you need to make sure that everything you put in session is serializable decorate your classes with the serializable attribute in my experience i ve always seen sticky sessions being turned on on the load balancer as this is the simplest approach

15500397
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload is typically not called multiple times in the view s lifecycle
viewwillappear viewdidappear are called when the view is actually coming on screen

15503928
google-chrome	firefox
secondly the final conditional comment seems faulty should probably be that said i m not sure why it is working in for example google-chrome
i guess it may well be because of google-chrome reacting differently to the broken conditional comment and applying the tag within while firefox does not

15504901
prepare	execute
if it s not firing then your prepare method is either in the wrong action you re not accessing the page through an action initially hitting a plain jsp or there s an interceptor stack configuration issue
prepare execute when a preparable action is execute

15511668
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari firefox edge handles it but ie do not

icmp	tcp
note though the os will often do its own processing of tcp and udp packets including sending icmp port unreachable or other responses for ports it doesn t have listeners for ...and doing your own processing on top of that is bound to cause wackiness
if you re going to implement your own flavor of tcp you might want to use a different protocol number

15514049
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and safari include an origin header on same-origin post put delete requests same-origin get requests will not have an origin header
firefox doesn t include an origin header on same-origin requests

15518248
setcontentview	findviewbyid
solution call setcontentview first and then initialize your variables and do the remaining stuff
from you code snippet for oncreate it seems that you have not called setcontentview . for this reason all calls for x findviewbyid r.id.x

15518313
setinterval	settimeout
if you don t care if the code within the timer may take longer than your interval use setinterval setinterval function delay that fires the function passed in as first parameter over and over
a better approach is to use settimeout along with a self-executing anonymous function that guarantees that the next call is not made before your code was executed

15519116
vsto	add-in
the answer can be found here there are alternatives to vsto for office development that help you develop for multiple versions netoffice add-in express
from what i know developing for multiple office versions with vsto can be a pain and is not directly supported by vsto this of course is the advantage of using the old shared add-in project types you can build one add-in that targets all versions of all office apps that support com add-in ie 2000 onwards

15523982
uiview	subviews
i followed the steps listed and i was able to view the map inside the small uiview when i set mapviewonscreen addsubview _mapview
my suggestions link the uiview from your storyboard to your header file as a uiview instance variable not a gmsmapview change the mapwithframe camera method to be set to your linked uiview s bounds at the end of the viewdidload method set the uiview instance variable to your gmsmapview or add a subviews

15524471
implements	extends
so a more object oriented approach would be to make your enums implements a common interface and then use delegation to a support class that provides the real implemetation
enums cannot extends other classes but can implements interfaces

15525003
google-chrome	firefox
this works as expected with ie google-chrome
but not with firefox

15536660
spaces	delimiter
this is happening because white spaces are not accepted in parameter names
you can change acceptparamnames parameter of the parametersinterceptor but as the documentation states acceptparamnames - a comma delimiter list of regular expressions to describe a whitelist of accepted parameter names

15537569
client-side	server-side
javascript js is an interpreted computer programming language.it was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that client-side scripts could interact with the user control the browser communicate asynchronously and alter the document content that was displayed
there are 3 major types of javascript namely client-side javascript csjs -- an extended version of javascript that enables the enhancement and manipulation of web pages and client browsers server-side javascript ssjs -- an extended version of javascript that enables back-end access to databases file systems and servers core javascript -- the base javascript language client-side javascript csjs and server-side javascript ssjs are dependent on the core javascript and cannot work without it

15543429
implements	extends
mutablesequence will automatically implements all the other list methods based on the five methods below
on the flip side this is not as efficient as overriding all the list methods manually -- for example the extends method provided by mutablesequence will call __len__ and __insert__ once for each element

15543988
client-side	server-side
this could be expensive however because it means your application would be going back to the server every time the user clicks the add button however i m not sure how you d achieve this strictly on the client-side
but there is nothing stopping you creating new controls on the fly on the server-side using asp.net

15546937
bash	zsh
i m not really a zsh user but seems like in zsh is the same as in bash
to create a new file or truncate it in zsh use

15548428
webkit	gecko
function the problem with this is of course that this is limited to only webkit
gecko firefox however does not support the blur function but it does allow you to refer to a svg filter using a url resource

15548543
layoutparams	viewgroup
basically layoutparams layout_ are used for child views to tell their parent viewgroup how they should be positioned
but layoutparams are specific to each viewgroup type linearlayout relativelayout framelayout etc. so layoutparams can not be generalized in this way for a theme

15555969
tabcontrol	tabitem
converter code tabcontrol xaml
even if you had access to the just the tabitem properties in the code-behind it wouldn t help as the tab doesn t know it s own index in the tabcontrol collection

15558403
innodb	myisam
innodb implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while myisam implements table-level lock
innodb has transactions while myisam does not

15558403
innodb	myisam
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not. innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

15558403
innodb	myisam
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not. innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not

15558403
innodb	myisam
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not
the only thing that i see on this list which impacts the query-level is that myisam does not support foreign-keys or constraints but ormlite as of 3 2013 does not support them either

15561681
phong	shading
your question is much longer than the whole theory behind gouraud and phong shading
and the confusing mathematical symbols are not typical in conputer graphics so in two sentences gouraud shading bilinearily interpolates the colors at the vertices

15567649
implements	extends
redis pub sub mechanism is not reliable enough to implements a logical cluster because unread messages will be lost there is no queuing of items with pub sub
to achieve ha of a collection of redis instances you can try redis sentinel but it does not extends to your own software

15570577
nunit	mstest
what you are asking about can be achieved with parameterized test fixtures in nunit
i am not familiar enough with mstest to suggest an equivalent approach there and a quick search indicates that mstest may not have this feature

15570717
rsa	aes
also rsa ecb pkcs1padding is not common when you want to rsa encrypt a large amount of data usually you encrypt an aes key with rsa and encrypt your data with aes instead
basically to do this rsa ecb decrypt outside of java it will be manually and you are going to have to break your cipher text up by your block size key size and then decrypt each block without padding until the final block with padding that s how you get the ecb

15572924
comparator	comparable
for example if one adds two keys a and b such that to a sorted set that does not use an explicit comparator the second add operation returns false and the size of the sorted set does not increase because a and b are equivalent from the sorted set s perspective
virtually all java core classes that implement comparable have natural orderings that are consistent with equals

15574351
google-chrome	firefox
to be as compatible and forgiving as possible google-chrome does have a window.event property like ie s of old did
since the first line of your function is wrong javascript s scope scanning resolves event to window.event - which works in ie and google-chrome not in firefox

15574773
ng-switch	ng-show
as discussed in the comments ng-switch can be used to add the appropriate html content to the dom based on the type
note that ng-show ng-hide currently do not add remove content from the dom like ng-switch does ndash

15574829
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
so throwing nullpointerexception would be legal however it s not the common practice so i would recommend illegalargumentexception
the problem with nullpointerexception is that it occures when you forget to check if something is null or give the wrong argument that is null and shouldn t

15575077
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you can use viewport units doesn t have full support quite yet but ie10 google-chrome firefox and safari all support it
one downside or possible upside is that at least in google-chrome the text doesn t scale as the viewport is resized

15580151
prepare	execute
you can do it like this now you can prepare the statement i recommend using pdo for this
now you can execute variables into the prepared query if you re inserting or updating then you would have wanted to do which stores a boolean in success or you can fetch the values from a result if you re selecting note that you should actually make that be a function and pass shopid into the function but not the session itself and check if the session actually exists

15581824
ssl	https
also make sure that the proxy.cgi script closes exists after every run to make sure that the apache ssl process isn t getting filled up with zombie processes that never close themselves
i have had problems like this at times and nearly all of them have been solved by forcing a connection close in every https response

15585373
ocaml	sml
features sml supports but not ocaml transparent signature ascription module-level let symmetric sharing constraints syntactic sugar for functors over types and values features ocaml 4 has but not sml higher-order functors recursive modules local modules nested signatures modules as first-class values general module sharing module type of several sml implementations provide some of these as extensions however higher-order functors sml nj moscow ml alice ml local and first-class modules moscow ml alice ml module sharing sml nj alice ml nested signatures moscow ml alice ml and recursive modules moscow ml
semantics-wise the biggest difference is in the treatment of type equivalence especially with respect to functors in sml functors are generative which means that applying the same functor twice to the same argument always yields fresh types

15586667
rvm	bundler
system ruby is when using rvm the ruby version installed on the machine ie not via rvm
if you are just starting gems and bundler are of interest to you

15587459
keystore	jks
according to the documentation java supports at a minimum the jks and pkcs12 keystore types so you can do something like
i don t know about the keytool class and since it s not a public api i d be averse to using it but you can read and write keystores yourself using the keystore class

15587786
gam	mgcv
mgcv gam doesn t find the knots - it places them for you and you can control where it places them via the knots argument
in mgcv gam there is a way to do this your q2 via the predict.gam method and

15591798
ubuntu	linux
read postgresql tutorial it doesn t matter if it s ubuntu or other linux
initdb -d usr local pgsql data you need to be logged as user postgres on linux machine

15593399
serializable	deserialization
since the json doesn t contain type information switching to another serializable api like jackson wouldn t provide for a simpler solution. the following demonstrates the approach i d likely take
as i understand the problem custom processing is necessary to provide the desired polymorphic deserialization where the decision for which type to use is based on the presence of specific json element names

15594326
awt	swing
generally mixing awt swing components is not a good idea
the older awt components typically don t respect the z-order of components and often hide their lightweight neighbors

15596709
required	placeholder
encapsulate it with square brackets edit i see you are using an odbcconnection this will required that your parameters placeholder will be supplied using question marks not strings with prefix
so your commandtext should be note how i have removed also the id field and its parameter placeholder because you say it is an autoincrement field and therefore you can t pass your own value for that. also remember that in this scenario the parameters are recognized by their position in the parameter collection

15603019
mongodb	bson
generally the mongodb server will not see a difference
the bson encoding length is the same 64 bits

15603325
skip-lists	tree
it could use another type of data structure say a splay tree scapegoat tree or deterministic skip-lists that also guarantees this time complexity
interestingly though not all balanced binary search tree structures can support amortized o 1 deletion

15603633
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
any exception that is a child type of runtimeexception is not required to be handled
this is called an unchecked-exception

15603690
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
any sub-class like classcastexception etc are derived from runtimeexception and you need not worry about handling them
it can be achieved by throwing a unchecked-exception

15604573
calloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
however there s never a good excuse to be using malloc and free in c++

15605616
g++	gcc
i was trying to deal with the same problem which led me to finding this question and after a bunch of research came to the definitive conclusion that no you are not missing anything there is no way around this besides compiling your own g++
see this recent question on the gcc-help mailing list i compared gcc sources and found that you can go as high as stock 4.4 as unique symbols were added in 4.5

15605624
nsorderedset	nsset
the fundamental problem is that a core data ordered to-many relationship returns an nsorderedset and nsorderedset is not a subclass of nsset
any array controller bindings that expect an nsset will fail

15606979
viewmodel	caliburn
code in the main viewmodel may look like this also i noticed you have export ishell attribute on your mainviewmodel class - which doesn t look right because screen is not ishell
consider using windowmanager from caliburn

15607304
hex	binary
if not you will get an escaped version and depending on the escape settings may want to convert to binary yourself if it is hex though you can just strip off the x at the front of the value and use as hex
i would store as bytea hex encoded

15607972
octal	binary	octal	decimal
0644 octal is 0.110.100.100 in binary i ve added dots for readability or as you may calculate 420 in decimal
leading 0 means this is octal constant not the decimal one

15607972
octal	decimal
leading 0 means this is octal constant not the decimal one
and you need an octal to change file mode

15614349
prepare	execute
use pdo- prepare which returns pdostatement object and then execute the statement or just use pdo- query and do not execute the pdostatement
pdo- query will execute a query and return pdostatement object now you are again executing the returned pdostatement which cause this error

15614512
pdfsharp	itext
it can use either gdi+ or wpf. it includes support for unicode in pdf files. it also includes migradoc foundation which brings you all the high-level functionality not included in pdfsharp
itext is a library that allows you to create and manipulate pdf documents

15616237
implements	extends
you ve told the compiler that only things that implements the interface are allowed to be used as t but you are sending in a type that doesn t implements the interface
if these types are coming from an auto-generated service reference you can take advantage of the fact that the data types are implemented as partial classes by the reference code generator and extends them to implements your new interface by simply making another partial class file

15622698
comm	grep
since android 7.0 the easiest way to find out the process id by package name is to use pidof command just run it like this adb shell pidof my.app.package in android before 7.0 people used ps command and then parsed its output using either built-in filter by comm value which for android apps is the last 15 characters of the package name or grep command
the comm filter did not work if the last 15 characters of the name started with a digit and the grep was not included by default until android 4.2

15624375
mono	xamarin.android
and this situation is likely to continue for a little while yet as xamarin are currently adding .net 4.5 mono 3 support async await support pcl support this work is being done with some urgency but without any official target date - so i m afraid there isn t any easy way to predict dates for alpha beta or final availability
for the current osx setup i think you can use the current xamarinstudio monodevelop - 4.0.2 the current stable xamarin.ios monotouch and xamarin.android monodroid - do not use the aplha channel for the current pc setup i think you can cannot use xamarin.ios but you can use vs2010 or vs2012 the current stable xamarin.android monodroid - do not use the aplha channel with just a couple of changes you need to add two supported framework xml files - one for android and one for monotouch - you can find these on for discussions on getting things building and running don t use stackoverflow - instead use one of as a backup you can also try don t even think about trying to get an mvvmcross app built - on the free version of xamarin - it s limits are way too low for any app i ve tried to build

15624692
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
you can do it in css but there isn t much support in browsers other than modern versions of google-chrome safari and opera at the moment
firefox currently only supports svg masks

15625001
realloc	malloc
dynamic array of dynamic strings not everyone approves of using realloc to initially allocate and then reallocate memory space
you can do a malloc before the loop if you prefer

15629463
implements	extends
you re not doing anything wrong validation is implements as internal middleware within mongoose and middleware doesn t get executed during an update as that s basically a pass-through to the native driver
if you want your client update validated you ll need to find the object to update apply the new property values to it see underscore s extends method and then call save on it

15629640
udp	tcp
otherwise re-invent tcp using udp at the application level
from wikipedia udp is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction is either not necessary or performed in the application avoiding the overhead of such processing at the network interface level

15629640
udp	tcp
from wikipedia udp is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction is either not necessary or performed in the application avoiding the overhead of such processing at the network interface level
time-sensitive applications often use udp because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets which may not be an option in a real-time system. 2 if error correction facilities are needed at the network interface level an application may use the transmission control protocol tcp or stream control transmission protocol sctp which are designed for this purpose

15629640
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp
time-sensitive applications often use udp because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets which may not be an option in a real-time system. 2 if error correction facilities are needed at the network interface level an application may use the transmission control protocol tcp or stream control transmission protocol sctp which are designed for this purpose
basically use tcp if you care if the packets message gets there

15634566
d3.js	chart.js
its not as feature inclusive as d3.js but it is working to become exactly that in the future
chart.js is a javascript library that just came out that creates charts using html5 for rendering

15638541
postgresql	mysql
while it is possible to run mysql on heroku as a new user i d recommend just working with postgresql instead as it s much easier to set up and you won t have to worry about installing additional add-ons to get it to work
heroku is really designed to run postgresql as its database engine not mysql

15638541
postgresql	mysql
heroku is really designed to run postgresql as its database engine not mysql
you actually have the postgresql gem installed pg

15640084
alloca	malloc
the alloca function is typically implemented by the compiler vendor and doesn t have to be a system call at all
since all it needs to do is allocate space on the local stack frame it can be implemented very simply and thus be incredibly fast when compared to malloc

15640467
jar	war
as pointed out in the other answers in maven you cannot just load classes from a war artifact the way you can from a jar artifact
therefore the recommendation is to split off a separate maven jar project with the classes you want to reuse and depend on this project in both the original war and the new project

15640467
jar	war
therefore the recommendation is to split off a separate maven jar project with the classes you want to reuse and depend on this project in both the original war and the new project
however if for some reason you cannot do not want to split the war project you can also tell maven that you need a jar artifact in addition to the war

15640467
jar	war
however if for some reason you cannot do not want to split the war project you can also tell maven that you need a jar artifact in addition to the war
put this into the pom.xml of your war project then when building the war project maven will create a war and a jar from it

15641514
implements	extends
basically an anonymous class a class implements the interface onclicklistner which doesn t have a name per se
from documentation the anonymous class expression consists of the following the new operator the name of an interface to implement or a class to extends

15646927
afnetworking	sdwebimage
if it s just the uiimageview category you re after which provides the setimagewithurl placeholderimage method then some i d like to say most but i can t back it up with data stats people use afnetworking since more likely than not they re already using that as their network stack
our production app uses afnetworking + sdwebimage because we need the extensive afnetworking functionality but also on-disk caching

15647070
vb.net	vb6
my experience has been that this type of code use is found in c# vb.net projects that have been converted from vb6
when developing new c# vb.net solutions projects this practice should not be used

15648287
apache-poi	docx4j
docx4j contains org.docx4j.convert.in.doc which uses apache-poi to read the .doc but it is a proof of concept not production ready code
last i checked there were limits to apache-poi s hwpf parsing of a binary .doc

15651358
ciimage	uiimage
it is because this uiimage is not in fact a ciimage
in other words uiimage s ciimage is not nil only if the uiimage is backed by a ciimage already because it was generated by imagewithciimage

15651358
ciimage	uiimage
in other words uiimage s ciimage is not nil only if the uiimage is backed by a ciimage already because it was generated by imagewithciimage
you can t use this to magically turn the uiimage into a ciimage as you seem to be hoping to do

15655844
uitableview	uipickerview
using uitableview internally makes it much easier to implement pickers with large amount of rows as uitableview provides great support for reusing cells otherwise apple would need to reimplement that logic once again for picker - that would not make much sense sorry i don t see any big problems in customizing uitableviewcell for this case so it is hard to comment on that as uitableview is uiscrollview subclass you can make it snap to a specific position check scrollviewwillenddragging withvelocity targetcontentoffset method in uiscrollviewdelegate protocol that can be used for exactly that purpose
uipickerview actually conforms to uitableviewdelegate protocol but just does not expose that in public headers

15656782
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it send content-type text plain the html5 video may play in safari google-chrome and ie 9 but not firefox or ie 7-8
if you fix the mime-type issue it will play in firefox

15657422
innodb	myisam
if you want to use innodb and foreign keys then the explicit index creation is not needed as adding a foreign key creates an implicit index
the myisam storage engine does not support foreign keys

15657676
ubuntu	debian
and debian s ubuntu s uwsgi will be just quiet about it
do not forget that debian s ubuntu s and its derivates uwsgi package does not require installation of its python plugin uwsgi-plugin-python because uwsgi does not necessarily uses only python there are plugins for lua erlang and other languages

15659665
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
try calling it from viewdidappear which is called when the view is confirmed to be in the hierarchy
you re calling it from viewwillappear - at this point the view is not necessarily in the hierarchy yet it will appear doesn t mean it has appeared yet

15659812
ienumerable	ilist
if you want to remove items you should expose the list as an ilist not ienumerable
you can cast the ienumerable to an ilist

15661281
nfa	dfa
an information represented by a single state in dfa can be represented by a combination of nfa states hence number of states in nfa are less than their equivalent dfa
proof are available numberofstates dfa 2 power numberofstates nfa as all set combinations are powerset the dfa for above regular language is as below using this dfa you will always find a unique path from initial state to final state for any string in σ and instead of set you will gets to a single reachable final state and if that state belongs to set of final that input string is said to be accepted string in language otherwise not your expression and are same usually in theoretical science we don t use

15662642
profiling	instrumentation
so you would have to enter to de ios developer portal add your device to the provisioning profiling reinstall the provisioning profiling and that message shouldn t appear again
this is because the profiling using instrumentation needs to be done in release configuration using an ad-hoc provisioning profiling and you re are seing that message probably because the device you re trying to use for instrumentation is not in the provisioning profiling you re using

15663544
inline	inlining
you could stick to your today s policy as long as you don t inline images in css that you call as separate files from other places like html but i personally find this less powerful that properly configured cache parameters and sprites
a few problems with sending everything as base64 inlined images if your image is used from more than one place inlining it prevents cache use base64 encoding takes more place than binary about one third more the browser starts to render as soon as it can if your css contains even the images not needed for the home page you make the rendering slower even if having less requests is generally good having a few requests isn t so bad as the browsers makes them in parallel there is a much better optimization when you consider the set of small images you use on all pages especially if they share the same palette sprites you probably change the css more often than the images

15664419
google-chrome	firefox
ok i found that google-chrome does consistently lose the report page s master page reference or at least the radajaxmanager there while firefox and ie do not i can trace through and watch find work for both of them
what i did find however is that google-chrome and the other two can consistently find the main grid of the report which is what refreshgrid was ultimately looking for

15664738
super	self
__init__ will handle the rest return super someclass cls .__new__ text else raise typeerror def __init__ self text ....
overwriting self does not affect the instance itself

15665746
ocaml	scheme
it allocates gnu mp objects inside the ocaml heap as opposed to the normal allocation scheme through malloc which is not very suited to functional programming
there are several modern big numbers libraries for ocaml all interfaces about gnu mp my own mlgmp which ships with many linux distributions as libgmp-ocaml

15667727
udp	tcp
the big security problem with udp is that you are susceptible to spoofing and dos attacks
it s not possible to spoof an address across the internet using tcp since the handshake will never complete

15667727
udp	tcp
otoh with udp there is no implicit handshake - any session maintenance must be done by your code processing overhead
i am aware that udp offers some performance advantages over tcp only across a lan - part of the reason is the decreased latency of not having to carry out a handshake - but the big difference is that it bypasses congestion control mechanisms

15671311
clang	llvm
xcode uses the clang compiler by default which does not support nested functions
to use gcc in xcode go to your project settings select your target and change compiler for c c++ objective-c to llvm gcc 4.2

15674775
setinterval	settimeout
the settimeout is fired once and does not repeat it self and you wont need to clear interval as you have to for setinterval
you should try using settimeout instead of setinterval

15676568
mtu	icmp
the answer is no - so_reuseaddr doesn t affect fragmentation ... the clue is mtu discovery and don t fragment flag in ip header
in case of sending of 1472 bytes with mtu discovery on 1500 bytes sent with don t frag flag on i get icmp internet control message protocol type 3 destination unreachable code 4 fragmentation needed checksum 0x90db correct mtu of next hop 1480 after that the sender does fragmentation for all packets to fit 1480 mtu while route arp cache info is kept for that receiver 5 min for route and 30 sec for arp - defaults configured on my system

15678536
innodb	myisam
edit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisam
use myisam for very unimportant data or if you really need those minimal performance advantages

15678615
innodb	myisam
maximum of 64 indexes per table innodb limitations no full text indexing below-5.6 mysql version cannot be compressed for fast read-only 5.5.14 introduced you cannot repair an innodb table for brief understanding read below links mysql engines innodb vs
myisam a comparison of pros and cons mysql engines myisam vs

15678800
ssl	https
i m not sure why this happened though i had uploaded the certificate to azure and was able to connect to my service on https in firefox so the ssl was working
the problem in my case was that my solution cloud project had the thumbprint of the ssl certificate i d uploaded in its servicedefinition.csdef and serviceconfiguration.cloud.cscfg

15682428
sudo	passwd
generally you only need to type your passwd once per session for sudo
maybe on the real machine you had already done sudo once and had not logged out

15683483
queue	fifo
your resque workers can pull these tasks from the queue run the requests and put the responses as json into the redis memcached cache store
if you have enough workers it can all be parallel if not they ll all get done eventually fifo

15684166
ffmpeg	libav
if you really have to use constant bitrate try this instead ffmpeg -i in.flv -c v libx264 -b v 1104k -c a libfdk_aac -b a 122k out.mp4 see the x264 encoding guide and aac encoding guide on the ffmpeg wiki for more options
first of all you re using an outdated misnamed and broken version of ffmpeg that s actually not from ffmpeg but from libav an ffmpeg fork

15688430
google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
for instance in the current version of webkit safari google-chrome yandex rockmelt many mobile browsers etc. the link text is rendered but it cannot be clicked
that said it works as you might expect in the currently most-used versions of presto opera soon to be replaced by webkit trident internet explorer and gecko firefox waterfox etc.

dictionary	map
after that you can use espeak rules to create a phonetic dictionary espeak -v tr -x türkçe tyrkts e you only need to parse the output an put it in the dictionary in alpha-only format.you just neet create a map to letter-only phoneset not necessary a map to arpabet
open the text pad and create a map t t y yy r rr k k e ee s sh so in the end you get entries like this türkçe t yy rr k t sh ee that s it

15694059
inline	inlining
yes the compiler could decide to optimize it anyway and it could also decide not to optimize it even if you specified the inline keyword possibly producing a warning if the appropriate compiler options are set - notice that member functions defined in a class definition are implicitly marked as inline
in general if inlining is possible the compiler will decide whether to inline or not based on the body of the function being called

15694059
inline	inlining
in general if inlining is possible the compiler will decide whether to inline or not based on the body of the function being called
however inlining may not be possible at all if the function is a virtual function or if the definition of the function is not visible to the compiler

15694692
opera	firefox
this will work consistently across browsers current and future ones including opera
both existing ways to style placeholder available in firefox and webkit are vendor-prefixed and nonstandard and should not be used in production

15698120
opera	google-chrome
im not sure how you do that in opera
try google-chrome right click - inspect element - click on the magnifying glass on the bottom left corner - select the button and you can see the html it s defined

15698397
gruntjs	package.json
it s likely that gruntjs is not installed locally in your project folder which is different than grunt-cli
you have it in your package.json so try doing npm install or alternately npm install gruntjs

15698397
gruntjs	package.json
you have it in your package.json so try doing npm install or alternately npm install gruntjs
for more information see the getting started page note that installing grunt-cli does not install the gruntjs task runner

15700060
pascal	delphi
the first version of delphi was evolved from turbo pascal
the object oriented features in turbo pascal were rightly considered not fit for purpose

15700060
pascal	delphi
the object oriented features in turbo pascal were rightly considered not fit for purpose
so borland developed delphi 1 and incorporated much of the apple object pascal language

15700811
sudo	passwd
you could configure the sudo or the super commands to not ask any passwd i actually knowingly do that on some machines but i do know it is -or may be abused as- a security hole
this means trusting the entity human or program running that sudo command

15701250
junit	testng
how can i have something similar with junit as in series of user interactions test assert something
navigate again to the next page 1 clarify your question - user interactions are done by selenium and not testng 2 - - assert vs

15701589
pascal	delphi
borland calls the language delphi language and thus the exact equivalent of object pascal is delphi language not delphi
since delphi is a registered trademark in many countries most compatibles kept referring to the language as object pascal even after borland renamed it

15704485
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
even with this option the compiler does not warn about failures to inline-functions declared in system headers. the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

15705287
postgresql	mysql
use postgresql or sql server
mysql oracle do not support transactional ddl

15708028
kerberos	ntlm
use one shot calls with kerberos - i did not explore this because turning on kerberos in my scenario would have been a bigger headache b
use a custom binding with ntlm based auth - i tried this but sct s were still being used so it didn t work for me c

15712068
centos	linux	rpm	yum
lastly you might want to post this on serverfault that seems like it might be more appropriate and you might get better linux package related responses i answered anyway in case it helps but again i m not a centos guy and haven t used yum rpm in a long time so grain of salt and all
i dont use centos but i looked in the rpm package files section yum is an rpm frontend wrapper of sorts if i recall

15712263
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you want a tab to simply display a view controller which doesn t need hierarchical navigation or a navigation bar then you wouldn t need to use a uinavigationcontroller and can directly set your view controller as the controller for that tab
as your app is using a uitabbarcontroller each tab will display a separate branch of views

15712561
email	dkim
microsoft relies on various authentication filters to determine if an email is spam or not
common industry practices include reviewing email for the presence of a spf validation sender id and dkim records within email received

15713109
mdpi	hdpi
as we all know an hdpi device will use an image from the drawale-hdpi folder while an mdpi device will display the same named image from the drawable-mdpi directory
however when an mdpi device cannot find an image in the drawable-mdpi directory it will eventually choose from the drawable-hdpi folder but it will down-scale the image for display on the mdpi screen

15715735
uicollectionview	uitableview
why not use a uicollectionview
it s designed to present a group of objects including images in a manner similar to uitableview

15717024
vb.net	vb6
i ll provide you a link to the uk amazon for vb6 if you still want to go vb6 way if you are not in the uk you can search for it at a local bookstore amazon qid 1364635699 sr 8-3 and as i said why go vb6 way when you will eventually end up using vb.net or c#
first get the free express edition of vb.net from microsoft here then this is a link to some great beginner tutorials for vb.net

15717370
g++	gcc
use g++ instead of gcc to build your c++ program
while gcc knows how to compile c++ by default it does not link against the c++ libraries that are required by your program

15717846
atoi	strncpy
2 in declaration of specialstring chars is wrong you should write small c 3 atoi is correct function you got to convert a string into int if you wants to convert without atoi you can use sscanf function like view this working code
in your code you have two mistakes 1 strncopy is not the function you wants its strncpy

15724834
equals	gethashcode
by default indexof compares by reference only since your custom class has not overridden equals
when you override equals you should always also override gethashcode

15728219
daemons	systemd
maybe you could also show us the .plist file you use for your launchd daemons that goes in systemd library launchdaemons
one quick experiment might be to not start your daemons automatically

15728406
union	distinct
i created a view and used union to combine result from two distinct queries
you have to use top level select clause as the union all is not directly supported from top level statements

15729438
gmail	hotmail
try sending it to another email address gmail or something
you wouldn t say but hotmail is really critical when it comes to recieving emails

15729438
gmail	hotmail
gmail is not that critical and does other google things to make it work
here is a header that works for me for sending to hotmail make sure either your mx records ip is the same as your server ip if your server handles your email or put a spf file in your dns

15733929
factors	matrix
i strongly doubt there will be any chance to influence this factors from withing a vm so i m not sure if this is to be taken into consideration
mathematically the product of matrix a l x m and b m x n is defined as a matrix c l x n consisting of the elements so if you re not too much up for speed you might be happy with the straight forward o n 3 implementation if instead you re up for speed you might want to check for other alternatives like strassen algorithm see strassen algorithm

15734931
profiling	debugging
something like this would be the simplest profiling that tracks function calls returns note that you should not trust absolute numbers it generates only relative ones
there are several profilers available that you can check but most of them target execution time and are based on debugging hook

15735786
quicksort	heapsort
in which case the information below isn t much use to you directly although you should be aware that insertion sort is quite inefficient compared to a bulk insert followed by a better sorting algorithm quicksort which you can implement using the standard library quicksort function
if you only ever need the lowest or highest item instead of full sorted order then heapsort is still useful reading

15741198
client-side	server-side
the extension library dojo data grid events are client-side not server-side
that s because it is a dojo control and the dojo controls are client-side

15744453
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
when viewdidload is called the view is not yet on screen
after viewdidload you will see viewwillappear then viewdidappear being called

15748464
skip-lists	tree
the comment you quoted was written by the author of the original skip-lists paper not exactly an unbiased assertion
it s been 23 years and red-black tree still seem to be more prevalent than skip lists

15751118
octal	decimal
also because in non strict mode you don t have a clue if test variable was defined as octal literal or decimal so test.tostring 8 will give you of course different results if test was defined as 0132 or 132
in strict mode javascript doesn t allow you to do such things define an octal literal and you will get an exception instead

15753499
prepare	execute
the display of toast is an asynchronous i.e not a blocking call operation means once the toast request is execute the operating system jumps to the next operation and meanwhile the toast is prepare and displayed
to acquire your default behavior you should execute the thread-sleep call after few seconds of delay

15753594
floating-point	fractions
that said you may prefer to use isdate .cells r c .text instead of .value since the value property may return a double or floating-point value that can be evaluated as not a date
you have to remember that excel and many other microsoft products store dates as floating-point numbers the integer part is the count of days elapsed since january 1st 1900 1 is equivalent to 1 1 1900 the decimal part is the fractions of day elapsed 0.5 is equivalent to 12 00 pm the question on how to find a minimum or maximum date value is then obfuscated by the fact that you may have many other numbers in your row

15754441
pascal	delphi
it doesn t include free pascal or dws
free pascal is focused on being a open source and cross platform clone of delphi i m sure i ve offended a few people with that. each dialect of object pascal adds things and implements things a little differently

15755155
passenger	thin	passenger	webrick	thin	unicorn	unicorn	webrick
you can set the server sinatra uses with the server configuration setting set server webrick # or thin mongrel in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick
if you choose passenger or unicorn you would not configure the server within your sinatra application file itself but instead typically configure it separately using a rackup config.ru file

15764914
hex	binary
a bitwise not of this gives you 11101111 - 0xef in hex if you assigned 0x10 to a type that was larger than one byte inverting its bits would set its least significant byte to 0xef and others to 0xff
0x10 gives you a bitwise not of 0x10 0xef 0x10 as binary is 00010000

15766090
glut	glfw
first i wonder why you are using opengl 4.0 to work with fixed deprecated pipeline... but let s get to the problem.what you need is msaa .i am not sure enabling it via control panel will always do the trick.usually it is done inside the code. unfortunately for you you selected to use glut which has no option to set hardware msaa level.if you want to be able to do so switch to glfw .another option is do do it manually but that implies you use custom fbos.in such a scenario you can create fbo with msaa texture attachment setting msaa level for the texture also you can apply custom multisampling algorithms in fragment shader if you wish . here is a thread on this topic
glfw allows you specifying msaa level on window setup.see the related api

15768142
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s only working great in google-chrome safari because you ve included -webkit- browser effects and not the -moz- ms and general equivalents which you would need to get the same effects in firefox and ie
for example when you include -webkit-box-flex you d need to include -moz-box-flex too for firefox compatibility

15769486
explode	substr
i would implement the entire thing like so removing the first backslash as you require or with explode taking only the first part of the uri
using explode is not at all a bad idea if you are interested in all the parts of the uri you should take a look at the documentation for explode its usage would be like so however as far as i understand you are looking to replace the link by whatever is after the first character which is always you could use substr like so in your case it is not needed because you are able to predict there is a backslash at the beginning of the string

15771288
udp	tcp
if you do want or must use udp to transfer files you need to build those parts that are integral to tcp but not to udp into the application
there is a saying though that this will most likely result in an inefrior reimplementation of tcp

15771439
udp	tcp
the udp protocol uses the same strategy for checking packets with errors that the tcp protocol uses - a 16 bits checksum in the packet header
the udp packet structure is well known as well as the tcp so the packet can be easily tampered if not encrypted adding another checksum for instance crc-32 would also make it more robust

15774008
inline	inlining
when i posted the assembly for the functions in my op edit i noted that the inline version might be different
i hadn t examined or posted the timing code because it was hairier and because i thought that the process of inlining would not change whether or not branching takes place in compare

15778058
realloc	malloc
it is then not a valid pointer to use for other purposes including realloc
you re also wasting all of the space you retrieved with malloc on the line above by throwing away your only pointer to that memory

15778121
multiplication	modulo
you can compute x y mod modulo as follows this algorithm requires only o log y multiplication and moduli to compute
moreover each intermediary value is at most modulo 2 so if your modulo is not too large you can just use plain int s to do the computation

15779944
serializable	deserialization
if i find myself needing to customize configure the serializable api to do what i want i tend to simplify what s being serializable so the serializable api doesn t need the extra configurations
so if i have a more complicated data model parts of which aren t to be serializable deserialized then i extract from it a simpler set of pojos as a conceptually separate data model to participate in the serializable deserialization

15782554
addition	multiplication
a common approach is to implement as a member operator and then implement addition as a non-member this makes the operation symmetric wrt the lhs and the rhs allowing for implicit conversions on both sides
the fundamental problem is that an addition operator should not return a reference but a value this applies to multiplication subtraction etc

15785963
mp4	webm
# mime types for video addtype video mp4 mp4 m4v f4v f4p addtype video ogg ogv addtype video webm webm addtype video x-flv flv
firefox doesn t support .mp4 files which explains the specified type attribute of video mp4 is not supported

15787036
google-chrome	firefox
its not possible to add extension on google-chrome for android according to this
it is possible to have a few addons on firefox for android

15787787
oncreate	setcontentview
you extend activity but your oncreate is missing the bundle parameter you don t call super.oncreate will not work
arraylist needs a type something like you never call setcontentview meaning your activity will never show something this is just for the first lines of code.

15788536
ienumerable	ilist
most collections are supporting construction by ienumerable parameters
i don t actually know why doesn t support ienumerable but ilist

15794402
g++	gcc
if you want you can explicitly add -lstdc++ to the command line or definitely the first choice in general just use g++
you are not linking against libstdc++ or not using g++ in short the gcc driver being the c driver not the c++ driver doesn t link the c++ runtime at the end

15795764
setinterval	settimeout
code in the alternate syntax is a string of code you want to be executed repeatedly using this syntax is not recommended for the same reasons as using eval delay is the number of milliseconds thousandths of a second that the setinterval function should wait before each call to func
as with settimeout there is a minimum delay enforced. note that passing additional parameters to the function in the first syntax does not work in internet explorer

15796741
mayavi	matplotlib
i would recommend looking into mayavi which is an opengl based plotting package that can do true 3d
this is not easy to do with matplotlib due to the way that the 3d graphs are rendered

15797089
super	extends
to solve it either declare your super class as serializable or add a zero arg constructor to the super class
this could happen if your employee class extends a class that is not serializable and the superclass does not have a zero argument constructor as decribed in the java.io.serializable documentation

15798784
filewriter	printwriter
i think you intended to use filewriter file file boolean append constructor instead ie instead of
on the constructor printwriter writer out boolean autoflush the second boolean argument is actually for autoflush not append mode

15803186
factors	matrix
ie9 supports css3 transformation with -ms-trasform but for older version there isn t any method but using a filter where 1.3 is your scale factors
m11 m12 m21 and m22 are values of the transformation matrix that will be applied to the element

15803449
filewriter	bufferedwriter
filewriter is simply to write plain text without formatting it doesn t use any buffer mechanism whatever comes its way it just writes
bufferedwriter is a wrapper for writer classes to allow it to be able to use buffer functionality to optimize io

15803472
filewriter	bufferedwriter
personally i don t like filewriter as it doesn t let you specify the encoding
i prefer to use fileoutputstream wrapped in an outputstreamwriter but that s a different matter. bufferedwriter is used for buffering as you say - although it doesn t buffer all the output just a fixed amount of it the size of the buffer

15803653
namenode	hdfs
in order to forcefully let the namenode leave safemode following command should be executed bin hadoop dfsadmin -safemode leave you are getting unknown command error for your command as -safemode isn t a sub-command for hadoop fs but it is of hadoop dfsadmin
also after the above command i would suggest you to once run hadoop fsck so that any inconsistencies crept in the hdfs might be sorted out

15804249
fileoutputstream	printwriter
for writing streams of raw bytes consider using a fileoutputstream
printwriter from here prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. this class implements all of the print methods found in printstream. it does not contain methods for writing raw bytes for which a program should use unencoded byte streams

15809773
innodb	myisam
the most likely reason is that you re using the myisam engine instead of the innodb engine
the myisam engine parses foreign key constraints but it doesn t enforce them

15809828
ssl	https
oliver bock s answer may work for you and igor dvorkin s answer is not valid anymore since iis 8 with windows server 2012 supports sni which enables you to add a hostheader to https bindings and having multiple ssl certificates to different domains listening to the same https port
you need to automate the process of installing the certificates on the machine and add https bindings to iis

15811480
spaces	linefeed
that assumes of course that cx is not changed by all of the folderol checking for a spaces or writing out the line .
oh btw - conventionally a new line is cr linefeed or 0dh 0ah - in that order

15814214
listview	gridview
or you can set this declaratively in the html using the data-win-options attribute of the listview control div. hope that helps
in xaml you use different controls - gridview for a horizontal list of items that fill by column and wrap when they run out of vertical space and listview for a vertical list of items that fills by column and does not wrap

15814214
listview	gridview
in xaml you use different controls - gridview for a horizontal list of items that fill by column and wrap when they run out of vertical space and listview for a vertical list of items that fills by column and does not wrap
in html you use a listview for both cases

15816228
nfa	dfa
construct a deterministic finite-state automaton dfa from the nfa
the nfa is a tree not even a dag which should avoid the exponential worst-case for the standard algorithm

15816228
nfa	dfa
the nfa is a tree not even a dag which should avoid the exponential worst-case for the standard algorithm
effectively you re just constructing a prefix tree here and you could have skipped step 1 and constructed the prefix tree directly converting it directly into a dfa

15817644
equals	gethashcode
see this link section notes to implementers for details on the implementation of gethashcode especially this paragraph if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

15821566
slug	permalinks
it doesn t know for instance that the page with the slug coming-soon is also
and it assumes that your permalinks settings are set to pagename which they should be anyway

15822093
cassini	iis
use a webserver that doesn t run on the desktop iis instead of cassini
i m unsure about whether or not iis express is a good idea or not - personally i prefer the genuine article

15822492
ilist	iqueryable
however this only works if data has an indexer an array or something that implements ilist
an ienumerable or iqueryable would not work

15823655
implements	extends
if you need implements methods use abstract instead of interfaces
an interface is only a class skeleton for library users to extends and as you said methods cannot be implements

15823655
implements	extends
an interface is only a class skeleton for library users to extends and as you said methods cannot be implements
an abstract class can have implements methods

15825152
jar	war
to include a jar file that contains enterprise bean s in a war module add the jar to the web-inf lib directory of the war module
war modules that contain enterprise beans do not require an ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor

15827660
jar	manifest.mf
so it shouldn t even accept wordcount it isn t for me. the following command has the same result as shown above bin hadoop jar hadoop-examples-1.0.4.jar wordcount license.txt output for your information the main-class is already defined in the meta-inf manifest.mf file contained in the jar main-class org apache hadoop examples exampledriver
try running without wordcount like hadoop jar usr local hadoop hadoop-examples-1.1.2.jar input output you will receive something like follows unknown program input chosen. valid program names are aggregatewordcount an aggregate based map reduce program that counts the words in the input files. aggregatewordhist an aggregate based map reduce program that computes the histogram of the words in the input files. dbcount an example job that count the pageview counts from a database. grep a map reduce program that counts the matches of a regex in the input. join a job that effects a join over sorted equally partitioned datasets multifilewc a job that counts words from several files. pentomino a map reduce tile laying program to find solutions to pentomino problems. pi a map reduce program that estimates pi using monte-carlo method. randomtextwriter a map reduce program that writes 10gb of random textual data per node. randomwriter a map reduce program that writes 10gb of random data per node. secondarysort an example defining a secondary sort to the reduce. sleep a job that sleeps at each map and reduce task. sort a map reduce program that sorts the data written by the random writer. sudoku a sudoku solver. teragen generate data for the terasort terasort run the terasort teravalidate checking results of terasort wordcount a map reduce program that counts the words in the input files. so basically the first argument is not the main-class name rather it is the example program s name which you want to run

15828409
spaces	delimiter
more confusingly for me in your case having a spaces between the and the
means it is not treated as a delimiter anyway

15828690
g++	gcc
if you mean variable length then it differs compiler by compiler microsoft c++ 2048 characters intel c++ 2048 characters g++ no limit but keep in mind that annex b of the c++ standard says that an implementation should support identifiers at least 1024 characters long but this is not mandatory
edit dev c++ uses the mingw or tdm-gcc 64bit port of the gcc as its compiler

15828934
jar	war
i agree that a self-contained deployment of this kind is preferable to having a separate jar file somewhere else
yes war files will each be loaded under their own classloader so they do not see each other s classes

15830640
required	placeholder
i think you shouldn t count on html5 required attribute since in case of ie only ie 10+ supports it see form validation section here web forms - dive into html5
of course the same goes for placeholder attribute but in most cases it s something you can live with and having a working validation is more critical

15833078
client-side	server-side
client-side includes your question actually specifies to do this in js or jquery
not sure if it does because you were not aware of the server-side options or if you really wanted a client-side one

15833078
client-side	server-side
not sure if it does because you were not aware of the server-side options or if you really wanted a client-side one
in any case there are also some client-side solutions

15833571
persistent	transient
of course it does not make sense to persistent an entitymanagerfactory
you could mark the field as transient to prevent it from being persisted but then you are just going to face different problems

15837310
antialiasing	transparent
when you rotate an image the border pixels are not antialiasing see this question
the solution as odd as it sounds is to give the image a 1px transparent border

15839195
prepare	execute
better to initialize the prepare statement in the constructor or somewhere else outside the function the query is called as well as delete in the destructor or elsewhere if you do use a prepare statement
instead of a prepare statement though note that prepare statements are most useful for very high-use and high-cpu intensive queries so using it for password validation might not be important here you could just execute a regular query instead of a prepare statement . likewise the resultset needs to be deleted delete res at the end of the try block rather than in the destructor

15839234
aggregate-functions	sum
i don t use order by in the window clause because per documentation when an aggregate-functions is used as a window function it aggregates over the rows within the current row s window frame
an aggregate used with order by and the default window frame definition produces a running sum type of behavior which may or may not be what s wanted. to obtain aggregation over the whole partition omit order by or use rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following

15842035
firefox	safari
as mentioned this behavior is not seen on firefox nor windows 7 sp1 internet explorer 10 iphone ios 6.1.2 safari ipad ios 6.1.3 safari just an fyi for those unaware webkit webkit is a layout engine software designed to allow web browsers to render web pages
wikipedia webkit is currently used by chrome chromium and safari as of this writing 2013-04-05

15842425
persistent	transient
if the data isn t really transient persistent it somewhere
if it s a small amount of data such as settings persistent it in sharedpreferences

15842691
jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
knowing this you have plenty of alternatives free java ee application servers like jboss glassfish v3 and tomee do not confuse with tomcat
paid java ee application servers like websphere application server aka was from ibm or oracle weblogic

15844111
implements	extends
in transitioning to arc release notes see arc enforces new rules you cannot explicitly invoke dealloc or implements or invoke retain release retaincount or autorelease
the prohibition extends to using selector retain selector release and so on

15844573
scheme	racket
it should work on any scheme interpreter that defines a fold-right -like procedure define flatmap f lst apply append map f lst define cartesian-product lsts foldr lambda lst acc flatmap lambda x map lambda y cons x y acc lst lsts either way it works as expected
you re describing the cartesian product of a list of lists here s a possible implementation works in racket now if you re not using racket here s a vanilla implementation using mostly standard procedures

15847675
recvfrom	datagram
you should re-write you if you forgot to add parenthesis if data recvfrom sd file_buffer sizeof file_buffer 0 struct sockaddr server server_length 0 reason precedence of is higher then so in your if first performed then and this cause assigns data either 0 when data read successfully and 1 when recvfrom returns -1 on error
actually you forgot parenthesis or if you don t know you shold add. like if data recvfrom sd file_buffer sizeof file_buffer 0 struct sockaddr server server_length 0 see i added like edit second error buffer is not 0 terminated the function recvfrom if successful worked returns the length in bytes of the message or datagram

15848117
boost	allocator
in boost pool allocator the emphasis is on avoiding invoking the heap freestore to allocate many small objects a task that the heap cannot perform very efficiently and will cause it to become fragmented
it maybe should have been called small-object allocator instead to avoid any confusion

15849798
equals	gethashcode
the relevant section in the documentation object.gethashcode objects used as a key in a hashtable object must also override the gethashcode method because those objects must generate their own hash code if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value.however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
you re on the right track the problem is indeed that you don t override gethashcode while you override equals

equals	gethashcode
the problem is not that hashcodes can have collisions but that if two elements that should be considered equals are actually never compared using equals if their hashcode returned by gethashcode is different
also there is some logic in my equals function which is not directly comparing all strings 1-to-1 so this means i would basically implement this functionality twice in order to assure equals objects get the same hashcode right

subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
bodmas or bomdsa are exactly the same since multiplication division and addition subtraction are at the same level of precedence in facts they should be written more correctly as b o dm as with whatever order you prefer inside the various groups
as said by the relevant wikipedia page these mnemonics may be misleading when written this way especially if the user is not aware that multiplication and division are of equal precedence as are addition and subtraction

15850276
subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
as said by the relevant wikipedia page these mnemonics may be misleading when written this way especially if the user is not aware that multiplication and division are of equal precedence as are addition and subtraction
in other words what you are missing is that normally both when doing math manually and in any sane programming language the operators are actually grouped by classes of precedence where multiplication and division have the same precedence as well as sum and subtraction

15850276
associativity	operator-precedence
although for math on reals this is not really relevant unless talking about division addition and subtraction are associativity if you consider subtraction as addition of the opposite in programming it is double important since math on fp numbers and on int is often not associativity
also programming languages provide many more operators not associativity commutative with different associativity and not so well established precedence rules so it s normal that they specify their rules for operator-precedence in a more refined way

15850567
firefox	safari
some users might not want to disable firefox s bfcache see section page caching despite unload and beforeunload handlers and it is why the firefox fix above is unbinding the onunload event inside of the onunload event
apparently there s no way of disabling safari s bfcache and we must refresh the page when it s shown

15852260
coldfusion	railo
as of coldfusion version 8 listtoarray takes an optional third argument includeemptyfields which is a boolean controlling that behavior defaulting to false
for example re java split like other java functionality that pokes up through the coldfusion layer this is undocumented and unsupported in adobe coldfusion 8 9 and 10 but not in railo this is a syntax error but this works as far as i can see adobe coldfusion treats the result of .split like a coldfusion array cfdumps show it as an array it s 1-based you can use arraylen on it you can modify its elements in coldfusion there may be other behaviors i didn t check that aren t like a cf array but as above it s unsupported in railo debug dumps show it as native array java.lang.string the other statements about its very array-like behavior are still true that s in contrast to real java arrays created with createobject java java.util.arraylist

15852260
coldfusion	railo
for instance in adobe coldfusion elements of a java arraylist can t be modified directly with cfml in general railo handles java arrays more like coldfusion ones than acf edit thanks leigh i stand corrected i should stick to what i know which is cf way more than java
i was reacting to the comment saying that the result of .split is not a coldfusion array but a native java array

15852337
super	self
here is the logic that you were missing by not calling the crawlspider.__init__ via super downloadspider self .__init__ self._compile_rules
don t forget to call the base class constructors for example with super update when you override a method in python the base class method is no longer called and instead your new method is called this means that if you want your new logic to run in addition to the old logic not instead of then you need to call the old logic manually

15852594
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
turns out this is a known bug in webkit and therefore effects both google-chrome and safari not firefox and i have no idea about internet explorer or opera the relevant tracker is here coincidentally this was resolved a few days ago so hopefully it will be in a public release soon
since both google-chrome and safari manage to keep most users up-to-date i don t think it s worth building a workaround in the meantime but if anybody does have a nice workaround please post it here

15852969
geany	scite
here is how scite may look when the extension properly installed and toggle activated after startup note that it s pretty much the same functionality as in geany - it inserts linebreaks upon typing text - but not on pressing backspace nor upon copy pasting
well i was rather disappointed that there seems to be no break-lines-as-you-type facility in scite

15855834
client-side	server-side
now it is up to you whether you want to provide an ui with dynamic client-side validation hints or not
validation should always be performed server-side - you can never trust client-side validation

15855834
client-side	server-side
validation should always be performed server-side - you can never trust client-side validation
client-side validation is always in the sense of providing a better user experience ux so the user doesn t have to submit and reload a page simply because a value in a form isn t valid - it makes things more dynamic

client-side	server-side
client-side validation is always in the sense of providing a better user experience ux so the user doesn t have to submit and reload a page simply because a value in a form isn t valid - it makes things more dynamic
as you don t even need a browser to make requests independently of your website relying on js to work properly you will need server-side validation and sanitize all user input in case you care about not having your databases pwned

15859491
gradle	ivy
you have full control on the dependencies and where they come from gradle doesn t have any repositories hard-coded so you might use bintray instead of maven central for example less mistakes to correct
ivy s dependency management is alike

15859973
thin	unicorn
simply include gem unicorn-rails and for rails 4.2.4 gem rack-handlers in your gemfile run bundle install to install the gem then you can run although once unicorn-rails is installed unicorn should be the default app server so you could also just run rails server and it should use unicorn assuming you don t also have thin or mongrel in your gemfile in which case they may conflict and you might want to remove the ones you re not using
it looks like the unicorn-rails gem that dogbert mentioned can actually be used to make unicorn the rails server handler

15862670
inline	inlining
inline is basically useful only when you want the odr one definition rule not to apply
in short you can mark functions as inline and provide their definition directly in one header file which is then imported by multiple translation units without the linker complaining about this foo.hpp foo.cpp main.cpp the presence of the inline keyword which again does not guarantee that the compiler will perform inlining ensures that the linker will merge those definitions

of course in order for this merge operation to be meaningful all the definitions of a function marked as inline which end up being part of several different translation units must be identical

15866511
single-quotes	double-quotes
variables are not expanded in strings using single-quotes
try with double-quotes instead

15868577
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
feature firefox gecko - not supported google-chrome - 21.0-webkit internet explorer - 10.0-moz opera - full support 12.10 maxthon - full support 4.0 i am currently looking for solution.
fyi mozilla firefox is the only browser that still doesn t support flex-wrap

15868739
gridview	objectdatasource
as you already know the footer does not display when the gridview is empty no rows
the work around is to ensure that a dummy row is returned from the objectdatasource when there is no real data present

15869814
operands	scalar
list assignments look like this or even all these expect a list of values to assign so give the right operands list context
when you say this is a scalar assignment and so _ gets scalar context which causes it to return its number of elements not the first value

15871525
ssl	https
update 3 2 2016 just use https for everything eg paul irish recommends against using protocol-relative urls and recommends writing all links using https - the rationale being now that ssl is encouraged for everyone and doesn t have performance concerns this technique protocol-relative urls is now an anti-pattern
if the asset you need is available on ssl then always use the https asset

15872296
pthreads	fork
the only exception is the system framework and even there the pthreads standard places severe constraints on what you can do between a fork and an exec
as you said in a comment this is for jailbroken devices otherwise you could not use fork or exec at all. you are running into a limitation of the apple frameworks which is documented in obsolete programming techniques in technical note tn2083 daemons and agents daemonizing frameworks many mac os x frameworks do not work reliably if you call fork but do not call exec

15874681
rdf	owl
the basic jena model is designed to process rdf including owl but other uses of rdf as well while the ontmodel from the ontology api is specifically designed for working with owl and other ontologies
an ordinary jena model will not load imported owl models but an ontmodel will

15875867
onresume	onpause
i implemented this in some projects and worked fine in manifest now create trickyapplication.java now in every activity onresume and in every activity onpause note that password dialog will be also showed for the first time you can manage this with some shared preference and don t set it until your user not set a password or so then check that pref before showing dialog
the solution is simple consider the four methods oncreate onresume onpause onsaveinstancestate bundle outstate

15876059
super	extends
use prototype based inheritance to achieve your inheritance and explicitly call the super method output i am initializing the base class i am initializing the child class
jquery s extends doesn t build inheritance but merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object

15877680
client-side	server-side
this tag tells your application which server-side vo a given client-side vo is mapped to
use it like this furthermore from what you re showing it looks like the names of your properties don t match the client-side one has prepended underscores while the server-side one doesn t

15877680
client-side	server-side
use it like this furthermore from what you re showing it looks like the names of your properties don t match the client-side one has prepended underscores while the server-side one doesn t
the property names of the client-side vo and the server-side one should be exactly the same

15880815
png	ico
convert a png favicon to ico here more info on wikipedia here
internet explorer does not support png favicons

15886422
ciimage	uiimage
it is really nothing but a thin wrapper around ciimage which is not what you want
you must convert render the cifilter output thru cgimage to uiimage thus giving you a uiimage that actually has some bits cgimage a bitmap

15888836
required	placeholder
the importance of required false is your page will run without error if your section definition is left out of your view
sections are placeholder in your _layout that can be populated by your view example would have a corresponding section in your view if it s not obvious whatever markup goes in your view s section definition is rendered in your _layout

15890279
google-chrome	safari
i can access the iframe s dom but not the iframe s jquery. in google-chrome i have to select the iframe from the popup menu at the bottom of the console
in safari i have to use so as i expected something relatively stupid not setting the iframe context in the console and actually failing the test in selenium for other reasons

15892747
avcapturesession	avassetwriter
because you re asking for the use an avassetwriter as an output for an avcapturesession isn t possible
basically an avcapturesession object has inputs eg a camera represented by some avcaptureinput subclass and outputs in the form of avcaptureoutput s

15892747
avcapturesession	avassetwriter
basically an avcapturesession object has inputs eg a camera represented by some avcaptureinput subclass and outputs in the form of avcaptureoutput s
and an avassetwriter is not an avcaptureoutput subclass so there is no way to use it directly from an avcapturesession

15892747
avcapturesession	avassetwriter	avcapturesession	avassetreader	avassetwriter	avassetreader
and an avassetwriter is not an avcaptureoutput subclass so there is no way to use it directly from an avcapturesession
if you want to use an avassetwriter you ll have to write the data out using an avcapturefileoutput instance and then read it back with an avassetreader modify your data somehow and then output it via an avassetwriter

15893007
bash	zsh
by default when bash fails to glob it puts the whole pattern into the arguments unchanged
when zsh fails to glob it does not run command at all which i find more convenient in most cases

15896083
jar	war
client proxy jar ideally i would create the client proxy jar in another maven project that depends on the web service war project and uses the maven jax-ws plugin goals wsgen followed by wsimport to do the work
but i could not get a maven project to use a war as a depedency so that its classes in web-inf classes are added to the class path

15897128
super	extends
at least call super or just don t include it
you can add the listener defined in another class doing something like this btw you should take care of some more bits of your code classs names should be typed in camelcase with the first letter capital use proper names for your packages i don t think that the main method in the listener class is making anything usefull there is not need at all to extends from jpanel in your listener class try to avoid make empty constructor like you are doing in listen

15897505
pthreads	fork
you can t create new process in an ios application on a non jailbroken device you would get an error such as operation not permitted but you can create new thread using pthreads library
edit but if you re trying to detect whether a device is jailbroken i don t think that would violate the store guidelines just to try to do a fork but it s more a legal question than a technical question

15900092
udp	tcp
udp does not have a notion of connections it s for a one-shot send without guarantees about delivery
several higher-level network protocols are built on top of tcp ip and udp

15902607
entity-relationship	diagram
in entity-relationship diagram when the relationship is denoted the arrows are not used
some instructors use this arrow when they want to decide the cardinalities but that is just to get the cardinality 1 1 1 m and n m i have attached the entity-relationship diagram for this in chen notation and also using crow notation you can use either of them

15903963
multiplying	multiplication
and then multiplying x by the n th element of the table
this may not be the fastest if your code emulates floating point multiplication because the cpu doesn t support it directly

15906358
trie	tree
similarly patricia denotes a specific type of radix trie but not all radix tries are patricia tries
trie describes a tree data structure suitable for use as an associative array where branches or edges correspond to parts of a key

15907429
g++	gcc
they may be located in separate packages. solution download and install gmp version 4.3.2 package because mpc needs higher version download the source code from gmplib.org compile the source code and install while compiling gmp see error 2 for help installed gmp version 5.1.1 download and install mpfr package installed mpfr version 3.1.2 download and install mpc package installed mpc version 1.0 download the packages from error 2 solution sudo apt-get install m4 error 3 cannot find g++ compiler i got this error because i installed the os recently and had not installed the compilers
solution sudo apt-get install build-essential this installs all the standard build essential software error 4 solution though gcc documentation specify that we can provide the path of gmp and mpfr installtion through with-gmp and with-mpfr flag but unfortunately i tried to give the path but it didnt work

15909862
profiling	debugging
the pdbs for managed dll will not work you need to generate native pdb for ngen d image with ngen tool take a look on the article creating ngen pdbs for profiling reports
this article about how to get ngen pdbs for profiler report but for debugging it is the same

15909923
lxml	html5lib
but the short version is if you have lxml it uses that
if not it tries html5lib

15915172
realloc	malloc
you cannot use free realloc or any other memory allocator windows globalfree localfree heapfree functions
realloc can only reallocate memory regions which were allocated with the malloc family of functions malloc calloc and realloc

15917784
firefox	safari
unfortunately it is impossible to get firefox to close the window
this works in chrome 26 internet explorer 9 and safari 5.1.7 without the use of a helper page ala nick s answer the nested window.open is to make ie not display the do you want to close this window prompt

15919452
setinterval	settimeout
note for our library we will stop using setinterval from now and instead rewrite the few parts in the code that rely on it to use settimeout directly.
for completeness sake i am adding a possible workaround here as i have already written and commenters suggested this can be worked around not fixed by falling back to settimeout

15921904
realloc	malloc
it must be previously allocated by malloc calloc or realloc and not yet free with free otherwise the results are undefined
when using realloc store the result to a temporary variable to avoid a memory leak in the event of failure

15922886
octal	binary
in fact c and c++ don t even have binary literals built-in a numeric literal starting with 0 is interpreted as octal base 8
just because you write a number that looks binary since it has a lot of 1s and 0s and is 8 digits wide doesn t make it magically a binary literal

15923872
serializable	deserialization
in fact the serializable process doesn t preserve the class
the only way to restore it is to pass the class name as attribute in the serialized json and instruct the deserialization routine to instantiate an instance of that class

15924809
wadl	wsdl
there are folks out there that want to push the use of a wadl for such cases but i m not for it
the wsdl defines operations that can be executed on a service

15927590
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
if you want to use asp.net-mvc and ajax i think you probably need an ajax.actionlink if you want to just delete then redirecttoaction then just a normal html.actionlink will do
i am not sure if you want to perform an ajax delete using something like jquery - or if you want to just use asp.net asp.net-mvc

15928296
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you still want to use dbcontext you may be able to overload its own savechanges method to use iobjectcontextadapter.objectcontext by using an extension method for example
savechanges boolean is part of objectcontext not dbcontext

15928296
dbcontext	objectcontext
savechanges boolean is part of objectcontext not dbcontext
note that the method savechanges boolean in objectcontext is deprecated in favor of savechanges saveoptions

15928353
countif	named
so your countif line should be like worksheetfunction.countif range e e present
excel functions are available in worksheetfunctions module like worksheetfunctions.countif arg1 as range arg2 also pass your second argument as string not as a variable vb s hectic nature will declare an uninitialized variable of that named for you which is probably not what you want

15928936
innodb	myisam
another option may be the way that innodb stores the data on the disk - the innodb files are a virtual tablespace and as such are not necessarily ordered by the data in your table if you have a fragmented data file then this could be creating problems for your disk io and as a result running slower
myisam generally are sequential files and as such if you are using an index to access data the system knows exactly in what location on disk the row is located - you do not have this luxury with innodb but i do not think this particular issue comes into play with just a simple count explains this innodb does not keep an internal count of rows in a table

15928936
innodb	myisam
myisam generally are sequential files and as such if you are using an index to access data the system knows exactly in what location on disk the row is located - you do not have this luxury with innodb but i do not think this particular issue comes into play with just a simple count explains this innodb does not keep an internal count of rows in a table
in practice this would be somewhat complicated due to multi-versioning. to process a select count from t statement innodb must scan an index of the table which takes some time if the index is not entirely in the buffer pool

15929707
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
opera has a very nice explanation of this property in their flexbox basics article for your particular problem i was able to solve it in google-chrome by setting the width of the input element to a very small value this solution does not appear to work in opera if you add the unprefixed properties
it probably won t work in firefox either

15931934
inline	inlining
the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

15934662
subtract	addition
you may or may not have to figure that out depending on what you do with the carry bit after the operation conditional branches for example jump if carry set jump if carry not set in this case as the other poster showed some instruction sets have a subtract with borrow
just like add then a series of addc operations to cascade an infinitely large addition you can use sub and sbb to cascade an infinitely large subtract

15935062
ubuntu	centos
i cannot help resolve the issue on ubuntu and i suspect the euca version involved is way out date
if you are willing to work on centos then you ve got two great options faststart - this is an awesome bundle of eucalyptus and centos

15935629
concave	convex
your polygon is concave so the behavior of this function is undefined and as you ve observed it doesn t always work
you will need to break your polygon up into one or more convex polygons for this to work correctly

15936223
udp	tcp
then comes sock.sendall ... it s supposed to be used on say udp sockets where you want to broadcast a message on all open sockets in your case you re sending to and from a server nothing else
and it s via tcp so you should be using sock.send ... correct me if i m wrong here a side note ping it should only reply with and not be spammed with join every time join should be sent after motd is recieved but sure it s not a problem really

15937678
lisp	scheme
in common lisp we can write defun list-me list list list in scheme which does not have separate namespaces one would write something like this define list-me lst list lst
common lisp has different namespaces for functions and variables

15940072
udp	tftp
udp was specially engineered for tftp among other things and that protocol breaks down if you cannot distinguish a transaction
specifically one of the tftp transaction types is the data transaction which consists of an opcode block number and up to 512 bytes of data

15941339
udp	tcp
this code of sending and receiving udp packets can not guarantee to successfully recreate the file in client side
udp is unreliable - there is no low level acknowledgement and packet retransmission mechanism like in tcp so you have to implement this

15941339
udp	tcp
udp is unreliable - there is no low level acknowledgement and packet retransmission mechanism like in tcp so you have to implement this
packets may be lost and never received at client side udp is not sequential - you can not just expect the udp packets to recieve at client end sequentially

15941415
viewdidload	viewdidappear
but as you want to change the index you need to write this code in viewdidappear rather than on viewdidload it is not changing because you are trying to change index before your tabbar is loaded
so please try to put your code in viewdidappear

15943068
comparator	comparable
this is spelled out in the documentation for sortedset all elements inserted into a sorted set must implement the comparable interface or be accepted by the specified comparator
furthermore all such elements must be mutually comparable e1.compareto e2 or comparator.compare e1 e2 must not throw a classcastexception for any elements e1 and e2 in the sorted set

15943111
comparator	comparable
if you check treemap code you will see that if the comparator wasn t found within the map object it will try to cast the key your employee object directly to comparator
from treeset#add e javadoc throws classcastexception - if the specified object cannot be compared with the elements currently in this set basically what you need is to let employee implement comparable or provide a comparator to the treeset object

15945018
postgresql	mysql
if mysql had generate_series supported by postgresql it would have been much easier to do without scripting but unfortunately it doesn t
however you still can easily create big tables in mysql or any other sql database without scripting

15947094
equals	gethashcode
on the other side that means that for entities that are not equals the uniqueness of hash code has to be guaranteed as much as it possible
correctly means that gethashcode returns the same hash code for the entities that are expected to be equals

15947208
punctuation	words
you are not using regular expressions at all here so you may as well just use if you wanted to replace only whole words so with whitespace or punctuation markes around them at the start or end of the input string you need to some kind of boundary anchors at which point it makes sense to use regular expressions
if all you have are alphanumeric words plus underscores b would work this puts b before and after the string you wanted to replace so that baz in foo baz bar is changed but foo bazbaz bar is not

15947496
listview	gridview
as we cannot add listview inside scrollview we cannot and should not add gridview inside scrollview
you should not add gridview into scrollview

15947734
super	implements
you need to call super implementations for the touches methods
these methods need to be implements on your view and not your view controller

15948497
g++	gcc
you may check how was your gcc built in c or in c++ by running if that command shows typed c++ manged names instead of just execute_ipa_pass_list your gcc has been compiled with a c++ compiler probably g++ so you may need to use g++ not gcc to compile your gcc plugin
i suggest downloading the very latest since i will release the next melt in a few weeks for gcc 4.7 and 4.8 and don t expect to change the parsing behavior of your gcc with a plugin

15949135
google-chrome	firefox
if you do not have a specific requirement to build your system on google-chrome you should possibly move to firefox
you can develop a google-chrome extension which intercepts http-requests by means of webrequest api analyses their headers and extracts media urls such as containing audio mpeg mime-type for example in http-headers

15951675
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode has two rules that must be followed if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

15951675
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

15953393
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
really weird bug but the above code fixed it for me across all tested osx win ios 5+6 android 2+4 each with native browser google-chrome firefox ie safari and opera if available platforms
taking gregers comment on win8 and google-chrome firefox into account skyisred s comment doesn t look that dumb after all p all the haters though i would rather go with a blacklist than with a whitelist which he suggested only excluding android from touch-binds btw i found that mouse-events are not always triggered if stoppropagation and preventdefault were used specifically i only noticed an extra mousemove directly before a touchend event.

15955755
implements	extends
to get the behaviour required you might also need to implements computeminwidth and computeminheight on the imageviewpane so that they return zero rather than the minimum size of the image
now the image goes over my grid this is because the minimum size of your image is currently larger than the available space of the center of your borderpane borderpane does not clip its content by default so it is possible that childrens bounds may extends outside its own bounds if a child s min size prevents it from being fit within it space

15958585
email	dkim
when and if you get email adress from oauth than you will need to send email on behalf of that user
since your smtp server is not authorised to send emails on behalf of random users see spf and dkim you will quickly get on spam lists and be blocked

15960203
multiplying	multiplication
to compute using only mov but the real problem with 16-bit values is that in x86 x86-64 memory is addressed using byte offset not with word dword qword offset and we can only multiplying by 256 n
but let s see first how the look-up table could look like if we didn t have this problem with multiplication and byte offset addressing

15971368
opera	google-chrome
it is not supported in firefox safari or opera
dottoro.com claims google-chrome support but it is no longer true if it ever was

15975447
trie	tree
i m not 100 sure but if i were to guess it would be a trie
the idea is that you start at the root of the tree and you trace a path to a leaf node

15976563
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy copies the final 0 so one more character if you use strncpy as you do which you shouldn t then you will end up with a string which is not 0 terminated
so with strcpy you overrun the end of the buffer and with strncpy anyone trying to read the string will overrun the end of the buffer since they will continue until a 0

15976563
strcpy	strdup
so with strcpy you overrun the end of the buffer and with strncpy anyone trying to read the string will overrun the end of the buffer since they will continue until a 0
the rule is to allocate one more character than strlen returns although not standard c many systems have a strdup function which does this

15976563
strdup	malloc
the rule is to allocate one more character than strlen returns although not standard c many systems have a strdup function which does this
using malloc of course so you would have to free with free and not delete . beyond that i will repeat what i said before your code will leave the object in an inconsistent state if any of the allocations failed

15977643
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
note this method doesn t work in opera and possibly other browsers
it was tested in google-chrome firefox and ie 8 9 demo edit it at another method that should work in most browsers including opera is to make the file upload element invisible and put an element on top of it

15977811
vim	emacs
i m not a vim user but after looking up ctrlp s functionality it seems you are looking for ido-mode
ido-mode comes with emacs and you can enable it by putting this in your .emacs require ido ido-mode t there is a lot of features in ido-mode but this video is a good introduction to some basic functionality

.htaccess	httpd.conf
try this in the .htaccess for the public root directory if you re adding these directives to a httpd.conf file then add a forward-slash at the start of the rewriterule pattern so it becomes
i ve assumed you re using .htaccess which does not need the forward-slash. this should redirect with a 301 status code a request for dashboard or dashboard to cs dashboard if the string cs appears anywhere in the value of the http accept-language header sent by the visitor s browser

google-chrome	firefox
here s the part that generates the n v in firefox evaluates to while in google-chrome it is equals 23
so due to firefox s extra whitespace this isn t quite enough to get to the v and is instead n

webkit	gecko
just as text will not float in a circular way around your divs for all intents and purposes your circles are still rectangular in layout and to webkit in behaviour
gecko developers apparently have gone the extra mile to respect border-radius for hovers but that is actually inconsistent since they don t do it for gaps in backgrounds and the like which are essentially also just visual changes just like border-radius

udp	tcp
however using the udp network transmission protocol requires that some of the delivery mechanisms used by tcp in order to provide the dependable sequence of bytes must be assumed by the user of udp
some of the issues with udp are 1 packets may not be received in the same sequence in which they are sent 2 packets may be dropped or lost so that some packets sent may not be received and 3 data sent using udp must be explicitly put into packets for transmission so that the sender and the receiver see packets rather than a stream of bytes

google-chrome	firefox
thus when you login with google-chrome wp sends a login cookie to google-chrome starting a new session
when you then access the site with firefox firefox doesn t have a login cookie so wp prompts you to login and then sends a login cookie to firefox also starting a new session

setcontentview	findviewbyid
move setcontentview above your findviewbyid line
r.id.hello cannot be found by findviewbyid until after you call setcontentview and add r.id.hello to your activity s view

kerberos	ldap
i got this same error message server not found in kerberos database 7 but this occurs after the successful use of the keytab to login
the error message occurs when we attempt to use the credentials to do ldap searches against ad

firefox	safari
for example firefox doesn t include an origin header on same-origin requests
but chrome and safari include an origin header on same-origin post put delete requests same-origin get requests will not have an origin header

prepare	execute
this stems from a common misconception about how the placeholders in prepare statements work they are not simply substituted in as strings and the resulting sql execute
instead a dbms asked to prepare a statement comes up with a complete query plan for how it would execute that query including which tables and indexes it would use which will be the same regardless of how you fill in the placeholders

prepare	execute
to understand why binding a table or column name doesn t work you have to understand how the placeholders in prepare statements work they are not simply substituted in as suitably escaped strings and the resulting sql execute
instead a dbms asked to prepare a statement comes up with a complete query plan for how it would execute that query including which tables and indexes it would use which will be the same regardless of how you fill in the placeholders

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the net effect is uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller have special undocumented internal code that makes it seem as if 0 0 is the top left corner - they force-resize reposition any uiviewcontroller s you add to them ...if you are not using one of them as your main controller you have to re-implement that logic yourself
if you re using 3rd-party uiviewcontroller instance the logic is often implemented incorrectly or missing

translation	localization
but people who are not very familiar with computers tend to fail at that task i often received the xml files back as microsoft word documents .doc or they translation the xml keys which become the strings ids later as well
therefore i recommend you to use some convenient tool for collaborative translation such as transifex crowdin or get localization

profiling	instrumentation
this is andre hamilton from the visual studio profiling team
the reason the values are in percentages and not in ms is because you are seeing a report based on sample profiling and not instrumentation based profiling

profiling	instrumentation
the reason the values are in percentages and not in ms is because you are seeing a report based on sample profiling and not instrumentation based profiling
sample profiling basically the operating system will periodically do a stack walk

profiling	instrumentation
because information is taken at every function enter exit the resulting profiling report can be very huge it is not unkown to have over 1gb of data with just a few seconds of program execution
also if static instrumentation is used on signed binaries you will need to have them resigned

hex	binary
that data looks like hex encoded image with a length in front of it not an unencoded tiff which is a tagged binary format
perhaps you need to strip the number before the slash and decode e rest of the string from hex digits into nsdata and then call using that decided data

15999666
g++	gcc
for example strongly-typed enumerations are available in g++ since gcc 4.4.0
however with the option and its equivalents the macro __cplusplus was not set to the good value before gcc 4.7.0 it was set to 1 instead
