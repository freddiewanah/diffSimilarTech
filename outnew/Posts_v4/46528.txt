autoresetevent	manualresetevent
as a result your client will not be waiting for the socket to be connected before trying to send data after the first message is sent as indicated by the following message which i saw logged when i ran it on my machine a request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket is not connected and when sending on a datagram socket using a sendto call no address was supplied try changing your manualresetevent s to autoresetevent s which automatically reset after waitone returns true in the client which should resolve the issue
the problem looks to be the use of manualresetevent s in the client

swift	objective-c
using swift classes in objective-c step 1 create new swift class add a .swift file to your project and name it myswiftobject.swift
in myswiftobject.swift step 2 import swift files to objective-c class in somerandomclass.m the file should already be created automatically in your project even if you can not see it

24006989
swift	objective-c
swift itself doesn t have anything for asynchronous requests so you use existing api for that
you can use the trailing closure syntax though in most cases you don t need to worry about creating reference cycles with swift closures the way you do with objective-c blocks

24007718
swift	objective-c
you ll want to run convert to current swift syntax in xcode to get those using #selector
swift itself doesn t use selectors several design patterns that in objective-c make use of selectors work differently in swift

swift similarly can do both
it does differ from objective-c in that it does not always dynamically dispatch

to fix it add your mcr to the as shown below first make sure to add the missing files to the right folder in terminal add the proper library folder to your .profile such that this change will stay after logout ubuntu gedit .profile in the end of the file add following lines invoke following code in the terminal to make sure that ubuntu bug doesn t re-write your variable reboot if this solution doesn t work try to reinstall matlab mcr 8.3 from the mathworks website and repeat the steps
since i have already found a solution to this problem wasting a day i just want to share it this seems to be a problem of matlab mcr installation script designed for linux by mathworks

at a guess you aren t using postgresql you re using greenplum database or amazon redshift
if you really are using 8.2 postgresql 8.2 does not support desc ending ordered indexes

24015174
sudo	passwd
it means that you must be superuser the owner of the machine to run those commands for example sudo shutdown it will ask for a passwd you must type the main user s passwd the typing will not print out the passwd s chars and press enter so you can confirm you are the super user
sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user as specified in the sudoers file

coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl
you could get it to work by using is null case when column_name is null then unnamed else column_name end as my_alias but coalesce is cleaner
use coalesce nvl isnull nullif or whatever function is appropriate for the the server software you requerying coalesce column_name unnamed as my_alias isnull column_name unnamed as my_alias if your case statement isn t working it s because is always false even if x is null so that case never gets used

24020950
swift	objective-c
pure swift method calls do not appear to be dispatched dynamically via anything like objc_msgsend and it appears from brief experimentation that the type safety of swift is implemented at compile time and that much of the actual type information is absent gone at runtime for non-class types both of which likely contribute to the purported speed advantages of swift. for these reasons i expect that meaningfully swizzling swift-only methods will be significantly harder than swizzling objective-c methods and will probably look a lot more like mach_override than objective-c method swizzling
you would likely be able to swizzle swift-generated classes that inherit from objective-c classes with no problem since they appear to use dynamic method dispatch all the time

24021378
equals	compareto
a set will not allow more than one element that compares equals
your use of treeset will have it relying on calling compareto

24022476
swift	objective-c
if you have pure swift code and do not expose your classes protocols to objective-c with the objective-c decoration it appears that pure-swift method calls are not dispatched via objc_msgsend however in other cases they are
if the protocol your swift object adopts is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c then method calls to protocol methods even from swift objects to other swift objects are dispatched via objc_msgsend

24024067
arraylist	treeset
here you can define how to order the arraylist. if you don t add an comparator the treeset implicitly expects the arraylist to realize the comparable-interface which it does not do
the treeset doesn t know how to sort the arraylists because there is no natural ordering for lists

24024067
arraylist	treeset
the treeset doesn t know how to sort the arraylist because there is no natural ordering for lists
to make the treeset understand on what you want to sort you have to add an comparator to the constructor the comparator has to realize the interface

24024168
dictionary	map
however if you do not care about that then using standard dictionary would be perfectly fine too - depends on your actual use case
the f# map type is a mapping from keys to values just like ordinary .net dictionary except that it is immutable

24025447
swift	objective-c
setter getter in swift are quite different than objective-c
the property becomes a computed property which means it does not have a backing variable such as _x as it would in objective-c

24025668
postgresql	mysql
there s postgis for postgresql which should be quite straightforward since it has full support for latitude longitude distance computations
once you have it setup with proper indexes it should be as easy as mysql has some support for the opengis extensions however it doesn t have support for latitude longitude distance computations

24025726
octal	decimal
because a number that starts with a 0 is considered as being octal not binary
10 is considered decimal because it s default

i m not aware of mysql having the analogous abilities

24027337
equals	gethashcode
if two objects have a hash-collision but do not compare as equals the dictionary will still store them as two separate key

swift	objective-c
swift exceptions are not compatible with objective-c exceptions
your do-catch block will not catch any nsexception and vice versa for that you must use objective-c

24030038
nsexception	nserror
your do-catch block will not catch any nsexception and vice versa for that you must use objc
swift exceptions are compatible with cocoa nserror method conventions of returning either false for bool returning functions or nil for anyobject returning functions and passing nserrorpointer with error details

24030038
swift	objective-c
swift language does not seem to have any language support for exceptions like throw catch etc keyword
however as documentation suggests it is running on the same runtime as objective-c and therefore you are still able to throw nsexceptions like this nsexception name somename reason somereason userinfo nil .raise you just cannot catch them in pure swift although you may opt for catching exceptions in objective-c code

consistency	acid
consistency as in acid means that when you update the database you cannot put it into an inconsistent state the database will enforce that all constraints are met
read consistency is one of the transaction isolation levels that describe how good concurrent transactions are isolated from each-other in how far they can treat the database as if only they work on it

24034973
swift	objective-c
yes you can swift to develop an ios app without knowing objective-c

24034973
swift	objective-c
the learning curve is not steep for the swift language itself but understanding of the sdk will surely be beneficial to those that have previously developed for ios with objective-c

24035209
swift	objective-c
not all of swift features are available in objective-c then some swift programs may not be available on objective-c side
cited from apple website the model for importing swift into objective-c is similar to the one used for importing objective-c into swift

24035940
consistency	acid
i don t think it is strong consistency since if one node with active vbucket reboot data has not been replicated or not persisted yet it will lose the data
strong consistency need w+r n and r 1 here so we need w n which means all replicas should be acid

however you can convert your jks keystore to bouncycastle bks keystore and it will work

24037182
swift	objective-c
it s likely that you could also get some gains by using swift to call directly into c or c++ libraries but the generic not-apple-provided p invoke story to use a .net word is not very clear at the moment
remember these two environments are bridged which means that if your swift code calls into objective-c objects you re still going to pay the dynamic dispatch objc_msgsend penalty

24037182
swift	objective-c
in an ideal world the best strategy here would be to use a native swift xml parser which probably doesn t exist at this point and have your model and controller objects all be pure swift with shim classes for where they cross the border into objective-c
if we were talking about c++ instead of swift i would say that if you rewrote your model and controller objects as native c++ objects and then used a pure c++ xml parser and only used objective-c at the point where you had to interact with the ui you would expect significant performance gains

24038997
swift	objective-c
so if you are not using any new apis added as part of the ios 8 sdk or some swift specific apis corresponding api is not available for objective-c your application will seamlessly work on ios 6 or later tested and working even on ios 5 not tested
most of the apis in swift are just the replacement of the existing objective-c apis

client-side	server-side
also - since your js function is dealing with client-side elements the attribute you want to set or remove is class not cssclass which is used by server-side controls

24048654
quicksort	mergesort
there are different implementations of sorting algorithms but more often than not std sort is built on top of a variant of quicksort that will degenerate on a different sorting algorithm like mergesort to avoid the quicksort worst case performance
the implementation of quicksort selects a pivot and then partitions the input around the pivot then independently sorts both sides

what i d say and i m highly pragmatic about this sort of thing is that if you have a block of code that is based on the semantics of objective-c strings it might be good to keep using them for a while get your code working and then evaluate changing to swift s string later
swift strings are not the same as foundation strings they can be bridged and they may have method names in common but that does not mean they should be treated as being compatible

when your output contains external dependencies generated from r code you are strongly recommended not to write the output file to a different directory because the structure of relative paths may confuse several tools in the chain including knitr markdown pandoc latex and so on
knitr knit

swift	objective-c
two files will be added to your project the objective-c file and project name -bridging-header.h delete the empty objective-c file you added and open project name -bridging-header.h add your import for the facebook sdk into the file using the objective-c style import example save the header file and you can now access facebook sdk in your swift code
you do not need to add import facebooksdk into your swift files

google-chrome	firefox
html css google-chrome firefox ie
here is the demo i am not quite sure why my browsers google-chrome firefox ie doesn t agree

24108501
apache	nginx
i m not familiar with unconv but i ve had a similar problem with porting my server from apache to nginx and exec
nginx + php-fpm have a bare minimal set compared to apache and it s likely your unoconv is not on that path

24108898
swift	objective-c
update swift creator and lead developer chris lattner had this to say on this issue on the apple developer forum on july 4th 2014 what is happening here is that cgfloat is a typealias for either float or double depending on whether you re building for 32 or 64-bits
this is exactly how objective-c works but is problematic in swift because swift doesn t allow implicit conversions

24109438
uialertview	uialertcontroller
note uialertview is deprecated see declaration but swift supports ios7 and you can not use uialertcontroller on ios 7 view of uialertview declaration in xcode an alert in swift ios 8 only update for swift 4.2
there is a bug in the swift shim of the uialertview convenience initializer you need to use the plain initializer this style code feels more true to the swift language

24110896
awt	swing
call super.paint or be prepared for additional weirdness keylistener will only respond to key events when the component it is registered to is focusable and has focus consider using the swing api instead of awt
awt components aren t double buffered and will flicker when updated

24111629
dbcontext	objectcontext
edit okay the above will not work since .savechanges false is an objectcontext method also deprecated for .savechanges saveoptions and we have a dbcontext
we know dbcontext is a wrapper around objectcontext so we can use an iobjectcontextadapter to get access to the .savechanges saveoptions method first we ll need to add using system.data.entity.infrastructure

24112808
queue	fifo
what is bft bft needs to use a data structure called queue which is a fifo list
first we offer to the queue the starting point and we mark it as visited meaning that it has entered the queue and is not allowed to enter any time later in the traversal

24114795
swift	objective-c
this is a very new publicly language and it is going through what i assume are lots of changes since there are people heavily involved with the swift language asking for feedback and they all say the language isn t finished and will change
code used p.s i m not an expert on objective-c nor all the facilities from cocoa objective-c or the swift runtimes

24116464
mongodb	bson
if you re not chasing extreme levels of performance as the mongodb developers who designed bson are then i would advise using json -- the human-readability is a great benefit to the developer
as long as you use a library like jackson migrating to bson later should not be hard -- as you can see by how almost identical your own bson and json classes are

24119298
uicontrol	uibutton
this is not a really easy task there are different roads that you can take but the one that makes more sense to me is subclass uicontrol
uicontrol is a subclass of uiview the main difference is that it s ready to work with the target-action pattern and gives you the possibility to track touches without adding gesture recognizer. a lot of ui interactive elements are concrete subclasses of uicontrol for instance uibutton . ray s site has interesting tutorial about how to do that

24119852
stateless	stateful
for a web application the http session is almost always leading which means using the session scope and local stateless beans and or cdi beans for business logic
in some cases stateful beans are needed for their natural support for the extended persistence context from jpa and for their passivation features servlet doesn t have a standardized passivation mechanism

24120668
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
if you are using google-chrome mozilla firefox or internet explorer 11 the screenshot capability takes advantage of html5 compatibility
safari is not supported

24121244
robocopy	xcopy
either a usage error or an error due to insufficient access privileges on the source or destination directories. there is more details on robocopy return values here
robocopy replaces xcopy in the newer versions of windows uses mirroring xcopy does not has a rh option to allow a set time for the copy to run has a mon n option to check differences in files copies over more file attributes than xcopy yes i agree with mark setchell they are both crap

24121244
robocopy	xcopy
robocopy replaces xcopy in the newer versions of windows uses mirroring xcopy does not has a rh option to allow a set time for the copy to run has a mon n option to check differences in files copies over more file attributes than xcopy yes i agree with mark setchell they are both crap
brought to you by microsoft update xcopy return codes 0 - files were copied without error. 1 - no files were found to copy. 2 - the user pressed ctrl+c to terminate xcopy

24122071
icmp	tcp
however java does not provide the means to send an icmp message
so you might try to establish a tcp connection to some server

24124793
octal	decimal
if you want a leading 0 to mean octal and leading 0x to mean hexadecimal you can do that at least if memory serves by setting the base for the conversion to 0
the cleanest way would probably be to use a stringstream with an istream_iterator something like this note that there is a little bit of ambiguity in the input you provided it s not clear whether you intent the 0104 to be decimal or octal as a leading zero would cause it to be interpreted in source code

24125348
queue	fifo
a ring buffer is one possible implementation of a queue though it s not the only one for example you could implement a queue using a linked list
in other words queue is a general term for a data structure that can support fifo insertions and ring buffers are one possible data structure you could use to implement a queue

24128280
rspec	capybara
i sort of found out the problem i m getting initialized constant capybara because in newer versions of rspec they have a new folder rails_helper when you first create a spec folder it creates both rails_helper and spec_helper
the first mock speck test in the spec folder has this at the top require rails_helper i was following a tutorial that told me to require spec_helper but that is not true for newer versions of rspec

24128280
rspec	capybara
the first mock speck test in the spec folder has this at the top require rails_helper i was following a tutorial that told me to require spec_helper but that is not true for newer versions of rspec
so i added config.include capybara dsl in the rails helper folder and everything worked except i get an error with the css but i believe this is because the tests run headless so they do not work

24128337
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
fourth request using refresh f5 or ctrl f5 if i refresh page instead of hitting enter with in 60 seconds of previous request firefox didn t load data from cache instead it made request to server with special header in request google-chrome second request with in 60 seconds using enter this time google-chrome sent request again to server instead of loading data from cache and in request it added header cache-control max-age 0 aggregating results as google-chrome responding differently to enter click you saw different behavior in firefox and google-chrome its nothing do with jax-rs or your http response
to summarize clients firefox google-chrome safari opera will cache data for specified time period in cache control client will not make new request to server unless time expires or until we do a force refresh

24128823
clang	llvm
for example clang -mllvm -std gnu++11 test3.cc -o test3 clang llvm option parsing unknown command line argument -std gnu++11
the -mllvm option tells clang to not process the option itself but to pass it on to llvm

24128823
clang	llvm
the -mllvm option tells clang to not process the option itself but to pass it on to llvm
but llvm has no idea what this option means

24128867
backgrounding	multitasking
the text book as of the 2nd edition on my shelf here somewhere at least is well written as well and goes into a lot of theoretical backgrounding on each of the features it supports
i successfully used it in several product development projects and would considering it again for a project that needs multitasking but does not need to carry the weight of a full os like linux

24129428
centos	linux
instead it sees only that it is connected through ethernet to a router firewall. so even with that this might not work all depends if another virtual machine on a bridged network is considered outside your machine. if it does not work you can run the emulator on the cenos virtual machine. you might also create a proxy on the pc i suspect 10.0.2.2 will be the windows machine you can make a small program to bind listen accept here connect to the centos machine and then pass packets back and forth
netcat would do that on linux there is probably an equivalent for windows. my last approach would be to use a virtual private server vps for the centos host

24129552
wildfly	glassfish	jboss	glassfish
i ve already implemented a project with batch processing in wildfly jboss
i m not familiar with configuration details on glassfish not using it anymore because the ve dropped enterprise support however i can give you some insights and guidelines according to my experience

24129947
couchbase	couchdb
a few alternative options are available to you right now couchbase which has per-user databases janus which works using mozilla persona rather than facebook id and isn t ready yet but should be unveiled shortly
currently you can only do per-user read-write permissions in couchdb by having an additional process on the server side details which would be troublesome for you since you re using iriscouch so you d need a separate server somewhere to host this process

24131164
google-chrome	firefox
in fact i d say most developers develop their app in google-chrome 90 of the time and then test on their devices or a simulator
i do know that firefox is simply not supported

24131593
swift	objective-c
when translating to swift you generally put the first part of the method name before the left parenthesis with subsequent parts appearing inside the parens
it looks like that call should be that s because the objective-c method name is -boolforkey not -standarduserdefaults boolforkey

24132239
robocopy	xcopy
the most important difference is that robocopy will usually retry when an error occurs while xcopy will not
in most cases that makes robocopy far more suitable for use in a script

24132305
serializable	deserialization
you are using ascii encoding for the serializable but utf-8 encoding for the deserialization that looks asymmetrical
do not use text encodings for binary serializable this has undefined behavior the binary array you are using has no encoding at all it is binary data

24135465
build.gradle	gradlew
as the error points out you need to place your debug.keystore file at the path specified against storefile in your build.gradle
gradlew is not able to locate your debug keystore

24135647
swift	objective-c
though as matthew notes you should slowly adapt to swift
i would not start a new project in objective-c though if there aren t very good reasons for it

24135956
sudo	passwd
when you run sudo wget it will download it into the current directory
you can find your current directory by typing passwd note that wget sometimes saves the file with a name you might not be expecting - especially if there is a query string on the end of the url - eg if you run ls -lrt it will list the contents of the current directory sorted with the newest file at the bottom

24136454
tabcontrol	tabitem
the properties value inherited is definitely stopping at the tabcontrol
i suspect that it has something to do with all of the different template s and style s that the tabitem provides although that shouldn t cause any problem really

24136897
implements	extends
borrowing from duncan s answer to the question get name of currently executing test in junit 4 if you are within a bigger project you may extract the custom testwatcher rule into a own small class that way you would have one line of code per test class two if you count the annotation add the rule declaration to an abstract test class all other tests implements update you are mixing junit3 and junit4 style
you cannot extends testcase junit3 style and then attempt to rely on the annotation driven junit4 style

24137213
swift	objective-c
if you have a swift class the best you can get is dispatch_once inside the init statement
this solution differs from +initialize which is called the first time an objective-c class is messaged and thus isn t a true answer to the question

24137486
swift	objective-c
in pure swift a root class is not necessary though
one more note swift classes doesn t run on top of objective-c

24137486
swift	objective-c
one more note swift classes doesn t run on top of objective-c
they are not translated into objective-c behind the scenes

24139982
fgets	getline
you can detect whether or not you read a whole line by inspecting the last character of the string the one before the null terminator to see if it is n or not -- fgets passes n through to you
there is no standard c function which will read a line whilst dynamically allocating enough memory for it however there is a posix function getline which does that

24140696
swift	objective-c
a better solution might be to implement the enum in objective-c for example in your briding header because then it will be automatically accessible in swift and it will be possible to pass it as a parameter
edit it is not required to add objective-c simply to use it for an objective-c class

24140933
serializable	deserialization
hazelcast doesn t have out of the box support for arrays afaik so for serializable first you serializable the size and then you iterate over every item and call objectdataouput.writeobject and for deserialization you read the size and create an array and then you iterate over every item to call deserialize and store it in the array
your condition object doesn t need to be dataserializable to be used as long as hazelcast knows how to serializable it

24141778
mongodb	bson
numberlong and numberint are not data types in mongodb but javascript functions in the mongodb shell
data types in mongodb are defined in the bson specification numbers are stored as type 0x01 floating point type 0x10 32-bit integer or type 0x12 64-bit integer

24143674
swift	objective-c
in swift you can use extensions to add new functionality to existing classes structs and enumeration types
they differ from objective-c categories in a few ways mainly they aren t named you don t need to import an extension explicitly

24147246
spaces	delimiter
to split on a single spaces character but it seems like you are not getting the input you say you are
you seem to be using scanner#next which returns a single token where a token is delimiter by whitespace a spaces character is a whitespace character instead of scanner#nextline which will go to the end of the line ie

24147428
persistent	transient
it does not loose your jobs on recycling process because it uses persistent storage to keep information about background jobs
it automatically retries your background jobs that were aborted or failed due to transient exception smtp server connectivity errors

24148864
memcpy	memmove
a specification of memcpy s requirements in a specification language designed for this sort of thing looks like this in this contract for memcpy the requirement expresses exactly which memory zones are supposed not to overlap
if you want to from a memory zone to another that you do not know for sure that it doesn t overlap the first one use memmove

24149030
swift	objective-c
end ...then when swift turns them into initializer it elides the part of the method name that s the generic name of the class thing thing moves the part of the selector that refers to the parameter to be a parameter label and drops any prepositions connecting those parts
so the initializer declarations look like this in swift and you construct objects like this a followup because class-method like are treated like initializer by the objective-c to swift translator even if that doesn t seem to fully work right now that naming pattern is a bad idea for singletons

24150107
haskell	agda
a useful tool to learn when proving stuff about haskell code is agda here is a short proof stating what you want to prove this illustrates a couple of points others have pointed out which definitions you use are important for the proof and should be made explicit
in my case i did not want to use agda s libraries

24151162
nsstring	nsobject
yeah you can use foundation classes like nsstring nsdictionary and whatever else you want as a generic type parameter but i would recommend against inheriting from nsobject in a generic class definition
for some reason inheriting from nsobject is not a good idea when using generic classes in swift. i would say avoid doing so in any swift class unless you absolutely must

24151162
swift	objective-c
for some reason inheriting from nsobject is not a good idea when using generic classes in swift. i would say avoid doing so in any swift class unless you absolutely must
if you need objective-c compatibility then mark your class with the objective-c prefix along with any methods that will be called from objective-c

24152204
bower	npm
if not you could use npm for your dependencies and let bower magic them up for you
jquery and angular are available via npm so using jquery as an example you could just declare it in your package.json like so alternatively running from the directory containing your package.json will install the specified module and save it as a dependency in your package.json file

24155382
swift	objective-c
using swift with cocoa and objective-c
currently swift does not support any built in mechanism for observing property changes of objects other than self so no it does not support kvo

24155382
swift	objective-c
currently swift does not support any built in mechanism for observing property changes of objects other than self so no it does not support kvo
however kvo is such a fundamental part of objective-c and cocoa that it seems quite likely that it will be added in the future

24156361
implements	extends
laravel 4.0 maybe the best way to implements this would be to replace cookiesessionhandler with your own handler
for example a new class could be created which would extends cookiesessionhandler with an updated write function which would mark all cookies as not being for https http only

24158176
crossover	mutation
on whether there is a better crossover mutation algorithm for the basic genetic algorithm the answer is not really
you can experiment with different kinds of crossover 1-point two-point n-point and mutation swap or replace

24158336
clang	llvm
you can most definitely do it without clang
the vectorizers are all about llvm ir they re not in clang

24158336
clang	llvm
the vectorizers are all about llvm ir they re not in clang
i got this ir from your example by using clang without optimizations yeah i cheated and then annotated a bit or two data layout and triple are important

24158743
swift	objective-c
examples valid swift invalid swift if somecondition one liner if somecondition one liner this design decision eliminates an entire class of bugs that can come from improperly using an if statement without braces like the following case where it might not always be clear that something s value will be changed conditionally but somethingelse s value will change every time
in swift the braces aren t optional like they were in objective-c c

24159928
super	implements
the answer is no cause you are limited to only one super class to extends in java where in some other oo languages this is not the case therefore the compiler forbids it cause there are no possible scenarios where this will work
the difference in this situation is obviously that i is an interface which could be implements

24166567
build.gradle	gradlew
in my build.gradle for my main project reference the library project like add the following to the bottom of my build.gradle then when i run a clean and rebuild it will copy the native libs to the proper spot and include them in the build
i am not sure if there is a cleaner way in the newer version of vitamino or gradlew

24167497
viewdidload	viewwillappear
it s not working in your current implementation because viewdidload is called before detailviewcontroller.note has been set
you should set up your subview in viewwillappear

24168438
hex	binary
if you really want to convert it to some character field then convert it to hex display characters
the mqmd accountingtoken field is made up of both binary values and character values set by the queue manager default behavior so you need to treat it as a binary field byte field and not a character field

24170747
inline	inlining
the compiler is not required to obey inline it can choose to generate a normal function if it decides the inlining isn t worth the extra code bulk which can cause cache misses and increase code size
inline functions are only available in the source file that declares them

24171383
sse	avx
edit the only potentially efficient way to add 128-bit or 256-bit numbers with sse is with xop
the only option with avx would be xop2 which does not exist yet

24173699
required	placeholder
this approach will also be required should you change the backing store to an object instead of just a string value ie store the actual state object not just it s id
the reason your initselect function is not invoked is that select2 thinks that your placeholder is selected

24174606
spaces	delimiter
to make it look nice tabular puts a spaces after it since it assumes that the field delimiter doesn t end in a spaces
if you add the l0 flag after the delimiter you will remove the extra spaces to the left of the next field

24174728
comparator	comparable
require the entities to implement the comparator interface this means you d need to change your classes generics to handle the entities implementation requirements.
this will also require that all your class must implement the comparable interface which might not always be practical as you might not always control the entities you could provide the means to pass a comparator to your sort methods instead or any of the methods that might need to compare the elements then instead of.

24175539
punctuation	words
but it is a decision made by the apple engineer by replacing the punctuation or shortcut to become a whole words for uisearchbar
i think it is because punctuation or shortcut words does not make much sense when we are searching

24175789
ssl	https
you should not use ssl to a localhost hostname connection
ssl + https use a certificate with your domain name and use this to provide authentication

24176876
clang	llvm
from what i ve seen from the portfile the llvm clang -3.4 ports and the other similar ones i assume install a plain llvm and or clang
for example the latest released xcode comes with apple llvm version 5.1 clang-503.0.40 based on llvm 3.4svn target x86_64-apple-darwin13.2.0 thread model posix apple doesn t tell us the specific revision number but we know their private clang was based on a revision of llvm branched off of trunk between the middle of 2013 and early 2014

24176876
clang	llvm

i also don t understand what you mean with macport clang is more close to gcc

24177745
fgets	getline
when reading input from any file stdin included where you do not know the length it is often better to use getline rather than scanf or fgets because getline will handle memory allocation for your string automatically so long as you provide a null pointer to receive the string entered
this example will illustrate the relevant parts being setting line to null causes getline to allocate memory automatically

24180962
queue	fifo
you can consume with 5 consumers from one queue if you do not want to duplicate messages
does rabbitmq support to push the same data to multiple consumers in amqp protocol terms you publish message to exchange and then broker rabbitmq decide what to do with messages - assume it figured out the queue message intended for one or more and then put that message on top of that queue queues in rabbitmq are classic fifo queues which is somehow break amqp implementation in rabbitmq

24181029
vb.net	vb6
don t expect vb.net samples to work in vb6
the two languages are incompatible on a number of levels not just because vb6 doesn t use the .net framework

24185109
swift	objective-c
update june 9th 2015 - very important swift 2.0 comes with try throw and catch keywords and the most exciting is swift automatically translates objective-c methods that produce errors into methods that throw an error according to swift s native error handling functionality
note methods that consume errors such as delegate methods or methods that take a completion handler with an nserror object argument do not become methods that throw when imported by swift

24185109
swift	objective-c
update from apple news books using swift with cocoa and objective-c
runtime exceptions not occur using swift languages so that s why you don t have try-catch

24185166
textview	imageview
in your case i d go for the linearlayout approach because it s hard to position the imagebutton to the right of the two textview without adding an extra container view as you did
add android layout_alignparentleft true to the imageview to anchor it to the left side of the layout android layout_above +id text_layout in the imagebutton doesn t make sense if it should be to the right of the two textview

24186511
swift	objective-c
from using swift with cocoa and objective-c section working with nil because objective-c does not make any guarantees that an object is non-nil swift makes all classes in argument types and return types optional in imported objective-c apis
before you use an objective-c object you should check to ensure that it is not missing

24188141
ubuntu	debian
this guide is for ubuntu not debian
the repository containing the relevant packages is added via ppa which isn t supported by debian

24188716
passenger	unicorn
yes phusion passenger does forking almost exactly like how unicorn does it
unicorn s default behavior preload_app off is the same as phusion passenger s direct spawning not default in phusion passenger

24188716
passenger	unicorn
unicorn s default behavior preload_app off is the same as phusion passenger s direct spawning not default in phusion passenger
unicorn s preload_app on is the same as phusion passenger s smart spawning default in phusion passenger

24190217
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
try storing the return of the method instantiateviewcontrollerwithidentifier in a uiviewcontroller instead of a uinavigationcontroller
instantiateviewcontrollerwithidentifier returns a uiviewcontroller but you re storing it in a uinavigationcontroller when you shouldn t

24190217
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
instantiateviewcontrollerwithidentifier returns a uiviewcontroller but you re storing it in a uinavigationcontroller when you shouldn t
when you try to access a uinavigationcontroller property viewcontrollers it crashed because uiviewcontroller doesn t have a property named viewcontrollers

24194512
robocopy	xcopy
it has at least one other bug surrounding error 32 in use files b backup mode will fail with this error even if a file is not exclusively locked and is copyable with copy xcopy windows explorer and robocopy without b so i suspect there are bugs in how it handles in-use files in general
this is quite probably a bug in robocopy

24195306
armadillo	lapack
copy includes armadillo doesn t need to be compiled
i haven t ran any benchmarks to verify but it appears that using lapack and blas works fine with an uncompiled copy of armadillo by using #define in code

24195772
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
this is an over-simplified statement if you use realloc or calloc
you need a free for each malloc that was not realloc d and a free for each realloc that did not do a free mdash

24196329
daemons	systemd
if not using the audit daemons this requires writing some netlink code
if you want to coexist with other userspace trying to access the audit systemd you ll need the 3.15 kernel for its multicast netlink sockets

24198892
hex	binary
the hex value is the most precise
well it doesn t make a difference how you represent them but as we know that humans don t understand binary numbers they are only to make the computer s life easier as it works on only two states true and false

24199287
hex	binary
therefore the hex system isn t used by computers but by humans for terser representation of binary numbers but easier convertibility than from to decimal number system
hex numbers have another characteristic which makes them preferable over decimal numbers it is not uncommon that a change between two numbers involves only flipping one or few bits

24199287
octal	hex
besides hex is was octal system used frequently too
it s disadvantage is that one octal digits describes a group of 3 bits only not 4

24199287
octal	binary
it s disadvantage is that one octal digits describes a group of 3 bits only not 4
as binary numbers in computers for example addresses have often a range of a power of 2 the numbers fit better into groups of four than into groups of three

24200494
octal	decimal	octal	binary
using decimal numbers however it would not be possible to see which bits are affected when using a numbering system to the base of 2 n octal or hexadecimal one digit corresponds to some bits while in decimal system for example a change of one digit in the decimal number may change all bits in the binary number
octal numbers are used less often than hexadecimal numbers

24203701
client-side	server-side
you problem is that you are mixing a server-side language with a client-side language
razor is a server-side language so you will not be able to access client-side code ie html or javascript using razor

realloc	malloc
you can t deallocate part of it let s forget realloc that s not what it s doing anyway you can only deallocate the entire thing
you can t deallocate x bytes either -- you either free the memory block you got from malloc or you don t

nginx does not have permission to write

24210222
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
for instance recent versions of google-chrome and firefox 35.0 and 28.0 at time of test respectively handle nan + far more efficiently than string nan whereas string is more efficient for undefined and null
safari 7.0 couldn t care less

24211284
inline	inlining
from observing the code generated for many different kernels the cuda compiler seems to inline in the vast majority of cases
note that in some cases inlining is currently not possible for example when the called function is in a different separately compiled compilation unit

viewdidload	viewdidappear
the key window must not yet be set at the time of viewdidload
your code works fine in viewdidappear

24215607
swift	objective-c
so from the documentation it s clear that swift does not have a corresponding instance variable thus no need to have the _ around anymore
in objective-c when you declare a property synthesize would create the getter and setters for you automatically since clang 3.2

24217850
google-chrome	safari
please be aware that if you are using an ios device tested on ios 7 8 platforms google-chrome renders as safari since it uses the built-in safari engine
it is not google-chrome at all from what i can see but safari with a different look

24217850
google-chrome	safari
it is not google-chrome at all from what i can see but safari with a different look
google-chrome hacks do not affect it only the safari ones

24218638
jruby	mri
actually the answer above is not correct except mikel s answer if you observed any benchmark for jvm you ll find it s slow so imagine jruby s performance compared to cruby
personally i m an mri ruby contributor and i think that the benchmark chart above is not true at all since the introduction of the yarv vm of mri ruby this version became the fastest outthere and lots of benchmarks proved so see pat shaughnessy s benchmarking and comments about the three famous ruby interpreters mri ruby jruby and rubinius

24218728
opera	google-chrome
at this time i do not know of a way to do this with google-chrome and i have not looked into opera especially now that it uses much of the same methodology as google-chrome
google-chrome did not release a version for mac until version 3

24218728
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also for a mac google has issued a statement that os x 10.6-10.8 will not be supported after google-chrome 49 so google-chrome 50 and newer will indicate mac os x 10.9 mavericks or newer
firefox internet explorer and safari have better options though

24218728
firefox	safari
firefox internet explorer and safari have better options though
firefox 4 and newer can detect that a windows theme is being used so even old versions of firefox will at least detect whether you are or are not using windows

24218728
firefox	safari
ios ipad and iphone did not have a version of firefox when i wrote this so firefox with os x font smoothing really does only cover mac computers only not apple mobile devices at this time
like chrome for ios firefox for ios uses the safari engine so uses the safari hacks on ipads and iphones

24218728
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
like google-chrome for ios firefox for ios uses the safari engine so uses the safari hacks on ipads and iphones
so they both are targetable -- as safari but are secretly not what they say they are under the hood

24224266
ssl	https
you should probably stick with ssl tls harden it where deficient and then speed it up with choice in cipher suites
if https can work fine in the poor network conditions which is typically faced by mobile app mobile is not that bad in practice

24224614
mef	caliburn	viewmodel	caliburn
it looks like mef cannot construct the iwindowmanager which is a dependency of your viewmodel
try registering at least the default instance from caliburn

24228448
bower	npm
npm install -g bower and then sudo bower install --allow -root now check if the files are created
i am not sure about this but try installing bower with the command

24229123
ssl	https
i therefore removed the line to continue with a plain text tunnel rather than ssl
once the http 1.1 200 connection established r n r n message is sent the browser and end server will then form their own ssl connection through the proxy and so the proxy doesn t need to do anything related to the actual https connection

24231719
swift	objective-c
in swift the object initialization can t fail so we are speaking only about objective-c interoperability here
one example to answer the comments in swift if the file doesn t exist in both languages we get a nil

24233499
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller class is not designed to be used as a child of a uinavigationcontroller which might explain why you re seeing odd behaviour
if you absolutely need a tab bar within a uinavigationcontroller you ll probably have to roll your own

24234301
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that google-chrome was trying to use vlc media player plugin instead of windows media player plugin
i found out there is no way to use wmp plugin with the latest google-chrome if you are running windows 7 and your google-chrome browser is version 33 or newer the extension will not work have no idea what is wrong with firefox and wmp - on the settings page all the settings maps to the wmp but firefox also uses vlc plugin

24235790
sudo	passwd
you can do this by doing a second login from an admin to the user you would like to sudo as
you do not pass the passwd parameter but just the username

24240990
implements	extends
i guess what you want is to amend the collection interface with the operation withoutnulls and implements it accordingly but since you cannot add a new method to the existing collection classes you are out of luck
but since you often use your own collection implementations maybe you can extends your interfaces and provide some methods to convert regular collection classes to your own

24245263
swift	objective-c
in swift you should use closures and change your approach. however if you want to use performselector to dynamically call a method given only it s string signature altough it s not supported natively i ve found how to do it
it is possible to create a c alternative to performselector that works even on native swift classes non objective-c takes a selector from string however it s not so straightforward to implement a complete version of it and it s necessary to create the method in c

24245263
swift	objective-c
it is possible to create a c alternative to performselector that works even on native swift classes non objective-c takes a selector from string however it s not so straightforward to implement a complete version of it and it s necessary to create the method in c
in c we have dlsym a function that returns a pointer to a function given the char symbol. well reading this interesting post i ve learned a lot of interesting things about swift

24245668
jquery	scriptaculous
looks like jquery is not a valid library in grails 1.3.x library optional - the name of the library to include
either prototype scriptaculous yahoo or dojo you may want to make sure that your path is correct and you either have the grails jquery plugin installed or you have the library in your web-app js directory

24246232
super	implements
in other words the following would sit two levels down not one this would get moved into an inner shell where currentshell is an observable that holds the current shell inside the viewmodel of your super shell
you don t really have to implements multiple shells

24246412
padrino	ruby-on-rails
up from ruby-on-rails 4.0.2 activerecord does support the distinct method by the way so you won t have to resort to using a string if you can update your activerecord gem as padrino should not depend on it
after playing around with some similar code in one of my models i finally found this question as i got the same error message in ruby-on-rails 3.2 that was

24247672
swift	objective-c
from using swift with cocoa and objective-c section working with nil because objective-c does not make any guarantees that an object is non-nil swift makes all classes in argument types and return types optional in imported objective-c apis
before you use an objective-c object you should check to ensure that it is not missing

24248215
google-chrome	firefox
try adding the following rule to the css for some reason google-chrome s default styling of the input elmement creates some extra white space below the baseline
setting display block seems to fix the problem in google-chrome and does not break anything in firefox

24249584
elasticsearch	kibana
you could probably index your mongodb data in elasticsearch following instructions similar to but then you are unnecessarily duplicating your data in 2 systems
i m afraid that kibana is specifically designed to use the elasticsearch api. while they do both provide json responses they don t return compatible data structures and even if they did mongo would not provide the same features facets filters that kibana makes heavy use of

24255398
swift	objective-c
the only workaround at this time is to write a non-variadic wrapper in c or objective-c and call that from swift
according to the swift devs c variadic functions are not compatible with swift variadics so you won t be able to call it directly

24256609
implements	extends
i think the way you implements the region monitoring might cause some problems
here are the reasons - inside the startlocationtracking method your locationmanager is a local object that does not extends over the life cycle of that method

24256856
swift	objective-c
you can t use beta versions of xcode to submit to the app store though so if you do plan to submit before 8 comes out make sure your project is compatible with xcode 5 which means no swift
objective-c isn t going anywhere yet

24257392
alarmmanager	timertask
starting services regularly via alarmmanager as with activities the android system may terminate the process of a service at any time to save resources
for this reason you cannot simply use a timertask in the service to ensure that it is executed on a regular basis

24260318
gmail	hotmail
a gmail row matches the hotmail and yahoo rules individually and will therefore be returned in the results because of the or as any rules can be matched
you were nearly there just replace the or s with and s select name email from clients where email not like gmail and email not like hotmail and email not like yahoo

24264091
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division
that s not the same result you ll get if x is a double with the value 45.0 but it s still better than multiplying by 0.
the difference is between whether you do the multiplication first or the division first - and what the types of those operations are

24268907
base	fractions
floating values aren t always stored exactly -- they are instead stored as a base and exponent which for some numbers is stored exactly and others is not
any modifications to the float can cause a very small fractions to appear

24269391
sudo	passwd
but i was able to get around it by saying sudo full path to bundle exec ... in my case i m using rbenv so i had to sudo home renier .rbenv shims bundle exec ... that worked
to get sudo to not ask for a passwd you would need to configure your etc sudoers file for this

24269466
ssl	https
you might look a level deeper in the software stack and find that an https library might be building on top of an ssl library
in such a case even the https library does not need to know about sni

24270329
margin	text-align
there are many solutions to center a div two of them are using auto margins html css using absolute margins html is the same css as you can see you can t center a div vertically using auto top and bottom margins so if you want to center your div vertically you have to make a subtraction and add ½ of it to the top margin for example
another approach and not so recommended is setting the inner div s display atribute to inline-block and setting the container s text-align attribute to center

24270506
textview	imageview
also change your id of the last textview because it clashes with your id of description textview
instead of using a grid view why are you not using relative layout and set your layout relatively.your second problem is because your are setting your grid row one after another hence after setting the imageview it sets your textview txtcabindesc..try this following code snippet i have tried

24271763
comparator	comparable
so unless comparator always returns a value for two different object references equals should be overridden
from the javadoc for comparable it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings the ordering defined by comparable.compareto be consistent with equals

24272137
hex	binary
the code above actually allocates the varbinary field with a converted zero character hex code 0x30
this may not be what you actually want particularly if you want to perform binary operations on the field later

24274805
swift	objective-c
usually when accessing an objective-c api in swift you will see lots of these implicitly unwrapped optionals because pointers in objective-c can be nil
that means the variable must be optional but to make the api feel more like objective-c we want to treat it like it is not optional

24275825
google-chrome	firefox
first here are the differences using google-chrome - i ve added a red border to visually show that they re not top-aligned
and now when you view the two pages in firefox you see and again both of these were from firefox and show that they are both top-aligned

24278168
knitr	latex
knitr uses pdflatex to generate a pdf
pdflatex is a part of tex latex installation which is not an r package and cannot be installed using r terminal at least natively because installr can actually do this as indicated by gregor

24285248
rdf	owl
rdf isn t the database it s the data model
owl has a mapping to rdf but generally is used to define logical constructs that a reasoner can use to infer new information from existing data

24290437
decoder	encoder
now let me explain how the the decoder input buffer is not big enough error can happen
when libstreaming is used with the mode_mediacodec_api with a resolution that has never been used before on the user s phone it first tries to see if at least one encoder accessible through the mediacodec api is working properly at that resolution

24290437
decoder	encoder
the bug you are mentioning happens when a decoder has not been able to decoder the h264 stream produced by an encoder
if that test stops and no valid encoder decoder pair has been found the resolution is considered not supported on the phone

24291029
apache	nginx
my config nginx + php-fpm + mysql on a fresh centos 6.5 when installing php-fpm and nginx default permission on var lib php session is root apache php-fpm through nginx store php session here if nginx did not have authorization to write it fail miserably to keep any login session resulting in an infinite loop
so juste add nginx in apache group usermod -a -g apache nginx or change ownership of this folder

24291242
multiplying	multiplication
in order to multiplying each element in your vector with the chosen scalar that scalar must not only belong to num but also be the same type a
multiplication is defined on num a and num a 2 arguments of same type belonging to num typeclass

24293236
swift	objective-c
my experience is that swift therefore is not namespaced in the slightest
in turning one of my apps from objective-c to swift i created an embedded framework because it was so easy and cool to do

24294229
implements	extends
then i implements all of the custom drawing in the onpaint method
i m not sure about the intricacies of your exact form with all the controls on it but i ve implemented a base doublebufferablecontrol class from which you can extends it to create custom controls that are double buffered

24295100
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
read the documentation for uinavigationcontroller programming here
you should not be creating your own uinavigationbar and adding it as a subview to your view controller s view

24296328
bash	subshell
in a bash string you can do this and this but not this the ps1 variable is simply not exempt from this rule
note as mkelement0 explains in the comments this is because the part will be executed in a subshell so you could do though - it s just that the variable will only exist in that scope

24296605
subtraction	modulo	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
111oneone use gcc s -fwrapv this option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition subtraction and multiplication wraps around using twos-complement representation
1 - this rule does not apply to unsigned integer overflow as 3.9.1.4 says that unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

24296981
google-chrome	firefox
i had been using firefox to access the pages and when i tried the same page in google-chrome it loaded instantly
i could then go back to firefox and it again would not load. so there was something wrong at that point in time with the browser with respect to jenkins not sure quite what it was

24297220
inline	inlining
also causes the optimization to not happen even though std endl is inline
the inlining of std endl seems to affect the earlier part of the loop structure which i don t quite understand what it is doing but i ll post it here in case someone else does with original code and -o2 with mymanual inlining of std endl -o2 one difference between these two is that esi is used in the original and ebx in the second version

24299594
splinter	selenium
splinter is calling selenium wedriver self.find_by self.driver.find_elements_by_xpath it s yet another level of inception
i m not sure why they decided to do that instead of directly calling selenium in the first place

24300193
wildfly	jboss
but if you are going with the community version it wouldn t make sense to start with jboss 7 since wildfly 8 provides java ee 7 support jboss 7 not
i ve recently migrated a huge industry-strength project to wildfly and am very surprised by the new application server

24300276
namenode	hdfs
first make sure you format the namenode then start the namenode and datanodes run some basic hdfs commands such as hdfs dfs -put and hdfs dfs -get then you can start the jobtracker and tasktracker then and not earlier you can try to run some mapreduce job which uses hdfs
you need to run hadoop namenode -format as the hdfs-superuser

24301361
wildfly	jboss
when i downloaded wildfly i didn t run it in debug mode with attached jrebel agent which i was constantly doing with eap 6.1
if i start jboss eap 6.1 without jrebel the problem doesn t happen

24303256
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you can t do that in javascript the expression as a whole is either case-sensitive or not
you get a case-insensitive expression by using the i flag at the end so if your goal is to match a in lower case followed by b or b the expression would be i m sure your actual use case isn t that simple and so this is going to complicate things fairly significantly for your real expression but unfortunately there just isn t a way to start out being case-sensitive and then switch to being case-insensitive part-way through

24304366
factors	matrix
the package psych from i guess you are using principal has the rotations varimax quatimax promax oblimin simplimax and cluster but not equimax psych p.232 which is a compromise between varimax and quartimax excerpt from the stata manual mvrotate p.3 rotation criteria in the descriptions below the matrix to be rotated is denoted as a p denotes the number of rows of a and f denotes the number of columns of a factors or components
if a is a loading matrix from factor or pca p is the number of variables and f is the number of factors or components

24307086
build.gradle	gradlew
make sure its minimal and it does not contain activityname or launcher props build.gradle
may get diff results with diff gradlew versions but i ve done this on 1.10.

24309842
translation	localization
as deceze has pointed out using machine ids separates source strings from translation and can avoid such problems
although this is how many other localization platforms work it is not really how gettext is intended to work square peg round hole etc. perhaps worth mentioning though is that you can use extracted comments feature to convey further information to translators

24309915
viewmodel	caliburn
still although the viewmodel do not know each other this gives a way to exchange data between them
personally i have used the caliburn micro mvvm framework several times for this but there should be enough other mvvm frameworks that provide the same functionality to fit your taste

24310298
bash	zsh
if you want to do it in bash without using a | then it s not possible
if you want to do it in zsh without using a | then just follow chepner s comment do setopt multios and then

24314661
nsorderedset	nsset
note also that although nsorderedset understands many of the same messages as both nsset and nsarray it is not a subclass of either
as of os x 10.7 and ios 5.0 you can use nsorderedset

24315456
swift	objective-c
again eliminating guesswork would be a good bug to file . you can read more about this in using swift with cocoa and objective-c
anyway in this case you can probably expect that ikimageview is not incrementing the retain count of the cgimage when providing it so you can unwrap the unmanaged like so also note you don t need the ref suffix when working with cf types in swift

24315794
debian	centos
checking using dpkg is unfriendly to people trying to install your package on a distro that s not a debian derivative
maybe they are running centos or fedora or arch or gentoo.

24318140
realloc	malloc
c11 7.22.3.3 ... otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
malloc family function allocates memory and then returns pointer to that block

24318476
required	placeholder
the specification says if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1
and if the value of the first option element in the select element s list of options if any is the empty string and that option element s parent node is the select element and not an optgroup element then that option is the select element s placeholder label option

24318476
required	placeholder
if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1 then the select element must have a placeholder label option
in the original code there was no placeholder label option because the first option s value was not the empty string

24318517
ethernet	wireless
make sure you have two sufficiently fast ethernet cards
you ll set your wireless router to not do nat because pfsense will be doing that then you can get to work setting up your vpn server etc

24320973
setinterval	settimeout
furthermore a setinterval callback with heavy load could end up in an unresponsive script or even hole system
recursive settimeout immediate before return from function will not be executed if any exception hasn t been caught

24324500
spaces	delimiter
since the source text file doesn t follow delimiter format standard you need to use script task and write custom script to handle all those white spaces and bad data
you need to convert text file into some delimiter format then it can be processed as per requirement

24327322
hex	binary
and the best thing underscores do also work for normal numbers and hex literals the only constraint of the underscore is that of course a number cannot start with it
binary literals will make enumerations and bit vectors a little bit easier to understand and handle

24327949
super	implements
you re calling the constructor of the class testnull which it calls the super constructor it contains a call to the method implements in testnull where you print the string field at this time the fields of the sub-class testnull are not yet initialized are null
after the super constructor call all the fields will be initialized and therefore the second print actually show the new value of the initialized string

24328568
xslt	schematron
looking on github the xrouters schematron projects is using a very old version of the standard xslt stylesheets from
these are xslt 1.0 stylesheets and are not capable of generating xslt 2.0 stylseheets

24328927
war	manifest.mf
warfile.war in case warfile.war already exists although you ve written i need to create a war file the attribute will be of use by only updating and not overwriting the file
you can use task with .war extension for destfile attribute to achieve the same result as the task without manifest.mf

24330325
implements	extends
the point of the abstract class here is that for a class to not throw errors if extends the abstract class it must implements a function sayhello
that way whoever ever makes a class extends base_version won t break the program because objects will all have at the very least those functions defined as abstract in the base class

24330575
listview	gridview
works just like a listview minus footer n header and with a numcolumns parameter
i cannot use gridlayout so use gridview link available since api 1

24331280
libstdc++	libc++
this is c++11 header that is not available in the libstdc++ version that is available on mac
note that it is not advisable to link cuda runtime library with libc++ so you should avoid these features in cuda code

24331876
ng-show	ng-class
perhaps ng-show isn t breaking the animation it might be revealing the graphic after the animation has finished
maybe you could try using ng-class on all the class attributes using ifs that depend on a scoped boolean that you set after scope.data has been filled

24332503
swift	objective-c
swift protocols don t map as types into objective-c
you can t say this in objective-c that s illegal because printable a protocol isn t a type

24332503
swift	objective-c
so your swift function defined that way doesn t magically map upward into objective-c as it has nothing to map to
it is filtered out and objective-c never sees it

24332503
swift	objective-c
i was afraid that a swift class that uses any non-objective-c features wouldn t map to an objective-c class at all
but on the contrary you can use all the pure-swift features you like and they simply don t map up into objective-c they are cleanly filtered out and those parts of your swift class that do map into objective-c work just fine from objective-c

24333229
paperclip	fog
paperclip supports 3 storage methods file storage aws s3 storage native support fog storage fog is a cloud based abstraction library which allows you to interface with a number of different cloud based storage and other service provides
box cloud storage is not currently supported by fog

24333834
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
d refer a b c e again this is a wrong comparison nsurlsession is not replacement or equivalent for nsoperationqueue it is replacement for nsurlconnection
f nsurlsession enables to use ios7 background fetch mode with a background session configuration if your question is about general background task execution in ios7 you can perform a task in background for 180.0 seconds

24337144
swift	objective-c
for example if you subclass pfquerytableviewcontroller and type tableview on a new line all the standard uitableviewcontroller protocol methods appear as autocomplete in addition to the pfquerytableviewcontroller-specific method however this isn t really a parse-specific issue and will probably improve with new releases of swift xcode
there is definitely some support for autocompleting bridged objective-c libraries into swift but it s not perfect yet

24337891
swift	objective-c
there probably aren t many tutorials for swift os x development yet but the cocoa frameworks that you re working with are the same regardless of your choice of swift vs
objective-c

24338964
apache	nginx
php-fpm can be run with apache and in fact this allows you to take advantage of apache s more efficient worker mpm or event in apache 2.4
however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx

24338964
apache	nginx
however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx
disadvantages of moving to nginx - not many but things to keep in mind it does not support .htaccess files

24338964
http	spdy
http proxy and web server features ability to handle more than 10 000 simultaneous connections with a low memory footprint 2.5 mb per 10k inactive http keep-alive connections handling of static files index files and auto-indexing reverse proxy with caching load balancing with in-band health checks fault tolerance nginx uses very little memory especially for static web pages
fastcgi scgi uwsgi support with caching name- and ip address-based virtual servers ipv6-compatible spdy protocol support flv and mp4 streaming web page access authentication gzip compression and decompression url rewriting having its own rewrite engine custom logging with on-the-fly gzip compression response rate and concurrent requests limiting bandwidth throttling server side includes ip address-based geolocation user tracking webdav xslt data processing embedded perl scripting nginx is highly scalable and performance is not dependent on hardware

24339133
mongodb	bson
gridfs gridfs is not software or a special function of mongodb
it is in fact a specification for functionality to be implemented by available drivers for the sole intent of enabling you to store content that exceeds the 16mb bson storage limit

24341846
inline	inlining
the virtual calls are not inline and require an indirection through the table of virtual methods and virtually ensured cache miss
the lack of inlining actually requires full function stubs with parameters passed through the stack

24343896
svg	vml
however reading this one or this one posted over a year later it sounds like that is no longer the case because of versions of ie before 9 not supporting svg canvas
in openlayers 2 ie support for older browsers is done via vml and is one of the only parts of the code base where there is browser detection

24346873
uialertview	uialertcontroller
apple s policy of not changing the appearance of an uialertview does not affect the presenting view controller
i see no reason why you shouldn t be able to subclass the uialertcontroller

24349366
express	node.js
it looks like your code is using express which would normally be good for building and api for your app
however to make a simple request to a third party api and staying in node.js why not try the request module which is great

24350789
rspec	capybara
rspec 3 does not include the capybara matchers in controller specs by default
you can change this for an individual spec by doing include capybara rspecmatchers or in your spec helper your next issue is that recent versions of capybara don t allow you to test for the presence of invisible elements by default and the title element is considered to be invisible

24352144
uilabel	nsstring
i once was had the same issue so i was very thoroughly scanning the docs of uilabel but i didn t find an option that would allow achieving this on the level of the uilabel -api so i also ended up modifying the resulting nsstring so i guess that s not possible
putting the modifications into a cateogry for uilabel uilabel+capitalization.h in the end worked quite well for me so that every time the label was modified i could call something like was quite convenient

24352936
daemons	systemd
in apple s daemons and services programming guide adding login items there are two ways to add a login item using the service management framework and using a shared file list
login items installed using the service management framework are not visible in systemd preferences and can only be removed by the application that installed them

24353916
strncmp	memcmp
the strncmp function is similar except it compares the only first at most n bytes of s1 and s2
note that strncmp in this case cannot be replaced with a simple memcmp because you still need to take advantage of its stop-on-nul behavior in case one of the strings is shorter than n

24353916
strncmp	memcmp	strncmp	strcmp	memcmp	strcmp
note that strncmp in this case cannot be replaced with a simple memcmp because you still need to take advantage of its stop-on-nul behavior in case one of the strings is shorter than n
if strcmp causes a buffer overrun then one of two things is true your data isn t expected to be nul-terminated and you should be using memcmp instead

24354185
uiview	subviews
that s because the compiler has inferred cell to be of type uiview and indexpathforcell expects an uitableviewcell
you can explicitly cast it to an uitableviewcell as below however this is not a reliable way to get a cell or its indexpath from one of its subviews the uitextfield in your case

24354338
fiddler	charles
thanks to haspemulator s answer i started to follow the steps of this blog with fiddler i had problems with the certificate frequently it was asking me to add the certificate to the emulator even after installing it successfully moreover i was only able to see https traffic of the browser but not the traffic in-app
the same happened using another program as charles i only saw the browser traffic

24355634
udp	tcp
if the tcp connection was established from intern to outside you have to do the same with udp otherwise the nat device will not establish a connection for the udp connection and thus packets from the peer will not be sent to you
there will be no tunnel for udp just because you have a successful tcp connection. you have to establish the udp connection the same way you got the tcp connection

24355648
swift	objective-c
in swift you create an immutable array with and a mutable array with mutable arrays can be modified just like nsmutablearray however you can t pass a mutable array to a function but the above code does work with an nsmutablearray you can achieve nsmutablearray s behaviour by using an inout method parameter re-wrote this answer 2015-08-10 to reflect the current swift behaviour
swift does not have any drop in replacement for nsarray or the other collection classes in objective-c

24361050
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining
if any of the method s formal arguments are structs the method will not be inline

24362291
equals	gethashcode
the rule is that if equals returns true then gethashcode must return the same value but not the other way around
consider this gethashcode returns an int

24363573
implements	extends
i believe that the best way to implements your requirement is to create a new template that extends base.html and includes left1.html and right1.html
something like this extends base.html block left_panel include left1.html endblock content block right_panel include right1.html endblock update based on op s comment actually you just need one configurable template not 100

24364556
inline	inlining
if after inspecting the core and profiling you determine that certain functions are not inline when they could be you can use inlinable or inline to increase the liklihood of inlining occuring
recall that the major effect of an inline pragma is to declare a function s cost to be very low

24364978
noexcept	throw
as a consequence i think it would be an error to assume that c linkage implies noexcept
as far as i can tell there is no guarantee that function defined with c linkage will not throw exceptions

24366843
namenode	hdfs
you are correct about the secondary namenode however when running a standby namenode you should not have a secondary namenode
the reasoning is explained in the hardware resources 1 section on the hdfs ha page s

24368223
setinterval	settimeout
this is the classic closure problem each function you re passing into setinterval has an enduring reference to i not a copy of it and so sees the same value of i the value it has after the loop when it runs
you also don t want to use setinterval here you want settimeout

24370031
amd	umd
why import is not working - the reason you are not able to import the package is because sockjs uses some kind of umd syntax for amd
they do the following check to see if it can use the amd syntax

24370920
ubuntu	linux
on linux distributions with up-to-date gdb i ve tried with the juno release and luna m6 release versions of cdt packaged eclipse on ubuntu 14.04 comes with gdb-7.7 and it worked straight away out of the box
on linux distributions with gdb versions older than 7.5.1 if your distribution does not provide gdb it is fortunately easy to build. you can download the source from and just need to follow the instructions in the readme files

24372036
bower	npm
everyone seems to have trouble because they are installing bower outside their public folder
the solution here is simple install bower in your public directory not your app node master directory for example mynodeapp public - npm install bower then set up bower from this directory bower init create your .bowercc file and add to it directory vendor where vendor is your custom fldr thats it

24372036
bower	npm
the solution here is simple install bower in your public directory not your app node master directory for example mynodeapp public - npm install bower then set up bower from this directory bower init create your .bowercc file and add to it directory vendor where vendor is your custom fldr thats it
now whenever you run a bower install command from within the public directory it will either create or save to that vendor directory

24372240
shadowing	named
for example belongs_to to class_name message as it currently stands the accessor methods generated for the association are shadowing the accessor method for the attribute
the named of the association the first argument to belongs_to should not be the same as the named of the column that contains the foreign key

24372352
swift	objective-c
that is why when translating from objective-c all pointers must become optionals in swift
the usefulness of this knowledge is right in the description you gave optionals of any type can be set to nil not just object types in swift all types can be made optional and therefore nil

24372352
swift	objective-c
the usefulness of this knowledge is right in the description you gave optionals of any type can be set to nil not just object types in swift all types can be made optional and therefore nil
for example in objective-c you cannot make an nsinteger nil

24372853
lxml	beautifulsoup
you cannot use regexes in the xpath expressions using lxml since lxml supports xpath 1.0 and xpath 1.0 doesn t support regular expression search
instead you can find all the links on a page using iterlinks iterate over them and check the href attribute value an alternative option would be to use beautifulsoup html parser to make beautifulsoup parsing faster you can let it use lxml also you can make use of a soupstrainer class that lets you parse only specific web page parts instead of a whole page

24373564
webclient	httpwebrequest
using webclient using tcpclient you will need to use tcpclient class for what you want to do
httpwebrequest does not provide the level access you need to the underlying stream and connection

24374406
direct3d	directx
. many of the directx headers and libraries are included with these windows xp compatible platform headers see directx sdks of a certain age such as direct3d 9 directsound and directinput
you will however need to continue to use the legacy directx sdk for windows xp compatible versions of the d3dcompile api #43 legacy d3dx9 xaudio2 xinput and pix for windows tool the visual studio 2012 graphics debugger does not support direct3d 9 applications

24374406
direct3d	directx
there are older direct3d 10 and direct3d 11 headers as part of this 7.1 era toolset which are outdated compared to the windows 8.x sdk versions using the standard v110 platform toolset particularly the sdk debug layers installed by the windows 8.0 sdk on windows 7 and windows 8
the platform toolset v110_xp is therefore not recommended for developing directx 11 applications but it can technically be done with some caution

24374625
postgresql	mysql
postgresql does not support loose scan which mysql is able to use for queries like this
it s the using index for group-by you re seeing on the mysql plan

24374724
swift	objective-c
the only workaround at this time is to write a non-variadic wrapper in c or objective-c and call that from swift
according to the swift devs c variadic functions are not compatible with swift variadics so you won t be able to call your function directly

24375632
multiplying	division
it s not clear how you are going to handle null values - it definitely makes no sense to multiplying by null so i just use zero instead of null such values will not affect sum keep in mind - when you apply division operator on two integers integer division is used
if item1 value is less than 100 this division will produce 0 as result

24376716
inline	inlining
however the clr team has blogged about when methods are eligible to be inline though this is of course pre-ryujit
note that the c# compiler doesn t ever inline the methods - the inlining happens during the jit compilation phase

24377161
strcpy	strncpy
sizeof char is always 1 the strcpy function finishes after writing strlen label +1 bytes so it is redundant to try and use strncpy
strncpy is fairly dangerous in general because sometimes it does not output a string

24380012
required	placeholder
since this obviously depends on the form element being although it s not clear to me why you need a data-required attribute in addition to the standard required you may need to add an extra span element after the input and style that element using a sibling selector rather than using a pseudo-element
the issue is not with the placeholder but the fact that you are trying to apply a before pseudo-element to an input which isn t supported cross-browser because it s not defined within the standards

24383470
oncreate	setcontentview
edit i have refactored and improved your code you really should not have so many different methods for everything all the setup belongs in oncreate that you write extra methods for each step just introduces the possibility for additional errors
try this as you can see i use an abstract method called getlayout to pass the correct layout to setcontentview

24390064
g++	gcc
you compiler g++ in this case is not finding the header files due to them being in a non-standard location
you need to use the -i flag to tell gcc where to look for the include files

24390731
onresume	onpause
6 the mysterious part which is my theory after a bit of tinkering some part of bringing the old task to the foreground continues to interact with mainactivity the root of the old task during its onresume call
this interaction causes the helloactivity s onpause method to be triggered probably not intended by the os developers

24390976
junit	testng
i prefer it to junit for this reason
converting to testng is easy since it basically supports pretty much everything in junit there s a converter plugin for eclipse even converting back to junit is not so great because of these missing features

24390976
junit	testng
converting to testng is easy since it basically supports pretty much everything in junit there s a converter plugin for eclipse even converting back to junit is not so great because of these missing features
in testng beforeclass methods are not static and execute before the tests in that class run rather than when the test class is loaded the junit behavior

24390976
junit	testng
in testng beforeclass methods are not static and execute before the tests in that class run rather than when the test class is loaded the junit behavior
i once had a junit project where all of the database tests a few dozen initialized the database right at the start which was quite idiotic behavior

24390976
junit	testng
junit does not by design which is annoying
testng data providers are a bit more flexible than the junit equivalent

24391903
bash	subshell
bash is a subshell resource when you use the bash or any execute resource you are executing in a subshell so things like source or export are not persisted to the parent process
there are a few things here your not_if is wrong you are confusing ruby and bash here

24392586
swift	objective-c
first check that you filled the class in the data model as projectname.addrbook for swift classes you have to specify even the project name
note this is needed only if you haven t used the prefix objective-c addrbook before the class but i see that you used it so this is not the problem

24394285
implements	extends
inheritance only happens via extends not via implements
when you define a class implements several interfaces you are not saying it will be an extension of those interfaces but it will have the same behavior and behavior at least in java doesn t define inheritance

24394285
implements	extends
when you define a class implements several interfaces you are not saying it will be an extension of those interfaces but it will have the same behavior and behavior at least in java doesn t define inheritance
for java to support multiple inheritance it would need to support something like public class mi extends object myotherclass which java can t

24396521
swift	objective-c
one other observation if you re using mogenerator with it s new swift generation options then the entitywithname approach becomes much easier you can just add to each of your user modifiable class files not the _ one and it should be fine since mogenerator generates an entityname class method
you can use nsstringfromclass as long as you make sure that your model classes have non-mangled names by using objective-c modelclassname another option which is more work for you might be something like however since your model objects are required to have nsmanagedobject as a superclass trying to avoid binding to objective-c is really kind of pointless

24397388
ng-switch	ng-show
don t use ng-switch just use ng-show or ng-if
here s a plunker edit okay i guess if you really want you can use ng-switch though i would suggest not doing it if all you re doing is checking true false

24398198
factors	mean
tools like automapper the solution you choose depends on factors like how often you do this how many callers need this etc
same name doesn t mean they re of the same types

24398555
scheme	racket
full disclosure i m the owner of the repo and i m a scheme noob
the code in the repo is womm certified but your mileage may vary. if on the other hand you re not content to use bigloo gambit mit-scheme it shouldn t be too hard to add support for guile racket insert-favorite-scheme-here

24398760
dictionary	map
in your situation where you want to do an in-place modification to the dictionary in your list i think a for-loop will be best
usually map is not the right tool to use in python unless the function you re applying already exists a builtin like int or a method of some existing object

24398801
draggable	droppable
looks like we can simply append the draggable item accessed via the ui.draggable to the list associated with the droppable item in this drop event handler but it s not such simple
this is not the right place to append the draggable item because there are some stages after that may append the draggable item back to the original list when the dropping target is not a valid sortable list so the appending will fail

24401436
rar	zip
note console version rar.exe supports only creation extraction of rar archives
it does not support zip archives

24406046
spaces	delimiter
that is why this exception is thrown in case of using spaces with hello world 3rd token is of type string instead of double
a scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern which by default matches whitespace and inputmismatchexception is thrown if the next token does not match the integer string double .

24407692
serializable	deserialization
let s say in a next iteration baseclass adds some property of its own the foo property and assume that we want that property de- serializable
you would probably implement the necessary code for deserialization in the baseclass serializationinfo streamingcontext constructor in your current setup when deserializing finalclass the foo property of baseclass would not be deserialized since you decided to call the this string filename string password constructor instead of base serializationinfo streamingcontext constructor

24411343
udp	tcp
with udp you cannot send messages bigger than 64kb
use tcp or split the payload yourself into multiple messages which will be extremely complex because messages can be lost

24412004
division	modulo
div - arithmetic operator division alternative to ge - relational operator greater or equal to alternative to lt - relational operator less than alternative to null - null literal empty - the empty operator is a prefix operation that can be used to determine whether a value is null or empty
gt - relational operator greater than alternative to mod - arithmetic operator modulo alternative to or - logical operator alternative to || eq - logical operator alternative to instanceof - java keyword to do a class comparison between objects ne - relational operator not equal alternative to

24412425
matlab	simulink
the rand being called from your matlab fcn block is not the same rand as would be called from matlab hence the reason why rng shuffle
has no effect on simulink s random number generation

24413907
vim	atom-editor
as ruud again also pointed out one solution might be to use vim
there s an interesting example in documentation for this regex atom-editor should match abc in abc abc but i couldn t make this example work seems to me that 1 remains empty

24416023
swift	objective-c
in swift where anyclass is defined as anyobject.type
types in swift are not objects and thus are not directly equivalent to class objects in objective-c

24416023
swift	objective-c
types in swift are not objects and thus are not directly equivalent to class objects in objective-c
however if you intend to use an objective-c api from swift it will have been bridged to expect anyclass anyway so you have to pass a type

24419007
udp	tcp
i m unfamiliar with udp connections so i really don t know where to begin designing the server. udp can be lower latency but sometimes it is far more important that packets aren t dropped in a game
if it makes any difference to you world of warcraft uses tcp

24419967
clang	llvm
apple s xcode comes with clang which is probably what you d want to use for this and macports also supplies a number of clang distributions
is a clang not gcc option and tells clang to use llvm libc++ standard library which is what clang uses rather than gnu libstdc++ which is what gcc uses

24419967
clang	llvm	libstdc++	libc++
is a clang not gcc option and tells clang to use llvm libc++ standard library which is what clang uses rather than gnu libstdc++ which is what gcc uses
since you got linking errors it seems likely that other packages you are using were compiled with clang and libc++ which is not abi compatible with gcc s libstdc++ except for some low-level stuff

24419967
libstdc++	libc++
since you got linking errors it seems likely that other packages you are using were compiled with clang and libc++ which is not abi compatible with gcc s libstdc++ except for some low-level stuff
so you ll need to compile the package with clang and libc++ as well

24422523
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome iframes and onload -note- you only need to keep reading if you are interested in how to setup a ui blocker when doing uploading downloading currently google-chrome doesn t trigger the onload event for the iframe when it s used to transfer files
firefox ie and edge all fire the onload event for file transfers

24423646
implements	extends
you could give a look at default methods if you are working with java 8 which essentially are methods declared within interfaces and in java a class can implements multiple interfaces
in java you cannot have a class which extends from two classes since it doesn t support multiple inheritance

24424392
google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
google-chrome webkit engine shows it in am pm
firefox gecko engine doesn t show anything but validates

24425341
mp4	h.264
inside the mp4 container is video stream data generally encoded in the h.264 format and audio stream data often encoded in the aac format
the client player can interact with it directly because the chromecast s browser has html5 video support for interpreting the mp4 container format and playing back the h.264 video and aac audio but it isn t streaming in the way that term is often used .

24428086
swift	objective-c
arrays in swift work differently than they do in objective-c
in swift you can t create an array that has pre-allocated memory but does not contain elements

24430688
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
-webkit- is only supported by safari google-chrome opera 15+
therefore your code will not work in ie or firefox

24431495
wildfly	undertow
in fact it looks like this is a wildfly issue see wfly-3474 - npe in httpservletresponse.getheaders
upgrading to a recent undertow version 1.1.0.beta2 + solves that specific exception but creates a bigger problem since spring framework websocket module does not yet support this beta version

24432051
implements	extends
there are some points to consider for this interface give you option to your class to extends with other class.as you know you can not extends multiple class but you can implements multiple interface to achieve multiple inherited
by extends class you can not force subclassing to override method define in the super-class.while in implementation of interface force to implements your method in subclassing

24434027
clang	llvm
i am not sure if you have tried more than what you have listed but here is more information on clang unused options using its gcc compatibility first here is what the documentation suggests -wextra -wunused-but-set-parameter the following is background reference information from here if you are using the llvm-gcc or apple llvm compiler build option there are a large number of possible compiler warnings that you can enable disable
the clang front end also supports the gcc diagnostic warnings see for backwards compatibility

24437983
queue	fifo
if you want to limit the number of scheduled but not yet processed work items you would limit the size of the fifo queue
in a typical producer-consumer relationship producers and consumers are disconnected from each other and communicate through some shared data structure such as a fifo queue

24440708
pyenv	virtualenv
what helped is that i looked through the function and saw this what isn t covered is that when you create a virtualenv in pyenv it shows up as a version
so when you do pyenv versions you get a list of your pythons -with- your virtual environments

24440845
dictionary	map
you might even say there s no such thing as key order in a dictionary there are implementation of dictionary that preserve order though if the order in which you display them to the end user is important in a ui table you ll have to get the keys of your object order them and then go through your object with each key to get the value you want library has keys and sort utils for you to use
ordinarily the dictionary map key-value data structure doesn t store or care about the order of the keys

24440845
dictionary	map
ordinarily the dictionary map key-value data structure doesn t store or care about the order of the keys
two dictionary with the same key-values but in different orders are considered identical

24442709
awt	swing
i would not bother with learning awt if you learn swing you are learning awt for the most part
the largest difference with swing vs awt is swing components start with the letter j

24442959
spaces	delimiter
actually the scan function will remove spaces or tabs if they are not specified as the delimiter from any value that is not a character as it process the input stream
once it has the cleaned the value of spaces then it uses the same function as as.numeric to turn that value into a number

24443092
vim	emacs
if a terminal doesn t have true arrow keys -- defining the arrow keys as escaped versions of vim s h j k and l keys might be a reasonably compatible solution as long as it doesn t conflict with other programs which might want to use those input escape sequences for other things
i don t use emacs and other popular programs which might want those escape sequences for something so if anyone else knows which if any programs would have problems with that solution a comment would be appropriate

24443680
noexcept	throw
the noexcept keyword promises that the method will not throw an exception
if you break that promise it your program will throw a runtime exception

24445330
implements	extends
an interface can extends another java interface only an abstract class can extends another java class and implements multiple java interfaces
a java class can implements multiple interfaces but it can extends only one abstract class. interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated

24446393
implements	extends
i think the code was pretty clean though i didn t made unit tests - i tested it with dig and it took about a week understanding dns protocol + implements + documentation
if anyone would want to extends it i guess it would not be very difficult. because i think it only supported inverse queries as that was asked in the exercise

24447638
client-side	server-side
you can just embed it it runs client-side so php doesn t even have anything to do with it php just runs on the server like ruby on rails
edit just realised it s not just very hard to write a game in php it s impossible since it s a server-side tech and the game engine would need to run in the browser

24448137
implements	extends
the right way to get the session map in an interceptor is note be careful in messing with actions and interceptors together it s strange to see an interceptor implements actionsupport.
it s not a problem with your code because you are using declarative xml configuration but convention plugin would scan the packages luckily you have a package with an unmatching name for classes extends actionsupport and would detect it as an action making it threadlocal that is not what an interceptor has meant to be

24450629
rspec	capybara
the new spec_helper.rb is the same standard helper generated by running rspec --init
this change was made to accomplish two general goals keep the installation process in sync with regular rspec changes provide an out-of-the-box way to avoid loading rails for those specs that do not require it this second point got me thinking about the fact that a feature spec for capybara would need to load the application stack

24451359
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval should not be used here because it could lead to simultaneous execution of the same task
use settimeout instead

24451898
dbcontext	objectcontext
a side effect of this was that many of the namespaces for entity framework has changed the namespaces for dbcontext and code first types have not changed. this means for many applications that use ef 4.1 or later you will not need to change anything
types like objectcontext that were previously in system.data.entity.dll have been moved to new namespaces

24456179
mp4	webm
the problem is likely that the browsers are not supporting mp4 because it is a proprietary format
to get the best cross-browser support you ll have to also encode your video in webm and ogg vorbis formats and then add those files to your video tag with their own source tags

24457397
swift	objective-c
note that swift does have a full implementation of generics
objective-c does not have generics so nsarray and nsmutablearray are not strongly typed in the way you desire

24459222
google-chrome	firefox
could not read google-chrome manifest in the installation directory is because the platform supports having a manifest in the installation directory but firefox doesn t use this capability anymore
the service.metrics.provider ones are related to the performance metrics firefox collects and may send to mozilla if you opted-in

24460012
profiling	debugging
i think this is what you are looking for this way you have one common build tag and two profiling each profiling specified whether to debugging or not via the properties tag
then when building you specify your profiling like this -pdevelopment or -prelease

24466416
oncreate	setcontentview
in web view you can use method in oncreate you put that code if work than vote up.. thanks
you not set your view setcontentview r.layout.activity_main

24468241
primes	modulus
this is achieved by modifying the lines where these are defined and adjusted note that you can vectorize the loop which determines that a value is primes with code such as this using that instead of for gets me to 451249 a significant regression using no cat and using integer arithmetic
this is because r does not have lazy list evaluation so the modulus is taken for every value then they are tested against 0

24470626
daemons	systemd
on nix platforms you can achieve this by using visudo command and appending however it is not recomended to give web server user right to do such thing and you perhaps should question that solution with restarting mysql daemons
exec will do the job only if systemd user that runs php usually www-data has rights to restart mysql daemons

24470937
implements	extends
now we can implements the widgetfactory as an enum thus in general having polymorphic behaviour on enum can be extremely powerful
an enum cannot extends another class because an enum already

24472375
.htaccess	httpd.conf
even though mod-rewrite is enabled by default it is not enabled for .htaccess files
hold your breath open xampp control panel stop apache click the config button on the apache row and select httpd.conf in that file search for something like a bit lower you may see a line like this # allowoverride all

24473151
factors	mean
however interaction is made to create factors interactions and will work on any factors as will if the inputs are already factors -- interaction coerces its input to factors
does not mean to sort it means to increment trailing factors faster in this case this setting means the each value of

24473183
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and opera are saying uncaught typeerror cannot set property color of undefined
firefox is saying the same but in more details and finally even ie11 has the same opinion script5007 unable to set property color of undefined or null reference

24473193
implements	extends
classpathxmlapplicationcontext is a subclass of configurableapplicationcontext which means it implements closable
applicationcontext does not extends closeable so the closable#close method cannot be invoked on any reference of type applicationcontext

24476253
serializable	deserialization
i might misinterpret your problem but i why don t you put all the thing you want to save in a class and do it like this plus if you use class your data transportation and management will be much easier serializable deserialization note the need-to-be-saved field should have property because the tag in the xml will mimic the property name
additional note froggamedata is not different than a normal class for automatic serializable like this

24476828
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari

swift	objective-c
initwithcoder is called when a view or view controller is instantiated from a storyboard or nib file and overriding that method works in objective-c but the equivalent swift code fails with the error message must call a designated initializer of the superclass uitextview
this problem occurs with all subclassing of uiview that have a their own designated initializer uitextview uicollectionview . on the other hand the problem does not occur with subclassing of uilabel which does not have a designated initializer. the swift language is very strict about calling the super classes designated initializer but there should be a way to override initwithcoder for all custom uiview subclassing so i consider this a swift bug

24480370
thin	webrick
thin does not have these problems which made it superior - already in development
webrick also can t handle longer uri s if they exceed 2083 chars you ll see a crash

24480757
swift	objective-c
no it s not strongly typed as you could expect swift native observation system to be
using swift with cocoa and objective-c | key value observing no currently there is no builtin value observation system for arbitrary swift objects

unused non-existent directories passed through gcc g++ are just ignored
i tried to manually run the 1st g++ which ran file and created myfun.o file but when i tried to manually run the 2nd g++ it gave me an error saying that it couldn t find the tmp.def file

24484003
prepare	execute
also emulated prepares doesn t actually do anything in the prepare step it just saves the query string
when you execute you supply values and they are interpolated into the query and then submitted to mysql

24484221
shadowing	named
this code doesn t work because there s already a click native method and shadowing it prevents the normal click event handling
give it another named and it will work

24484289
swift	objective-c
in the second case you are not including objective-c from apple doc a swift class or protocol must be marked with the objective-c attribute to be accessible and usable in objective-c
this attribute tells the compiler that this piece of swift code can be accessed from objective-c.if your swift class is a descendant of an objective-c class the compiler automatically adds the objective-c attribute for you

24485815
sudo	passwd
new script name home quaser restart-apache.sh use visudo add at bottom of the file now in your script change sudo service apache restart to sudo home quaser restart-apache.sh and you should not be asked for a passwd
the problem is that your script uses sudo at some point

24487765
super	extends
make a super test class containing the method annotated with beforeclass
extends all the test classes from this class eg this method will run before any beforeclass annotated method in the subclasses source . ensure that this method name is not used in any subclass to prevent shadowing

24488938
swift	objective-c
for example the swift initializer init foo int bar int translates to objective-c as - instancetype initwithfoo nsinteger foo bar nsinteger bar and the selector would be selector initwithfoo bar
the swift method func authentication viewcontroller gtmoauth2viewcontrollertouch finishedwithauth gtmoauth2authentication error nserror is exposed to objective-c as which means that the selector is selector authentication finishedwithauth error generally the first parameter name is not part of the selector

24488938
swift	objective-c
the swift method func authentication viewcontroller gtmoauth2viewcontrollertouch finishedwithauth gtmoauth2authentication error nserror is exposed to objective-c as which means that the selector is selector authentication finishedwithauth error generally the first parameter name is not part of the selector
the only exception are init methods where the first parameter name is merged into the objective-c method name

24489745
puma	unicorn
puma can spawn many workers and each worker can use many threads to process the request
unicorn does not have threads as far as i know it just has the worker model

24494622
set	bag
now the question is are you sure you don t mean a set
if you don t then are you using something like a bag surely there must be concrete instances which are not empty in the overall logic

24494864
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval timers can stack when the window doesn t have focus and then all run at once when it gets focus back again
using settimeout also ensures that you don t get multiple ajax requests queued up if the first one blocks for some reason

24497595
pickle	dill
if the person who serialized the object had label in their globals and there was a closure being serialized pickle includes everything in globals so it might not even be relevant but you d need it do unserialize the object
you could also ask for a re-pickle by a serializer that is more cautious about including globals like dill or cloudpickle

24497926
swift	objective-c
a swift array of structs packs its data together like a c array of structs not an objective-c nsarray of nsvalue -wrapped structs
and you can pass a swift array to obj c apis that take a cmutablepointer or similar so it s totally cool to construct an nsdata from a swift array

24499628
client-side	server-side
by default sessions are stored in a cookie in the client-side the user s browser s cookie
it is not stored on the server-side where the rails app is actually running. when you use the session hash rails is smart enough to look ask for the session information accordingly

24499959
implements	extends
solution 2 is more elegant but maybe you cannot use it because the someone doesn t want to implements the interface
solution 1 specify the method you want to use with a cast let iterablemap be the object that should be the parameter for the function and myspecialsetmap a instance of your special class or solution 2 create a new interface that extends and and implements this interface in the class that extends and

24500399
clang	llvm
i ran across a thread a week or so ago discussing alignment problems in sparc solaris clang and this may be one of the reasons clang isn t yet usable on this platform
as of the 3.4.2 release june 2014 llvm is missing code necessary to be able to generate object files for sparc targets

24501018
decimal	ieee
obviously that would not be the case if python truncated based on 15 decimal digits
instead it is picking the ieee 64-bit binary floating point number closest to the decimal literal with ties rounded to the one with a zero least significant fraction bit

24502401
mongodb	bson
the mongodb 2.6 improvements are that you are not pulling all the results out of the workoders collection into memory as an array so only each document is pulled in from the the cursor results
the bulk operations actions store the updates in manageable blocks that should fall under the 16mb bson limit and then you send this in those blocks instead of individual updates

24502412
lxml	elementtree
if you want an elementtree compatible library with full xpath support try lxml . elementtree does have support for xpath but not the way you are using it here
if you indeed do want to use elementtree you should provide an example of the html you are trying to parse so everybody has a notion of the structure

24503800
serializable	deserialization
since what you re injecting are also cdi beans it is not the beans themselves that get serializable but their lightweight proxies
upon deserialization the proxies dynamically resolve the correct beans for whatever scope they are

24504005
primes	modulus
but for x not relatively primes to n this is no longer true
in your example the base does have a common factor with your modulus namely 2

24505233
build.gradle	gradlew
locate build.gradle file in your project s root directory and change the version in buildscript block so it would look like this save the file and try to re-open your project
since your project is not being opened by the ide try to update gradlew plugin version manually

24505399
erlang	elixir
archives are basically a tar of compiled artifacts that the erlang runtime knows how to load
archives do not include dependencies and in elixir they are used only as plugins for the mix build tool

24505999
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
using the code above from terry young i found that in opera it would refuse to give the file a name simply calling it download and would not always work reliably
to get it to work i had to create a binary blob also note that creating the exportlink variable on the fly would not work with firefox so i had to have this in my html file using the above i have successfully tested this using windows 7 64bit and opera v22 firefox v29.0.1 and google-chrome v35.0.1916.153 m

24506668
gtk	cairo
so you have gcc -o gtktest gtktest.c pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0 if this isn t the problem try reinstalling gtk
update try to reinstall cairo because when you link with gtk+-3.0 you link with cairo. this is a gtk+ 2 tutorial for gtk+ 3 follow this tutorial

24514395
sudo	passwd
for security reasons sudo doesn t accept passwd on standard input by default
you should configure your sudoers file with a nopasswd tag for the commands you want to execute without prompting and invoke sudo with the -n flag to ensure that your script doesn t get hung up waiting for input

24514395
sudo	passwd
you should configure your sudoers file with a nopasswd tag for the commands you want to execute without prompting and invoke sudo with the -n flag to ensure that your script doesn t get hung up waiting for input
if you insist on passing in passwd see if your sudo supports the -s flag which on my system says -s the -s stdin option causes sudo to read the passwd from the standard input instead of the terminal device

24514611
union	distinct
as to the comment i don t understand why since neither of the main queries use a distinct a union executes a distinct on the resulting union results
union all will not

24519475
setcontentview	findviewbyid
move under setcontentview r.layout.type_layout
your buttons are not created when you try to find them using findviewbyid therefore you get a nullpointerexception

24519578
oncreate	setcontentview
your application crashes because of this line the crash occurs because you cannot find a view before the contentview has been set which happens in the oncreate ... method of your activity
move the initialization of glayout below the setcontentview ... call

24520269
client-side	server-side
large workloads require more complex logic for requests processing and it will consume more resources resulting in higher costs for maintaining the application the technologies used will usually involve more complexity than using just client side technologies c# asp.net mvc sql wcf etc vs javascript html and css pros for client-side technologies they are lightweight relatively and possibly easier to learn and use than server side technologies the response time can be faster than sending requests to a server provided the operation can be performed without using resources located remotely for example creating a chart and saving it as an image does not necessarily require you to send data to the server lots of platforms can be targeted since these technologies are supported by the majority of browsers for your specific case dom manipulation is faster when done in the client side ajax is the evidence of how much people hated postbacks and roundtrips to the server for trivial things
cons for client-side technologies trying to process some operations that are better suited for a server-side operation results in convoluted and sometimes unpractical solutions due to unavailability of things like access to the filesystem and other local machine resources html5 helps a lot in this with the addition of local storage local db and other resources for manipulating binary strings as data but the adoption levels for html5 browsers are still not where everyone want them

24521965
client-side	server-side
untested code but i believe this will solve your problem if it s caching as for continuing to get an error after redirecting the mistake you re making is not separating server-side from client-side execution of code
unless aborted the server-side code will continue to execute to the end

24526407
bower	npm
for example you can send a request for getting the bower package info curl -vv if npm install still fails look at the npm-debug.log and the artifactory log files for more info
the error message indicated that npm tried looking for a package named artifactory instead of bower artifactory is not in the npm registry this can happen due to various misconfiguration configuring the artifactory repository to use a wrong registry url like configuring npm to use a wrong registry url npm config set registry both cases will cause artifactory to send requests to the public registry with the following url instead of in order to make sure your setup is correct try the following click the test button in the artifactory edit remote repository window to verify that the registry url is correct and artifactory can reach it verify the registry url stored in the .npmrc configuration file

24537049
swift	objective-c
see also get a user-readable version of the class name in swift in objective-c nsstringfromclass was fine
swift does not have the introspection capabilities yet as objective-c does

24537653
implements	extends
3 the method setlistadapter topstoriesfragment.mycustomadapter is undefined for the type topstoriesfragment solved by extends listfragment instead of fragment. the solution to both this problem and the previous one is to store a reference to the listview when you first construct the fragment s view then you can set the adapter for listview directly 4 the method onlistitemclick listview view int long of type topstoriesfragment must override or implements a supertype method solved by adding public to the method you can explicitly set an onitemclicklistener for the listview to respond to item clicks you would then eliminate the method onlistitemclick from topstoriesfragment
your problems seem to be solvable by extends listfragment instead of fragment but you say that you cannot do that

24539233
hlsl	glsl
if you use cg hlsl shaders you compile to a specific hardware profile which describes the lower bound of the vertex geometry and pixel shaders
glsl does not target hardware profiles and will simply fail to compile the shader if the hardware in incapable of running it

24541814
bower	npm
it is an alternative to bower in the way it brings npm dependencies into your browser and it s apparently lighter
i didn t have the opportunity to compare in details bower and webmake but i noticed webmake doesn t work well with modules internally using global variables such as socket.io which is full of bloat anyway imo

24543259
ratingbar	textview
as zimeriljazia suggests making the ratingbar stick to the right and have the textview wrap to the left is easy with a relativelayout for the textview just alignparentright and for the ratingbar use
if you re just using the ratingbar for display not for input then you could use textview.setcompounddrawables or one of its cousins

24544271
union	distinct
the union can result in better performing subqueries which makes up for the increased computation for removing distinct values
if i understand correctly the logic without the function would be this might best be implemented as a union or union all a function call in the where clause is not going to optimize very well

24548148
ng-show	ng-class
if you need to toggle a class on an element not only show hide it you can use ng-class instead of ng-hide ng-show
ng-class automatically adds removes a class based on the truth value of a variable

24558615
inline	inlining
and if you look through the c++ standard you will see that most mentions of the inline keyword are discussing issues related to providing inline definitions implementing the function where it s declared instead of in a separate cpp file
pretty much any function whose definition is available to the compiler can be a candidate for function inlining which is not the same thing as inline definition

24558615
inline	inlining
the only times that function inlining is mentioned in the c++ standard is to make it clear that if the compiler chooses to inline a function it should not have any visible effect on the behavior of the code they are all remarks like this should be true even if the function is inline
the only relation between the inline keyword and function inlining is a suggestion in the standard that the keyword could also be considered as a hint that function inlining is desirable for that function because it often is but this is not a requirement and i believe many compilers ignore it completely when it comes to deciding whether to inline a function or not mostly because compilers don t need that hint they perfectly capable of making that choice on their own

24558615
inline	constexpr
the only relation between the inline keyword and function inlining is a suggestion in the standard that the keyword could also be considered as a hint that function inlining is desirable for that function because it often is but this is not a requirement and i believe many compilers ignore it completely when it comes to deciding whether to inline a function or not mostly because compilers don t need that hint they perfectly capable of making that choice on their own
that said the d1 variable in your example is being initialized with a call to a function which is not a constexpr function meaning that it cannot be required to be done statically

24561630
swift	objective-c
i m not sure why you can t just say the protocol conforms to anyobject perhaps that s a swift bug
you have to declare your thumbnailtableviewcelldelegate protocol as objective-c this is because iboutlet declares the variable as weak which only works with objects

24562371
swift	objective-c
for now you ll need to work around this by writing your own c objective-c functions methods that forward to the non-imported api and calling those from swift via a bridging header
glkvector2 is a union type and swift doesn t import those as of beta 2

24563670
pickle	dill
the class navigablestring is not serializable with pickle or cpickle which multiprocessing uses
you should be able to serialize this class with dill however

24564458
rdf	owl
so in your case i would save the ontology as rdf xml and then read it with jena
according to jena documentation here if you look at the read method it is clear that jena does not support owl xml

24565436
comparator	comparable
it just takes a class which implements comparable and creates the default comparator for it
no way around it -- you can t create a comparator for something that is not comparable

24565436
comparator	comparable
no way around it -- you can t create a comparator for something that is not comparable
you want treemap to require comparable but you can t because it is a valid case to use something that is not comparable as long as you have provided a comparator

24565447
comparator	comparable
i guess you have to implement comparable to use comparator.naturalorder in your class foo in your example. you must have a method comparator object o that method is the one that implements the natural order so you don t need to store it in a variable
i think you can use comparators in a class that doesn t implements the comparable interface at least in java 8 so they don t implements comparator object o but you have to implement this this is from the java 8 api a comparison function which imposes a total ordering on some collection of objects

24565447
comparator	comparable
i think you can use comparator in a class that doesn t implements the comparable interface at least in java 8 so they don t implements comparator object o but you have to implement this this is from the java 8 api a comparison function which imposes a total ordering on some collection of objects
comparator can be passed to a sort method such as collections.sort or arrays.sort to allow precise control over the sort order

24565968
decimal	ieee
when this value is printed unless otherwise stated is printed to 6 places past the decimal point which is 19.885099
float are typically implemented using the ieee 754-2008 the 32-bit base 2 format call binary32 as this format is based on powers-of-2 and not powers-of-10 the value of 19.8851 is not exactly representable

24566116
sudo	passwd
c after deleting those files above you can start to sudo to terminate processes i etc ssh sshpa which causes the creation of tmp .sshddxxxxxxxxxx etc .ssh2 etc sfewfesfs ii and to terminate processes tmp .sshddxxxxxxxxxx etc .ssh2 etc sfewfesfs d please delete these files immediately etc ssh sshpa tmp .sshddxxxxxxxxxx etc .ssh2 etc sfewfesfs and use htop to make sure they are not launched in the background anymore
e updating your system please don t forget to change root s passwd and all users passwd

24568366
build.gradle	gradlew
could you try following in your build.gradle at project level
i do not think it s possible to do built and its artifact uploaded before evaluating the other modules due to gradlew has to complete configuration phrase before execution phrase during configuration phrase gradlew will try to evaluate all dependencies in all modules

24569358
google-chrome	firefox
your answer was invaluable. form firefox 30.0 - doesn t need a hidden iframe and submit button as shown below but needs the login-form-autofill-fix directive for recognizing the autofilled credendials as follows hidden iframe google-chrome 35.0 - doesn t need the above directive but needs a hidden iframe and a submit button on the real form
the hidden iframe looks like angular directive using jqlite this works with angular 1.2.18 amendment after some testing i realised that google-chrome needs a little timeout by the angular login method 200ms - it seems the redirect is sometimes just too fast for the password manager

24575431
http	spdy
these host method path scheme and version headers are not caused by your extension or code but by the fact that google.com is accessed over spdy instead of http
if you open the developer tools and visit or any other site that supports spdy such as then these request headers will also show up

24579752
realloc	malloc
then you will attempt to write to longest that value but you will never call realloc before you do that which is required
if _getline reads 10 or more characters it will call realloc on memory that was not allocated with malloc

24579755
realloc	malloc
assign the return value of realloc to a temp variable first check its value and then assign to the original pointer only if realloc was successful
you are trying to realloc memory that was not allocated dynamically with malloc

24579776
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
this also happens when the pointer that you pass to realloc has not been properly initialized it s neither a null nor a pointer previously returned from malloc calloc realloc
in your case the pointer passed to realloc is actually an array allocated in automatic memory - it s not a valid pointer

24579855
realloc	malloc
realloc call will re-allocate memory by taking a pointer to a storage area on the heap i.e a dynamically allocated memory result of a call to malloc
in your case the problem is that you are allocating memory on the stack and not dynamically by a call to malloc which results memory allocation on the heap

24579873
swift	objective-c
regarding your reply remember swift isn t fully baked yet and there may be many more apis available to us in future releases such as a unique set api reflection etc
this should not deter you from learning swift as well as objective-c so don t give up

24580116
serializable	deserialization
anyway the form component would not be able to deserialize the json xml so you ll have to use a serializable
in our restfull api we usually use the symfony serializable component to handle the deserialization of entities then the symfony validator component to ensure that the entities fulfill all the required conditions before pushing updating them in database

24580627
implements	extends
in your case your class b is extends a while class a is not implements the interface c
so by extends a it inherits a method that has less access than the one defined in the interface and that is not allowed

24585268
namenode	hdfs
while your namenode is running if you remove fsimage file and try to read the hdfs file it is able to read
removing the fsimage file from the running namenode will not cause issue with the read write operations

24585362
implements	extends
purpose of service layer is to use dao s to implements your business logic. i have enlisetd few benifits of service layer below service layer can use transactions to perform atomic operations.using transaction in dao layer does not make sens for complex use case as there can be multiple entity involved in the operation
with help of service layer we can extends session scope to request instead of session per operation

24586769
factors	mean
if you managed to come up with a linear sorting algorithm with the same constant factors as the n log n algorithm the curves would look like this
the difference is simply too small to see with the naked eye at this scale using your heapsort results 600ms for 1000000 entries here is a o n function green and a o n log n function red from the two functions in this picture are green red note that these functions have vastly different constant scaling factors but of course these do not matter in big-o notation. however just because they are hard to see in a diagram does not mean they are impossible to distinguish

24587159
decimal	ieee
remark if c# did not allow itself to do floating-point computations at a higher precision a good trick would have been to use dekker splitting to split d into two values d1 and d2 that would convert each exactly to decimal
alas dekker splitting only works with a strict interpretation of ieee 754 multiplication and addition

24587893
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
same goes for google-chrome but safari on mac works
this page from w3c is great at observing and understanding events i took the jsfiddle you mentioned and added some extra controls for fast forward rewind speeds however though this works fine for me with google-chrome firefox safari i should point out that it doesn t really address your key questions

24588092
vb.net	vb6
today there are free editions of vb.net
not only is the free edition of visual studio far better the vb6 but it also supports x64 bit computing

24589834
google-chrome	firefox
this mozilla bug report comment on a related issue suggests that firefox does it this way in order to follow the specification stating that matching google-chrome s behavior would require changing the specification
so it seems that firefox and internet explorer are rightfully running the animation regardless of the display state but webkit is instead choosing to optimize the rendering by not running animation on display none

24594476
client-side	server-side
key point here is client-side that is validation which can be done via javascript in client browser
checking for name uniqueness involves server-side resources and while it can be done in javascript using ajax requests to server usually people decide not to do so

24595015
innodb	myisam
innodb implements transactions
myisam does not

24595967
equals	gethashcode
first method you have to override two methods of xx equals which will tell the dictionary whether the two instances are equals gethashcode which has to return the same number if two instances are equals
note that it can return the same number if two instances aren t equals too but you should make it as unique as possible

24599796
strtol	atoi
you should actually check the error information that strtol makes available should be replaced by
no you shouldn t use the above instead of atoi

24600924
union	distinct
i went to query the base table again you could easily do the same against the queries you built. by the way you shouldn t use union in this situation and instead union all
union will take only distinct rows out of the whole unioned dataset

24602465
antialiasing	transparent
make sources public when antialiasing and ready
you can only do 1 cgcontextdrawpath with the implicit path and use kcgpathfill to fill it. also if you want the translucent background color to not interfere with the overlaying arc draw the background first use an actual transparent color alpha 1.0 do this ...before you do that redefine cgcontextaddarc ps

24605706
addition	multiplication
in addition to using the existing answers explaining how to make more than one translation by chaining them you can also construct the 4x4 matrix yourself i grabbed the following image from some random site i found while googling which shows rotational matrices rotation around x axis rotation around y axis rotation around z axis i couldn t find a good example of translation so assuming i remember understand it right translation see more at the wikipedia article on transformation as well as the pragamatic css3 tutorial which explains it rather well
another guide i found which explains arbitrary rotation matrices is egon rath s notes on matrices matrix multiplication works between these 4x4 matrices of course so to perform a rotation followed by a translation you make the appropriate rotation matrix and multiply it by the translation matrix

24605826
clang	llvm
so to sum it up it s not a roundabout way it s just the easiest way for clang to generate ir and making the ir better is the responsibility of llvm passes later on
clang is responsible for generating the first code segment

24612999
bash	tcsh
here s a test program and its behavior under bash it will behave the same under ksh93 and tcsh as well pp.c in a pipeline the leftmost command is the process group leader
this isn t documented but bash ksh93 and tcsh all do it this way

24613992
inline	inlining
having said that i agree that the current behavior isn t as useful as it could be - the compiler could also inline the body of the lambda into the call site which would be safe and improve performance
just to be clear the f# compiler is inlining every definition that you ve marked as inline

24613992
inline	inlining
just to be clear the f# compiler is inlining every definition that you ve marked as inline
it s just that the current behavior of inlining isn t very useful when using an inlined function as a higher-order argument

24613992
inline	inlining
it s just that the current behavior of inlining isn t very useful when using an inline function as a higher-order argument
check can only be inline when given an argument and so iter runs check is treated as

24614034
cdr	cons
the value of a list s car goes into x and of cdr - to the recursive call whose result goes into y
or in equational style where cons e es is not a function call but a data representation using the upper case to signify this - a cons cell with e in its car and es read eez like in e plural in its cdr

24614377
union	distinct
also if you know that union branches produce distinct values use union all instead as it does not try to remove duplicates and is more efficient especially when there is a lot of duplicate rows
if you want to use union operator you have to order by at the end rather than do that in each union branch

24615684
bash	subshell
globs wildcard expressions - they always interpret their operand as a literal filename. 1 a simple trick to test if a pattern glob matches exactly one file is to use a helper function if you re just interested in whether there are any matches - one or more - the function is even simpler if you want to avoid a function it gets trickier caveat this solution does not distinguish between regular files directories for instance though that could be fixed. the code inside the command substitution does the following shopt -s nullglob instructs bash to expand the pattern to an empty string if there are no matches set -- .
assigns the results of the pattern expansion to the positional parameters ... of the subshell in which the command substitution runs

24615950
serializable	deserialization
when you attempt to deserialize an serializable object the mechanism must create an empty instance of the object and fill in the members to restore the object to the state it was when serializable
a constructor of a serializable object would have been called when the object was first constructed but constructors are not called during the deserialization because technically you are not constructing the object instead reconstituting it to the former state

24615950
serializable	deserialization	super	extends
deserialization of serlializable objects do not cause constructor invocation but when there is a super class that is not serializable that is you extends a non-serializable class with a serializable class then that class is not expecting to be deserialized and it has no mechanism for storing restoring its members
if the super class is not serializable the deserialization mechanism needs to call the zero-argument constructor to make sure that the reconstituted object instance is initialized correctly

24615950
serializable	deserialization
if the super class is not serializable the deserialization mechanism needs to call the zero-argument constructor to make sure that the reconstituted object instance is initialized correctly
if you fail to specify a zero-argument constructor the deserialization code will not warn you of this problem until your first attempt to deserialize an object of that class

24622846
swift	objective-c
the release notes for swift 1.2 imply that the fields may not be accessible at all but they are still readable for at least the glkit types swift can now partially import c aggregates containing unions bitfields simd vector types and other c language features that are not natively supported in swift
the unsupported fields will not be accessible from swift but c and objective-c apis that have arguments and return values of these types can be used in swift

24623080
awt	swing
besides without awt you don t have swing.
lightweight means that the swing component does not have native peer of it s own it shares a common native peer

24623081
awt	swing
ordinary swing components can be seen as a logical area on awt containers
swing components are called lightweight because they do not require a native os object to implement their functionality

the sampling method is lightweight and has little effect on the execution of the application methods ... the sampling profiling method interrupts the computer processor at set intervals and collects the function call stack
such effect should not be possible unless there is another factor which is not clearly seen by you like running release against debugging mode etc. as msdn says the sampling profiling method collects statistical data about the work that is performed by an application during a profiling run

swift	objective-c
nil is also called nil in swift nil has no equivalent in swift can be accessed in swift as nsnull
swift s nil is not the same as nil in objective-c

24626563
swift	objective-c
swift s nil is not the same as nil in objective-c
in objective-c nil is a pointer to a non-existent object

union	distinct
btw the keyword distinct after union is not allowed in all dbms
usually you would just write union

24630974
bower	npm
there s a really interesting section in the bower handbook avoiding .. .. .. .. .. ..
not everything in an application properly belongs on the public npm and the overhead of setting up a private npm or git repo is still rather large in many cases

24634500
innodb	myisam
infobright operates on the brighthouse engine and cannot be used in conjunction with an installation that utilizes the innodb engine there s some sort of build restriction with mysql
even though you can t use innodb you can still use myisam

24635026
azure	hdinsight
refer to this website for steps required to access your certificate from the documentation i read on azure it had seemed like getting a certificate setup was not required if the subscription had already been set up and accessed
this was true for all the services i had used except hdinsight

24636856
swift	objective-c
your basic problem is that in objective-c closures aka blocks are represented as nsobject or more precisely are transparently converted to nsobjects while in swift there is no such mapping
this means that closures can not be directly stored in a dictionary short of using objective-c glue the closest i can come up with is something along the lines of wrapping the value in an enum which is probably a better solution anyway because this way you have an explicit typing associated with individual arguments instead of it being implicit using some sort of inflection

24637655
pbkdf2	md5
also i don t know what your use case is but if this is for storage of any type of credentials i d recommend using sha512 contained in the apache commons sha2crypt class or better yet pbkdf2 or bcrypt
md5 is a fairly fast hashing algorithm and was not designed to be used for hashing passwords

24637796
division	subtract
adding the result of that division to the whole-number part should yield a decimal value which is within one least-significant-digit of being correct it may not be precisely rounded but will still be far better than the built-in conversions
for larger values multiply by 1.0 281474976710656.0 2 -48 take the whole-number part of that result multiply it back by 281474976710656.0 and subtract it from the original result

24637805
swift	objective-c
in modern objective-c this would be written as and that translates to the above swift code
it is quite simple note that objective-c arrays are not nil-terminated. you are perhaps confused by the syntax this creates an array with two objects

24637853
pthreads	fork
anything you wrote that used mach threads upon which pthreads are based upon which gcd is based etc. would not be implementing your own threading model it d be the same threading model that everyone else uses
likewise on os x if you aren t ultimately using mach threads there s no way for you to start a truly concurrent thread of execution in the same process because only the kernel can do that so at the end of the day you would be implementing a cooperative multitasking system that would only ever be able to run on one core or fork multiple processes and using shared memory or something to coordinate between them and if you do that you re still effectively using mach threads they re just in different processes created by the kernel. if you want to tinker with your own thread pool implementation just do it and ignore appkit s background threads

24640936
hex	binary
what it doesn t do is treat the inputs as hex
you need the key and the encrypted data as binary values whereas you ve currently got them both as hexadecimal strings

24641887
libsvm	liblinear
you should use libsvm for that
liblinear does not support multi-class classification by default but you can download this tool from the official site and it can do the job

24642286
google-chrome	firefox
overlay about addons and google-chrome mozapps content extensions extensions.xul and hook the docommand belonging to preferences
re-bind addon-generic but patching rebinding this monster of a binding is not only not easy but also very fragile may get out of sync if future firefox changes something and also not even enough because there is still a menu item in the context menu

24643153
jar	war
also consider moving your source target levels to the parent project so you don t redefine the same yet have a consistent java version talking about old versions how come you even still have .svn folders that you need to exclude for a while now there s only a .svn folder in the root of your subversion work space that wouldn t affect the maven war plugin so your project structure could look like this root meat packaging jar where your classes live lt packaging war depends on meat lt1 packaging war depends on meat and stays the heck out of lt addition forgotten some aspect as pointed out in comment .
while meat is of packaging jar you want it to also include stuff that you had going into webapp without it ending up on the classpath

entity-relationship	diagram
i m not sure if this is what you are looking for but this is how i make all of my entity-relationship diagram for my database
if you re using sql management studio i use 2008 you can just right click on the diagram drop down in the explorer and click create new diagram

24645106
google-chrome	firefox
as noted in that bug page google-chrome has similar behavior on other special elements like and though it does happen to accept custom display styling on for some reason
firefox does not in any case. to fix this you need to set display flex on a wrapper-div inside of the instead of on the itself

24650748
implements	extends
make all your classes implements that interface then use this will still preserve the contract that specifies that your list should contain only those 3 classes
i can not create abstract class parser and inherit from it because saxbooksparser is already extends defaulthandler .create a interface

24652504
carrierwave	fog
not sure where you got the information on the configuring carrierwave this way
carrierwave uses fog to communicate to aws and any other cloud

24652504
carrierwave	fog
carrierwave uses fog to communicate to aws and any other cloud
you need to set the storage to fog not aws

24654272
udp	tcp
i don t know if you meant in the sense of udp broadcast packets but those do not work well in practice over the internet
therefore the only benefit to using udp would be to reduce overhead but i think you will see that for the reasons above the few bytes of overhead don t outweigh the benefits of tcp for this type of application

24656054
ienumerable	iqueryable
it s calling the implementation of skip that accepts an ienumerable because that s what the generic constraint tells the compiler it must implement so if it were an iqueryable even if you resolved the messy cast issue you wouldn t be using the query provider to translate the skip call
you need to have two overloads here one for iqueryable and one for ienumerable

24657895
profiling	debugging
glend from the nsight user guide s supported opengl functions page nvidia nsight visual studio edition 4.0 frame debugging supports the set of opengl operations which are defined by the opengl 4.2 core profiling
note that it is not necessary to create a core profiling context to make use of the frame debugger

24659413
google-chrome	firefox
answer for question 1 yes i faced the same problem in google-chrome but i see no issues in firefox since firefox does not update select value until user hits return
but i could not find the solution for the strange behavior when using keyboard in google-chrome

24661459
implements	extends
this is not currently possible in the routingautobundle but it could be easily implements
the routingautobundle creates route documents which extends the cmf s route object

24661906
xsl-fo	xslt
apart from your xslt outputting a mix of html and xsl-fo it does actually seem to pick up bold and italic tags
if you are after pure xsl-fo then looking at the question you have referenced it doesn t need much work to make it work with your xml of course one reason why it might not be working may be if your actual xml has namespace declaration in

24662031
implements	extends
but if your dispatcherthread class implements runnable interface then you can write the clean up at the bottom of the run method
skeleton code by the way thread suffix is not a good name for a class that technically is not a thread because it doesn t extends from thread

24664331
swift	objective-c
see using swift with cocoa and objective-c for more information
nskeyedarchiver will only work with objective-c classes not pure swift classes

24664331
swift	objective-c
nskeyedarchiver will only work with objective-c classes not pure swift classes
you can bridge your class to objective-c by marking it with the objective-c attribute or by inheriting from an objective-c class such as nsobject

24664469
xsl-fo	xslt
the principal is the same for html but just output html tags instead of xsl-fo ones
the main issue why you xslt doesn t work is because you haven t got templates matching either bold or italic try this xslt not the use of priority on one of the templates this acts as a sort-of catch-all template for matching elements where you don t have specific templates

24670469
factors	mean
i think you re looking for you just need to factors out the 1 in the second part of the alternation in the same way that you factored out the 0 in the first part
this regex doesn t mean what you think it means

24672139
implements	extends
so had you set the window.datacontext to an instance of a view model that implements inotifypropertychanged with a property declared in it named message then your code would have worked just fine
view models should not have dependencyproperty s in them and should certainly not extends the dependencyobject class because these are ui related classes

24683552
backtracking	greedy
not sure why they would but here goes check out this example for confirmation that it works i switched from my original match to a negative lookahead to avoid a catastrophic backtracking as the test program put it
your expression is greedy and is currently matching the in the first comment because matches

wildfly	jboss
use java 7 or upgrade to wildfly 8
jboss 7.x does not support java 8

24686535
google-chrome	firefox
i saw the load function of iframe fires in firefox but not in google-chrome
so firefox reload the iframe again on load event

24689036
exponent	modulo
the exponent will be not bigger than the short key
so for dsa you have to compute a 2048 bit number to the power of a 256 bit number modulo a other number and for rsa you have to compute a 2048 bit number to the power of an other 2048 bit number. this is why rsa is much slower than dsa

24690703
zsh	subshell
zsh is not affected because etc zshenv is read by every zsh instance
to summarize and complement holdenweb s helpful answer particularly with respect to os x a subshell started from ipython with

24692032
prepare	execute
sql injection is a serious threat you would do better to prepare and protect yourself against it
it is not possible with a single query but you can combine multiple commands into a script and execute them with a single request to the database server

24692214
swift	objective-c
since your objective-c protocol use int a c primitive type and not nsnumber as the type of some parameters return value you should bridge it with the correct type that is cint change all your int with cint on the swift side and all will work you can read more here
swift primitive types like int are automatically bridged to nsnumber when interacting with objective c

24693415
http	spdy
the only time mseekable is ever set true is when source the stream is http http spdy the http response has no content-encoding the http response provides a content-length
the http response has accept-ranges bytes omitting the header is not supported for all other stream types incl

24693415
http	spdy
moreover npn_requestread is only implemented for http streams but doesn t actually care about seekable and furthermore does not actually check if the server returns 206
conclusion you can only use np_seek streams with http https spdy

24697253
postgresql	mysql
but you could run intro trouble if you change the pdo driver from mysql to postgresql
because postgresql does not support the attribute mentioned above

24702145
ssl	https
the other alternative would be to use the old net ssl crypt ssleay backend for lwp but i advice against it because it does not implement all necessary certificate checks and thus mounting a man-in-the-middle attack against it is easy
please make sure that you use at least version 6.06 of lwp useragent and version 6.06 of lwp protocol https

24702765
google-chrome	firefox
current browsers firefox ie google-chrome do not seem to support the after and before pseudo-elements for empty elements other than hr
for hr ie and google-chrome place the generated content inside a bordered box which is the implementation of hr

24705589
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome uses a lazy paste event which means that it doesn t check to see if the focused element is an editable content area which is why the paste event works on the document
as for firefox and ie it actually checks the element before letting allowing the paste event to be fired

24705791
udp	mtu
a single receive on a udp socket consumes a single datagram from the network
though the theoretical max payload of a udp packet is 65 507 in practice you are probably not going to get messages over 1400 bytes because of path mtu limits

24706024
vmware	virtualbox
it can manage virtualbox vmware and now docker
depending on what your needs are you can achieve isolation through vagrant via virtualbox or docker but vagrant does not provide the isolation by itself

24707918
implements	extends
there is no reason why this couldn t be done with python it merely needs a bit of implementation work. to give a rough estimation of the amount of work a caffeine-driven expert coder takes about two days to implements a stand alone forth interpreter doubling as operating system from scratch on a platform s he s familiar with
by then the system will be far from finished or complete but it will compile source and allow extends itself with the results of that compilation

24708363
slug	permalinks
slug is a good one to use because it can be used in permalinks or in conditional handlebars expressions etc
a slug should have no spaces be lowercase and use dashes not underscores if it might end up in permalinks

24708363
slug	permalinks
a slug should have no spaces be lowercase and use dashes not underscores if it might end up in permalinks
if slug doesn t work for you use whatever makes sense but basename probably isn t a good one for this purpose b c it could be index which might belong to more than one file and properties like title might be a sentences

24708408
persistent	transient
detached a detached instances is an object that has been persistent but its session has been closed
transient an object is transient if it has just been instantiated using the new operator and it is not associated with a hibernate session

24716632
prepare	execute
in summary prepare statements create a separation between the data being sent and the sql query itself ensuring that the data can not be misinterpreted as the sql query
however an attacker can still enter sql as data and although it will not be execute when it is first stored if you are using prepare statements you must still use caution when retrieving said results

24718253
freebsd	linux
i have once traced the current 1 1 freebsd threading implementation to an article in kerneltrap opensolaris doesn t seem to describe its own threading implementation on man pages
i could find instead a document comparing the opensolaris kernel with linux 2.6 and windows vista

24718399
punctuation	words
the first half of the regex matches whatever you consider to be a words and the second half matches whatever you consider punctuation
in this example i just used whatever isn t a words or whitespace

24718763
swift	objective-c
swift only sees const s
however i think that your approach as a whole might not make sense - it looks like you re trying to assign a value to the global objective-c constant ddloglevel

24718763
swift	objective-c
swift s let is not going to do that for you - it s a completely different namespace
this is on top of not being able to use objective-c macros in swift

24718763
swift	objective-c
this is on top of not being able to use objective-c macros in swift
your best bet is to leave an objective-c file in your project called say loggingconfig.m that just contains the library you re using relies heavily on objective-c features so best to just use objective-c to configure it

24719148
swift	objective-c
the best way to work around this is to encode swift types as nsdictionary instances untested edit 2 contrary to what i wrote above this isn t limited to just reading objective-c instances from swift
it appears that any usage of nscoding requires an objective-c name for your class

24719782
stateless	stateful
a stateless session bean can implement a web service but a stateful session bean cannot
as per javaee reference here a stateless session bean can implement a web service

24722905
google-chrome	firefox
though i m only accustomed to web accessibility and not in anything related to software browsers apis and their internal working so i could be very wrong sorry i guess the communication related to accessibility from webkit to the os and there s webkit on windows os x maybe still linux etc is managed by google-chrome the software and vanilla chromium the software from chromium the project not webkit the rendering engine
if it does or can you should have the same accessibility as in chromium good luck with that compared to firefox and ie

24723850
oncreate	setcontentview
its because of activity context is not available in activity class its available after oncreate method of activty
you may define ratingbar rate in your class and initiate in the oncreate method. also add setcontentview r.layout.activity_test

24727049
floating-point	fractions
choosing b as 2 or 10 does not make a difference for small integers 0 1 2 can be represented exactly both in binary floating-point and in decimal floating-point but the fractions numbers and the very large numbers that can be represented exactly are not the same in binary and decimal
examples binary floating-point can represent 2 -100 and 2 100 exactly but decimal128 cannot

24727063
passenger	thin	passenger	webrick
it works with passenger but with webrick and thin it doesn t
it looks like both webrick and thin parse a request too so the failure happens before initializer is loaded

24730639
oncreate	onstart
just send an extra via the intent you use in your onreceive method in your sound playing activity you have to play the sound in oncreate this will return false if the intent-extra playsound does not exist or is set to false true if it is set to true
oncreate is only called once when the activity starts while onstart gets called everytime a user reenters your activity through recent apps

24731960
icomparable	compareto
icomparable will let your code call compareto for example
there are some other built in constraints available that are not related to your type hierarchy where t class where t struct where t new you can find out what these mean by reviewing the documentation . icomparable is simply a .net framework interface available in the bcl

24737794
shadowing	named
use setattr built-in function besides list is not a good variable named - it is shadowing built-in and can cause problems suprises
also you probably want to have a dictionary of field named field value pairs instead

24738214
punctuation	words
the specific problems are that you don t consider punctuation at all
and you use the length of the bad words not the words when inserting s

24741196
inline	constexpr
run time performance is not directly relevant except that constexpr methods are implicitly inline and otherwise well-behaved not containing some undefined behavior so may be more amenable to optimization
1 a constexpr constructor that takes parameters can be called at compile time if the parameters are known at compile time

24741429
matplotlib	colormap
matplotlib is rather complicated when it comes to interpreting images
it goes roughly as follows if the image is a nxm array of any type it is interpreted through the colormap autoscale if not indicated otherwise

24743796
add-on	xpcom
but when it comes to things the sdk is not tailored for like is the case here you d actually have to write sdk boilerplate + low-level xul xpcom stuff and cannot use xul overlays as an added bonus because restartless add-on don t support those
scratchpad - with a xul overlay here is a complete xul overlay add-on

24746301
sudo	passwd
think of it like this ansible_ssh_user is the user to ssh to the host as ansible_sudo_user is the user to sudo on the host in other words using your users and commands as the example the equivalent commands that ansible will run are therefore the foo user s passwd needs to be provided not the bar user
the foo user will need privileges to sudo as bar

24749055
union	distinct
if t_a and t_d have non-overlapping data it doesn t make sense to use a union which does an implicit distinct
you almost certainly want to use the less expensive union all

24749343
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the previous css hack before edge and safari 9 or newer firefox versions this worked for only google-chrome version 28 and newer
the above google-chrome 28+ hack was not one of my creations

24752762
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
for example if you want to do a+b c and a and b are already reduced and then you can use a comparison and a subtraction like this i did this in this example vectorizing-modular-arithmetic another example is if the divisors are not compile time constants but are nevertheless constant within a loop then you can use an analogous idea from floating point division
a common trick in floating point division is to pre-compute the reciprocal of the divisor and do multiplication like this you can use a similar technique for integer division which converts the integer division into integer multiplication with a shift

24755848
multiplying	multiplication
you can cast one of the i to long multiplying with 1l but not you can also assign to long and than multiplying with i like this
1099511627776 which is the result of multiplication is as it s integer multiplication so after value would be 1073741824 but after multiplication with 1024 it becomes out of range which causes integer overflow and k will be 0

24761306
tiff	bmp	tiff	png
you cannot by default read a tiff file into a buffered image using imageio
calling imageio.getreaderfilesuffixes will return an array of the supported file formats which should at least include jpeg png bmp wbmp and gif

24764187
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid
you cannot really run any activity code before oncreate
move these initializations to oncreate and the findviewbyid calls after setcontentview

24765759
swift	objective-c
so i m not saying there isn t value in doing these tests right now but until swift 1.0 is finalised we can t say anything conclusive about final performance
i don t think that as of today you can run these tests and determine with any certainty whether swift 1.0 is faster or slower than objective-c

24765780
client-side	server-side
finally do not rely on client-side enforcement of security
you can check security on the client side to have the ui react appropriately but all server-side requests should be doing checks to make sure the user s security claims are valid

24766368
udp	tcp
check out udp socket manual for methods you need
udp connected term is not the same as tcp

24766368
udp	tcp
udp connected term is not the same as tcp
you will not see udp connections in netstat output

24767574
bower	npm
like npm bower is slower than component at installing has an unnecessary publish step does not support multiple versions of dependencies and does not cache installations
the team behind component have now written their own opinionated answer to this copying the content as of today bower is more similar to npm than to component

24768434
stateless	stateful
first the stateful example then the stateless or rather object-oriented approach these carry out the same steps create a figure object matplotlib.figure.figure create a new plotting area object matplotlib.axes.axessubplot and add it to the figure create a new line into the plotting area matplotlib.lines.line2d in the object-oriented form we do the operations above rather explicitly and take the object references into variables fig ax li
the references are not lost in the stateful interface either but they are hidden somewhere within matplotlib

24771812
hex	binary
the problem is that this_is_key is not a sequence of hex values with the exception of the e
if you run the test code through the php binary itself you ll also see these lines php warning pack type h illegal hex digit t in - on line 2 php warning pack type h illegal hex digit h in - on line 2 php warning pack type h illegal hex digit i in - on line 2 php warning pack type h illegal hex digit s in - on line 2 php warning pack type h illegal hex digit _ in - on line 2 php warning pack type h illegal hex digit i in - on line 2 php warning pack type h illegal hex digit s in - on line 2 php warning pack type h illegal hex digit _ in - on line 2 php warning pack type h illegal hex digit k in - on line 2 php warning pack type h illegal hex digit y in - on line 2 note that it s every character except for e that throws an error and note that in your hex output every character gets converted to a null nibble except for e

24772304
mongodb	bson
the c# mongodb driver serializes decimal as a string the driver source-code corroborates this
it does this because there is no bson type for decimal - double does not have the same precision

24774320
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload is called once and only once when the view gets loaded
in your situitation viewwillappear might not work as well because it s only called only if the view gets loaded on the canvas

24778901
hive	hdfs
when the function is referenced for the first time by a hive session these resources will be added to the environment as if add jar file had been issued
if hive is not in local mode then the resource location must be a non-local uri such as an hdfs location

24782524
equals	gethashcode
yes - equals is going to return false for any two distinct objects
within your equals implementation you re calling the customobject.gethashcode method which isn t overridden not your custom comparer s gethashcode method

24782524
equals	gethashcode
within your equals implementation you re calling the customobject.gethashcode method which isn t overridden not your custom comparer s gethashcode method
if you expected equals to call your custom gethashcode method you d need to change it to or given the implementation of gethashcode customobject you can just simplify it to note that your gethashcode method was being called by distinct but it was then calling your equals method to check that the objects were really equal.

24783544
mp4	h.264
so far what i ve come up with is this plain html important notes ended up putting the ogg as the first because mac os firefox quits trying to play the video if it encounters an mp4 as the first
the correct mime types are important .ogv files should be video ogg not video ogv if you have hd video the best transcoder i ve found for hd quality ogg files is firefogg the .iphone.mp4 file is for iphone 4+ which will only play videos that are mpeg-4 with h.264 baseline 3 video and aac audio

24783710
ubuntu	linux
remember that ubuntu 14.04.5 lts provides node.js v0.10.25 stable
create a shortcut in usr local not usr bin ln -s usr bin nodejs usr local bin node according to the linux documentation project distributions may not install anything in there

24784471
mayavi	matplotlib
if you are not restricted to using matplotlib you might want to take a look at mayavi and its contour3d function
the following code produces a similar plot to your example using mayavi

24787820
hex	binary
maybe you are looking to the -hex option of openssl rand given that option is available on your system your example could be rewritten if you need to later convert from hex to bytes use this perl one-liner from please note i pipe to the client program and o not use a shell variable here as i think it cannot properly handle the x00
as the bash cannot properly deal with binary strings containing x00 your best bet if you absolutely want to stick with shell programming is to use an intermediate file to store binary data

24787889
fseek	fread
fread reads sizeof struct mystruct_thing bytes starting from the current position of fp so the starting position differs assuming offset is not the same position at which you are already at before fseek because fseek sets the position for future reads and writes
the second argument of fread is the size of each item to be read in this case the struct

24789068
swift	objective-c
if you re writing your own protocol just in the context of swift then you can definitely drop the optional for added safety
imagine you re not implementing this method but instead calling it on a class that was defined in objective-c

24790451
flask	django
the answer to context-agnostic isolation is here werkzeug s context locals werkzeug and flask have the same creator
werkzeug is not a framework but just a set of utilities you can use in any wsgi framework django

24792949
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the changeability of both max_input_vars and post_max_size is php_ini_perdir which means they can be set in php.ini .htaccess httpd.conf but not using ini_set
so create a .htaccess file in your application_root with php_value max_input_vars 12345 now in that directory create a test file that will reflect the value of max_input_vars and check it by accessing it

24793881
qthread	qobject
a simple solution is call processgps directly and use sleep as timer this is not a nice solution a recommanded way is creating a worker to do all the job and then use qobject movetothread as said in qthread document
qobject cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thready is beacuse in the run is creating an object in the child thread but this which point at gpsthread is in the main thread

required	placeholder
demo on jquery required
i m thinking you can use another tag to simulate placeholder maybe the code here is not very good but i just provide another thought

24797021
jpql	hql
hql jpql are mostly useful when you want to fetch entities not projections
neither hql or jpql support derived table expressions

24798071
mongodb	bson
by default uses the extended json syntax standard for mongodb
this is because json is not typed where bson is and certain data is expected to be typed in this case the objectid

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the somewhat accepted convention as of this writing is that it s ok to deprecate support for any browser not supporting queryselector localstorage and addeventlistener . meaning you can safely drop support for firefox 3.5 ie 8 safari 3.2 google-chrome 3 opera presto 10.1 and everything under
which is to say it s a little too early right now to remove vendor prefixes especially due to the fact millions of users still use android 2.x or 4.3 devices running safari 4.x 5.x levels android stock browsers or opera mini presto 11

implements	extends
so your run method now becomes something like this one last thing - backgroundservices shouldn t extends thread it should just implements runnable
the executorservice is treating it as a runnable because thread happens to implements that interface but executorservice creates and manages its own threads

24804980
arraylist	treeset
i did a little benchmark of treeset vs arraylist insertion performance
obviously arraylist performs the better but with a million unique records 279ms of full iteration time is not that bad

24804980
arraylist	treeset
obviously arraylist performs the better but with a million unique records 279ms of full iteration time is not that bad
if in your case that time is negligible i d stick with the treeset

24806284
hex	binary
it s not just java it looks like it s this way in c too this page explains it some since the hex number is representing a double it s represented in scientific notation so what you are seeing is 1.0 to the power of 0
the thing is that the tohexstring method is first looking at the binary string and the translating any portion after the . to hex

24810520
imperative	declarative
it is the aspect of the explicitly defined behavior that makes c imperative
there is the secret under layer of c where optimizations can be made as long as they have a guarantee to not change the output of the program that makes the compiler have some declarative behavior where the declaration is the behavior of the input c program but the end result can be anything that matches that c program in functionality 5.1.2.3 part 10 alternatively an implementation might perform various optimizations within each translation unit such that the actual semantics would agree with the abstract semantics only when making function calls across translation unit boundaries

24810728
comparator	comparable
i would not even make a separate comparator
you can just implement comparable interface on your patient class and implement the necessary compareto method. a quick implementation also add this.add p in your registerpatient method

24814027
ethernet	wireless
this way i can tell what type of interface it is ethernet wireless loopback tunnel etc. whether it is active or not and sooo much more
now to get the ipv4 address of your ethernet network interface call getlocalipv4 networkinterfacetype.ethernet

24814512
allocator	stl
if it s not clear to the reader you will need to declare an allocator class per casey s comment
although this is fairly obvious if you read all the replies what wasn t clear was the way these allocators are passed to the object which isn t like most of the stl allocators i ve used before which take an allocator type not instance as part of the type specification

24814512
allocator	stl
although this is fairly obvious if you read all the replies what wasn t clear was the way these allocator are passed to the object which isn t like most of the stl allocator i ve used before which take an allocator type not instance as part of the type specification
for std function an instantiated allocator is supplied to the constructor of your std function object which is what comicsansms is showing above

24815926
swift	objective-c
swift functions that are not a class function don t require parameter names but you still can explicitly add them as bryan said it s to make swift method calls make sense when called on objective-c methods that have parameter names in the method signature
init methods include the first parameter because swift changes the init methods from objective-c from initwith .

24819918
cfstring	nsstring
swift knows how to convert a swift string to an nsstring and an nsstring to a cfstring but seems not to know how to do both steps in one
if you want to convert a non-literal string you have to cast it to nsstring

24824179
innodb	myisam
the application may be artificially slowing down this update for example in innodb a transaction might be opened but committed after a lot of time was consumed
you tested with myisam too which does not support transactions

24824223
google-chrome	firefox
it seems paper-elements core-elements have known issues in google-chrome apps
i tried it and it looks fine in dartium 36.0.1985.97 282401 google-chrome version 36.0.1985.125 and firefox 30.0 but not in dartium as extension

24826877
client-side	server-side
fortunately you can not access your database from your client-side application directly
you need to have a server-side application to access your mongodb

24829166
client-side	server-side
you need to create a client-side security exit and use mqcsp structure but it will not do you any good if you do not have a server-side security exit to read it
note you cannot protect your queue manager from a client-side point of view because anyone can simply download one of the free mq supportpacs or one of the many free mq applications and use it to connect to your queue manager

24830655
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
but runtimeexception is unchecked so it s not required to be in the superclass method s throws clause
in an overriding method you are always allowed to declare that it throws a runtimeexception because runtimeexception s are unchecked-exception

24830655
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
in an overriding method you are always allowed to declare that it throws a runtimeexception because runtimeexception s are unchecked-exception
usually methods aren t declared to throw runtimeexception s but you can do so if you wish

24830655
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
usually methods aren t declared to throw runtimeexception s but you can do so if you wish
section 8.4.6 of the jls states it is permitted but not required to mention unchecked-exception classes 11.1.1 in a throws clause

24830759
google-chrome	firefox
from a completely different perspective - i was also having problems with highcharts tooltips using google-chrome on my ultrabook
this problem was not occurring in ie or firefox

24831250
google-chrome	firefox
using zwj multiple times is the safest bet this seems to fix the issue in google-chrome
in firefox the problem does not seem to exist but there is the problem that the diacritic is not colored

24834144
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload is definitely not being called because the views are already loaded
if the other methods viewwillappear etc are not being called too you could forward the calls to the other viewcontrollers

24836269
fgets	fseek
for example fgets should be used instead of gets as indicated by chris mclovin etc
and the report would be cleaner if there was an ending newline and as indicated by ed heal this line is not needed fseek stdin 0 seek_end

24836566
clang	llvm
clang converts c c++ etc to llvm if llvm performs optimizations on the if and the llvm x86 backend writes out x86 machine code for execution
despite the name llvm is not a virtual machine in the traditional sense - it is a computation model and representation that lends itself well to the task of manipulating code

24840666
punctuation	words
it should read instead of you could have also used since everyone is posting additional code that doesn t work i thought i would offer a solution that is simpler and works with punctuation
you forgot a capital on words in your variable badwordcounter when incrementing it

24842035
innodb	myisam
in innodb #2 and #3 will be much faster than #1
#2 also helps with myisam but not nearly as much

24843584
swift	objective-c
translate directly uicolor.blackcolor .setstroke mybezier.stroke but of course you can t do any of those things in objective-c or in swift unless you are in a graphics context drawrect or uigraphicsbeginimagecontext
in objective-c i would use something like this but this is obviously not going to work in swift

24844611
fgets	fread
fgets and fputs are there to read and write textual data fread and fwrite are there to read and write binary data be careful
as stated by clifford below fread will still translate line-ends if the file was not opened as binary

24845527
swift	objective-c
using mirror here s a pure swift solution with some limitations limitations returns an empty array for objective-c objects will not return computed properties if self is an instance of a class vs. say a struct this doesn t report its superclass s properties you could work around this using superclassmirror depending on your desired behavior
using class_copypropertylist if you re using objective-c objects you can use this approach the output to the console if classtoinspect is nsurl this won t work in a playground

24847610
implements	extends
the method set of a type determines the interfaces that the type implements and the methods that can be called using a receiver of that type
it isn t so much an advantage than it is a go feature allowing to easily extends a type with new methods

24851624
uiview	subviews
the view hierarchy would then look like this containerview uiview mapview mkmapview mybanner uiimageview in this case mybanner can still overlap mapview because views with a higher index will be placed above views with a lower index
this would not work containerview uiview mybanner uiimageview mapview mkmapview i m not 100 sure but i think there is a problem with the mkmapview it just doesn t want you to put subviews on top of it

24852926
twig	smarty
doesn t matter if you are using the twig c extension twig is gonna be slow anyway
twig is really really slow when compared to volt and even to the good old smarty

24854672
implements	extends
i m not sure whether it s an good idea to allow html-mails ishtml false this depends on your application and the amount of time you want to spent implements this
i d extends step 2 with additional post-data sent to the server this would allow the client full control over sent message but the activation procedure mail generation delivery is still handled by the service

24856148
bash	zsh
works with zsh bash dash and ash
type -p foo it appears to work with zsh bash and ash busybox but not dash it interprets -p as an argument

24856148
bash	zsh
type -p foo it appears to work with zsh bash and ash busybox but not dash it interprets -p as an argument
command -v foo works with zsh bash dash but not ash busybox -ash command not found

24859576
swift	objective-c
swift initialiser sets up a valid instance and could not theoretically return anything other that a valid instance so there s no point in explicit return
so from my point of view allocation initialisation sequence looks like this runtime allocates instance of requested class initializer is called with self set to allocated instance initializer performs setup runtime returns initialised instance to client code although this approach breaks some useful objective-c patterns like initialisers returning nil on error the guarantee that instantiation always succeeds allows compiler to perform some optimisations

24859806
sse	avx
even msvc will get that one correct at least for sse
your compiler will have to do some adjustments for n not a multiple of 4 or 8 for avx and alignment but this cost will be amortized across n and this overhead will have a negligible effect except for small n

24860808
glut	sdl	glut	glfw
actually glut is not particularly well suited for the kind of input you want
it s far simpler to do this with glfw or sdl

24860817
stateless	stateful
a stateless session cannot be used with persistence management functions of hibernate no save update merge and so on---just executeupdate allowed which results in an immediate sql against the database
the regular stateful hibernate session accumulates all the beans you have involved until either commit or an explicit clear or in some special circumstances which we shouldn t discuss here

24866660
google-chrome	firefox
this isolates each website tab etc. from each other so that they do not affect each other or the core google-chrome process in the event of a failure
so if on firefox you have a page that dies it could cause firefox as a whole to give up and crash

24867015
portrait	landscape
the problem originates from the fact that the #container width is larger than the portrait width in pixels thus the user has to manually unzoom step 3
changing orientation to landscape after unzooming step 4 doesn t work well inside the phonegap browser it works in the regular browser though

24876361
ssl	https
custom ssl client support unless you need compatibility for really old clients select only clients that support server name indication and save 600
if you are redirecting https to s3 redirect the origin domain should not be the autocomplete bucket but the static redirect endpoint s3 gives you save your distribution

24876707
swift	objective-c
in swift code
other option is was to change objective-c code to success void nsmutablearray response success not preferred as it kills the purpose of using the bridge

24878122
swift	objective-c
this is an issue with gcdasyncsocket and delegates inside swift code can apply to other delegate scenarios as well
what you are experiencing here is swift creates a reference to self for the call of gcdasyncsocket objective-c does something with it but treats it as __weak basically not creating an additional reference swift needs to care about

24878122
swift	objective-c
what you are experiencing here is swift creates a reference to self for the call of gcdasyncsocket objective-c does something with it but treats it as __weak basically not creating an additional reference swift needs to care about
swift finishes the call to gcdasyncsocket and arc removes the reference to self as there is no other reference

24878122
swift	objective-c
swift finishes the call to gcdasyncsocket and arc removes the reference to self as there is no other reference
swift does not know that objective-c still needs it

24878122
swift	objective-c
swift does not know that objective-c still needs it
and as the delegate is declared as __weak it s gone in the objective-c part as well

24879448
hex	binary	octal	binary
for general numeric input c++ has std dec for decimal input std oct for octal base 8 std hex for hexadecimal base 16 but strangely nothing for binary
it is not possible to read a multi-digit binary representation of a number directly into an integral type

24879504
nsstring	nsobject
your dictionary contains nsstring not nsnumber nor int or long
a dictionary is a collection of nsobject

24880258
udp	tcp
one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data
the reasons for this are a deep subject but suffice to say that tcp provides many very useful features that udp does not such as ensured delivery of the packets and corruption detection

24880475
opera	safari
opera mini android browser blackberry browser 7 ios safari 7 or less ie mobile 10 opera mobile 11.5 or less
according to caniusel.com webgl is completely supported by the following mobile browsers safari on ios 8 blackberry browser 10 opera mobile 22+ its partially supported meaning it may or may not work in some cases by the following browsers

24880475
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
according to caniusel.com webgl is completely supported by the following mobile browsers safari on ios 8 blackberry browser 10 opera mobile 22+ its partially supported meaning it may or may not work in some cases by the following browsers
google-chrome for android 35 firefox for android 30 lastly here is the list of mobile browsers that don t support webgl

24881403
udp	tcp
tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted
udp does not have this features so it can t guarantee that

24882244
swt	swing
it doesn t cover everything but how to install and use it is explained currently nattable is building a swt control
swing is not supported

24882401
imagemagick	libtiff
once you install it all you do is brew install libtiff brew install fontconfig brew install ghostscript brew install imagemagick --with-fontconfig --with-ghostscript --with-libtiff if you already have homebrew and you installed imagemagick without any of the extra options you can do this oh i forgot to say your command works fine on my osx mavericks with homebrew
if not i would really recommend it - i use it for everything from imagemagick to exiftool ffmpeg 7zip openssl netcat jhead gawk gnuplot gnu coreutils gnu parallel etc

24882920
onresume	onpause
the problem is that you are calling setvisible false in onpause and not calling setvisibile true in onresume . consider that you don t need to use setvisible bool method in this case
according to android documentation link public void setvisible boolean visible added in api level 3 control whether this activity s main window is visible.this is intended only for the special case of an activity that is not going to show a ui itself but can t just finish prior to onresume because it needs to wait for a service binding or such

24885876
clang	llvm
c and c++ compilers generally have 4 stages pre-process compile source to assembler assemble assembler to binary object files link multiple object files to produce one executable shared library or static library in the case of clang stage 2 is kind of split first produce llvm ir then assemble that into assembly for the target architecture
clang and gcc both share the same command line options to control which stage will be executed -e runs only the preprocessor stage -s runs preprocess and compile stage outputting assembly files -c runs preprocess compile and assemble stages producing a .o object file if you do not include any of these options then it will also link to produce an executable or depending on other options a static or shared library

24888789
spaces	delimiter
notably while and + are valid characters in a url they re not valid within a url query parameter value because is used as delimiter between query parameters which would prematurely terminate your value and + is translated to a spaces character
unfortunately the standard percent-escaping leaves those delimiter unescaped

24892039
equals	gethashcode
the general contract is to always implement gethashcode if you override equals as you can t always be sure in advance that later users won t put your objects in hashtables
this implementation of equals is already invalid as it is not transitive

24892041
equals	gethashcode
as others have noted though this isn t what equals is normally for and breaks assumptions that many other things may use for equals such as transitivity - edit turns out this is actually contractual requirement so no-go so it s definitely worth at least considering comparing these manually or with an explicitly separate equality comparer
having gethashcode always return a constant is the only legal way of fulfilling the equals hashcode constraint

24899469
mdpi	hdpi
mdpi is 1.0 as you said not 1.5
if you create an image that is 480x800 in the mdpi folder it will be scaled up to 720x1200 on an hdpi device or 960x1600 on an xhdpi device

24900192
implements	extends
i tried something like imagedata.size large .url i think it didn t work for me because my bean doesn t implements map
i notice you re extends hashmap

24900298
jar	war
edit you either bundled an older version of the jar or an older version of the jar is visible from your application classpath
may be that you added the jar to your project build path but you are not bundling it into your war deployed on tomcat

24900680
swift	objective-c
the working with cocoa data types section of using swift with cocoa and objective-c says emphasis mine core foundation objects returned from annotated apis are automatically memory managed in swift you do not need to invoke the cfretain cfrelease or cfautorelease functions yourself
if you return core foundation objects from your own c functions and objective-c methods annotate them with either cf_returns_retained or cf_returns_not_retained

24902364
daemons	systemd
imagine also a systemd with a buggy daemons not yours but something else which take ages to terminate
then your daemons might not have time to do something sensible

24904805
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is simply not intended to be used like that for a long time
puppy linux is way more suitable for your needs since it is originally created to live on usb drive forever

24910854
webclient	httpwebrequest
i tried many different ways to access the source webchannelfactory webclient httpwebrequest response tcpclient but failed so far
finding this thread i focused on httpwebrequest response where i have the same problem that following line is blocking as artiom chilaru stated if it s blocking something is wrong because it should not

24911314
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
you need to start by understanding the graphics view scene system. for example you state the following - i m going to have a qgraphicsview on it are... this doesn t make sense
a qgraphicsview is like a window into a world the qgraphicsscene

24916047
bower	npm
i configure grunt and bower manually quick and dirty install node with npm. then from your console developer command prompt for vs2013 bash or whatever you use run the following commands npm install grunt --save npm install bower --save npm grunt-font-awesome-vars --save bower doesn t need grunt
grunt doesn t need bower

24921206
octal	decimal
seems octal doesn t get much attention at least not as much as decimal and hexadecimal
first read in the octal value drop the o or other indicator via readoct

24921935
serializable	deserialization
hence you would add json.net to your project add the corresponding using statement and use the following to deserialize your response the additional benefit is that json.net is a much more efficient serializable so the code runs in general faster
the key of this issue is that restsharp uses its own internal json serializable deserializer which does not support deserialization of array objects parentproductids in your case

24921935
serializable	deserialization
the key of this issue is that restsharp uses its own internal json serializable deserializer which does not support deserialization of array objects parentproductids in your case
it does support deserialization of list generics objects

24922220
equals	gethashcode
however the reverse is not true equals hash codes do not imply object equality because different unequal objects can have identical hash codes
furthermore the .net framework does not guarantee the default implementation of the gethashcode method and the value this method returns may differ between .net framework versions and platforms such as 32-bit and 64-bit platforms

24924255
implements	extends
the short answer is no you can not do it but you can implements a orexample it s pretty easy only check the source code of the example and change the and for or see sourcecode line 329
since the methods are protected you can extends it and override just the necesary

24925824
debian	linux
from the docs docker is available only as part of rhel7 onwards not sure about debian
linux containers involves things like resource management process isolation and security

24926951
serializable	deserialization
you can t serializable interface s because there is no way to restore them
for the deserialization something like new igrouping would be needed and that s not possible

24929800
mongodb	bson
mongodb uses bson which is the binary and typed form derived from the json spec
conforming to the general json semantics the keys of a bson document must be strings and not of any other specific type

24930708
jar	manifest.mf
you need to add a class-path entry to the manifest file meta-inf manifest.mf inside the jar class-path c ... myprogram
this assumes that there are dependent classes under c ... myprogram not jar files

24931923
union	distinct
you ll need to name your column in at least the first query in the union otherwise it will not have the name a in the outer query
select min a as a from select min column1 as a from mytable union select min column2 from mytable union select min column3 from mytable if your columns are indexed individually or as the first field of a composite index using min in this way will allow use of min max optimisation thanks cl. although i d use union all instead of union to avoid a distinct step

24932110
client-side	server-side
the percentages are values for each benefit based on my personal weightings where a perfect generator would be 100 generator- angular- fullstack offers 8 that meanjs.org doesn t 1.9 client-side end-to-end tests 0.6 factory 0.5 provider 0.4 sass 0.4 less 0.4 compass 0.4 decorator 0.4 endpoint subgenerator 0.4 comments 0.3 fontawesome 0.3 run server in debug mode 0.3 save generator answers to a file 0.2 constant 0.2 development build script ....

24933328
swift	objective-c
from xcode 6 beta 4 release notes known issues testing unit tests written in objective-c cannot currently import the swift generated interfaces header product_module_name -swift.h for application targets and therefore cannot be used to test code that requires this header
16931027 workaround unit tests for swift code should be written in swift

24934206
stateless	stateful
doing it stateless and making two separate web application usually is overkill. what i usually end up doing is
make my restapi stateful because usually scaling is not an issue and simple form authentication will suffice

24936548
getdate	datepart
the result is 00 10 38 638s 600s + 38s 10 minutes and 38 seconds another example select distinct convert char 8 dateadd s datediff s crdate getdate 1900-1-1 8 from sysobjects order by 1
i can mention four important functions of ms sql server that can be very useful 1 the function datediff is responsible to calculate difference between two dates the result could be year quarter month dayofyear day week hour minute second millisecond microsecond nanosecond specified on the first parameter datepart select datediff day 1997-10-07 2011-09-11 2 you can use the function getdate to get the actual time and calculate difference of some date and actual date select datediff day 1997-10-07 getdate 3 another important function is dateadd used to convert some value in datetime using the same datepart of the datediff that you can add with positive values or substract with negative values to one base date select dateadd day 45 getdate -- actual datetime adding 45 days select dateadd s -638 getdate -- actual datetime subtracting 10 minutes and 38 seconds 4 the function convert was made to format the date like you need it is not parametric function but you can use part of the result to format the result like you need select convert char 8 getdate 8 -- part hh mm ss of actual datetime select convert varchar getdate 112 -- yyyymmdd select convert char 10 getdate 20 -- yyyy-mm-dd limited by 10 characters datetime cold be calculated in seconds and one interesting result mixing these four function is to show a formated difference um hours minutes and seconds hh mm ss between two dates .

24936657
calloc	malloc
the tests are not equivalent because using calloc and maybe value initialization does not actually 0 the memory until it is touched
whereas your manual setting of the malloc d memory to 0 causes it to be touched and therefore allocated

24936834
email	dkim
an alternative is to use a function like the following to generate the keys nb2 django send_mail doesn t provide any tools to authenticate your email
if you want to authenticate your email dkim spf i advise you to look into this nb3 there is a security issue with the view new_activation_link it should check if the user requesting the re-send is the right one and also if he isn t already authenticated

24938657
rspec	capybara
poltergeist runs the server in the separate thread which means that it can not see anything that is written to the database in rspec although it can be accessed directly from the rspec code
there is a description of this phenomenon on the capybara homepage

24939913
namenode	hdfs
the actual settings file is in the datanode folder not the namenode folder as evidenced by the lack of dfs.datanode.data.dir values in the latter
using centos 6.5 the cloudera manager special files do not show up in a search files result because their permissions are set to hide from all but the hdfs user

24941425
awt	swing
since awt does not explicitly depends on the double-buffered property of components the painting artifacts are most likely caused by the swing painting code
the bug is reassigned to swing for further evaluation

24942847
swift	objective-c
the anomalies you are seeing are because there is some implicit conversion happening between the basic swift types and the basic objective-c types
in swift for example string is a struct and therefore cannot be added to an anyobject array

24944138
opcache	apc
it s entirely compatible with the original but leaves the zend-code cache for opcache
while opcache doesn t support the user-side caching functionality of apc it can still be a useful tool and so the pecl module apcu was extracted from the original

24945004
google-chrome	firefox
it usually but not consistently works in firefox google-chrome when run from the console but not from an embedded script
in google-chrome the sheet property is always null the same way google-chrome treats cross-domain stylesheets

24945814
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome adjusts the file size to 0 when you delete a file
sadly firefox does not do this

24945932
postgresql	mysql
cur.execute insert into table_name_here id date timest ... for string concatenation postgresql uses sql-standard double quotes not two single quotes
master which does not work in default mysql

24947269
innodb	myisam
innodb was not a default storage engine until mysql 5.5
in my case myisam was the default storage engine and did not support the transactions

24947557
caanimation	calayer
the real solution is not use calayer animations but caanimation
calayer animations are not queued but compounded

24948594
wordpress	joomla
you cannot compare them as wordpress is almost all written in php.
there are many worpress like cms-es like drupal joomla etc

24948900
swift	objective-c
the header that has the -swift suffix is a bridging header and is what you use to bridge objective-c code so that it can be used in your swift application
in which case you do not need to create an external interface as described here swift how can i create external interface for static library public headers analog in objective-c .h with swift you identify your public interface by marking classes and methods as public

24950414
swift	objective-c
unfortunately an enum is not transferrable to swift from objective-c it needs to be an ns_enum
i have the same setup as you in a project where i need the enum from an objective-c framework and use it in swift

24952192
aggregate-functions	sum
i am not overly familiar with postgres syntax but based on the documentation it would appear that the returning statement returns computes value s on a per-row basis for each row that is inserted so using an aggregate-functions max on a per-row basis has no meaning in this context
there are perhaps more elegant ways of writing the query but this should suffice assuming i have made no syntax mistakes select sum value1 sum value2 max value2 as max_all_groups from example_groups group by user_name order by max_all_groups desc -- order from highest to lowest maximum value per user limit 1 -- get top row obviously if you are just wanting the max value across all groups returned for your insert into statement and do not care about the sum ... columns you can remove them

24952511
super	extends
these methods are just normal methods so you ll have to extends them exactly as normal methods from django.db import models class urlimagefield models.imagefield def __set__ self instance value super .__set__ instance contentfile urllib.request.urlopen value image.png
you don t want to and cannot overload assignment but you simply want to extends the imagefield descriptor. descriptors are explained in the descriptor howto guide in depth

24953123
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in fact if you have a look at the headers for these classes you ll see that they also provide this functionality through a category on uiviewcontroller -- so from now on every childviewcontroller can call self.yourcontainer to get a reference to your custom container or nil if it is not contained in one
if so you can simply call self.navigationcontroller from within firstviewcontroller or secondviewcontroller it will traverse the parentviewcontroller chain upwards until it reaches a uinavigationcontroller or subclass - then you would call - pushviewcontroller animated on that navigationcontroller

vim	sublimetext
in sublimetext you mark each match of a pattern before doing the change mark cmd+d mark cmd+d mark cmd+d mark cmd+d change foo in vim you mark a pattern do the change once and repeat it on further instances of that pattern but since you have 7.4 you can use the new gn normal mode command motion and shorten the process above to which is not that bad i think
the canonical vim way to do that the dot formula as coined by drew neil is the reverse of the sublimetext way

24957839
innodb	tokudb
your primary problem is that myisam is not the best engine neither is innodb
tokudb would be your best bet but you d have to install that on the server

24959561
thunk	trampolines
in your function the nesting goes 3000 deep and thus the stack is overflowed as soon as the first item is requested and the 3000 nested thunk are unwound
the implementation of lazy-sequences will in general unwind nested thunk trampolines style when seq ed and not blow the stack however if you call seq within the lazy-sequence on the unrealized portion while realizing it.

build.gradle	gradlew
adding this to the build.gradle for the module fixes it
turns out this seems to be a bug with intellij and how gradlew not setting the resource directory for the test sourcesets correctly

24965111
jmeter	soapui
actually it is much better than soapui because with jmeter you can easily read the data from csv and parameterize it
soapui free version does not provide the option

24967391
innodb	myisam
you know that you can t use fulltext indexes in an innodb table in mysql 5.0 but you could copy the searchable text data to a myisam table and use fulltext indexes there
i wouldn t recommend making the myisam table be the only copy of that data

24967702
uicollectionview	uitableview
however in terms of intuitiveness and simplicity the uicollectionview is the better of the two options
if you feel comfortable with a uitableview then picking up a uicollectionview is not at all difficult

24968145
google-chrome	safari
after crawling around on the development forums i found out that apparently safari has no such events unlike google-chrome or if there are any they are undocumented and therefore not meant to be used
i think your best bets are a request the feature via apple s bug-reporting and feature-requesting site b set up an external service that can monitor library safari extensions or the extensions.plist file for deletion which is probably enormously difficult considering the security risks c keep track of the active user base instead by pinging an external service once a day or on some other interval

24968897
client-side	server-side
while client-side is good for ux it doesn t let you be sure all will be good
at some point you will need server-side validation convertion anyway

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome uses the 16x16 windows or 32x32 mac png icon
firefox uses the latest declared png icon see bug 751712 although it apparently doesn t always behave that way

firefox	safari
firefox uses the latest declared png icon see bug 751712 although it apparently doesn t always behave that way
safari uses the biggest png icon it can find

24969828
multiplication	modulo
essentially you need to split both multiplicands into hi lo unsigned 32-bit and perform long multiplication taking care of carries and columns between the partial 64-bit products
divide and modulo return 64 bit results given 64 bit arguments - so that s not an issue as you have defined the problem

24970761
swift	objective-c
from swift docs you ll have access to anything within a class or protocol that s marked with the objective-c attribute as long as it s compatible with objective-c
this excludes swift-only features such as those listed here 7 generics tuples enumerations defined in swift structures defined in swift top-level functions defined in swift global variables defined in swift typealiases defined in swift swift-style variadics nested types curried functions for example a method that takes a generic type as an argument or returns a tuple will not be usable from objective-c

24971503
base	fractions
the integer and fractions parts both consist of a sequence of decimal base ten digits
either the integer part or the fractions part not both can be omitted

24972419
persistent	transient
it has lot of pre-checks before it go actual merge if required if object is transient it simply fires insert query makes object persistent attached to session if object is detached fires select query to check whether data modified or not if modified fires update query otherwise just ignore merge task
where as session.update throws exception if object is transient

24973742
swift	objective-c
tuple is not compatible in objective c .you can use dictionary instead of tuple .from swift documentation
you ll have access to anything within a class or protocol that s marked with the objective-c attribute as long as it s compatible with objective-c

24974072
spaces	delimiter
you can use awk instead alternatively you can use tr -s to squeeze multiple spaces
it is because cut doesn t work well with multiple occurrences of delimiter

24976420
comparator	comparable
to clarify more it is firstly calling this the current calling object then calling getfirstkey on it and then calling standard comparable interface s comparator method
next the parameter being passed to comparator method in the inner-definition of outer comparator method is of type that.getgetsecondarykey .it doesn t match the parameter of type of outer comparator method as outer comparator method has argument of type doublekey whereas inner comparator method has arguments of type that.getsecondarykey ---referentially j

24976420
comparator	comparable

so now clearly parameters passed to outer and inner comparator methods differ.inner comparator is the standard comparator as defined in comparable interface and that s why the author has implemented comparable interface

24977197
ubuntu	linux
here is another link that shows the porting logic there is another effort to build android compability layer in vanilla kernel like ubuntu fedora etc so that you can play with the android apps on your pc
there are lots of differences between android kernel and vanilla kernel to overcome a lot of the ipc problems android does not have any of the normal ipc mechanism and so the kernel does not implement it found in normal linux shared memory named pipes semaphores etc

24977468
multiplying	multiplication
while for standard arithmetics where the bit width remains the same the sign doesn t matter it s a completely different story for multiplying long
and that s the reason there are two separate instructions for arm umull and smull for long multiplying while a single mul instruction will do for 32bit both signed and unsigned multiplication

swift	objective-c
this explains how you can import objective-c file into swift
you can not import the objective-c file in swift by simply #import statement

24978409
swift	objective-c
you can not import the objective-c file in swift by simply #import statement
you need to create objective-c bridging header and import the file in this bridging header

bluestacks	android-emulator
other options for speeding up android android-emulator intel haxm hardware accelerated execution manager article bluestacks app player article jar of beans disclaimer i m not affiliated with any of these projects nor have i tried any of them myself so i can t vouch for their quality or compatibility with the arm-based android distributions but from reading about them folks seem to really like the performance and development debugging on such devices should in theory easily transfer to arm-based ones
per comments on my earlier answer it seems that an issue with the android-emulator is its speed

24987838
viewdidload	viewwillappear
my guess is that viewwillappear is being called but viewdidload is not at least not when you expect it is
viewdidload should be called once but depending on how you re managing the view controllers viewdidload may not be triggered every time your view appears which happens after loading

24987838
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload should be called once but depending on how you re managing the view controllers viewdidload may not be triggered every time your view appears which happens after loading
the completion handler is called after the viewdidappear method is called on the presented view controller

24988562
persistent	transient
this means that when a java ee deployment implements a session preservation scheme for example tomcat will attempt to save current sessions to a .ser file on server shutdown if the deployer so chooses those session-scoped beans would also be part of the payload that will be persistent
a session scoped bean that isn t serializable becomes a problem here as it renders the entire http session that it is a part of un-persistable any attempt to serialize an object that contains an unserializable member will cause a notserializableexception except with some special handling incidentally that means that even if your session-scoped bean implements serializable all its member variables must either be serializable or be marked transient

24994548
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
you could even want to install the debugging variant of some system libraries on debian or ubuntu packages like libstdc++6-4.8-dbg etc... you should also consider using valgrind and with recent gcc compilers use some sanitizing option and you could trace some functions using a recent gdb since it may be scriptable in python
btw to understand how standard libraries work which syscalls they are calling you could not only strace a program using them but also since most standard libraries on linux are free software study their source code

24994716
oncreate	setcontentview
by examining you log i found java.lang.nullpointerexception looks like you have not set correct layout in your oncreate method
setcontentview r.layout.example

24996099
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
although the first constructor fileinputstream string name is probably used more often it is only the second one which is fileinputstream file file which allows for accurate checking of the input file using the file class methods before we link it with the inputstream
furthermore the process of creating an object of fileoutputstream class is not dependent on the existence or possible lack of the appropriate file

24997075
pandas	pytables
it s a bit tedious but not that bad another approach using pandas is here large data work flows using pandas
well the only practical solution for now is to use pytables directly since it s designed for out-of-memory operation.

here is some more information on the problem in firefox
personally i couldn t find much about safari on this topic

laravel	phalcon	laravel	codeigniter	codeigniter	phalcon
i am unsure if your question will be taken down as it being an opinion you know according to guidelines and all but imo - despite phalcon being fast for its c build i find being laravel 3 user transitioning from codeigniter before it retired with laravel 4 now - it has a lot of integration with known networks and architectures
not to bash phalcon as i have very minimal usage of it but here are some bullets for laravel easily modular with composer all packages can be imported in with the current psr standards from composer for rapid deployment of dependencies which codeigniter was lacking

profiling	debugging
it will profiling trace cuda and opencl kernels
i have heard rumour that nvidia have an internal version of nsight that will debugging opencl kernels but it has not been and imho will is unlikely to be released due to commercial reasons pushing cuda as the compute platform of choice

24999823
super	extends
only in b.a there s hiding of a since b is of type something which extends super and hides member a which is why it returns 25
a.a shouldn t return 25 since the type of a is the super type super and there s no hiding

24999993
stateless	stateful
question 1 - it depends on the bean type stateless - the specific bean instance will be discarded so subsequent requests will use new instances
since stateless inherently have no client affinity there shouldn t be any effect on calling code stateful mdb - the bean instance will be discarded and since instances are 1-to-1 with client references any data stored in the bean will be lost and the client would need to start over by creating a new bean

25002889
google-chrome	safari
so phantom 2.x when finally released won t be equivalent to any version of google-chrome
the quick answer is no phantom is using the same webkit rendering engine that google-chrome safari uses so cannot act like ie

25003480
bash	zsh
in one of the other answers some explanations about how it works in bash were presented
i m a user of zsh so i think it wouldn t be superfluous to show how i managed my task there configuring .zshrc file adding folder for your autocomplete functions enabling zsh tab-completion system note above accented lines must be added to .zshrc file

swift	objective-c
nowadays there is a difference between swift 2.2 and lesser when defining selectors
the bellow specifies callback on self which is assumed to be a nsobject of objective-c accessible the myaction function may have to be marked as objective-c because selectors still use objective-c runtime as of right now sorry about the funny coloring stackoverflow doesn t get the #selector stuff.

25007980
google-chrome	firefox
as you have mentioned that you intent to repeat the patterns images but not for the larger images i suggest you to use the following approach which i have tested in both firefox and ie and google-chrome demo html change the class of the div element that wraps the list of the larger images from patterns to images js add additonal logic to determine whether the clicked image is a pattern or cover image in the .click event
setting background with the jquery function .ccs appears to be a bug in firefox see link i suggest you to stick with background-image

25010881
strdup	malloc
strdup 3 is documented as the strdup function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string s
memory for the new string is obtained with malloc 3 and can be freed with free 3 . btw as matt mcnabb commented strdup is standard in posix not in the c99 language specification

25012489
istream	getline
if this is exactly numeric_limits max there is no limit link at cplusplus.com std istream ignore if you are going to skip a lot of lines you definitely should use it instead of getline when i needed to skip 100000 lines in my file it took about a second in opposite to 22 seconds with getline
the more efficient way is ignoring strings with std istream ignore handlereadinglineerror is not standart but hand-made of course. the first parameter is maximum number of characters to extract

25016135
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib	html5lib	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup ranks lxml s parser as being the best then html5lib s then python s built-in parser
this is because of the differences in beautifulsoup parsers as you can see html5lib cannot get the body from this particular html

25016135
html5lib	beautifulsoup
this is because of the differences in beautifulsoup parsers as you can see html5lib cannot get the body from this particular html
and according to the documentation html5lib would be chosen as a default in case lxml is not installed if you don t specify anything you ll get the best html parser that s installed

25017202
profiling	debugging
in order to solve the problem i did a clean-build-republish but it did not work recreated the profiling and readded the server with new profiling still did not work then finally re-installed rad and web-sphere but it still did not work
then i found the below article and realized it could be a problem due to some other os process interfering with debugging process port so i performed a system restore

25018774
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for webkit-based browsers apple safari google-chrome opera you can get rid of scrollbar with simple css it s easiest but not cross browser way
do not forget about still lame ie and firefox

25021747
ssl	https
so you would have to either move to a different host or buy the ssl just so the warning does not trigger before your htaccess has a chance to redirect
however if your website does not have a security certificate it s on a shared hosting environment and you don t want to get the warning when your website is being requested through https you can t redirect it using htaccess

25021845
bash	tcsh
it doesn t matter though since ssh and sshpass return the remote command s exit code this is how you should be doing it if you really wanted to run something in bash on the remote shell you could do use charles duffy s code with a minor change
jonathanleffler caught the problem right away -- you re not using bash but tcsh

25021845
bash	tcsh
jonathanleffler caught the problem right away -- you re not using bash but tcsh
tcsh has its own syntax incompatible with bash

25022780
swift	objective-c
one solution then would be to write a helper function in objective-c such as include the header with the function prototype in the swift bridging header so that it will be accessible as a global function from your swift code
this doesn t seem possible in swift at the moment

25025318
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the problem is not greediness but case-sensitivity currently your regex matches the 12 at the end of serialnun12 probably because it is case-sensitive
we have two options using upper-case or making the pattern case-insensitive

25025688
super	implements
when you call b.class.getinterfaces it returns a class containing only those interfaces explicitly declared by the class and not its superclasses although in reality it is implements interfaces which are implements by its superclasses. to solve it you need to recursively call the super class and get all the interfaces implemented.declaring an interface explicitly in your sub class will help you in this case
there is no difference if your sub class restates that it implements an interface.but there is a huge gain when it comes to reflection api.i have personally faced it

25025754
haskell	scheme
combine dummy.o and a.o ld -r dummy.o a.o -o temp.o mv temp.o dummy.o now you have a loadable haskell module dummy that also contains all of the a.o
update this scheme works if modules that use a.o dummy.o are compiled to object code and does not work if they are interpreted

25026358
implements	extends
so example from the c standard #define cbrt x _generic x long double cbrtl default cbrt float cbrtf x this macro implements an overloaded cbrt operation by dispatching on the type of the argument to the macro choosing an appropriate implementation function and then passing the original macro argument to that function
so to implement your original example we could do this foo_int int a foo_char char b foo_float_int float c int d #define foo _1 ... _generic _1 int foo_int char foo_char float _generic first __va_args__ int foo_float_int _1 __va_args__ #define first a ... a in this case we could have used a default association for the third case but that doesn t demonstrate how to extends the principle to multiple arguments

25027445
udp	tcp
however the server side works the fact remains that there has to be some way for the network layer to decide which tcp connection or udp listener to deliver a specific packet to
similarly for the transport layer i ll just consider tcp here since it s connection-oriented - udp is similar but doesn t mind losing packets

25031673
allocator	stl
ps lastly using a typedef as part of the allocator seems like a very bad separation of responsibility having its own template parameter seems cleaner because it has nothing to do with allocator rather it has something to do with implementation choices of specific methods of the container
ps2 edit i wish to add as said in the comments that the cannot be taken as an example of what is possible to do because it was a mistake in the standard and is actually an infringement of the stl requirement that a container defines .. reference as

25032636
phpstorm	webstorm
use phpstorm instead of webstorm
webstorm doesn t have php support that is why you can t use symfony2 plugin

25032999
bash	subshell
your break doesn t have a surrounding loop so it does not make sense and is an error bash break only meaningful in a for while or until loop
you need to kill the read command instead of course this is only a very crude solution not hiding any error messages issued by terminated subshell etc

25039930
udp	tcp
therefore any attempt to simulate udp with tcp must fail when you are trying send while no one is listening
obviously it s not very difficult to write a program that listens on udp and resends any data it receives to a peer over tcp

25039930
udp	tcp
obviously it s not very difficult to write a program that listens on udp and resends any data it receives to a peer over tcp
or likewise a program that listens on tcp and resends what it gets by udp

25046321
serializable	deserialization
it looks like this in this case the contents of this method would look like this for more information on this method and others look at the specification of the serializable class
your statement about the serializable interface not containing a method called on deserialization was incorrect - there is

25055689
postgresql	mysql
the code you have found is for postgresql with the postgis plugin
it will not work in mysql

25056355
implements	extends
since basicprofile has to make sure all that the defined methods of the trait are implements since you don t want to use an abstract class i d recommend using a case class for the basicprofile
you can extends the basicprofile with an idprofile class not case class and override the specific methods you are interesed in or leave them be

25056828
addition	modulo
in addition to the operations being processed in bulk there is an additional limiter in place from the async library
it s not really required but this ensures that essentially no more than the modulo limit of documents are in process at any time

25058595
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
unless you modify your graphicsmagick setup to make it use pngalpha in its delegate command the same as imagemagick uses your gm convert will not show transparent background
the reason why your imagemagick convert and your graphicsmagick gm convert commands produce different output is this both utilities are not able to process pdf input files directly both can only handle rater image formats

25058826
cdr	cons
bar in this case cdr would not be part of tree structure
note that while the car 1b component of each such cons is part of the tree structure the objects that are the cars of each cons in the tree are not themselves part of its tree structure unless they are also conses

google-chrome	safari
i found a fix for the warning on google-chrome
apparently the error on safari is an error that comes up on every download not particular to my application

25060555
implements	extends
once you have your custom class defined see here for how to implements the field in the schema.xml
it seems that there is no such field included by default but it shouldn t be too hard to write your own by extends the fieldtype class and using guava inetaddresses and guava converter

25062602
comparator	comparable
the class isn t comparable but nothing to worry we can write a comparator for it job done great
except poor client unwittingly violated the contract of treeset as the comparator provided isn t consistent with equals

25063620
implements	extends
therefore things like if statements are not implements into doctrine and won t be implements because the way mysql handles if for example is different from what postgresql does it it does not even exist
however doctrine 2 is so powerful that allows you to write your own functions and extends its functionality however i wouldn t recommend this unless it s really really necessary to do so

25064521
swift	objective-c
unfortunately i do not know if swift documentation is available online
all the links go to the objective-c documentation

25064929
portrait	landscape
my previous answer that was deleted i have the exact same problem on my nexus 5 and i noticed some additional points i only have the texture creation failed error for portrait shaped bitmaps
square bitmaps or landscape shaped bitmaps do not trigger these errors

25065219
g++	gcc
if you want to compile c++ with the c++ standard library use g++
make sure your hello world program has a .c extension and not a .cpp or similar extension gcc can compile c++ programs but it does not link in the c++ standard library it links in the standard c library

25069850
viewdidload	viewwillappear
first you shouldn t rely on the value of self.view in viewdidload
it is set to a correct value later in viewwillappear

jar	manifest.mf
package all the related other jar files into the same package
run the executable.jar as java -jar yourexecutable.jar and if it does not solve your problem just see my manifest.mf file in my executable jar file

25073295
addition	multiplication
furthermore most microcontrollers are tight on memory but have very fast single-clock addition subtraction and multiplication instructions
although a 16 16-bit multiplication with 32-bit result typically takes two or more instructions. a typical microcontroller does not have the rom flash capability to store enough interesting voxel patterns and only a few have dma capability from an sd card via spi so you could just load frames of voxel patterns from a microsd card but functions like the above can produce interesting shapes with few inputs -- and particularly inputs you can interpolate

25075526
equals	compareto
also note that this is unadvised behavior that do not follow the set interface contract since you did not override equals
only coffee one is added to the set since the treeset returns equality according to the compareto and since the element is already in the set noting will happen when you try to add two

25075526
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
from the java docs treeset note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

draggable	droppable
i found that the draggable option revert can have functions as well other than true false valid invalid values. you can assign a function to revert which will execute even when the draggable is dropped in a droppable and also when it is not dropped on the droppable
well i had this problem too to execute some function if a draggable isn t accepted by a droppable

25076771
draggable	droppable
well i had this problem too to execute some function if a draggable isn t accepted by a droppable
after lot of searching i found that you can have functions for a scenario where a draggable is not accepted by the droppable

concave	angle
it does not need to be precise but on complex concave shapes wrongly selected center position will cause errors in output mesh
add angular info for each vertex angle is easy just use after all this it should looks like this for angle angle deg index 0 1 2 3 4 green 355 085 135 170 230 blue 020 135 255 now you just match 2 closest vertexes from one polygon to the other do not forget that angle difference is max + -180 deg and also if you use radians then convert constants 180 360 to for next text line i j will mean i-th vertex from green and j-th vertex from blue polygon now the joining join closest vertexes just process all green vertexes and join them to closest blue vertex black lines on image line 0 0 line 1 1 line 2 1 line 3 1 line 4 2 fill the holes mesh triangulation need at least 2 joints per vertex so process points that have less connections index 0 1 2 3 4 green connections 1 1 1 1 1 blue connections 1 3 1 so now process less then 2 times used blue vertexes 0 2 and join them to closest green vertex yellow lines on image ignoring already used connection chose next one in that case line 1 0 line 3 2 so index 0 1 2 3 4 green connections 1 2 1 2 1 blue connections 2 3 2 now process the rest of green less then 2 times used vertexes joined to less then 3 times used blue vertex

swift	objective-c
the data model inspector has now two fields class and module for an entity when you create a swift managed object subclass for the entity the module field is set to current product module and with this setting creating instances works both in the main application and in unit tests. the managed object subclass must not be marked with objective-c classname this was observed in
alternatively you can empty the module field it will show none and mark the managed object subclasses with objective-c classname this was observed in

25078514
swift	objective-c
i think this is a bug because swift should define for c enums or an to int conversion but it doesn t
the simplest workaround is redefining your c enum as which will allow llvm to process the enum and convert it to a swift enum ns_enum also improves your objective-c code

25078573
opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
desktop browsers google-chrome firefox gecko internet explorer opera safari 38 25 25 not supported 25 7.1 mobile browsers android google-chrome for android firefox mobile gecko ie mobile opera mobile safari mobile not supported not supported 25.0 25 not supported not supported ios 8
firefox 25+ supports a math.log10 method

25081168
ubuntu	linux
third at least on my ubuntu 14.04 machine it would appear that running nproc doesn t require sudo in the first place
lastly since you re using linux you re probably better off using popen to capture the output of nproc instead of piping it to a file

25081529
ionic	angular
you re using the ionic which is fine but adds a layer that s hard to target
the .item-content div isn t in your template - it looks like ionic is providing this... but regardless if you re willing to adjust where in your dom you need this background image it s easy to set them in angular

25081719
fgets	getchar
your second call to getchar after the first fgets then reads that last character not the newline so the second call to fgets stops early because it immediately hits a newline
instead you ll want to allocate n + 1 characters for each string and call fgets with n + 1 as well

25083155
google-chrome	firefox
check out this jsfiddle - it is using .one but i was able to verify that when using .on the problem happened in firefox and not google-chrome
it looks like in firefox the call to .slidetoggle is triggering the domsubtreemodified event while this is not happening in google-chrome

25083155
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like in firefox the call to .slidetoggle is triggering the domsubtreemodified event while this is not happening in google-chrome
so basically in firefox something initially triggers the event which binds your click handler

25083316
serializable	deserialization
according to the human logic it is not needed for marshaling serializable
for example the most popular json library jackson does have such a requirement only for deserialization

25083703
dictionary	map
in your case you have a dictionary named that apparently does not have the key view scientific
you need to figure out why your map is missing this key

25085311
addition	multiplication
your first problem is in this function you say you will return an int int poly addition poly b ------ promise to return int but you return c where c is a poly
furthermore int poly multiplication poly b doesn t return anything as it stands

25087592
rsa	aes
to encrypt more data you could use a larger rsa key but rsa really shouldn t be used for encrypting large amounts of data so is usually used as part of a hybrid cryptosystem where rsa is instead used to encrypt a randomly generated key for a symmetric algorithm like aes and then the symmetric algorithm is used to encrypt the actual data so avoiding the length limits associated with rsa
the length of data that can be encrypted using rsa is determined primarily by the size of the key you re using

25087612
super	self
so for __new__ self must still be passed super ... .__new__ self ...
you should not pass self to super ... .__init__ as super ... .__init__ returns the bound method class aclass base def __init__ self resource super aclass self .__init__ resource also i m not sure what get is

25087612
super	self
you should not pass self to super ... .__init__ as super ... .__init__ returns the bound method class aclass base def __init__ self resource super aclass self .__init__ resource also i m not sure what get is
usually super s first argument should be the class from which it is called -- in this case aclass

25089329
udp	tcp
i m not sure why you chose udp in the first place but chances are you d be much better off using regular tcp sockets if at all possible
it sounds like you re going to wind up re-inventing most of tcp on your way to solving your problem

25092523
.htaccess	httpd.conf
is the minimal set you need for laravel s .htaccess or use allowoverride all if this doesn t work and you don t care for security
i had this problem on windows with manually installed apache 2.2 and the cause was a missing allowoverride in my virtualhost as the root directory in httpd.conf was defaulted to none

25092743
clang	llvm
for 32-bit i686-w64-mingw32 and 64-bit x86_64-w64-mingw32 clang assumes as below some_directory bin gcc.exe some_directory bin clang.exe some_directory bin clang++.exe some_directory bin .. include c++ gcc_version some_directory bin .. include c++ gcc_version x86_64-w64-mingw32 some_directory bin .. include c++ gcc_version i686-w64-mingw32 some_directory bin .. include c++ gcc_version backward some_directory bin .. x86_64-w64-mingw32 include some_directory bin .. i686-w64-mingw32 include some_directory bin .. include this probing logic can be found in initheadersearch.cpp located here line 374 as of writing this c mingw msys 1.0 src llvm tools clang lib frontend initheadersearch.cpp ensure that the version of gcc that your mingw installer used matches a supported version 4.6.2 is my case by looking here c mingw lib gcc mingw32 4.6.2
if your version of gcc does not seem to be supported automatically clang will be usable to resolve standard libraries and headers you want this

25095737
passenger	unicorn
in case anyone is experiencing this finally we have made the switch from unicorn to passenger and this issue has been resolved i am not sure but the problem may have something to do with post requests on slow clients
passenger nginx says request response buffering - the included nginx buffers requests and responses thus protecting your app against slow clients mobile devices on mobile networks and improving performance

25097227
super	self
super finds the overriden method and binds it to self you are not swapping out classes
super derived self .f2 finds the next f2 method on the base class and binds that to self

25097638
swift	objective-c
but fundamentally if you have a type that you want to pass in and find it s objective c encoding type you can use the nsobject s objctype method if you need to pass it through as an unmolested c string anyway you may not even need to convert it back to a swift string type
no there isn t - because under the hood swift classes don t use objective-c introspection to do their work

25097638
swift	objective-c
no there isn t - because under the hood swift classes don t use objective-c introspection to do their work
there s no need to calculate this like there is in objective-c in order to pass call data

25098005
swift	objective-c
update for swift 2 and later as of swift 2 xcode 7 this can be simplified
due to the objective-c lightweight generics self.view.subviews is already declared as in swift therefore the cast is not necessary anymore

25099617
google-chrome	firefox
this pure js version works in google-chrome but not in ie
not sure about firefox

25100663
ienumerable	ilist
hence you could alter your aredimensionsequal method to feature an ienumerable vector argument the code given is functionally equivalent to the aredimensionsequal method as shown in the question
the generic type parameter t in ilist t is not covariant

25100927
gmail	hotmail
unfortunately hover effects are not supported in outlook 2007 2010 gmail ios or android
the supporting clients are outlook 2000 2003 hotmail apple mail and yahoo

25103138
factors	matrix
true but if you ll read rbind documentation you will see that for cbind rbind vectors of zero length including null are ignored unless the result would have zero rows columns for s compatibility. zero-extent matrix do not occur in s3 and are not ignored in r. another properties of rbind is that it inherited it s properties from data.frame while one of them is what happened here could be easily illustrated in a dummy example consider you can see two things here data.frame automatically converted character class to factors when trying to parse a new level to factors vector it converts it into na and throws the exact error you were receiving as mentioned by akrun setting to will solve your problem
for example by adding print class yy print str newdf you would see that after first iteration both newdf vectors become factors

25105001
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
it s not my experience that nsurlsession is any slower than nsurlconnection is
i wonder especially without seeing code for nsurlsession implementation if your nsurlsession implementation is not caching for some reason

25107143
super	extends
i had to remove the r.raw.ormlite_config value that i used in the databasehelper class which i am passing to the super
my dbhelper class that extends the extends ormlitesqliteopenhelper needs to not use the raw folder yet

25107901
decoder	encoder
ffmpeg can be compiled with libstagefrihht which makes use of the built-in hardware decoder but unfortunately does not include an encoder
ffmpeg may use optional x264 encoder if configured this way

25109852
prepare	execute
as the other answer suggested this rake db test prepare will also setup your testing db but you have to run the rspec command after that so personally i prefer the first option
the point here is that rspec command doesn t execute migrations on your test database

25110330
strcpy	strncpy
then copy the variable-size string into it strcpy person currentperson
if you are not certain that currentperson will fit into person strncpy person currentperson size_max_person_name - 1

25111723
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy sentence sub
the strncpy function does not null-terminate its buffer if the source string doesn t fit

25111723
strcpy	strncpy
then the strcpy causes undefined behaviour because sub isn t a string
my advice is to not use strncpy it is almost never a good solution to a problem

25113969
memmove	strncpy
you can use strncpy instead of memmove but it has a more complex loop condition than memmove it has to check for a null byte as well as the count whereas memmove only has to check the count
you can use memcpy instead of memmove if you re sure there s no overlap between source and target but memmove always works and memcpy sometimes doesn t though only when the source and target areas overlap and i prefer reliability over possible misbehaviour

25116180
google-chrome	firefox
a method that works on google-chrome and ie but not firefox version 31 is to use a pseudo-element added at the end of the first div and to specify a page break before it
to make the pseudo-element non-empty browsers might otherwise combine the page breaks into one insert a no-break space there since this does not work in firefox it is better to use a dummy div element

25116912
postgresql	mysql
and you can use that as well in postgresql
this query in mysql is not valid sql according to the standard or other databases

25117917
profiling	instrumentation
poor man s profiling doesn t require any code instrumentation at all
see this example of usage albeit for allocation profiling but the idea is the same

25118715
jar	war
if you have the same or similar jar file in both places this will lead to class loading issues such as you describe
you need to check the web-inf lib directory of your war files to ensure that they do not contain jars that also exist in the ear lib directory

25119011
scikit-learn	nltk
since one of your tag is scikit-learn i ll assume you re using nltk which enables you to use it directly via nltk.download
while i m not aware of implementations details once you dispose of both the predicted and actual sets you should be able to use the provided functions of scikit-learn such as confusion_matrix

25119089
pickle	dill
the reason pickle fails and dill doesn t is that dill treats __main__ like a module for the most part and also can pickle class definitions instead of pickling by reference like pickle does
the reason dill can pickle a lambda is that it gives it a name then pickling magic can happen

25124352
client-side	server-side
since javascript jquery is client-side as mandeep has pointed out in the comments you cannot retain your class when the page refreshes
you would have to use server-side code to detect the current route url and then add the active class to it

25124703
client-side	server-side
in this case you can t mix your client-side likes method in mongoid ruby with server-side query sorting implemented in c++ by the mongodb server. your only choices are to be compatible with existing state and processing that are available on one side or the other
on the client-side you can fetch the data into ruby objects and then sort in ruby using your likes method. this is subject to efficiency issues for the amount of data fetched and the cost of the likes method for sorting. if the count of your documents is non-trivial you will want to memoize the result of the likes method into your data before sorting so that the likes method is not called for every comparison in the sort

25125833
client-side	server-side
javascript not including things such as node.js is a client-side scripting language that executes purely on the client in a web browser
php on the other hand is a server-side scripting language that executes on the server

25126950
mongodb	bson
the number of documents returned will be a function of how big your documents are cursor batches the mongodb server returns the query results in batches
batch size will not exceed the maximum bson document size

25127980
rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtcp	rtsp	rtcp
as far as tools go you can use openrtsp from which handles the transport for you rtp over rtsp via the -t command line argument and writes the frames to file
with reference to ainitak s comment it s not that complex there s a 4 byte header followed by the channel id followed by the 2 byte length of the following rtp rtcp packet

25128583
uicollectionview	uitableview
uicollectionview s performbatchupdates completion method does not require you to call back to the collection view when you are doing with the updates presumably because the block of work that you pass in to update the collection view is wrapped with those calls for you
uitableview predates blocks being added to objective-c

25129257
uilabel	uibutton
the uilabel class is used just to display text on the screen
sure you can detect taps not clicks on it but theres a uikit class specifically crafted to handle actions on the screen and that s uibutton

25130535
.htaccess	httpd.conf
php_ini_perdir means that the entry can be set in php.ini .htaccess httpd.conf or .user.ini since php 5.3 . for .htaccess php_flag mail.add_x_header off i have not personally tested this so ymmv
according to the php manual php manual function reference mail related extensions mail installing configuring that header can be turned off using php.ini or .htaccess file which would prevent anyone from gleaning information from your mail headers without you having access to your php.ini file

25131126
scala	typesafe
if you convert the scala code for sfoo and sfoobar to equivalent java code it doesn t compile because java enforces the rule that overriding methods cannot throw exceptions that weren t thrown by the method they are overriding
this makes checked exceptions typesafe when upcasting when converting a sfoobar to an sfoo

25131358
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that your input does not only contain the tokens you re looking for but also commas and spaces apparently
thus you have to tell your scanner to use a specific delimiter to understand that he has to tokenise your input stream on this string

25143118
onreadystatechange	onload
one is example is it doesn t support the onreadystatechange event
so if you want to switch between them like in the question you will need to make sure you use onload not onreadystatechange and check any other functionality is interchangeable

25143861
boxlayout	grouplayout	boxlayout	miglayout
i do not recommend to use the boxlayout manager -- it is very weak and leads to poor code
i recommend to use either the miglayout manager or the grouplayout manager

25143907
tabcontrol	tabitem
and no a tabcontrol there is no such thing as a tabpage in wpf does not only accept tabitem because just like any other itemscontrol the tabcontrol wraps each of it s items in an item container provided that the item itself is not an item container
this means that if you place for example a as an item of the tabcontrol wpf will automatically wrap the checkbox with a tabitem

25144585
division	modulo
numberofdays 365 is not division - it is a modulo
basically it will give you the remainder from division by 365

25148619
apache	nginx
and apache alias static var www myproject static hope this helps.
when using djangos development server i have found that this problem and its solution normally lies in the urls file when debug true something like this will allow you to use django to serve your static files this will mean that any urls serving from static_url will be handled by django here are the django docs on this edit added solution for running under a webserver not django development server if you are running your project behind a webserver and not using djangos runserver then its probably best you dont use djangos static file finder and instead use its static file collector and the webserver to serve static files to do this try this in your settings.py then run . manage.py collectstatic and ensure your webserver redirects requests from static to the full path of your static files directory e.g in nginx you might do

25150803
jlist	jtable
the long and short of it all is jlist simply isn t designed to support structured data in this way this is why we have jtable .
a jtable on the other hand is perfect for displaying structured data and with some simple tweaks can be made to appear seamless.

25151659
implements	extends
interface cannot implements other interface
it can extends it

25151755
matlab	simulink
the bottom line is that matlab compiler only supports deploying pre-trained neural networks
neural network toolbox can be compiled pre-trained network command line functions cannot be compiled all other command line functionality apps and uis simulink blocks gensim this means you cannot mcc -compile functions with training functionality anything containing train adapt etc... you can only deploy functions that evaluate simulate an already trained network object sim function and the like

25151755
matlab	simulink
i m not a simulink expert so i ll leave it to you to explore this approach gensim net in each approach above first three anyway the idea is to compile the simulate functions into one of the supported targets by matlab compiler standalone executable shared library java package .net assembly then deploy the generated component
actually approach #2 and #3 can also be converted into c c++ source code using matlab coder codegen

25152397
set	bag
you have a set here mdash
a unique collection of objects as opposed to a bag a collection of objects that allows duplicates and is not necessarily unique mdash

25153042
profiling	instrumentation
if you look at the note on the page op linked to it says note the automation instrumentation only works with apps that have been code signed with a development provisioning profiling
apps signed with a distribution provisioning profiling can not be automated with the ui automation programming interface

25155761
grouplayout	miglayout
i have also created two examples with miglayout manager and grouplayout manager. they are easier to use and more portable
one of the big drawbacks of the gridbaglayout manager is that it is not resolution independent. miglayout solution miglayout is a very flexible third-party layout manager

25164304
decimal	ieee
if an approximate result is good enough and there are lots of calculations where it is you can use double but be aware that it s a binary floating point number and accurate rounding to decimal might not always be possible
although in certain cases it might work in general there is no way to determine force the decimal precision of a double value or indeed any ieee floating point number

25168331
jar	war
you need to either copy the jar to the web-inf lib directory in the project or put it in the tomcat lib directory
when you add file in dependencies as external jar it does not get included in the war file when building the app

25168760
move	drag
however button1 appears to not move
but if i drag the top left corner the opposite is true

25168787
spaces	delimiter
a spaces as the beginning boundary and then a spaces or a period or a comma or a semi-colon as the ending boundary you can try with capturing groups with as substitution
demo sample code note use single spaces instead of s that match any white spaces character edited by o p did not need opening spaces as delimiter

25171450
union	distinct
you need to do a union of id columna with id columnb then summarize and order the result
like so select name group_concat distinct id order by id as ids from select id a as name from names union select id b as name from names as t where name is not null group by name order by name this will give you one row per name with a list of ids row numbers containing that name

25172932
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 31+ firefox 29+ opera 23+ android 4.4+ safari 9+ edge 12+ google-chrome for android update 2016 02 28 as the chart linked above will make clear all evergreen browsers now have supports support
font-feature-settings using small caps text figures on the web google-chrome firefox ie10+ this isn t perfect since ie10 11 don t implement supports you miss one browser

25174920
clang	llvm
note that i did manage to build a simple hello world but it failed miserably when running it especially when exception are involved long story short stick to mingw gcc for windows its the most reliable thing you will get here the output of building a simple hello world with codelite on my machine using clang 3.4 downloaded from llvm website and letting codelite detect it from settings- build settings- auto detect compilers it compiles fine however when i run it - it prints the hello world message and crashes instantly note that the reason that clang is using mingw include paths is simple it does not come with its own header files instead it relies on their existence codelite uses your default mingw compiler include paths and uses them for clang to conclude i strongly recommend you to stick to mingw or vc eran author of codelite ide
to make things simpler i am pretty sure that clang is not ready for windows development. other than code completion library i have not seen a single production application successfully compiled with clang under msw

25177448
portrait	landscape
and the main layout of this popup to note 3 my app is forced to stay in portrait mode
i haven t test this in landscape mode but i assume some modifications should be made not sure though

25180841
translation	localization
a quick procedure is i store all your strings in the resource file along with a key ii refer the keys in your xaml do not hardcode iii translation manually or by using bing
i think you are talking about localization and globalisation basically you need to add all your resource strings in your appresources.resx and make use of it using the key

25182469
client-side	server-side
you would need to do this client-side not server-side
the server-side code can t read the value of the input before the page has even been rendered

25187408
vim	sublimetext
second if you only want vim s colors to match sublimetext s you ll probably need to tweak the colorscheme itself or send their author a formal feature request
third vim doesn t highlight method names by default so no colorscheme will give that to you for free but you can try the example given under help tag-highlight

25189049
dictionary	map
the get method of a dictionary allows you to specify a default value if the key is not in the dictionary
as a preconditioning step i would map all your non atgc bases to single letters or punctuation or numbers or anything that wont show up in your sequence then reverse the sequence then replace the single letter alternates with their originals

25189561
ssl	https
unless you can get the http site owner to create an ssl certificate the most secure and permanent solution would be to create an rss feed grabing the content you need presumably you are not actually doing anything on the http site -that is to say not logging in to any system
the real issue is that having http elements inside a https site represents a security issue

25190588
division	modulo
to find the nearest 10 min assuming minutes contains the current minute count you do it uses integer division by 10 to round down to nearest 10 but first 5 is added such that 25 becomes 30 then divided by 10 becomes 3 then multiplied by 3 becomes 30
lastly modulo 60 because otherwise 56 minutes would be rounded to 60 which you cannot have

25192760
jar	war
the manifest file of the jar file needs to contain the key mainclass and that is it.
to execute a standalone application in java it doesn t need to be a war

25193835
equals	gethashcode
it may not be overridden well but it s not an incorrect implementation since two instances of the class that are considered equals will hash to the same value
of course with that requirement you could always just return 0 from gethashcode and it would be correct

25194342
decimal	ieee
if you need exact decimal values use decimal in your .net code
floating point data types .net double sql server float are approximate because some values cannot be stored exactly according to the ieee standard

25194963
swift	objective-c
the nsarray could very well be nil again absent nullability information - the individual objects in the array can t be nil nsarray doesn t support nil as an element so assuming swift knows that there is no need for the anyobjects to be themselves iuos
the official apple documentation for matchesinstring says given this signature there is no way for swift to know that your array will only contain objects of a certain type because it can t know the swift compiler has to translate it to the most generic possible result type which is an array of anyobject you do at least know only objects will be there since the method originates in objective-c

25198501
equals	compareto
note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
your compareto method isn t currently consistent with equals - x.compareto null returns 0 whereas x.equals null returns false

25202821
bash	subshell
resulting in an enoexec return value from execve 2 but appears to be a text file the shell will run a new instance of sh to interpret it. from bash 1 if this execution fails because the file is not in executable format and the file is not a directory it is assumed to be a shell script a file containing shell commands
a subshell is spawned to execute it. you cannot always depend on the location of a non-standard program like bash

25202821
bash	subshell
a subshell is spawned to execute it. you cannot always depend on the location of a non-standard program like bash
i ve seen bash in usr bin usr local bin opt fsf bin and opt gnu bin to name a few

25204159
swift	objective-c
then your method signature would be notes i do not recommend prefixing functions with get in swift
it will break certain kinds of interoperability with objective-c

25205921
multiplying	multiplication
the fastest way to square a number is to multiplying it by itself
it s really not but it is performing exponentiation instead of simple multiplication

25208542
rspec	capybara
rspec s request and feature specs are designed for testing the full stack not individual controllers so you can t get an instance of a controller
it might meet your needs to stub the method on all instances of that controller allow_any_instance_of designers spreevariantscontroller .to receive spree_current_user .and_return user however according to the rspec documentation request specs don t support current versions of capybara

25210256
spaces	delimiter
or else use tr to truncate multiple spaces into one first echo field1 field2 field3 | tr -s | cut -d -f2 field2
you can use awk since cut doesn t handle multiple delimiter correctly

25210258
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that there s more than one spaces
cut 1 doesn t collapse the delimiter

25213733
implements	extends
yes but it requires that the person implements the set violate the design contract upon which set is built
basically i could write a class that extends set and doesn t enforce set s promises

25215849
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
as your code stands if the user closes any of the input dialogs nullpointerexception will be thrown when equals is called and the stack trace will be unneccessarily complicated to debug as you develop your game
you should decide if each field can ever rationally be set to null and if not have the setter throw an illegalargumentexception and handle it appropriately in the code calling your setter

prepare	execute
they do so using a utility class named mvchelper which provides convenience methods to create new htmlhelper instance with a correctly prepare http context
after removing the code i did not need i ended up with the following class with this helper class my code execute correctly

25217125
google-chrome	firefox
i think it s a google-chrome bug
ie and firefox render markers color inherited from path but google-chrome does not

25217198
sudo	passwd
you generally can only switch to a locked account using su or sudo
the rules are described in the shadow manual page which says if the passwd field contains some string that is not a valid result of crypt 3 for instance

25218035
portrait	landscape
many devices -- but not all -- will not save portrait images
they will save landscape images with an exif header telling the image viewer to rotate the image to portrait

25219216
super	implements
namely you would implements observevalue forkeypath keypath of object change context which a makes sure we re dealing with our context and not something that our super instance had registered to observe
and then b either handle it or pass it on to the super implementation as necessary

25219216
swift	objective-c
for example you might remove the observer when it is deallocated in swift 3 note you can only observe properties that can be represented in objective-c
thus you cannot observe generics swift struct types swift enum types etc

25220294
viewdidload	viewwillappear
at issue here is we don t know what s up when you add a view in viewdidload
it s not enough to know that it works in viewwillappear

25220755
prng	random
the oracle sha1prng provider uses it as the only seed others may choose to mix it into the state of the prng for instance later android implementations will always generate random data
generateseed does not use any bytes generated by the random number generator

25223048
persistent	transient
indeed one can assume that persistent data structures do not offer optimal performance for this kind of computing
may i suggest instead the use of transient which are in a nutshell mutable implementations of clojure collections

25225518
ecdsa	rsa
heroku doesn t support ecdsa key per their documentation
i would create a fresh rsa ssh key that you use for heroku and only for heroku send that new public key to them then setup a ssh config file to serve that key when ssh reaches out to heroku.com

25226801
prepare	execute
if you are performing multiple inserts with the same prepare statement one invocation of mysqli_stmt prepare and multiple invocations of mysqli_stmt execute for a given statement and need to keep the unique id for each insert use mysqli_connection- insert_id
you should use because of this note on the php manual you referred us to mysqli_stmt_insert_id it should be noted that using mysqli_stmt- insert_id will not result in a unique id being returned for each execution of a prepare insert statement

25227301
filewriter	bufferedwriter
alternatively wrap the filewriter in a bufferedwriter and use the newline method of that
the problem is not with the resultset but with the usage of the filewriter

25228193
bower	npm
also refer this bower command not found after installation
if you used homebrew then npm won t put npm files accessible by users

25229791
google-chrome	firefox
what you should have done is to remove the anchor and use javascript to redirect when the video is clicked something like this that would have given you valid markup as you could just remove the wrapping anchor but it doesn t solve the problem with not redirecting when clicking the controls either it s exactly the same as the controls are still inside the video and triggers the click handler in firefox but not in google-chrome
in webkit the controls could potentially have been targeted somehow with the -webkit-media-controls pseudo class however firefox doesn t seem to have any such pseudo class so that won t work either

25230505
udp	tcp
it is not possible to connect to a tcp udp server by its mac address you must use its ip address
every tcp udp server has an ip address even behind a nat

25230505
udp	tcp
every tcp udp server has an ip address even behind a nat
tcp udp are designed around ip and are transport-agnostic so they can run on networks that are not based on ethernet mac to begin with

25231230
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division
i am just going to quote the comment because it was excellent and a summary probably would not do it justice for example if f was equal to 100000224 which is exactly representable as a float multiplying it by one tenth should yield a result which rounds down to 10000022 but multiplying by 0.1f will instead yield a result which erroneously rounds up to 10000023
if the intention is to divide by ten multiplication by double constant 0.1 will likely be faster than division by 10f and more precise than multiplication by 0.1f

25236081
stateless	stateful
in the case of a server failover restart the client might not be affected if stateless services are used but will likely have problems with a stateful service
a stateful web service is able to remember data between calls - typically using member variables or what have you

25236862
swift	objective-c
c++ code very important is the fact that you cannot use c++ code in your swift code without having a objective-c ++ wrapper you cannot import c++ code directly into swift
instead create an objective-c or c wrapper for c++ code

25236985
swift	objective-c
but there s little to nothing in the system apis that will require it once swift 1.0 is actually out
learning either objective-c or swift is not the hard part

25237505
google-chrome	safari
known issues google-chrome does not support viewport units for border widths column gaps transform values box shadows or in calc until version 34
ios safari both 6 and 7 does not support viewport units for border widths column gaps transform values box shadows or in calc

25238951
matlab	simulink
you should be able to put the actual image processing algorithm into a matlab function block with a few minor tweaks
as already mentioned in the comments you can t use the videoinput function in simulink because it does not support code generation

25243732
selecteditem	selectedindex
it will be updated in lostfocus event of combobox because selecteditem doesn t raise change notification which is necessary for immediate update
as a workaround you can use selectedindex property which publishes change notification via selectedindexchanged event

25244948
pickle	dill
pickle serializes classes by reference so if you change were the class lives it will not unpickle because the class will not be found
if you use dill instead of pickle then you can serialize classes by reference or directly by directly serializing the class instead of it s import path

25245972
google-chrome	firefox
also note that trying to run these full screen commands from the console do not appear to work on google-chrome or ie
i did have success with firebug in firefox though

25247535
move	drag
renewal fails if a bookmarked resource is move into a folder your application does not have permission to access
user drag a folder from your container folder to some folder outside the container folder

25248265
scipy	sympy
you can use sympy to evaluate the derivative and then use lambdify to convert that expression into a function that can be used with scipy
note that lambdify currently doesn t know about scipy by default so you ll have to add a translation dictionary for the scipy special functions manually at this point i am not able to find any roots of this expression using the newton function

25249179
ng-show	ng-class
when is not empty the ng-show is apply it it s okay
if is change the ng-class will update class in the same time the animation doesn t occur

25250258
ssl	https
it works for some sites like www.ku.edu but it don t works from facebook note that facebook uses ssl so you re not going to have anything to string match in the packets they ll be encrypted
it probably works for ku.edu because it s http traffic and not https

25250266
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
floyd-warshall algorithm for all pairs of shortest paths runs in v 3 or n m 3 which is smaller
short answer floyd-warshall is more efficient in this case than naive application of dijkstra s i m not 100 clear from your example but it seems that you have to advance through the arrays in increasing order and that you cannot backtrack

25252151
innodb	myisam
for partitioned innodb tables the row count given in the table_rows column is only an estimated value used in sql optimization and may not always be exact
so for the myisam engine in particular we can find the max year without a table scan or any additional indexing by using the following query note that this only works in certain situations - if you have more than one value in a partition the fact that there are rows in the partition doesn t necessarily mean that one or the other value is present

25252924
build.gradle	gradlew
this makes it very nice for storing your project in version control while keeping your keys and passwords separate and not in your build.gradle file
it is possible to take any existing android studio gradlew project and build sign it from the command line without editing any files

25252939
build.gradle	gradlew

it is possible to take any existing android studio gradlew project and build sign it from the command line without editing any files

25254796
pickle	dill
this can choke pickle however i believe dill should be able to handle it
it s a bit of an odd thing to do pickle serializes classes by reference and doesn t play well with __main__ for many objects

25254796
pickle	dill
it s a bit of an odd thing to do pickle serializes classes by reference and doesn t play well with __main__ for many objects
in dill you don t have to serialize classes by reference and it can handle issues with __main__ much better

25258419
hive	hdfs
you could have to continue the textfile example but is not the best method a file with this format and load in hive create table img_store id int filename string size bigint data string
load data inpath where your file is in hdfs into table img_store

25258739
gif	png
there s no need to resort to gif s if you re storing the images in your bundle and not loading them from the web
you can actually have an entire folder of images png s would be good quality and offer transparency

25260391
move	drag
ui dialog will not move from browser window to other window
as i think ui dialog works only on window based and if you drag it to another monitor then it will not move to another monitor

25261124
n-gram	words
if i use all the words possible in the respective language to create a prediction model what could be the possible cases where it would fail pretty much the same cases were a character n-gram model would fail
the problem is that you re not going to find appropriate statistics for all possible words. character n-gram statistics are easier to accumulate and more robust even for text without typos words in a language tend to follow the same spelling patterns

25261124
n-gram	words
had you not found statistics for the dutch words uitbuiken a pretty rare words then the occurrence of the n-gram uit bui and uik would still be strong indicators of this being dutch
in agglutinative languages such as turkish new words can be formed by stringing morphemes together and the number of possible words is immense

25266566
libstdc++	libc++
on gnu linux you are probably using clang + libstdc++ so it is compatible with gcc + libstdc++ because it uses the same definition of std string from libstdc++
on mac os x you are using clang + libc++ which is not compatible with gcc + libstdc++ they define std string differently so you get different mangled names

25266566
libstdc++	libc++
on mac os x you are using clang + libc++ which is not compatible with gcc + libstdc++ they define std string differently so you get different mangled names
one option is to use when compiling with clang on mac os x to tell it to use libstdc++ however the version of libstdc++ included with mac os x is ancient and doesn t support any of c++11

25267096
google-chrome	firefox
use the following code to get all available voices for the speech api in your browser at this time only google-chrome and safari support the web speech api although safari only supports the text to speech functionalities
curiously firefox os supports tts but the browser version does not

25268447
profiling	debugging
this thread in another stackoverflow may clear your mind optimization flags when profiling the problem is not profiling with optimization but debugging with optimization -g -pg
as quantdev said you should always use the same options as the one used to create production binaries and you are ont going to create a production binary with debugging information

25268638
union	distinct
columns that are formed by using the set operators union union all cross join except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns being modified are not affected by group by having or distinct clauses

25268794
swift	objective-c
the reason is that the swift protocol is defined to the swift-objc header then to your objective-c class definition which then goes again to the swift-objc header
mitrenegades solution is to use an objective-c protocol is one way but if you want a swift protocol then the other would be to refactor the code so as to not use the objective-c class directly but instead use the protocol some protocol based factory pattern

25268982
bash	subshell
use while read loop instead with process substitution recommended with bash or pipe exec is my style and is optional
since we only run one command inside the subshell summoned by process substitution having another fork may not be necessary

25270093
implements	extends
so i came up with the following summary of implements background services in android broadly services in android can be started or bound started services given that a started service performs a single operation and does not return a result to the caller so it can t met my specific requirements expose a service contract from a different process to other apps
for example getphonerecord recordid deletephonerecord phoneid etc. bound services there are three different flavors extends the binder class- used only for private services runs within the app

25271643
super	self
in python 3.0 you can simply write super .__init__ name without even the child reference
shape is a class not an object so when you call shape.__init__ there s no self variable

25272204
serializable	deserialization
if two classes with different fully-qualified names have the same uid this does not affect your de- serializable at all
for your reference this is how the java documentation describes the matter the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable

25273528
rsa	aes
note that you usually do not encrypt a file directly using rsa
usually you encrypt the file with a random data key using aes a symmetric cipher

25275580
innodb	myisam
innodb which you should be using
do not use myisam uses zero bytes for a field that is null but the full number of bytes for a zero value date

25276724
postgresql	mysql
this method has been around since about 2007 a good step-by-step write-up of the set-up and usage is available here the write-up demonstrates not only the usage of select statements from directly within mysql to postgresql and sqlite native tables but also inserts back into those tables using queries executed directly from within the mysql environment. the perl module is available here philips dbix-myserver-0.42 lib dbix myserver.pm good luck
you can access the oracle or other dbms information directly from within mysql using the mysql federated tables via the perl dbix myserver proxy

25283830
cpython	pypy
for more information on how dictionaries are implemented in cpython look at the source which is comprehensively documented and mostly pretty readable even if you re not a c expert
you may also want to look at the pypy implementation which is in python and has more clever tricks

25285377
stateless	stateful
udp connections are stateless
from the iptables manual udp connections are in themselves not stateful connections but rather stateless

25285469
bower	npm
until karma-browserify is updated you can force your project to use the most recent 4.x version of bower - which is compatible with karma-browserify - version 4.2.3 via adding the following line to package.json bower 4.0.0 then running npm update bower
the issue is that the karma-browserify version 0.2.1 - currently the latest version - is not compatible with the 5.0.0 release of bower on jul 22 2014

25285469
bower	npm
the issue is that the karma-browserify version 0.2.1 - currently the latest version - is not compatible with the 5.0.0 release of bower on jul 22 2014
the package.json in karma-browserify does not prevent the 5.0.0 or greater version of bower to be installed on an npm install so when you install a new project or update your bower version you will get this error

25289210
jpql	hql
jpql is a the standard jpa query language but it doesn t support all hql features
spring data doesn t use hql but jpql

25290615
ubuntu	linux
see this post for more information java fullscreen mode not working on ubuntu
you can also do it using the class toolkit on win7 for more information about the class toolkit see this link to the documentation if you are using ubuntu or other linux versions you could have some problems setting the full screen to your window or frame with the normal ways to do it

25291236
ssl	https
basic - make sure to tell apache to use ssl by adding this in httpd.conf furthermore you should try to redirect all links to use https so users cannot login via http and no unsecure links show up for more info you can check apache s documentation on ssl
assuming that you have registered your ssl if you manage your own server like you should do as a good little hacker

25295466
ubuntu	centos
make sure selinux fedora centos or apparmor ubuntu or any other mac security systems are not interfering with the file access
for selinux check var log audit audit.log or var log messages for apparmor im not a ubuntu user and as far as i understand the logging for apparmor isnt always easy to figure out

25297616
profiling	debugging
the express products also do not support the plug-in necessary to enable the nsight device code debugger and profiling facility
however code development execution profiling via the standalone visual profiler nvvp and host code debugging is still possible

25297673
swift	objective-c
in swift 1.1 there are failable initializers
this works in swift 1.0 there is a known issue in the xcode release notes about swift not supporting objective-c initializers that return nil

25297673
swift	objective-c
this works in swift 1.0 there is a known issue in the xcode release notes about swift not supporting objective-c initializers that return nil
basically what is happening is that according to the swift language the expression nscalendar ... has type nscalendar which is a non-optional type cannot be nil

25297673
swift	objective-c
basically what is happening is that according to the swift language the expression nscalendar ... has type nscalendar which is a non-optional type cannot be nil
however this is really an imported initializer from objective-c where it can return nil

25300946
sudo	passwd
and follow the below instructions to create a database in postgresql install postgresql 1.install latest postgresql 9.1 in console sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev 2.postgresql has a super user is called postgres
change user to the postgresql user sudo su - postgres 3.change passwd of postgres user psql -d postgres -u postgres psql 9.1.3 type help for help 4.restart the postgresql server sudo etc init.d postgresql restart pgadmin iii postgresql administration and management tools if pgadminiii is not installed the installation is easy sudo apt-get install pgadmin3 add a sever open pgadminiii and add new localhost server

25302983
ienumerable	ilist
and since ilist inherits from ienumerable you can call where on both interfaces calling where on a ilist actually calls the ienumerable.where extension method
so in both cases the same base method is called and the type of the resulting value will be an ienumerable not an ilist when applied to a list

25303765
jmeter	soapui
short answer go with jmeter with jmeter plugins
soapui is not a load testing tool but load ui is

25305047
serializable	deserialization
if a final field is initialized to a compile-time constant expression 15.28 in the field declaration changes to the final field may not be observed since uses of that final field are replaced at compile time with the value of the constant expression. thus usages of this field are replaced with constants in compilation time and cannot be influenced by serializable in runtime
only constant expressions will be assigned to the fields after deserialization

25305056
sum	coalesce
although according to sql standards null values will be ignored during aggregation unless there are no matching rows at all as stated here sum returns null if there were no matching rows
that means that you do not need to do this select sum coalesce c.height 0 .... just in case you or anybody else was wondering

25307121
implements	extends
it does not implements the getvalueat or setvalueat methods of the tablemodel
this will allow you to extends the model to support row objects of any type in the model

25307748
decoder	encoder
for audio codecs a compliant decoder mostly needs to come close to a reference signal while allowing for some implementation rounding differences
in most cases the trading of quality for speed is done in the encoder but some decoders also have options for deviating from the standards to increase decoding speed but not outputting the exact correct image

25308052
google-chrome	firefox
strangely with google-chrome v36.0.1985.125 on os x it was not working
i tried with a different browser firefox and it is working

25308454
ucma	ucwa
in ucma this is typically done via the context channel which ucwa does not have access to
ucwa as of cu4 doesn t have any access to push information to a conversation that is not plain text or html

25308957
serializable	deserialization
so solution is just to send regular context with correct options to the serializable
okay i ve got solution it was pretty easy actually i was confused by fosrestbundle s but actually they work for serialization and not deserialization

25310440
swift	objective-c
unlike objective-c categories swift extensions do not have names. see docs
this is a string extension form for versions of swift earlier than 1.2 usage reference extensions add new functionality to an existing class structure or enumeration type

25311233
octal	decimal
that s a literal octal integer
so 0234 in decimal is 156 not 234

25311281
octal	decimal
integer literals that start with 0 are interpreted as octal not decimal numbers
so 0234 is actually octal for 156 decimal

25316652
super	extends
someone extends a class should not have to go check the source code of the super class to ensure the constructor isn t calling overrideable methods
while using a setter in the constructor reduces code duplication calling overrideable methods ie non final non private methods in a constructor is discouraged - it can lead to weird bugs when extends a class

25317051
vb.net	vb6
vba visual basic for applications is not vb.net even though they share the same visual basic monikor and a similar syntax
the linked documentation is for vb.net not vba. vb6 and vba in microsoft office eg

25317139
division	subtract
the reason not to use to convert a random float to a random int is because you can skip straight to the random int to answer your question x y performs a floor division of x by y so your result will always round down
to round to the closest integer adding 0.5 or subtract for a negative number before converting to an int does the same thing as round x built-in

25317277
g++	gcc
so you might want to check your gcc version first using g++ --version like 40two said
according to the gcc 4.4 release notes unique_ptr was not in gcc s standard c++ library before 4.4

25319771
implements	extends
as you realize implements interface is not enough in your case
extends is lacking of flexibility

25321220
required	placeholder
if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1
and if the value of the first option element in the select element s list of options if any is the empty string and that option element s parent node is the select element and not an optgroup element then that option is the select element s placeholder label option

25324323
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome which uses a newer version of v8 throws an error if you don t use new
i m not sure why firefox doesn t throw an error though

25327086
imperative	declarative
if done properly you shouldn t see these chainable do this then do that then do that because ultimately that s an imperative paradigm and rxjs is capable of more than that
ideally it should be more about telling what the events are in a declarative fashion

25327089
subtract	addition
or some important notes when subtract two pointers they must point to the same array this is covered in paragraph 9 which says when two pointers are subtract both shall point to elements of the same array object or one past the last element of the array object
... in order to avoid undefined behavior the resulting pointer from an addition must still point to the same array or one off the end of the array and if you point to one past the end you shall not dereference it which is in paragraph 8 which says ... if both the pointer operand and the result point to elements of the same array object or one past the last element of the array object the evaluation shall not produce an overflow

25331804
layoutparams	viewgroup
if you pass in null the inflater doesn t know what type of layoutparams to generate it generates them from the parent viewgroup
i believed that this generated default viewgroup.layoutparams but maybe it doesn t provide any layoutparams at all

25331804
layoutparams	viewgroup
i believed that this generated default viewgroup.layoutparams but maybe it doesn t provide any layoutparams at all
you should replace this with where parent is the viewgroup into which customview will be added

25333979
daemons	systemd
as commented by that other guy you might perhaps use adjtimex 2 syscall but you first should be sure that no ntp client daemons -which uses adjtimex - is running so stop any ntpd or chrony service
i m not sure it would work and it might make your systemd quite unstable

for objects nsobject nsnumber and subclasses in objective-c and reference types in swift and test that the objects reference types are the same identical thing -- same hash value -- or are not the same identical thing respectively

25334176
swift	objective-c
for objects nsobject nsnumber and subclasses in objective-c and reference types in swift and test that the objects reference types are the same identical thing -- same hash value -- or are not the same identical thing respectively
swift s identity equality operators and check referential equality -- and thus should probably be called the referential equality operators imo

25334205
subtraction	addition
the same elimination does not hold for subtraction because we need the neighborhood above and below the product
we can eliminate zero from all optimal solutions as well leaving a 0 1 9 . because we note that singleton 0 ϵ a 0 and since by the definition of zero 0 a n 0 and 0 + a n a n the optimal solution for zero is always 0 and since any appearance of +0+ or zeros within a product space cancelled out the whole product or the zero addition step the solution is not optimal and thus could be excluded from the search

25335654
implements	extends
clojure functions classes implements the clojure.lang.ifn interface are not methods they are classes
ifn extends the runnable and callable interfaces

25340534
punctuation	words
see the manual for details c-h i g emacs abbrev ret an abbrev expands whenever it is present in the buffer just before point and you type a self-inserting whitespace or punctuation character spc comma etc.
more precisely any character that is not a words constituent expands an abbrev and any word-constituent character can be part of an abbrev. the most common way to use an abbrev is to insert it and then insert a punctuation or whitespace character to expand it

25342494
google-chrome	firefox
some numbers google-chrome capturevisibletab 200-205ms firefox drawimage 20-25ms + todataurl 125-130ms the devtools screenshot command is a good example of how to capture just the visible part in all fairness to make a meaningful comparison one has to take into account whether google-chrome s png encoder favors compression over speed
still this doesn t change the fact that firefox s canvas is fine

25342520
namenode	hdfs
note that there s no need to restart datanodes or namenode
question 2 while the gcs connector for hadoop is able to copy direct from hdfs without ever needing an extra disk buffer gsutil cannot since it has no way of interpreting the hdfs protocol

25343607
prepare	execute
do use mysqli_ prepare statements or pdo with prepare statements - it s safer
the problem with your code s failure to properly execute is you are mixing mysql apis using mysql_error along with mysqli_fetch_array they do not mix together being mysql_ and mysqli_ functions

25348059
sudo	passwd
if you get any errors type sudo in front of all the said commands
if that doesn t work your best bet would be too login to the root account by typing su and the root passwd following that

25348898
comparator	comparable
if the comparator passed as the second parameter to collections.sort is null it does not treat that as an error
rather it will try to cast each item in the list to comparable sorting them according to their natural sort order which won t work for these objects

25355019
mongodb	bson
you just need to set ttl time to live index on a date field that exists in bson record . you can read more here mongodb expire data from collections by setting ttl
mongodb cannot auto remove collections but it can auto remove bson records

25355298
google-chrome	firefox
i believe that google-chrome is not a fan of scrolling tables and bootstrap likes to render the table to fit all the data regardless
in firefox it scrolls in google-chrome it doesn t

25355365
g++	gcc
minimized example this doesn t compile in any version of g++ or clang that i tested
intellisense in vs2013 uses the edg frontend and to quote jonathan wakely if gcc clang and edg all agree and msvc disagrees that usually means msvc is wrong. to make things more interesting the relevant paragraphs in the standard actually changed between c++11 and c++14

25357080
verilog	vhdl
edit 1 i m not so good in coding verilog so i ll copy some vhdl code from our vhdl library
i think you will be able to translate the statements into corresponding verilog code. i spared the separate register process with reset and clock enable bits is a generic and set to 32 lfsr linear feedback shift register is 32 bit wide and stores the current checksum the temp

25362908
scrollable	panels
if something that .net doesn t provide you ll p invoke gdi gdi+ advice for choosing base class if your control needs to be scrollable listview kind of controls likely need it
so you can choose scrollablecontrol or panels as base class which supports scrolling

25364229
dns	spf
for the sending mail address www-data salvatore-vaio.huawei.com nsaboard # host salvatore-vaio.huawei.com host salvatore-vaio.huawei.com not found 3 nxdomain you need to setup an mx dns record and different techniques to increase reputation
like spf and dkim.

25365467
opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all major mobile browsers safari on ios google-chrome opera firefox on android do support this event in its un-prefixed form
firefox does not at this time of writing expose deviceorientation events on any desktop platform

25365955
union	distinct
union all is more efficient because it does not add the step of removing duplicates
i would write this as because you are selecting distinct id s you do not need union

25367808
implements	extends
it is not possible to implements like that
the current version of generics only supports extends or super

25368440
uiview	subviews
any subviews you want to add buttons should be added to the uiview not the skview
in case you re still stuck on this i had the same issue and it was caused by adding uibuttons as subviews on my skview

25368474
richtextbox	textblock
a richtextbox can contain plain text inline with hyperlinks -- the latter does not expose a tap event but it does have click which may suffice
failing that #2 should also be fairly straightforward and may suffice if you can work with the limitation that the wrappanel will treat the textblock as atoms ie it won t wrap intra-textblock text

25370806
kerberos	ntlm
which simply means that kerberos has failed for some reasons spn not registered clockskew not allowed for kerberos incorrect dns records best option is to use wireshark on the client to find the root cause
please note that java does not support ntlm as a spnego submechanism

25370832
portrait	landscape
it is only triggered when a configuration change is happening such as when you rotate your device from landscape to portrait and vice-versa
when flipping the device from portrait to reversed portrait or from landscape to reversed landscape this doesn t trigger a configuration change only the screen rendering is flipped and therefore you don t call camera.open again

25374159
ienumerable	iqueryable
i would choose between ienumerable and ihttpactionresult you can do pretty much the same thing with both of these just in slightly different ways
iqueryable is usually used for lower level data access tasks and deferred execution of sql queries so i d keep it encapsulated within your data access classes and not expose it with the web api

25377117
mongodb	bson
the last argument is reasonable but consider also that at the present time the implementation of a cursor concept for the aggregation pipeline results is a new concept for mongodb
it could be fairly argued that all reasonable expectations at the first design point would have been that most results from combining documents would not be of a size that was restrictive to the bson limitations

25379394
dbcontext	objectcontext
explanation for anyone that finds themselves here looking at the same issue the reason that the contoso university example will not work in visstudio2012 or rather ef5 revolves around that fact that the database context created in ef4 was an objectcontext in ef5 yours is created as a the newer dbcontext
as a result the optimisation part mentioned in the tutorial will not work and you will get the error about not being able to cast to a objectcontext see the link above to fix this you basically replace this part with an event call that creates your context

25379651
hex	binary
for binary usage as you seem to be reading serialized data you might like to dump the file dumping file position hex value and char value
since java 7 it is not needed to read byte by byte there are two utility function in files as you want to read binary data one would use readallbytes

25381269
client-side	server-side
you should always separate as much as possible the server-side from client-side else you ll end up having a hard to mantain not understandable and error prone code
that being said you can convert your map to json and send that json to the client-side so it can be handled as you want now you can write your client-side code regarding the population of the drop-down lists by using the statesjson global variable

25382137
haskell	agda
the data.typeable haskell machinery does not erase types at runtime
more powerful types haskell gadts and coq agda ... dependent types extend conventional static type checking to enforce even stronger properties on the code at compile time

25386951
pascal	delphi
a common denominator of these to fast and great image processors is asm although photoshop may have upgraded to delphi now it is still pascal
and any speed problems are comming from pascal but this is because we like the way programs look and not what they do now days

25387006
bower	npm
you can create your own build of when.js using bower if you prefer not to use an amd or commonjs loader in your project
git clone npm install npm run bower to generate build when.js or npm run browserify-debug to build with when monitor console enabled when will be available as window.when other modules will be available as sub-objects functions window.when.fn.lift window.when.sequence

25389568
client-side	server-side
unlike the previous solutions this one requires changes to the server-side script as well as the client-side curl
this solution is only useful if you specifically want to send the session id as something other than a url parameter or cookie or if you want to use a variable name other than the name that the server is expecting. place the following code in your server-side php that is handling the request prior to starting the session or or i suggest using solution #1 unless you have a compelling reason not to

25392157
oncreate	findviewbyid
with regards to this satement i do have another class but it calls oncreateview instead of oncreate and the findviewbyid method doesn t exist in oncreateview
you can pass your main activity s context to your other class through it s constructor and call the findviewbyid method by casting the context to activity

25392901
qthread	qobject
the problem isn t qthread the problem is that you re calling the connect method from a class which doesn t have it
you need to make myclass inherits from qobject

25397947
google-chrome	firefox
your code seems fine. if the favicon is a png type image it ll not work in older versions of google-chrome
however it ll work just fine in firefox

25401788
inline	inlining
first of all when inline like you did the phpdoc tag should be surrounded by like this secondly phpstorm does not parse additional inline tags in param or return descriptions -- it only parses it if see is located on separate line or if inline in main method description section
in other words inlining in param description will not work very unfortunately

25403602
prepare	execute
i would consider the following options remove setjobid and assign the job identifier in the constructor remove setjobid and assign the job identifier in the execution make sure setjobid does not reassign the id although i might rename it to something more intuitive like prepare if you don t do something like 1
or 2. you can check jobid within execute and if it has not been set raise an error or call setjobid - or his sexier new version prepare

25405466
mongodb	bson
mongodb stores data in bson format
and if you have a look at this link bson data types spec you will see that bson does not have a datatype called float it only has double

25407317
comm	grep
an alternative if your files consist of single-line entities only and the output order doesn t matter the question as worded is unclear on this would be comm requires its inputs to be sorted and the -2 means don t show me the lines that are unique to the second file while -3 means don t show me the lines that are common between the two files
if you need the differences to be presented in the order they occur though the above diff awk solution is ok although the grep bit isn t really necessary - it could be

25415005
direct3d	directx
this would definitely help though java will not make use of direct3d acceleration
the crash happens inside directx library d3d9.dll

25419598
ionic	angular
ionic automatically removes the 300ms delay in order to make ionic apps feel more native like
fastclick and angular s ngtouch should not be included to avoid conflicts

25422786
keystore	jks
this keystore is java specific it usually has an extension of jks
this type of keystore can contain private keys and certificates but it cannot be used to store secret keys

25424434
bower	npm
libraries that are especially targeted for the browser will often refer to bower as the install method instead of npm
bower is also a package manager but it is designed to download and install library written for browsers not node

25424696
google-chrome	safari
some css elements have not passed validation in mozilla but is accepted in google-chrome
the same case is with opera safari especially ie and other browsers

25425908
onresume	onpause
now for the second part how do you resume playing from the position where it was paused. as per the documentation mediaplayer class has two method getcurrentposition and seekto int msec you can use sharedpreferences to store the currentposition in onpause method and in your onresume get the position for the sharedpreferences and seekto int msec that position and then start playback again
in the onresume method check if the song is already playing you shouldn t start it again. so now your onresume becomes this will fix your crash

25427483
config	ini
session_start either restores a session or starts a new session if there is no session applicable to the currently set config
in other words you don t know whether there already is a session or not when you call session_start and session start will set the cookie based on the current ini settings and or session_set_cookie_params settings

25429268
apache	nginx
with apache you can combine mod_proxy with an authentication module like mod_authz_ldap to ensure that requests are authenticated before being passed to the backend server
i m not as familiar with nginx but i m sure it supports something similar

25430122
rdf	owl
this is expressed in turtle syntax and is trivial to transform to rdf xml or any of the other valid rdf serializations
this pair of restrictions is not exactly semantically equivalent to owl qualifiedcardinality but if you have the ability to modify your domain model you can often work around it

25430236
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is breaking because the line of code is returning the url with quotes url whereas in google-chrome it returns it without quotes url you then strip the url and the which works fine in google-chrome but it means in firefox the string bg has additional quotes around it
this means when you set the src attribute firefox converts those extra quotes to 22 and then doesn t recognise the url and attempts to load a local path

25430284
udp	tcp
-su udp port scanning is one of these
on linux the full list is -su udp port scans -ss tcp syn scans -sa w m n f x tcp scans with various flags -pe pp pm icmp host discovery probes -so ip protocol scans -sy z sctp scans -o os detection --traceroute tracerouting pretty much all the ids evasion options needless to say it s probably not a good idea to let your web server run nmap commands as root

25430290
ubuntu	centos
i tested on ubuntu but not on centos i only have rhel available now
but you can test the centos part and modify as needed

25433111
direct3d	directx
the win32 desktop direct3d tutorial or the windows store app direct3d tutorial builds just fine without the legacy directx sdk at all
many of the directx sdk samples are available now on msdn code gallery that build with the windows 8.x sdk and do not make use of the legacy directx sdk

25437380
clang	llvm
the xcode compiler is clang llvm but ruby mri 1.9 only supports gcc another older but widely used compiler
while it s true that mri 1.9.3 is unofficially compatible with clang there are some known issues and some modules do not compile correctly fibers

25438321
swift	objective-c
this is still somewhat of an option in swift however the compiler will analyze which of the fastest can be used and try to decide on your behalf
one side-effect of this is that some of the powerful features afforded by dynamic dispatch may not be available where as this could previously have been assumed to be the case for any objective-c method

25439026
realloc	malloc
most malloc implementations over-allocate this is the reason why realloc can sometimes avoid copying bytes - the old block may be large enough for the new size
but apparently in your environment the system malloc doesn t do that so i think your only option is to reimplement all 3 primitives gmp_default_ alloc realloc free on top of the system-provided malloc free

25439026
realloc	malloc
but apparently in your environment the system malloc doesn t do that so i think your only option is to reimplement all 3 primitives gmp_default_ alloc realloc free on top of the system-provided malloc free
there are many open-source malloc implementation out there glibc has one you might be able to adapt

25440214
hex	binary
it tries to read a vaident property where the next byte hex 53 is interpreted as the indent s byte length which is it not then it tries to read that many bytes decimal 83 and fails
in order to make your ttest custom streaming work correctly with objectbinarytotext you will have to produce a compatible dfm by duplicating the same logic that tstrings.defineproperties implements as its streaming methods are private and inaccessible eg which produces this dfm binary data 54 50 46 30 05 54 54 65 73 74 00 28 74 68 65 5f tpf0.ttest. the_ 6c 69 73 74 5f 69 64 5f 6c 69 6b 65 74 6f 73 61 list_id_liketosa 76 65 5f 77 69 74 68 6f 75 74 5f 70 75 62 6c 69 ve_without_publi 73 69 6e 67 01 06 06 61 71 77 7a 73 78 06 06 65 sing...aqwzsx..e 64 63 72 66 76 00 00 00 dcrfv... which produces this output text that is simply the way objectbinarytotext works there is no getting around it

25445049
prepare	execute
an additional reason for doing this is that often it isn t really possible to separate test cases from setup actions. rather you have a bunch of actions you can perform some test the application some prepare for such tests and some do both
for instance a web application workflow typically looks like open a particular url log in as a specific user performing some activity by interacting with the site this can be repeated indefinitely optionally log out all four steps are valid test cases on their own they may fail in ways that imply the application is misbehaving. however they can t be run in isolation step 1 must be execute prior to step 2 and 2 must be run prior to 3 or 4

25445352
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the tryanchordownload approach should work on modern versions of firefox and google-chrome and is a cleaned-up version of code provided in this forum post
the trysaveasdownload approach should theoretically work on any major modern browser though safari may not respect the specified file name

25446555
prepare	execute
but the player is not prepare so you want to set onpreparedlistener in order to know when the mediaplayer is ready to be used
the difference between those methods is basically in what thread they re execute

25447717
equals	compareto
this violates the equals contract specifically the symmetric requirement
a compareto method is not enough - you need to implement an equals method and is recommended to also override hashcode when you override equals

25448232
clang	llvm
i do not see any other language common between the two compilation suites than pre-processed c that could be output from clang to be fed into gcc in order to speed up anything
i read somewhere that llvm can act as a preprocessor to gcc i think that what you read was literally about pre-processing

25449367
equals	compareto
as a side note the implementation of hashcode is also wrong as it s not in line with equals either
your implementation of compareto doesn t match your implementation of equals

25449367
equals	compareto
your implementation of compareto doesn t match your implementation of equals
treeset operates on compareto

25449705
ubuntu	centos
both centos 6 and ubuntu use version 1.1.2
the issue on centos 7 can be bypassed by running the image with command line option as in edited section of op then running sed s useprivilegeseparation yes useprivilegeseparation no -i etc ssh sshd_config usr sbin sshd centos 6 when testing in centos 6 running docker 1.1.2 i did not have the same problem ssh connection got further hence i assume the error on centos 7 was caused by the docker version however ssh disconnected as soon as connected with an error on client side pam session not opened and on container side pam pam_open_session cannot make remove an entry for the specified session

25450999
scheme	racket
it is not compatible with either mit scheme nor #
racket the language

25453070
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if one were to implement such a thing one could add items to a dictionary and then switch between case-sensitive and non-case-sensitive modes
the biggest problem with doing that would be that adding if the dictionary is in case-sensitive mode when two items are added which differ only in case attempts to retrieve either of those items when the dictionary is in case-insensitive mode might not behave as expected

25453428
subtract	addition
since there are several ways to subtract one and because it s not entirely clear what is and isn t allowed i ll post several possible solutions - take your pick
using add with negative one mov ax b add ax -1 mov b ax using decrement mov ax b dec ax mov b ax using negation + addition mov ax b neg ax add ax 1

25454674
bower	npm
bower and webpack are very common the react community so nearly all libraries are published to npm for easy consumption
bower packs your javascript your react version of choice and any libraries into a single js file which doesn t use globals or other patterns that conflict with other code running on the page

25458561
super	self
for example class computer object def boot_message self return i am a computer class applecomputer computer def boot_message self return super applecomputer self .boot_message + with a really shiny logo we avoid duplicating the effort in computer.boot_message by taking its result and modifying it as necessary
note that the super base self .__init__ line is not necessary

25460140
directx	gdi
if you replace gdi + with d2d some of your sufferings will be officialy limited os support according to the directx version and or the functions you will use
you will have to forget about windows xp very possibly windows vista and less possibly windows 7 the performance compared to gdi+ gdi is not always greater

25461642
oncreate	setcontentview
you can freely call finish in oncreate without calling some extra methods for example and when you call finish it will not stop executing method so make sure nothing is below finish line
and you should not call setcontentview if you will call finish in oncreate to save memory speed

25461978
implements	extends
you can just replace class user implements userinterface by class user implements advanceduserinterface because advanceduserinterface extends the userinterface
your user class have to implements advanceduserinterface and not userinterface

25463055
implements	extends
here is an example using the main file either way you will need to implements listener and register the events with the plugin manager
eventhandler is not a class that you are extends

25463200
retrofit	okhttp
as mentioned you shouldn t use retrofit to actually download the image itself
if your goal is to simply download the content without displaying it then you could simply use an http client like okhttp which is another one of square s libraries

25463630
vsto	add-in
vsto does not support creating add-in for onenote
you can crate an add-in for onenote in a slightly different way though

25466148
floating-point	fractions	base	fractions
to quote from there i ve generalised the text in italics floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 binary fractions
no matter how many base 2 digits you re willing to use some decimal value like 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a base 2 fractions

25466148
base	fractions
no matter how many base 2 digits you re willing to use some decimal value like 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a base 2 fractions
stop at any finite number of bits and you get an approximation on a typical machine running python there are 53 bits of precision available for a python float so the value stored internally when you enter a decimal number is the binary fractions which is close to but not exactly equal to it

25466363
swift	objective-c
in objective-c properties were declared with if not using property in swift the property declarations look more like c# so you can t call the setter explicitly using the same method name as in objective-c though i have actually no idea what it will be compiled into...
try this properties are set using the property syntax in swift

25468236
lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup ranks lxml s parser as being the best then html5lib s then python s built-in parser
it is not about the version of beautifulsoup - it is about the differences between underlying parsers beautifulsoup uses beautifulsoup presents the same interface to a number of different parsers but each parser is different

25469921
prepare	execute
php is prepare for multi-threaded execution it does have a proper threading model and so green threads are not necessary
pthreads in php are not green threads they are implemented with posix threads which are kernel threads the question at hand i ll assume that you intend for these threads to be execute by the frontend that is within the webserver at the request of a client

25470117
profiling	instrumentation
but unlike glowcode it is less fragile for instance i couldn t enable glowcode to profiling stl classes and algorithms - always have bad hook instrumentation status for them
to enable profiling of a particular dll exe just click enable profiling in the project s context menu

25473274
udp	tcp
rtsp is gnarly to debug note the tools links and not assured to run inside a nat d network due to udp issues
so to get better result you may have to look into forcing your config to do data channel on tcp an not udp

25475090
implements	extends
answer to the question now - so once we have the json data for fetching individual images we can implements the logic of getting the images in background via handlers or threads or asynctask
we should note here that since my images once downloaded must be displayed on the ui main thread we cannot simply use threads as it is since they don t have access to the context. in the flickradapter the choices i could think of choice 1 create a looperthread extends thread - and keep on downloading images sequentially in one thread by keeping this thread open looper.loop choice 2 make use of a thread pool and post the runnable via myhandler which contains reference to my imageview but since the views in grid view are recycled again the problem might arise where image at index 4 is displayed at index 9 download may take more time choice 3 i used this make use of a thread pool and send a message to myhandler which contains data related to imageview s index and imageview itself so while doing handlemessage we will update the imageview only if currentindex matches the index of the image we tried to download

25479182
serializable	deserialization
because a transient part of an object s state is assumed to be changing within each instances it can not be static or final the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable
if the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialversionuid than that of the corresponding sender s class then deserialization will result in an invalidclassexception

25479182
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

25482271
inline-functions	inlining
above shows gcc does not inline-functions which have variable argument handling
possibly there are pretty complex operations going on while handling the variable arguments which would increase the size of the code to an un-optimal size so it is simply not worth inlining these functions

25482906
oncreate	onstart
you are initializing mservice object in onstart and using it in oncreate
ref in oncreate as mservice is not initialized and it is null as per default value of object in java its throwing null pointer exception

boxlayout	miglayout
there to use borderlayout as better simpler layoutmanager for jpanel than boxlayout is panel.add table1.gettableheader borderlayout.north
then put jtable to the center area better should be - don t to use jpanel in jscrollpane put jtable directly to the jscrollpane then jtableheader is visible otherwise you have to implements scrollable for jpanel for natural scrolling use miglayout for whole container is designated for by using this custom layoutmanager isn t required mixing different layoutmanagers use defaulttablemodel for storing value for jtable s view see oracle tutorial initial thread setpreferredscrollableviewportsize is used by jscrollpane your setting for preferredsize creates swing gui void tableproperties contains two useless code lines table.repaint

25484070
pthreads	fork
the system 3 function is on linux and most pthreads systems using the fork 2 syscall which can fail for several reasons eagain fork cannot allocate sufficient memory to copy the parent s page tables and allocate a task structure for the child
enomem fork failed to allocate the necessary kernel structures because memory is tight. so you won t be able to fork if your current process uses a lot of memory and if the system does not have enough swap space to hold a copy

25484206
prng	random
to the contrary a securerandom is more secure if it is not a prng producing a deterministic sequence based on a seed
the javadoc of securerandom says many securerandom implementations are in the form of a pseudo-random number generator prng which means they use a deterministic algorithm to produce a pseudo-random sequence from a true random seed

25485316
implements	extends
edit there is also one more option interfaces don t have extends each other and concrete class may implements them both but again - depends on what you need edit2 after your edit it still doesn t make much of a difference
still class can implements two interfaces or one and still you can use polymorphic assignment on both classes

25485473
icmp	udp
algi your best bet for device discovery is to use the icmp protocol which requires elevated privileges
using the udp protocol which operates at osi layer s 3 4 is not well suited for device discovery unless an existing client server protocol for discovery is implemented such as those in use with dns netbios dropbox applications

25485473
udp	tcp
using the udp protocol which operates at osi layer s 3 4 is not well suited for device discovery unless an existing client server protocol for discovery is implemented such as those in use with dns netbios dropbox applications
please don t misunderstand that device discovery can be implemented on these higher level protocols but to assume a device doesn t exist on a network because udp tcp port n is not open is folly

25485739
implements	extends
if you extends b from a only because of reuse method declaration then your concrete class has to implements all 3 methods and that is drawback not much use when you are concentrating only b
if you have a and want to use it you can go for b extends a

25486024
hive	hdfs
i guess in case of internal hive table creation we could see the table name in respective databases in user hive warehouse
in case of external table creation a file needs to be put in the specified hdfs location and we can not able to see the table names

25487005
super	extends
because this is the class that contains the call to the registry with hyperlinkdetectors configured via the extension point. to activate them this class needs an ipreferencestore so you must also initialize your customsourceviewerconfiguration with an ipreferencestore in the constructor and call super iprefstore
for who finds this just like i did but still didn t get it to work when working with extension points to define hyperlinkdetectors for your customtexteditor be sure to have your customsourceviewerconfiguration extends textsourceviewerconfiguration not just sourceviewerconfiguration

build.gradle	gradlew
if you re using gradlew for android with android studio this would be a fine place to use product flavors have the bulk of your code and resources be in the main sourceset as normal define standard and hebrew product flavors in your build.gradle file have the normal non-hebrew resources be in a standard sourceset have the hebrew resources be in a hebrew sourceset then a hebrew build will use the hebrew layouts while a standard build would use the normal layouts
if gradlew for android is not an option since you control the hardware you could drop some file in some special spot on the device and check that when your process starts to determine if you should be in hebrew-compatibility mode or not

atom-editor	sublimetext
last july atom-editor began using react and it gave it a nice performance boost but you can still feel the difference
apart from that if atom-editor s performance issues will not push users away - sublimetext better speed up the release cycle brush up its small ux tweaks and consider letting in more contributors because this is where atom-editor is winning

25491307
atom-editor	sublimetext
apart from that if atom-editor s performance issues will not push users away - sublimetext better speed up the release cycle brush up its small ux tweaks and consider letting in more contributors because this is where atom-editor is winning
atom-editor s package ecosystem is also growing really fast it might not be as big as sublimetext s at the moment but i have a feeling that with github at it s back it will keep growing even faster

25491676
mongodb	bson
of course you cannot query it directly with .find - it s just string from the mongodb point of view
you should have store it as bson if you wanted to query it.

25493001
implements	extends
to conclude xamarin supports development for android ios windows phone mac however not all of xamarin s api s are implements for all platforms
to update and extends jason s answer there is now xamarin.forms that let us build cross-platform gui for android ios and windows phone

25493270
openmpi	mpich
openmpi also supports both of these networks and others natively without ofi in the middle
in the past a common complaint about mpich is that it does not support infiniband whereas openmpi does

25493270
openmpi	mpich
in the past a common complaint about mpich is that it does not support infiniband whereas openmpi does
however mvapich and intel mpi among others - both of which are mpich derivatives - support infiniband so if one is willing to define mpich as mpich and its derivatives then mpich has extremely broad network support including both infiniband and proprietary interconnects like cray seastar gemini and aries as well as ibm blue gene l p and q

25493270
openmpi	mpich
openmpi also supports the cray gemini interconnect but its usage is not supported by cray
more recently mpich supported infiniband through a netmod now deprecated but mvapich2 has extensive optimizations that make it the preferred implementation in nearly all cases

25493270
openmpi	mpich
openmpi has only recently supported mpi-3 and i find that some mpi-3 features are buggy on some platforms mpich is not bug-free of course but bugs in mpi-3 features have been far less common
historically openmpi has not had holistic support for mpi_thread_multiple which is critical for some applications

25495191
profiling	debugging
the debugging constant is similar active by default in the debugging profiling but not release
by default in the profiles debugging and release visual studio will define the trace constant

25499030
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome can access the contents of a directory that is selected using a file input field
however other browsers such as internet explorer and firefox have not implemented this feature at this time nor is there currently any way to access a directory that was not selected by the user

25501193
dictionary	map
or the traditional for-loop as please note that even though the traditional way looks bigger it can add more values like here taking only the strings from the list if the list has other data types such as lists tuples dictionary etc so i would suggest either to stick with list comprehensions for simple controlled lists or the traditional way for controlled output
if you are learning to do with lambda not an official link you should try with map and filter like this here the map lambda y y 6 x will keep only strings from 7th character and replace other smaller strings with boolean false

25501454
spaces	linefeed
to ensure that your input is working correctly use edit2 you may want to remove the spaces in your format in other words linefeed instead of linefeed as my experience with spaces in fscanf formats is that they are not doing what you want most of the time and fscanf will skip whitespaces as needed before the actual input so you should get at least as good results without the spaces
your read function should be note that format is linefeed not f

25501699
express	node.js
there are several alternatives to iis for hosting asp.net applications such as iis express apache mono cassini not actively developped kayak project not actively developped c# webserver not actively developped abyss not actively developped there are probably others but generally most of them aren t actively developed
node.js is a little different

25502544
oncreate	setcontentview
your slider class needs to be able to create and display a navigationdrawer and still remain extensible so you need to write it in such a way that overriding standard methods like oncreate and calling setcontentview does not impact on the slider class s ability to display the navigationdrawer
i would suggest creating the navigationdrawer in a fragment and inflating that fragment in the oncreate of your sliding activity

25504351
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the other wrinkle is that in the implementing class you declared the method as throwing runtimeexception
runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception and the java language says that a caller doesn t need to deal with unchecked-exception

25504351
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception and the java language says that a caller doesn t need to deal with unchecked-exception
so in fact the throws runtimeexception has no practical effect except for documenting the api designer s intent

25506712
jar	war
if you are using some third part jar use the tag lib too example
in eclipse optionally there is a supply war export options such as whether or not to include java source files in the war and whether to overwrite any existing resources during the export process

25507091
spaces	delimiter
the spaces and punctuation delimiter are treated slightly differently spaces are neither appended to the end or beginning of a line
if there aren t any consecutive spaces in the text that is. punctuation is retained at the end of a line

25508331
direct3d	directx
goto direct3d and directdraw tabs and uncheck allow hardware acceleration
disable aero mostly not necessary but do it for now disable aero download directx 9.0c control panel from here extract and run directx.cpl as administrator

25510082
profiling	benchmarking
use profiling luke
now for the nanoscale benchmarking you are having in your test not all profiling are good

25512172
getdate	datepart
select dateadd month 9 dateadd year datediff year 0 getdate 0 as october1currentyear no casting required
what you re trying to is close but datepart returns a number so the + is doing addition not concatenation

25513170
ionic	angular
i had the same problem using ionic angular + cordova
i know this not solve the problem but it s the code for angular apps based on the answers above

25513638
prepare	execute
so dumb-proof steps would be download and execute setup.exe from cygwin.com install python and python-magic execute cygwin s shell you can execute cygwin terminal from your start menu or just execute c cygwin64 bin bash.exe --login -i for example from run dialog or windows console install pip see for example pip install not functioning on windows 7 cygwin install install pushbullet library pip install pushbullet.py prepare your testing script execute it python testing_script.py or just testing_script.py if it contains the shebang line and is executable it should work if not post your errors please thank you for a tip to useful library
from the windows paths in your traceback listings i guess that you are trying to execute pushbullet script from windows version of python

25514200
apache	nginx
yes you can compress php output this way but web-servers nginx apache can do such compressing more effective for all type of content css assets etc not only php output yes you can set zlib.output_compression to numeric value this option also accepts int values instead of boolean on off using this you can set the output buffer size default is 4kb . as for max buffer size you cant set it more than web-server can handle
for example nginx use 4k or 8k output buffer. ob_gzhandler compression level use zlib.output_compression_level which is -1 per default level 6 the default value -1 lets the server decide which level to use . but

25514415
ssl	https
you can use the features of mod_ssl ssloptions +strictrequire sslrequiressl note that the sslrequiressl directive will deny all requests that do not have ssl enabled
and a normal redirect which basically rewrites the request to use https as a 403 redirect

25517166
multiplying	multiplication
for example to multiplying the two expressions together use the operator java doesn t behave quite like mathematics where concatenation implies multiplication
instead you have to explicitly multiplying operands together

25517392
jlist	jtable
looking through the jlist api it wasn t apparent to me what resulted in this functionality
i do not feel it is part of component as jtable are components and do not seem to display this functionality

25519240
viewdidload	viewwillappear
from this post view frames are not actually useable in viewdidload
you should move all of your geometry-manipulating code into viewwillappear

25520805
google-chrome	safari
android how to play inline html5 video in android browser note that is for native android browser not for android google-chrome
whereas the document ios-specific considerations says currently safari optimizes video presentation for the smaller screen on iphone or ipod touch by playing video using the full screen video controls appear when the screen is touched and the video is scaled to fit the screen in portrait or landscape mode

25522570
vb6	vba
you cannot just import the raw vb6 code into vba no
what you should be able to do is to create an activex dll with vb6

25522596
portrait	landscape
on android holding your phone in portrait is considered to be 90 degrees
this the convention that android is using landscape 0 portrait 90 reverse landscape 180 reverse portrait 270 i know this doesn t make sense for phones but it does for tablets and there is realy no difference between tablets and phones on android

25523008
passenger	webrick
this thing happens only when running in apache passenger and does not happen for webrick
apache passenger starts multiple worker processes each running a separate application instance each having its own channels array

25529241
wildfly	undertow
first of all as previously stated you will need to flush the cache manually when the session is destroyed wildfly has switched default web container to undertow so valve cannot be used anymore
you can delete that part from your jboss-web.xml to enable sso you need to edit the standalone.xml and add the single-sign-on option in the undertow subsystem sso is configured per host but is still not enough as i had to logout twice to be able to logout

25532234
implements	extends
an interface is a contract that formalizes a behavior and cannot implements logic
however interfaces can extends other interfaces

25532496
g++	gcc
if you intended to compile the code as c in which case you do not require the cast use gcc instead of g++
also make sure you your file does not end with an extension that gcc interprets as c++ .cpp .c .cxx or .cc

25533163
realloc	malloc
this second code uses realloc instead of malloc which does not solve the previous problems but also adds probable segmentation faults realloc on an uninitialized pointer is a bad idea
this third code does the same as the first one for the first part but then uses realloc on for i starting with 0

25536304
kerberos	ntlm
in ad you need to enable the following objects for allow kerberos delegation addomain apppoolcredential1 addomain apppoolcredential2 machine1 machine2 for more information see here
you cannot do ntlm and then kerberos over multiple hops servers

25536304
kerberos	ntlm
you cannot do ntlm and then kerberos over multiple hops servers
you need to use kerberos to delegate windows authentication over all the hops

25539863
apache	nginx
possibly some modules that apache has but nginx does not have
then you would need apache in your stack somewhere quite fittingly at the backend just to do the tasks those modules do

25541287
implements	extends
you can even adapt to a marker interface that doesn t do anything useful by itself and make classes implements that interface externally just excerpts from local code here class iillustratablecontent interface this content has an image reference it sometimes might use class illustratableextender object adapts iillustratablecontent implements ischemaextender ibrowserlayerawareextender # do stuff and configure.zcml
schemaextenders adapt an interface and not the class itself so for your simple extends formfolder example you shouldn t need to do anything special

25553699
google-chrome	firefox
fat arrow function is not implemented in google-chrome yet
however firefox does support it

25555211
swift	objective-c
right now this only works for objective-c and not swift
in swift you can create your own global timestamp with and then you ll be able to use kfirebaseservervaluetimestamp in the same way

25557100
postgresql	mysql
for example rating value ------------------ g 1 postgresql 10 pg-13 20 r 30 nc-17 40 than give each movie the numerical value of the rating or use a join and then sort on that
mysql knows how to sort numbers and letters but not movie ratings

25558217
glut	sdl
you might want to give it a try although if sdl is not as rigid as glut is for eg than you are good to go
while i have no experience with sdl there is a very good chance you will not hit any barriers as a result of using it with opencl

25559068
subtraction	addition
since i am not sure on operator precedence i checked and found that is lower than subtraction so my parenthesis weren t necessary
the addition part works because string + string results in stringstring

25559517
swift	objective-c
the skfieldnode class method lineargravityfieldwithvector does this but it s not available in swift
in objective-c vector parameter uses the vector_float3 type from the simd library which uses special c compiler magic to make vectors that use sse on os x x86 or neon on ios arm hardware acceleration and pack nicely for sending to gpus

25562430
ssl	https
if the scheme https is used the ssl application needs to be started
when https links needs to go through a proxy the connect method extension to http-1.1 is used to establish a tunnel and then the connection is upgraded to tls however tls upgrade according to rfc 2817 is not supported

25563160
gif	png	gif	bmp
a lossless format will not produce these problems which is why gif works
or png bmp etc.

25564575
allocator	stl
as long as you are going to use the allocator with stl containers or code that adheres to the same conventions you can define your allocator by just specialising std allocator_traits for your class for which it then just suffices to be defined
thinking of it i think you might even hijack an existing non-allocator class for this purpose since calls to your allocator will not be made directly but through the std allocator_traits specialisation

25565326
prepare	execute
edit as debflav pointed out and i ve also touched upon the matter that your queries could benefit from not being execute as simple queries but transforming them into prepare statements
for the full story you could start checking out php.net prepare statements or to keep it short prepare statements look almost just like your everyday query however variables are not just concatenated into the query string rather bindings are used. you use the database handler s prepare function instead of query - with this method you are requesting the mysql server to inspect your query and optimize it for later use which will come handy if you re doing the same query over and over again just with a few varying values

25565763
webkit	gecko
note if using phantom to test web sockets you will need to get phantom 2.x which is still experimental and does not have an easily downloadable beta yet as phantom 1.x uses an old webkit
slimerjs always uses a recent gecko firefox engine so is fine

25569752
uiview	calayer
i create category of uiview and add method to make round rect and border
this is method of that category i get idea of using uibezierpath from this amazing article thinking like a bézier path i get most of code from this two link uiview category for rounding just the corners which you want not all like calayer cornerradius

25571659
super	implements
implements the cell s setselected animated you should already have one and do not call super s version
note that that will interfere with the selection state so it ll break when you come to implements your own animation

25573078
factors	mean
otherwise ffmpeg by default and depending on several factors will attempt to minimize or avoid chroma subsampling and the result is often not playable by non-ffmpeg based players
do not use -sameq it does not mean same quality this option has been removed from ffmpeg a while ago

25574483
nfa	dfa
that algorithm is deterministic - there s a specific sequence of steps to follow to convert an nfa to a dfa and accordingly you ll always get back the same dfa whenever you feed in the same nfa
you could conceivably have a nondeterministic algorithm for converting an nfa to a dfa where the algorithm might produce one of many different dfas as output but to the best of my knowledge there aren t any famous algorithms of this sort

25576501
swift	objective-c
in my case all i had to do was open the edit scheme window product schemes edit scheme for the embedded swift framework target and uncheck shared
i guess because non-embedded swift frameworks aren t yet supported sharing a framework scheme implies there must be an objective-c component of the module

25577369
strncpy	malloc
using strncpy target source strlen source guarantees that the string in target is not null terminated
if perchance malloc returns zeroed memory then it will seem to work but once malloc returns non-zeroed memory previously allocated memory things will go wrong

25582098
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
do note that recovery from a runtimeexception is generally possible but the guys who designed the class exception deemed it unnecessary for the end programmer to check for such exceptions
errors are also unchecked-exception the programmer is not required to do anything with these

25585599
touchesbegan	touchesended
set a flag in touchesbegan and clear it again in touchesended
in your animation block for touchesended check the flag and do not rescale to 1 1 if the flag is set

25586633
content-length	content-type
on the subject of content-length and transfer-encoding note that neither can be sent in which case the length of the response is determined by the number of octets received prior to the server closing the connection. 3.1.1.5
content-type if a content-type header field is not present the recipient may either assume a media type of application octet-stream rfc2046 section 4.5.1 or examine the data to determine its type

25587789
udp	tcp
if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time tcp is only slightly worse than udp
udp is much better suited for low-latency communications

25587789
udp	tcp
beware of nat firewalls however - not all are capable or are set up for udp address mapping
also be aware that tcp is a stream and as such does not provide message packetization

25588787
backgrounding	multitasking
this was not apparent in your first example because the caused the shell to fork a backgrounding process first basically rendering the exec useless anyway.
the process scheduler achieves apparent multitasking by running a snippet of each task at a time then rapidly switching to another

25589186
wordpress	joomla
can apparently import a wordpress blog posterous to joomla i m not aware of any tools to import posterous data directly into joomla but there seem to be a few tools to import posterous data to wordpress it looks like the best course of action is to import your posterous data into wordpress before migrating your wordpress site to joomla
wordpress to core joomla there are several tools one free that can help with migrating wordpress to core joomla

25591740
google-chrome	firefox
here is an example that highlights the same problem i added this which results in this in google-chrome that grey border would not be between the double red border if it was not a bug
for comparison this is how it should look taken in firefox here are the rules of border conflicts rule 1 you do not talk about border conflicts the following rules determine which border style wins in case of a conflict borders with the border-style of hidden take precedence over all other conflicting borders

25593803
express	node.js
using a framework such as express and a lot of modules it is not python node.js does not have a big standard library with a lot of cool things in it will allow you to build large projects
node.js is a powerful fast developing technology

25595398
division	modulo
i found this question searching for division by zero error when using modulo but the reason why was different
modulo the operator will not work when the denomenator is is less than 1

25595969
scrollable	panels
doing the latter the editor will not be scrollable in the scroll panels
update in my working program there is more than just an editor panels in the contentpane

25596066
textview	imageview
textview is not designed for this
your choices are stick with webview figure out how to render your mathematical expressions to images then either use an imageview imagespan etc

25600653
google-chrome	firefox
if you see the console in google-chrome it says resource interpreted as stylesheet but transferred with mime type text html
and in firefox the stylesheet was not loaded because its mime type text html is not text css

25607153
haskell	idris
the type of the parsed expression cannot depend only on the input string in a haskell function because it does not allow for dependant types
if you want to go down this path i might suggest you have a look at a language called idris

25609239
xslt	xquery
it supports xpath 2.0 functions but only as part of xquery not xslt
as far as i can tell from the release notes datapower only supports xslt version 1.0

25610522
implements	extends
as a side note if b was abstract instead of final then you could create a class a.c extends b.b that in turn would be able to implements a.a.method
using these classes i can reproduce the problem and however my ide eclipse gave me a different error message so ymmv this class must implements the inherited abstract method a.method but cannot override it since it is not visible from b

25610779
implements	extends
for example you could use a before_save callback to implements your logic if for some reason a callback does not fit your use casae call the custom method directly in the controller
i have an association of cart and transaction in which cart has_many transactions and transaction belongs_to cart since that s the case and you already have a cart object in your controller just instantiate the transaction from the cart cart_id will then be available to all the instance methods in the model so there is no need to extends with additional logic unrelated to the app_token

25610940
arc4random	srand
swift uses nil for a null-pointer and the return value of time has to be cast to an uint32 srand uint32 time nil but consider to use arc4random or its variants instead
from arc4random does not require an initial seed with srand or srandom making it that much easier to use

25610940
arc4random	srand
from arc4random does not require an initial seed with srand or srandom making it that much easier to use
arc4random has a range up to 0x100000000 4294967296 whereas rand and random top out at rand_max 0x7fffffff 2147483647

25612711
comparator	comparable
in order for classes a and b to be mutually comparable these requirements need to be satisfied a call of comparator on an instance of a passing an instance of b must be allowed a call of comparator on an instance of b passing an instance of a must be allowed if a.compareto b returns x then b.compareto a must return a value y with the opposite sign or zero when x is zero
the classes in your code are not mutually comparable because an attempt to pass an instance of c to b s comparator and vice versa works fine

25612711
comparator	comparable
the classes in your code are not mutually comparable because an attempt to pass an instance of c to b s comparator and vice versa works fine
however they are not comparable to instances of their own classes which would create a problem if you were to add more items to the collection to be sorted

25613704
multiplying	addition
multiplying a value by 1 is a way to ensure that it gets converted to a number if it isn t
when you add two things in javascript if either is a string then the operation gets evaluated as string concatenation not addition

25616689
union	distinct
a limitation of this feature is that an order by clause applying to the result of a union intersect or except clause can only specify an output column name or number not an expression
for your case there is no need of using uniq all user id distinct already so why don t you try this user.order email desc .pluck id assuming the ids duplicated you could uniq by ruby instead of db

25617055
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
however if you just take the o 2n-1 2 - 2 as the complexity of the third loop and multiplying it as we did before it s interpreted as every loop of k has a complexity of 2n-1 2 - 2 which is not true
for nested loops you should apply multiplication rule instead of addition rule

25619241
phpunit	behat
with phpunit you can configure the environment in a bootstrap and that configuration will be used throughout the entire testing
with behat you have a different situation unlike phpunit it makes requests to a server and doesn t talk to your php code directly

25619372
union	distinct
anyway you can perhaps use the good old union trick when i tried it on ideone it printed i got -0.007412 note that this relies on unspecified behavior so it s possible it might break if your compiler does not implement the access in the most straight-forward manner
this is distinct form undefined behavior which would make the code invalid but still not optimal

25619932
wildfly	jboss
if you want to update the version of resteasy used in jboss see if it is an option you can also use wildfly which supports resteasy 3.0.6 out of box
if the question is why am i getting noclassdeffounderror the answer is because the dependency org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jaxrs is marked as provided and therefore not available at runtime. note that jboss 7.1 does not use the version 3.0.8 of reasteasy in your case probably resteasy 2.3.5 but i don t know what is the value of version.jboss.bom you use

25620434
config	ini
config inifiles parses ini files
if your files isn t a valid ini file then config inifiles won t be able to parse it

25621998
gridbaglayout	miglayout	gridbaglayout	grouplayout
gridboxpanel.java here i have used the gridlayout manager instead of the gridbaglayout
it is maybe only the third example that i found where gridlayout can be useful. i made this modification to make things easier but i would personally not use gridlayout ever and create a solution completely with grouplayout or miglayout managers. gridlayout is not portable because it sets margins in pixels

25625649
jar	war
ok with the docs posted by geoand i found the following do not use the src main webapp folder if your application will be packaged as a jar
although this folder is a common standard it will only work with war packaging and it will be silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar

25626824
aggregate-functions	sum
you should be able to combine the two queries into a single query by using an aggregate-functions along with some conditional logic like a case expression see demo
your check on the second query if the c.email is not null is moved into the sum case

25628239
jsdom	cheerio
you can get this to work but you ll need another module called jsdom because jquery needs a dom window to operate it s not designed for node.js
install it with npm install jsdom --save please note i m using the latest jquery 2.1.1 and jsdom 1.0.0-pre.6 both installed via npm and then in your node.js file app.js then in node.js you run it node app.js and see the output perhaps the better option is to use something like cheerio which is a fast flexible and lean implementation of core jquery designed specifically for the server

25630217
memcpy	memmove
on linux up until fairly recently the implementation of memcpy worked in a way that was similar enough to memmove that overlapping memory wasn t an issue and in my experience other unixs were the same
this doesn t change the fact that this is undefined behavior according to the standard and you are just lucky that on some platforms it sometimes works -- and memmove is the standard-supported right answer

25633081
oncreate	setcontentview
solution always initialized your textview inside your oncreate after setcontentview and having your textview object as a global instance
my application stops when i declare the textview outside the oncreate method that is because the layout is not yet inflated in your activity thus crashing you app and i am 100 sure the error is npe when you set the text here textview.settext hello

25635244
awt	swing
when you use frame.add game you are replaceing what ever use to be at borderlayout.center instead of mixing lightweight swing and heavy weight awt components paint the background image as part of your render process
bufferstrategy doesn t play well with swing as you ve taken control of the painting process canvas can t be transparent so it will hide anything beneath it.

25638162
bash	zsh
dtcmp.sh sample outputs bash dash ksh zsh summary the shells all agree that the pure numeric comparison of iso 8601 date strings does not work
only bash accepts and works correctly with the and operators in plain test aka the other shells either do not accept it or accept it but produce the wrong answer which is worse

25638408
client-side	server-side
it s true client-side validation ensures that the data you will get will be valid as long as the user does not mess with the client forge a response use another client
however you can never be sure of this so you will need to have a server-side validation also

25639676
build.gradle	gradlew
for migrating from eclipse to android studio do not need to specify the gradlew home. locate the project you exported from eclipse expand it select the build.gradle file and click ok
in the following dialog leave use gradlew wrapper selected and click ok

25639804
direct3d	directx
also which isn t so widely known i think if you have customers that are going to run your applications in a citrix environment then directx direct3d xna won t be as economical a choice as opengl
the reason for this is that opengl applications can be co-hosted on a lesser number of servers due to performance issues a single server cannot host an infinite number of application instances than directx xna applications which demands dedicated virtual servers to run in hardware accelerated mode

25641594
fgets	fread
you should probably use something like 15s or another function like fread fgets
edit using fgets and strncpy closing stream and memory no need to declare global variables for thing that looks like local variable variable are initialized where they are needed it might not work with all c standard but it should with fgets reads in at most one less than sizeof x characters from fin

25644891
bash	subshell
if you are using bash 4.2 or later you can enable the lastpipe option to use the natural pipeline
the while loop will execute in the current shell not a subshell so and variables you set or change will still be visible following the pipeline

equals	gethashcode
but to be honest once you ve implemented equality it s usually really easy to write gethashcode with code like this perhaps - and if it s not easy then that s often a sign that your equals method will violate its contract anyway
note that gethashcode isn t just used for dictionaries - if you try to join two lists in linq based on a key of your type that will use gethashcode too

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
basically phpstorm webstorm + php + database support webstorm comes with certain mainly javascript oriented plugins bundled by default while they need to be installed manually in phpstorm if necessary
at the same time plugins that require php support would not be able to install in webstorm for obvious reasons

25647482
phpstorm	webstorm
is that phpstorm doesn t support js part like webstorm that s not correct your wording
missing extra technology in phpstorm for example node angularjs does not mean that basic javascript support has missing functionality

25649006
swift	objective-c
you can get all variables from class instance by using class_copyivarlist as i know swift doesn t support optional vars loop over them and get names
playground output myinteger myboolean mystring edit 1 ivar refers to objective-c runtime edit 2 if you interesting to get values also do two things inherit your cass from nsobject a.e

25650386
google-chrome	firefox
one can set cursor by using the trick of user3920458 but cursor will only change in google-chrome and not in firefox and probably other browsers when clicked
tested a javascript solution on image map but that also became very hackish as firefox seem to want cursor movement before changing the cursor back sometimes it does not change at all etc

25650386
opera	google-chrome
only tested in google-chrome firefox and opera
opera does not change cursor on active for anchors

25650386
opera	firefox
opera does not change cursor on active for anchors
that is it has some of the same problems as firefox during the click mouse down hack for maps one have to drag the mouse whilst holding button down for cursor to change and is quite buggy

25651263
client-side	server-side
two possible problems with your code a button of type button will not execute a server-side action it s meant only for navigation and client-side business mostly javascript
unless you really mean to you shouldn t have to set the type attribute on your buttons it defaults to the kind that executes server-side actions

25652200
cloudant	couchdb
if it doesn t the cloudant folks are really helpful on the #cloudant freenode irc channel
if you suspect something is fundamentally wrong in the replication between pouchdb and cloudant you can sync from pouchdb to couchdb and then from couchdb to cloudant

25652440
kerberos	ldap
while you can connect to the service with this name you cannot easily authenticate against it with kerberos because one cannot bind the same spn ldap example.com example.com to more than one account
if you try authenticate anyway you will receive a server not found in kerberos database 7 error

25653157
swift	objective-c
the first problem i faced was swift extension can t have stored properties
first of all categories in objective-c also cannot have stored properties called synthesized properties

25655730
factors	matrix
his code is needlessly complicated because the matrix was of class character rather than being a factors so conversion to data.frame and then needing to use as.character was unnecessary
r matrix cannot be factors since matrix are not supposed to have any attributes other than a dim vector and dimname-lists and the core atomic vector that carries its own class

25656262
quicksort	mergesort
for instance quicksort does not have a tight bound unless we are talking specifically about either best average or worst case analysis as it s ω nlogn in the best and average cases but o n 2 in the worst case
on the other hand mergesort is both ω nlogn and o nlogn therefore it s also θ nlogn

25664317
google-chrome	firefox
and if i force google-chrome to use this ms mincho font i surely get the crappy output you get at smaller sizes so this seems to be what google-chrome defaults to on your box for those missing glyphs
at small sizes ms mincho actually looks a little better but not by much in ie11 on firefox on the other hand the missing glyphs in gabriola get served from segoe ui symbol which is why they look good if you actually force firefox to use the crappy ms mincho font it looks just as bad as ie11 apparently the pixelated look at small sizes of ms mincho and its brother ms gothic is somehow by design

25664828
equals	icomparable
important to note that string class although a reference type overrides equals to provide value comparison instead of the default reference comparison
thus even if you do not implement iequatable or icomparable on your class distinct will work fine using the default valuetype.equals function

25665931
profiling	benchmarking
apart from a profiling like visualvm there are frameworks like jmh or caliper but admittedly using them may be some effort
for the simplest form of a very basic manual java microbenchmark you have to consider the following run the algorithms multiple times to give the jit a chance to kick in run the algorithms alternatingly and not only one after the other run the algorithms with increasing input size somehow save and print the results of the computation to prevent the computation from being optimized away don t print anything to the console during the benchmarking consider that timings may be distorted by the garbage collector gc again these are only rules of thumb and there may still be unexpected results refer to the links above for more details

25671795
prepare	execute
if you add the return clauses to each callback it should work edit it seems angular s finally implementation is not quite prepare to pass a value to the callback
however there is another way to produce the effect you want just replace the finally by another then since the promises are execute sequentially the final then will run lastly

25673810
super	extends
it puts those objects together in one super - or wrapping -object
the very difference is that after extends both objects are independend and with the second way not

25675406
ienumerable	icollection
if it s not you can check if it implements ienumerable and if it does create an enumerator and see if you can move to the first item
you can first check if the object implements icollection like lists and arrays do as checking the size of one of those is cheaper as they have a count property

25676795
lxml	libxml2
so the fact that you thought christoph gohlke didn t provide binaries for lxml implies that you hadn t found these docs
so it s possible that you did install libxml2 but not in a way that lxml2 s setup script can find it

25678209
daemons	systemd
not only we found this method to be less memory intensive but you can also kill it without restarting apache by running the following command kill processid edit as dagon pointed out this is not really the true way of running php as a daemons but using the nohup command can be considered as the poor man s way of running a process as a daemons
we have used the infinite loop in a live systemd environment to basically wait for incoming sms and then process it

25684103
wildfly	jboss
wildfly boms aka jboss bill of materials in its original version is a set of dependencies used to enhance deployment of dependant projects and automate in some way their tests
it does not unfortunately includes dependencies used in wildfly core the application server

25685414
hex	binary
keeping the hex notation on the resulting value
this is not necessary possible because an int is already a hexadecimal value and a decimal value and a binary value depending on how you interpret it

25686441
mockito	cactus
i prefer mockito and arquillian for server-side testing
cactus served as a good server-side testing framework in the ejb2 ages and but it s not supported anymore

25686973
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is not stable so the order of tied rows is not necessarily in the same order as the original data
however even if you were to use a stable sort such as mergesort when you reverse the result of np.argsort for rows that are tied the higher index comes first

25687233
g++	gcc
so if the library that you link with at run time is version xyz you should have used an -i command line option to get g++ to find the corresponding header files or things might not link or worse result in unexplainable crashes
ps after typing the below info i thought i d be kind and add what you need for your specific case g++ -wl -rpath home andrew install lib -o main main.cpp -i home andrew install include -l home andrew install lib -lboost_serialization -lboost_iostreams gcc itself doesn t care about the libraries

25688204
aggregate-functions	sum
i d suggest doing this with an aggregate-functions case expression see sql fiddle with demo
you d use the case logic to look specifically for the opening and closing values and then the final column would sum the rows where the type is not opening or closing

25689246
factors	mean
melt just coerces each factors to character and drops their attributes when creating the value column in the result
in this case the warning doesn t matter but you need to be very careful when combining columns that are not of the same type where type does not mean just vector type but generically the nature of things it refers to

25690012
bash	subshell
it seems you ve caught bash in a little bit of an optimization
however add a second command say the bash null command which does nothing and this is the result one of the main reasons to use a subshell is that you can perform operations like i o redirection on a group of commands instead a single command but if your subshell contains only a single command there s not much reason to really fork a new bash process first

25690117
swift	objective-c
since all this stuff is in beta and since the swift compiler is at least as of today not open i guess there is no real answer to your question
first of all comparing objective-c to swift compiler is somehow cruel

25690201
rar	zip
console version rar.exe cannot be used here as it supports only rar archives
extraction from zip tar and other archive formats is supported only by winrar.exe

25692989
puma	unicorn
i realize this is probably not best practice but i m curious if there is some conflict between rack-timeout and unicorn and or puma which is odd because heroku recommends rack-timeout for use with unicorn
anyway puma is working great for us but we did still see some random inexplicable timeouts even after the puma upgrade

25693874
sudo	passwd
sudo the sudo command may not work in a crontab
generally you need a passwd to run sudo but there might be a way to have it run without a passwd when running in a cron job

25696296
implements	extends
browsers aren t required to implements prototype inheritance for host objects though most do and the implementation details of host objects and methods are largely hidden so this is not an option
you might try extends the event api but you really should not mess with host objects

25697223
namenode	hdfs
do the following steps create a directory in your home directory for keeping namenode image datanode blocks replace with your login name modify your hdfs-site.xml file in your hadoop_conf_dir hadoop configuration direcotry as follows format your hdfs namenode start using
looks like you are not overriding the hdfs configurations dfs.name.dir dfs.data.dir by default it points to tmp directory which will be cleared when your machine restarts

25698128
firefox	safari
you can check your page in say safari which at present doesn t do cors checking for fonts and firefox that does to double check this is the problem described
see stack overflow answer on amazon s3 cors cross-origin resource sharing and firefox cross-domain font loading for the amazon s3 cors details

25698807
google-chrome	firefox
i can replicate it in firefox 31 but not in google-chrome 37 not sure what happened
in firefox it requests twice in google-chrome only once

25702227
thin	unicorn
a key difference in the two web servers you have used seems to be that one thin is eventmachine-based and one unicorn is not
the websocket rails project wiki states that a standalone server mode must be used for non-eventmachine-based web servers such as unicorn which would require an even more complex setup on heroku as it requires a redis server

25712222
inline	inlining
the specific reasons why a function might not be inline when the inline keyword aren t documented by microsoft
the closest i can find is the documentation for compiler warning c4710 . the inline keyword is only a hint and the compiler uses heuristics to determine whether inlining is a worthwhile optimization

25714485
operands	scalar
the third operands doesn t matter vshufpd xmm3 xmm2 xmm2 1 now xmm1 contains the higher-half of xmm0 and xmm3 contains the higher half of xmm2
the problem is that printf only treats xmmn registers as scalar they only hold one value

25717239
primes	palindrome
it would be a primes if the number is less or equal to sqrt n and devides n
function isitprime improve some notes about isitpalin the return result is swapped when is palindrome you must return true not false

25717269
equals	compareto
we need to override equals method to compare java objects
some additional information c++ has operator over loading java does not provide operator over loading. also other possibilities in java are implement compare interface .which defines a compareto method

25717355
bash	zsh
in zsh will also be replaced with the first command in the history while in bash it will be replaced by a command starting with 1
if you re using zsh on ubuntu then you are not using bash

25717663
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
sample 2 - using the translatey transformation demo for sample 2 update based on comments looks like even the latest google-chrome v39.0.2145.4 dev-m opera v23.0 and safari v5.1.7 on windows which are all powered by webkit still require the vendor prefix -webkit- for animations to work
firefox v32.0 and ie v10 do not require any vendor prefixes for the animations

25722666
inline	inlining
the inline keyword is more of a hint to the compiler than an explicit directive these days
there is no specific rule about not inlining functions with return statements

25723472
matlab	simulink
you could create a matlab function
see or you can solve it in simulink by for example a switch indicating whether it is close to one of your standard numbers u 11 u 0 abs mod u 1 0.05 then round the value if true do whatever you like when not

25726224
swift	objective-c
apparently dynamic in swift is used for key-value observing not declaring a variable s accessors to be defined at runtime what dynamic does in objective-c see this for a description of dynamic in swift and this for the description of why nsmanaged works the way dynamic does in objective-c
looking a little deeper for you it seems the hurdle is a misunderstanding of what the dynamic modifier in swift does

25726939
apache	nginx
please look at aws banchmark turn mysql and apache for low memory. 2.1 find via google how to optimize apache web server performance article on digitalocean com. 2.2 wizard for mysql yes mod_wsgi less memory way then others but if there is only one python instance in one moment only one connect then it s not big profit
try to replace apache2 to nginx if it possible

25727950
macports	homebrew
i too use macports and not homebrew
i seem to have fixed this by changing lines 21 22 in .julia v0.3 nettle deps build.jl to i added the macports lib and include dirs explicitly

25728384
ienumerable	ilist
of course one option that you have is to accept an interface such as ienumerable and then materialize it into a collection yourself possibly as a 3rd overload with overloads for arrays and lists to avoid the need to re-materialize those because if you ve materialized it yourself then you know it s not deferring execution
i know ilist would do the job actually it would not

25731092
ubuntu	linux
if you want the easy route to installing and updating oracle java 8 including the jre jdk and plugins for browsers on ubuntu 12.04 or later then i recommend doing it this way
first delete the file you downloaded as it isn t needed and proceed with these instructions open a linux terminal command prompt and issue these commands sudo add-apt-repository ppa webupd8team java this will add a repository where developers place updated version of oracle java 8 in a format easily installed by ubuntu package managers

25731092
sudo	passwd
first delete the file you downloaded as it isn t needed and proceed with these instructions open a linux terminal command prompt and issue these commands sudo add-apt-repository ppa webupd8team java this will add a repository where developers place updated version of oracle java 8 in a format easily installed by ubuntu package managers
when running that command it may or may not prompt you for your passwd

25732825
express	node.js
but then you must pass the cookie withcredentials true created by express in the following ajax request. if you are using jquery in the following way if you are not then on every call in your node.js server asking for request.isauthenticated will return the right value
other tip don t forget to modify your response headers in the express response to allow credentials and specify the origin to make it work in chrome response.header access-control-allow-credentials true

25733046
implements	extends
if those contracts are not compatible then c cannot both extends b and implements a
in this case you could use composition instead of inheritance -- have c implements a and include a b in its representation

25734523
bash	subshell
the pipe character in bash does notthing esle then connecting the output stream of the first command to the input stream of the second
echo 123 | cat is essentially the same as the latter does only start one subshell though while the first starts one for each command but this can be ignored here - plus it s a bashism and does not work in sh

25734552
google-chrome	safari
i m waiting for their response too update today 09 09 14 the error changed in google-chrome
now i get the following error failed to create a screenshot for screenshots for 4-inch iphone 5 and ipod touch 5th generation retina display in safari i keep getting error your app information could not be saved

25735062
swift	objective-c
if you find yourself adding a single byte frequently you could extend nsmutabledata edit swift 3
according to using swift with cocoa and objective-c when a function is declared as taking a unsafepointer argument it can accept any of the following nil which is passed as a null pointer an unsafepointer unsafemutablepointer or autoreleasingunsafemutablepointer value which is converted to unsafepointer if necessary an in-out expression whose operand is an lvalue of type type which is passed as the address of the lvalue a type value which is passed as a pointer to the start of the array and lifetime-extended for the duration of the call the third bullet means you can do note you must use var here and not let because it must be an lvalue

25736391
inline	inlining
as others have suggested for really small functions that are sure to benefit from being called inline it is best practice to put them in header files so dynamically linked libraries will also not suffer any significant performance loss
in any case inlining functions will only affect performance for functions that are being called very often inside loops that are going to be called thousands millions of times

25737352
serializable	deserialization
should not be used when full control on generated xml structure is required xmlserializer xmlserializer is only for xml serializable supports full control over the xml structure serializable only public properties
datacontractserializer is meant to be used for serializable deserialization of class in wcf service to and from either json or xml

25737442
google-chrome	safari
it has the following features column headers repeat on each page no need to worry about paper size or how many rows will fit-- the browser handles everything automatically page breaks occur only between rows cell borders are always fully closed if a page break occurs near the top of the table it won t leave behind an orphaned caption or column headers with no data attached a problem which isn t limited to just google-chrome works in google-chrome
and other webkit-based browsers like safari and opera .

25738647
persistent	transient
instances may exist in one of the following three states at a given point in time transient a new instances of a a persistent class which is not associated with a session and has no representation in the database and no identifier value is considered transient by hibernate
persistent you can make a transient instances persistent by associating it with a session

25750248
swift	objective-c
this may have changed between the beta releases. in addition the initwithcoder method has to be marked as required in swift 3 the required methods are
as you can see in the detailed compiler messages in the report navigator your methods are not declared correctly error type serverinfo does not conform to protocol nscoding class serverinfo nsobject nscoding foundation.nscoding 2 32 note protocol requires function encodewithcoder with type nscoder - void objective-c encodewithcoder func encodewithcoder acoder nscoder note candidate has non-matching type nscoder

25750928
super	implements
now there are lots of ways that super could be implements but pep 3135 spells out a specification for how to implements it every function will have a cell named __class__ that contains the class object that the function is defined in
this isn t part of the python reference docs so some other python 3.x implementation could do it a different way but at least as of 3.2+ they still have to have __class__ on functions because creating the class object explicitly says this class object is the one that will be referenced by the zero-argument form of super

25750928
super	implements
this allows the zero argument form of super to correctly identify the class being defined based on lexical scoping while the class or instance that was used to make the current call is identified based on the first argument passed to the method
and needless to say this is exactly how at least cpython 3.0-3.5 and pypy3 2.0-2.1 implements super anyway. of course this gets the actual class object not the name of the class which is apparently what you were after

25751738
swift	objective-c
apple has a massive amount of objective-c source code that it s not going to port to swift any time soon. almost all ios tutorials examples and books use objective-c
almost all ios-specific third-party source code you might want to use is implemented in objective-c

25751738
swift	objective-c
the swift language and its standard library are currently not very well documented
stick with objective-c for now

25753809
config	ini
why are cmake files a series of commands and not just config files eg ini xml yaml compilers don t use a universal config so cmake must adapt for the target compiler
cmake files are a series of commands to generate the appropriate config for the target compiler

25755579
bash	zsh
if you re using mac s default of bash you want .bashrc instead
afaik .zsh is not a file used by any shell not even zsh

25756372
postorder	inorder
you can reconstruct a tree with inorder and preorder or postorder traversals
you cannot in the general case reconstruct a tree with a preorder and postorder traversals there might be more than 1 option

25756716
textmate	sublimetext
i m not familiar with sublimetext but i have heard that it s very similar to textmate it may actually be based on textmate i m not sure
i am familiar with textmate 1.5 though and it does have a feature like this which allows you to setup tab triggers and templates by using the built in bundle editor

25757601
implements	extends
the second broken pipe you could fix by redirecting the pipeline stdout to the mid file it implements in your command without the shell
3 what might be the most compelling reason that i shouldn t write in first way if any of top_count extends mid summit come from a source that is not completely under your control then you risk running an arbitrary command under your user

25758421
g++	gcc
the difference is really only that g++ links automatically with the c++ runtime library and gcc doesn t
the errors are all about missing symbols from the gcc c++ runtime library and have nothing to do with c++11 features you use

25761426
ssl	https
second one is that you configured www.anymarket.co to be ssl endpoint not anymarket.co because of that you are getting index page on subdomain. you can test it with curl curl -kvi and curl -kvi in other words your link in mail should be like this one
your ssl config is wrong if you want to send a link there are two problems first you get pure http port 80 unencrypted protocol but you configured ssl so you get redirected to https protocol

25762263
punctuation	words
here are some test cases matching of with spaces before and after will not work in the cases where of is at the beginning at the end before a punctuation .
the best way to do it is to use a regexp means any char zero or more times . b is a words boundary . means the character o upper case or lower case

25763401
required	placeholder
the reason why it has some resistance in it s use is that if one is already a programmer one must make an effort to retrain the brain not to name everything just as if they can remember they may have found learning to code in the first place required quite an effort
examples now let s look at some specific uses more formally placeholder syntax means it them that their etc pronouns 1 lines.map _.length can be read as map lines to their length similarly we can read lineoption.map _.length as map the line to it s length

25768382
innodb	myisam
innodb tables do not support fulltext indexes
myisam features no transaction support table level locking provides full text search no limit to data in table

25768688
cobertura	eclemma	jacoco	eclemma
assuming your coverage data is being generated by your command-line module build using cobertura or jacoco when you want to see this information you ll have to run the command-line build and inspect the coverage report from the build
eclemma cannot see coverage from powermock-based tests

25772365
punctuation	words
as a side-note i d like to name a few limitations that your given app s online version has the converting is done only when a space new line or punctuation mark is entered
you cannot add letters to already converted words

25772422
arp	udp
but tcp still won t work because when the syn-ack comes back from the hext-hop router the next-hop router won t have an arp entry for this machine and won t be able to resolve one if the machine has ip address
if all you care about is sending traffic you might get away with udp sockets and a static route but even then the kernel stack may not allow it

25772717
equals	compareto
if all are equals 0 is returned
you should use equals not compareto since compareto returns an int and not a boolean as your if condition would expect

25773428
swift	objective-c
it s bridged in both directions with nsarray so for more type-safe code it s best to do your work with swift arrays and bridge only when needed for interoperating with objective-c apis
and in most imported apis swift automatically converts nsarray to so you don t even need to bridge very often. assuming the persons array is an you got from other api you can cut down on the amount of type casting relative to other answers by casting the array first also since you re using a comparator block only to sort on a specific property of your person class you might do better to use sort descriptors the persons as nsarray part may not be necessary if persons came from an objective-c api. depending on how the person class is implemented sorting with descriptors can produce a more efficient sort on the backend

25775687
division	modulo
division modulo is a generalized operation which must work for any divisor you provide not just 2
it must also check for underflow range errors and division by zero and maintain a remainder all of which takes time

25781144
ienumerable	icollection
an ienumerable variable stores an object reference which as an implementation detail will be four or eight bytes depending on the process
the same is true of a system.collections.generic.list variable an array variable an icollection variable or although not relevant to the question any reference-type variable

25784509
mvp	presenter
it is perfectly fine with mvp pattern to have properties on your view that will have complextype
so having something like this is perfectly fine and since your model is for view that has 2 inputs your model could look something like this now in your presenter you would just handle event fired from view populate model and set properties on view and regarding your concern i m striving to keep my view as passive and dumb as possible assuming it knows nothing of the presenter it doesn t subscribe to its events the presenter sends data to the view by calling iview methods instead let alone of the model

25786630
erlang	elixir
the fault tolerance of erlang is achieved because it doesn t let you share state and you have to put more thought to the design that will not involve state sharing but will be efficient
this will pay off in the long run so erlang elixir is definitely good language for this kind of apps

25787051
sudo	passwd
it would be better to configure sudo to allow you or anyone who is intended to run this script to run this particular date command without a passwd
sudo does not read the passwd from standard input by default but from the terminal itself so you cannot pipe your passwd into sudo this way

25787236
persistent	transient
to add to it all of object s variables which you have created get converted into a persistent state
so when you declare those variables as transient then it will not be persisted

25787236
persistent	transient
so when you declare those variables as transient then it will not be persistent
that is the main purpose of the transient keyword

25787820
g++	gcc
the problem probably arises due to the fact it does not find g++ compiler
it may happen that you haven t installed gcc compiler for c++ which is the most probable cause

25788405
directx	gdi
its possible that wpf can get around this since it uses directx to handle its drawing
since winforms uses gdi there isn t a lot of support for floating precision within drawing

25791257
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
or maintain a separate collection if you are using the sortedlist only because you were hoping to be able to sort it by values use instead
if the values are guaranteed to be unique you can use two sortedlists or sorteddictionaries by the way sorteddictionary is much more efficient if you are inserting data out of order so i ll use that for the second collection if the values are not guaranteed to be unique then you can either calculate a new collection whenever you need the data in value order here i assume that sortinlist is a or some other type that implements .

25796218
google-chrome	firefox
strictly speaking it is the first one that is causing the behaviour you are seeing because it stops #2 from ever happening but if the bug were fixed in google-chrome then as the question stands only dealing with the initial markup not any subsequent user interaction #2 would apply
it s also worth noting that #2 is what causes the similar but not identical behaviour in firefox

25796494
inline	inlining
if i replace the calls to math.abs with an inline check the time is reduced to 4.0 seconds
possibly .net is not optimizing or inlining the calls to math.abs while java does do so

25800721
comparator	comparable
you don t say but my guess is that your code is not compiling because class solocomparator does not actually implement the methods required by the comparator interface
you seem to be confusing comparator with comparable

25803157
comparator	comparable
lets take a look at the source code deep down in comparabletimsort.countrunandmakeascending there is the line the pertinent bit is - is cast to a comparable and then the comparator is called on that as a comparable
so if i can do this if it does not then i obviously cannot assign the instance to a comparable type and therefore i have no idea without resorting to reflection what methods contact has

25807014
google-chrome	firefox
this jsperf shows that google-chrome is the fastest and sanest i would expect uint32array to perform the fastest and that ie only defined the interfaces but did not care to optimize typed arrays
the firefox results are obscured because the console is flooded with warnings about how jsperf compiles the test code

entity-relationship	diagram
this has to do with the fact that the original entity-relationship model did not have modeling conventions for gen-spec superclass subclassing or for unions
unlike most people i prefer to make a sharp distinction between diagram that depict an entity-relationship model and ones that depict a relational model

unlike most people i prefer to make a sharp distinction between diagram that depict an entity-relationship model and ones that depict a relational model
contrary to prevailing opinion entity-relationship modeling isn t just relational lite

swift	objective-c
whether you use any or anyobject depends on your intended use if your dictionary will be used only within swift code then you should use any because your types int double float string array and dictionary are not objects
if you will be passing your dictionary to objective-c routines that expect an nsdictionary then you should use anyobject

25809478
swift	objective-c
from the swift programming language - also note that when you work with cocoa api it s common to receive an array of anyobject this is because objective-c arrays are not typified. so you need to cast them to the array type you expect
- edit december 22 2015 on the last statement note that this is changing with swift 2.0 and xcode 7

jms	jta
when installed within a javaee certified server the mq resourced adapter powered by the jms client will result in the mq queuemanager working in a resource manager role co-ordinated by the javaee server
outside of the javaee environment the jms client is not supported when working with any other jta provider

25810873
xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin
since my maven-jaxb2-plugin works and xjc via ant does not the question what is the difference. actually strict verbose and extension settings should make no difference for enums
however it may be that maven-jaxb2-plugin uses a newer version of xjc than you re using with enum

google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure why google-chrome still works in this scenario but perhaps it falls back to expanding it relative to the document
you can read a bit more about firefox s handling of partial urls

25817651
google-chrome	safari
you cannot directly remote debug google-chrome on ios currently
it uses a uiwebview that may act subtly different than mobile safari you have a few options

25819276
webkit	gecko
all this happens because of this part of code in bootstrap.js that annoying problem happens in firefox 32.0 gecko 20100101 and chromium version 37.0.2062.94 webkit 537.36 ubuntu 14.04
not happens in qupzilla version 1.6.6 webkit 537.21

25820367
factors	mean
the problem is you don t know that until you ve checked the rest of the factors
just because 9 isn t divisible by 2 doesn t mean it s prime

25820523
ssl	https
that said the url loading system does allow for default handling of ssl tls server trust evaluation
normally for https connections you do not need to implement an authentication challenge handler for nsurlauthenticationmethodservertrust

25820992
sudo	passwd
therefore the arguments that sudo gets as its argv value are an array that looks like this one argument per line sudo combines these with spaces and compares that to the commands in the sudoers file it is actually a bit more complicated than this since it does wildcard replacement etc.
thus the command it actually sees you executing for the purposes of checking permissions is when i put that command in my sudoers file i am not prompted for a passwd when i enter however i am also not prompted for a passwd when i enter any of these commands or other like them

25827994
swift	objective-c
so a .h or .m can t contain swift code the compiler will gives you some errors .
no a class must be defined in swift or in objective-c not mixed language inside single class file sorry

25827994
swift	objective-c
no a class must be defined in swift or in objective-c not mixed language inside single class file sorry
as you may have already noticed a class in swift is generally made by a single file with .swift extension while objective-c class is defined using two files .h and .m

25828170
lisp	scheme
basically because i wanted a lisp for functional programming symbiotic with an established platform designed for concurrency and couldn t find one
they are lisps either the cl or scheme dialects for functional programming symbiotic with an established platform the jvm but they are not designed for stm concurrency

25828584
ssl	https
error need openssl support for https requests this error occurs when http_request2 does not find ssl in your stream transports list
the openssl php extension must be installed in order to use the https stream protocol wrapper

25829137
swift	objective-c
init methods in swift is very different from their counterpart in objective-c
you should read the apple doc here self cannot be overridden in swift

25829470
base	fractions
thus when converting from an origin base with an exact value you may need to use an approximation in another base
specifically if the target base does not include all prime factors of the source base there are values which can t be represented accurate for example all binary fractions can be represented using decimal fractions but not all decimal fractions can be represented using binary fractions

25832898
nfa	dfa
this should be enough for nfa
however the classical power set construction to transform nfa to dfa will not work when there are transitions with intersecting character ranges. to solve this issue only one additional generalization step is required

25833338
sqoop	hadoop
naveen the link that you have provided is for sqoop2.it is not specifically for hadoop 2.0 branch.basically it tries to resolve and enhance sqoop by changing the design to client server model i.e it s major promises include ease of use ease of extension security .for more details find this interesting video for sqoop2
we can use the latest sqoop version 1.4.4 compiled library for hadoop2.0 or 1.4.5 from asf.just download the correct version of sqoop for hadoop 2.0 branch.for e.g sqoop-1.4.5.bin__hadoop-2.0.4-alpha.tar.gz can be downloaded and used without any issue with hadoop 2.0+ versions

25833338
sqoop	hadoop

if you couldn t find sqoop version i assume you are using versions earlier than 1.4.4 for hadoop2.0 + from the asf site you have to recompile the sqoop source code for hadoop 2.0 branch.but it is not required since you can just use the latest sqoop version which supports hadoop 2.0 hope you are not looking for production ready sqoop version for hadoop 2.0 since the recent versions of sqoop for hadoop2 is still in alpha phase

debian	linux
the below sample code has been written which uses system.io versioninfo monodevelop 3.1.0 installation uuid e5e69249-f5d5-40a6-9424-2ecbdf6c71c7 runtime mono 2.10.8.1 debian 2.10.8.1-1ubuntu2.2 64-bit gtk 2.24.10 gtk# 2.12.0.0 build information git revision unknown build date 2012-08-15 10 45 07+0000 operating system linux linux mantosh-inspiron-3521 3.2.0-67-generic #101-ubuntu s mp tue jul 15 17 46 11 utc 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux sampleprogram i am fully aware that this will not work on linux
has anyone worked in this area specially on mono linux to test the file dir enumeration performance

25836736
uiview	subviews
interface mycustomview uiview property assign nonatomic bool xib end and set user defined runtime attributes only in mycustomview.xib
pros none cons simply does not work setxib will be called after awakeafterusingcoder b check if self has any subviews normally you have subviews in the xib but not in the storyboard

25842155
ubuntu	linux
but we want to assess mono bcl against custom mono.posix i checked underlying implementation of both assemblies and while both would call system functions at the end the route is different as the former use mono runtime abstractions but the latter use direct p invoke so i wrote a simple code to assess performance differences for directory and file enumeration and here it is i tested with mono 3.2.8 on ubuntu 14.04.1 64-bit here is the result assessing mono posix crawl time 469 ms files count 16020 directory count 2965 assessing .net bcl crawl time 705 ms files count 16020 directory count 2965 based on my experiment there is a performance difference so based on your requirement and considering subtle differences between the two api it may not be such a bad idea to write a thin wrapper to achieve best results on both operating systems we can use direct win32 calls on windows as default implementation of file and directory io in .net is slow too
technically it should be faster on linux machines as the file system enumeration is generally faster than windows

25845039
g++	gcc
if a dynamic library exports a routine named _init then that code is executed after the loading before dlopen returns inspecting the asm output of a small shared object written in standard c++ i can see that clang 3.4 and g++ 4.8 both add an _init section however they are not required to do so
as for workarounds a gcc extension that has become commonplace does allow control of this behavior

25846714
implements	extends
the problem is in the second line in your method where you call within your service the method get is not defined if you have not implements it yourself
your controller has it because it extends a class called containeraware that implements this method

25847954
onclick	onchange
the option tag does not support the onclick event
use the onchange event on the select instead

25849032
google-chrome	firefox
location.href is uri-encoded in firefox but is not in google-chrome
so if you navigated to another hash with or without the trigger flag in firefox backbone will cache the unencoded version of your hash and then compare it with the encoded version

25851390
inline	inlining
later on the jit compiles the pipeline most likely inline within the compiled benchmark method and due to inlining limits fails to compile it all into one method
it just so happens those inlining limits are reached in the hot loop and calls to map or sum are not inline so the hot loop is unintentionally de-optimized

25853667
realloc	malloc
i m not 100 what your intent is with the realloc calls but it should probably be something like alternatively you could just define something to represent the size of a single element since you re always working with int types throughout your code
you have a bug in your malloc call

25856217
stateless	stateful
you should not inject a stateful ejb into a stateless ejb
this can have very unpredicatable consequences because lifecycle of a stateful ejb is started when injected and managed by owning bean

25856217
stateless	stateful
for more details read section named ejb 3 is not contextual here contexts and dependency injection article in order to associate a stateful ejb with the session you need to inject stateful ejb into session scoped cdi bean which can be injected freely into a stateless bean - actually only a stub is injected and session scoped bean together with the stateful ejb is created for every new session
maybe even better approach is to extract interface of the stateful bean and use a cdi producer to create a session scoped implementation of the sateful bean

25863402
unixodbc	iodbc
you can find out where unixodbc looks for files using odbcinst -j if you insist on using odbcinst.ini to define your drivers you ll need to tell unixodbc that by pointing the odbcinstini environment variable at your file
firstly that format for the odbcinst.ini file is not unixodbc it is iodbc

25863998
implements	extends
example this class provides a skeletal implementation of the set interface to minimize the effort required to implements this interface
the process of implementing a set by extends this class is identical to that of implementing a collection by extends abstractcollection except that all of the methods and constructors in subclasses of this class must obey the additional constraints imposed by the set interface for instance the add method must not permit addition of multiple instances of an object to a set

25866059
ssl	https
edit doing this is now considered to be an anti-pattern now that ssl is encouraged for everyone and doesn t have performance concerns this technique is now an anti-pattern
if the asset you need is available on ssl then always use the https asset

25866094
fgets	getline
the most typical choice would be fgets but that requires you to specify a static limit for the line s length
if you have getline you can use that it will handle any line-length but it is posix not standarc c

25867527
keystore	jks
to exchange the key you would need something portable like pkcs#11 which is a supported keystore format at least in java 8
this is not possible as the default keystore jks is a proprietary format used by java

25869727
client-side	server-side
if it does not then its a client-side application
if it does its a server-side application

25871282
fgets	getline
fgets reads until the enter key on the stdin but includes the new line character gets also reads until the return but excludes the new line character both functions null terminate the input be careful of the form of gets it does not check for buffer overflow conditions
one alternative here is to use std getline to get each line

25871657
client-side	server-side
i understand from this statement that on some browsers you can manage a client-side solution based on the http byte serving protocol
this will not work with all browsers but it will keep you from having to use a server-side solution

25872121
flask	django
now you can get all those same features with flask if you re prepared to do some integration work but the argument can just as easily be made that django is better for beginners precisely because it does come with all those things built-in
it s certainly not the case that the only benefit from django is the admin

25876903
implements	extends
in cpython of course it s implements in c but the equivalent python code is pretty trivial def __iadd__ self other self.extend other return self that extends method is equivalent to this def self.extend self iterable for element in iterable self.append element so your effectively does this obviously under the covers a lot of things are optimized
extends doesn t have to look up the append method dynamically or call it in a loop possibly expanding the list s storage multiple times it just has to have the same visible effect as if it had done so

25877252
swift	objective-c
this may be a bug in the objective-c swift bridge but it looks like arrays of uint8 or of any other byte-length-specific integer aren t compatible with objective-c
i say it may be a bug since uint8 s by themselves are fine and the swift type compatibility section of using swift with cocoa and objective-c doesn t say anything about it

25878810
serializable	deserialization
the limitations are disk size for the serializable session object shouldn t be a problem
processing deserialization and serialization of huge structures eat up cpu resources

25879559
udp	tcp
most voip services skype hangout xmpp chat and even youtube i think use udp for their streaming as it has huge gains on performances and it doesn t matter all that much if a frame made it to the other side of the line as the person could simply repeat themselves
tcp on the other hand is secure by default

25880106
swift	objective-c
for example consider this swift rendition of your method instantiating nsimage uiimage objects if you run this in instruments you ll see an allocations graph like the following but if you do it without the autorelease pool you ll see that peak memory usage is higher the autoreleasepool allows you to explicitly manage when autorelease objects are deallocated in swift just like you were able to in objective-c
note when dealing with swift native objects you generally will not receive autorelease objects

25880106
swift	objective-c
note when dealing with swift native objects you generally will not receive autorelease objects
this is why the presentation mentioned the caveat about only needing this when working with objective-c though i wish apple was more clear on this point

25882142
oncreate	onstart
i was trying to add it in onstart of the parent fragment so i could access the parent view which isn t available in oncreate
so instead of moving the code to oncreate i moved it to onactivitycreated

25882142
oncreate	onstart
this isn t a problem when adding a fragment from an activity because the activity s view is available in oncreate
if for some reason you need to add a fragment in onstart or another place where savedinstancestate is not available here s an alternative

25884799
super	self
so do class instance what_time # instance is wrongly named... def __init__ self super instance self .__init__ # here you do the requested call or if you cannot change your classes to new.style classes for some reason just derive from object additionally you can do class instance what_time # instance is wrongly named... def __init__ self what_time.__init__ self # here you do the requested call or as m170897017 suggests omit the __init__ altogether class instance what_time # instance is wrongly named... pass
your problem seems to be from day_night import what_time class instance day_night what_time.__init__ self here from day_night import what_time you import the class what_time and from this you should derive

25888381
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
the rules with malloc and free are that you must only pass to free a pointer that was allocated by a call to malloc or one of its equivalents like realloc or calloc
you do not do that when you call free you pass a which was not allocated by a call to malloc

25890914
qlistwidget	qtreeview
no as such font style option applies to qwidgets so you could apply the font or other like font-size style option to the entire qwidget qlistwidget in this case and not to special behavior of a derived qwidget qlistwidget s selection item
i think that it applies also to qtreeview because i was not able to change its style as well. i can change border color background color but nothing regarding font. first i thought that i have to reimplement paintevent function because i am reimplementing qtreeview

25891198
keystore	jks
these are the steps i went thru note that godaddy does not create a codesigning certificate in jks format and there is an extra step involved to convert the keystore to jks create keystore keytool -genkey -alias codesigncert -keypass yourpassword -keyalg rsa - keysize 2048 -dname cn server1.lccc.edu ou college name o college name l schnecksville st pennsylvania c us - keystore home oracle codesignstore codesignstore -storepass yourpassword -validity 720 storepass and keypass can be the same generater crt for godaddy keytool -certreq -v -alias codesigncert - file home oracle codesignstore codesignstore.pem - keystore home oracle codesignstore codesignstore using an editor open codesignstore.pem and paste it into the godaddy site when godaddy verifies the account and you pay your money the pending status will go away go to your godaddy account click on myaccount at the top of the page in the black header click on manage ssl certificates select the codesigning certificate listed click on the launch button download the file as a pem file save it on your local pc open firefox in the advanced section select view certificates and the certificate should be listed on the managed views
highlight the certificate and select backup export and save it as a pkcs#12 file click on view certificates at the top of the screen next to certificate viewer is the alias in double quotes right this down it will be the alias to be used on the jarsigner command below copy the file to the server where the codesigning certificate is going to be used e.g server1 home oracle code_sign_cert_from_godaddy godaddy_pkcs12.p12 this is the new keystore since the keystore has to be of the type jks and godaddy does t create a jks file it has to be converted to jks format convert pcks12 to jks keytool -importkeystore - srckeystore home oracle code_sign_cert_from_godaddy godaddy_pkcs12. pkcs#12 -srcstoretype pkcs#12 - destkeystore home oracle code_sign_cert_from_godaddy godaddy_jks.jks -deststoretype jks jar file processing unsign jacob.jar.

25896725
emacs	gedit	geany	gedit
conventionally executables don t have any suffix g++ is a binary executable not doing much except starting other processes like cc1plus -the compiler proper- as -the assembler - ld -the linker - etc... in all cases i strongly recommend to enable all warnings and debug info during compilation use g++ -wall -g .... to improve your source code till you got no warnings to learn how to use the debugger gdb to be able to build your program on the command line to use a version control system like git to use a good editor like emacs gedit geany or gvim once you are writing programs in several source files learn how to use a builder like make to learn c++11 or even perhaps c++14 rather than older c++ standards to also learn other programming languages ocaml scheme haskell prolog scala .... since they would improve your thinking and your way of coding in c++ to study the source code of several free software coded in c++ to read the documentation of every function that you are using on cppreference or in man pages for linux to understand what is undefined behavior the fact that your program sometimes work does not make it correct
concretely on linux you could edit your hello world program file hello.cc with gedit or emacs with a command like gedit hello.cc etc... compile it using g++ -wall -g hello.cc -o hello command debug it using gdb . hello and repeat don t forget to use git commands for version control

25899095
realloc	malloc
3 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

25900011
equals	compareto
the third condition would compare the string s lexicographically if their lengths are equals
the compiler is complaining because you cannot call compareto on an int

25900183
serializable	deserialization
primitives strings and core collections arraylist hashset etc. are all serializable
if you include something that isn t serializable you have to declare it transient and deal with its absence upon deserialization or you have to create a custom serialization format

25903164
sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
which however looks like overkill unless you are also interested in sctp s other improvements over tcp
in contrast to udp tcp is not a protocol that allows sending of individual messages which get delivered to the receiver in the same form

25904156
division	subtract
the outer addition by 1 and then division by 2 turns this into 0 for negatives and 1 for positives and zero
in order to get a function we just need some sort of not operation - which in the case of 1 for true and 0 for false is just subtract the value from 1

25906978
firefox	safari
i couldn t find out why exactly this fixes the problem in firefox but it did the trick
what i still find extremely strange is that it matters the order in which the css is loaded in firefox but not in chrome and safari

25907603
client-side	server-side
as such it is occurring on the server-side not the client-side
you should check the server-side logs to see what s going on there

25914426
phpunit	behat
if you want to compare data from two pages you can simply create a step like this besides the obvious you can use phpunit in with behat mink to make the assertions in your step definitions
most in not all phpunit assertions are static methods using them is as simple as this phpunit_framework_testcase assertsame

25914426
phpunit	behat
you can use selenium probably other frameworks too with phpunit if this is more about unit testing than functional testing the official documentation tells how
if you simply hate gherkin then there s not much you can do with behat it s at the core of it

25914837

also have a look at this comment you can define what tags to include with each profiling which might be quite useful if you want only certain tests running in certain browsers

25915111
google-chrome	firefox
i suspect the latter because google-chrome doesn t throw an error under the same circumstances
for example firefox throws the error the second time

25915111
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t throw an error
if you call node.gain.cancelscheduledvalues 5 in between the calls to setvaluecurveattime firefox allows it

25915448
required	placeholder
the forstate argument identifier is required but the title identifer is not
here s what the template looks like on-screen notice that the first placeholder contains title string

25916539
build.gradle	gradlew
as i see the problem is the following there is a gradlew multi-project with gradlew specified files like build.gradle common.gradle ...
the task is to import this multi-project to eclipse but not as a gradlew project using gradlew ide it should appeare in eclipse kepler as a java project without any errors

25919889
unicorn	webrick
i started out with pow but ran into a lot little issues like you ve mentioned and have been happy since switching to run unicorn as my rails development server
my personal opinion is to ditch pow and go with unicorn or thin or puma but for the love of all that s good do not use the built-in default of webrick

25919889
puma	unicorn	unicorn	webrick
my personal opinion is to ditch pow and go with unicorn or thin or puma but for the love of all that s good do not use the built-in default of webrick
i use unicorn locally it s also what we use on our production boxes and my local sites are as fast or faster than production

25923524
calloc	malloc
when memory is allocated it isn t zeroed first at least when using malloc calloc - however does zero memory first
to clear a buffer in c rather than c++ you have a few options allocate the buffer using calloc instead of malloc

25927680
swift	objective-c
rather swift can import c and objective-c apis
for example the address book api was not available at the time in objective-c

25927680
swift	objective-c
plus any custom c or objective-c apis can be used in swift if you put it in the bridging header
that doesn t mean those apis have been ported to swift

25932539
postgresql	mysql
if you want a cumulative sum in mysql the most efficient way is to use variables if you are planning on working with databases such as oracle sql server and postgresql then you should use a database more similar in functionality and that supports that ansi standard window functions
the right way to do this is with window functions but mysql doesn t support those

25937543
mp3	wav
well let s convert the wav file to mp3
simply saving the wav file and then converting it will not do

25938635
spaces	delimiter
for-loop looking on your code for the for-loop there is something wrong as you specify the spaces character as delimiter which is not good for file paths names with a spaces inside
also the spaces character is by default a delimiter for command for and therefore it is not necessary to explicit define it as delimiter if that is really wanted

25938635
spaces	delimiter
also the spaces character is by default a delimiter for command for and therefore it is not necessary to explicit define it as delimiter if that is really wanted
therefore i suggest to use with the delimiter list is changed to newline only

25938890
gruntjs	package.json
i think you are confusing gruntjs with npm because the gruntjs cannot handle dependencies it s simply a task runner
the package.json file is here because you need the devdependencies for the gruntjs installation and all its plugins like grunt-contrib-concat

25938890
gruntjs	package.json
the package.json file is here because you need the devdependencies for the gruntjs installation and all its plugins like grunt-contrib-concat
this file is associated with npm and not specifically gruntjs

25939074
bash	subshell
the above command line works by using find to invoke with --exec an explicit subshell bash -c passing it a large number of filenames as arguments
the _ is because the first argument to bash -c script is taken as not . the script provided to bash -c just loops through its arguments using the convenience function doit which you can easily redefine in case you want to use this idea with a different command. it s possible that you didn t really need find because you don t actually care about recursive matching in which case you could simplify that a bit

25939811
retrofit	okhttp
okhttp handles the lower-level http connection details while retrofit simplifies using rest apis
retrofit can be used on top of okhttp but it is not required

25939895
qqmlapplicationengine	qquickview
in order to load an applicationwindow you will need to use a qqmlapplicationengine
the error message is quite clear applicationwindow is a not a qquickitem and so you can t use qquickview to load it

25941441
dns	spf
this service will do a bunch of checks and you ll get a report back with ton of information such whether or not your mail server s dns is setup correctly whether your mail server s ip is on any black lists if you have a problem with your spf records etc
if you ve not done so already you might want to setup an spf record for the domain that you are sending from to indicate that the sending mail server s ip is authorized to send mail for your domain

fisrt there is no mysql-python under ubuntu debian repositories the package is python-mysqldb and is an interface to the mysql server for python is the driver for python and is needed to your django project to work with mysql. under pypi repository is named mysql-python second there is no reason to install a mysql server in a python virtualenv the python virtualenv is for python libraries modules frameworks mysql server is not that
so you can install the mysql server in your ubuntu system by the official repository apt-get install mysql-server and then you can install all that python libraries that you need in your special python virtualenv for your django project

implements	extends
your foo class cannot be instantiated unless callme is implements hence it must be declared abstract
these concepts are perhaps better explained with a real world example than your standard abstract class vehicle class car extends vehicle tutorials

25947855
mongodb	bson
and the kind of operations you are using in jsonpatch are natively supported in mongodb bson documents and their query language .e.g push set inc pull etc
perhaps you want to not interrupt users activities with a syncronous write to mongodb for that the solution is using async queus as mentioned in point#2

25950680
multiplying	multiplication
you multiplying numbers not string representations of numbers octal notation is just one way of representing a number
just parse the input into int variables perform the multiplication and then print it out again

25951715
mongodb	bson
mongodb on the other hand is not a relational database but rather a document database
basically this means that it stores aggregates collections of coherent but possible unstructured objects in a single document - an object which is stored in bson format which is similar to json

25954405
spaces	linefeed
in addition spaces are not required
finally since you are reading the data into double not float you should use linefeed as the format specifier

25956288
dictionary	map
when map iterates over the items in output it s doing this for key in output # when you iterate over a dictionary you just get the keys. func2 key so each time func2 is called all that s contained in output is a single key a frozenset from the dictionary
based on your comments above it seems you want to pass the entire dictionary to func2 but if you do that you re really not doing anything at all in parallel

25966105
octal	binary
you have 3 permission types user permissions applying to the file s owner group permissions applying to the file s group other permissions applying to everyone else for each of these types you can allow 3 things ability to read note that you need read permissions on a directory to list it ability to write ability to execute if you say chmod 755 some_file it gets broken down like this user group other 7 5 5 octal value base-8 111 101 101 binary value base-2 or binary rwx rwx rwx where r - read w - write x - execute so that command would mean that the owner gets all permissions but group members and others can only read and execute
there s another input format with chmod that s handy and doesn t require you to do conversion to binary in your head

25967080
cdr	cons
result is ignored constants-aux cdr form lst you should write constant-aux cdr form delete-duplicates lst t constants-aux car form lst
result is ignored constants-aux cdr form lst may be depends on what you want to get you should write cons constants-aux car form lst constants-aux cdr form lst 4 i m not shure but it looks like you using print for debug just use trace instead

25967448
ciimage	uiimage
no need to use valueforkey try below code update i think in your case ciimage property of uiimage instance is nil that s why its crashing
note that uiimage is not in fact a ciimage

25967448
ciimage	uiimage
note that uiimage is not in fact a ciimage
in other words uiimage s ciimage is not nil only if the uiimage is backed by a ciimage already because it was generated by imagewithciimage

25967448
ciimage	uiimage
in other words uiimage s ciimage is not nil only if the uiimage is backed by a ciimage already because it was generated by imagewithciimage
you can t use this to magically turn the uiimage into a ciimage as you seem to be hoping to do

25969847
fgets	fread
you use fgets and char which should be used for text files
i m not sure what fgets does when it encounters a null byte for example. it is therefore better to use bytes an unsigned char and read them block-wise with fread

25973334
rpm	yum
you can check which files belong to that package rpm -ql libsoundtouch
you did not install soundtouch package yum is telling you that this package is obsoleted by libsoundtouch

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
please note if you are using google-chrome and now also firefox on ios at least in ios versions 6.1 and newer and you wonder why none of the hacks seem to be separating google-chrome from safari it is because the ios version of google-chrome is using the safari engine
it uses safari hacks not the google-chrome ones

25975282
google-chrome	safari
as mentioned above since google-chrome on ios is rooted in safari it of course hits that one as well
one for safari 9.0+ but not ios devices and one for safari 9.0-10.0 but not ios devices below are hacks that separate 6.1-7.0 and 7.1+ these also required a combination of multiple hacks in order to get the right result since i have pointed out the way to block ios devices here is the modified version of safari 6.1+ hack that targets non-ios devices to use them usually like in this question the reason people ask about safari hacks is mostly in reference to separating it from google google-chrome again not ios

25975282
google-chrome	safari
one for safari 9.0+ but not ios devices and one for safari 9.0-10.0 but not ios devices below are hacks that separate 6.1-7.0 and 7.1+ these also required a combination of multiple hacks in order to get the right result since i have pointed out the way to block ios devices here is the modified version of safari 6.1+ hack that targets non-ios devices to use them usually like in this question the reason people ask about safari hacks is mostly in reference to separating it from google-chrome again not ios
it may be important to post the alternative how to target google-chrome separately from safari as well so i am providing that for you here in case it is needed

25975282
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
a modified version of the one we were using for google-chrome 28+ below
safari 9 the coming firefox browsers and the microsoft edge browser are not picked up with this one previously google-chrome 28 and newer were easy to target

25975282
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
safari 9 the coming firefox browsers and the microsoft edge browser are not picked up with this one previously google-chrome 28 and newer were easy to target
this is one i sent to browserhacks after seeing it included within a block of other css code not originally intended as a css hack and realized what it does so i extracted the relevant portion for our purposes note this older method below now pics up safari 9 and the microsoft edge browser without the above update

wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 29.0.1547.57 safari 537.36 not working ua mozilla 5.0 macintosh
intel mac os x 10_9_5 applewebkit 600.1.17 khtml like gecko version 7.1 safari 537.85.10 the problem lies in the major version-change to applewebkit 600. asp.net ajax does not correctly recognize the new safari 8 browser also with ios 8 . it thinks that there is no support for partial-rendering. i found it in those lines from pagerequestmanager.cs minimumecmascriptversion minimumw3cdomversion are both 1. request.browser gave me the following result even though ecmascriptversion has a strange value the problem is mainly caused by supportscallback beeing false

elasticsearch	kibana
see import index a json file into elasticsearch however in order to work well with kibana your json files need to be at a minimum
flat - kibana does not grok nested json structs

25983511
hive	hdfs
plus hive is not a true sql compliant replacement for a rdbms so it has to emulate some of the work by creating map reduce jobs
these jobs are considerably more disk intensive and use the hdfs file system for mapping the data into virtual tables verbage may vary

25988897
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it is browser issue
the google-chrome browser buffering the video before we set the current time .. but firefox and ie are not buffering when page loads

25990117
spaces	delimiter
for example you must not put any blank spaces between the n and the
usually you need to put a n before the first delimiter to tell the communication protocol that the following characters are in unicode and therefore must not be translated interpreted converted etc

25990135
prepare	execute
if you are using this function to build sql statements you are strongly recommended to use pdo prepare to prepare sql statements with bound parameters instead of using pdo quote to interpolate user input into an sql statement
prepared statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query

25993021
lxml	beautifulsoup
the difference is lxml
beautifulsoup uses lxml as the default parser when installed with a fallback to the standard library htmlparser module when it is not

25996836
client-side	server-side
the ruby driver provides a uuid1 generator you can use to create uuids client-side
you will not be able to get the uuid generated in cql server-side

25997293
swift	objective-c
as you know because of the nature of struct based implementation of array in swift following code does not affect cat.items
instead you have to call like this cat.items.append item on the other hand in objective-c is exactly same as following that is very similar to non-working swift code

25997293
swift	objective-c
instead you have to call like this cat.items.append item on the other hand in objective-c is exactly same as following that is very similar to non-working swift code
sad to say objective-c does not have equivalent property method calling semantics as cat.items.append item in swift

25998479
serializable	deserialization
serialversionuid is used to check whether the version of class used for serializing and de-serializing is same or not across different jvm s.the default value generated by serializable runtime is sensitive to class details.so although the classes loaded across different jvm may be compatible but still you can get a false invalidclassexception
check the javadoc - the serialization runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization

25998479
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

25998658
sudo	passwd
you ll also need to run sudo devtoolssecurity --enable per apple s man page on this tool on normal user systems the first time in a given login session that any such apple-code-signed debugger or performance analysis tools are used to examine one of the user s processes the user is queried for an administator passwd for authorization
devtoolssecurity tool to change the authorization policies such that a user who is a member of either the admin group or the _developer group does not need to enter an additional passwd to use the apple-code-signed debugger or performance analysis tools

25998780
factors	mean
the mean of a vector of factors gives you the warning you see and returns na
the reason is that when you do not convert the factors to character they are treated as numeric in the subsetting

25999518
swift	objective-c
the idiom is for objective-c not swift
in swift init blocks aren t normal functions and don t return anything
